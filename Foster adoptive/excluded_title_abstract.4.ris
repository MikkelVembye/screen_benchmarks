AB  - Objective: This study tested whether insecure attachment mediates the link between childhood trauma and adult somatization. Methods: A community sample of 101 couples completed self-report measures, including the Relationship Scales Questionnaire, the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, the Somatic Symptom Inventory, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Conflict Tactics Scale. Results: Childhood trauma was associated with higher levels of somatization and insecure attachment. Insecure attachment style was also associated with higher levels of somatization. Controlling for age, income, and recent intimate partner violence, analyses showed that fearful attachment fully mediated the link between childhood trauma and somatization for women. For men, there was no such mediation, but both childhood trauma and insecure attachment styles made independent contributions to predicting levels of somatization. Conclusions: Findings are consistent with the hypothesis that, for women, childhood trauma influences adult levels of somatization by fostering insecure adult attachment. For men, findings suggest that trauma and attachment are both important independent predictors of adult somatization. Study results support the idea that childhood trauma shapes patients' styles of relating to others in times of need, and these styles, in turn, influence the somatization process and how patients respond to providers. Screening for attachment style may provide information that could allow health care providers to tailor treatment more effectively.

AB  - Families vary greatly in size, structure, composition, race, culture, religion, and access to societal power and economic resources, but all play critical roles in providing support and nurturance for family members and preparing them for engagement in the world beyond the family. The central role families play in fostering the adjustment and development of their members has been consistently acknowledged in counseling theory since the early work of Freud and Adler. However, despite Adlet's advocacy for parent education in child guidance clinics as early as the 1920s (Dreikurs, Corsini, Lowe, & Sonstegard, 1959), psychological interventions with families were not commonly practiced until the 1950s. As is suggested by the examples that began this chapter, engaging in prevention and health promotion efforts with families is particularly compelling. Families are critically important social systems that have profound effects on their members and the other social systems (e.g., schools, neighborhoods, workplaces) with which they interact (Boyd-Franklin, 2003; Home, 2000). A family's capacity to provide growth-fostering nurturance and guidance is influenced by internal family processes, which are affected by factors external to the family, such as the experience of societal oppression, stress, discrimination, and access to social, political, and economic resources. Strong and supportive family relationships also promote resilience, enabling family members to cope more effectively with external stressors related to work, school, poverty, and racism (Kumpfer, 1999). Stronger families not only generate stronger individuals but also contribute to stronger schools and communities. As illustrated in the story of Marta, strong families can organize themselves and advocate for improved access to societal resources. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Since the United States Supreme Court ruled in 1967 that state laws against interracial marriage were unconstitutional, the number of interracial marriages has grown to approximately 2.6 million. As a result, the population of people with two racial backgrounds, or biracial individuals, has also been growing rapidly. Research findings suggest that the process through which biracial individuals develop their racial identities, rather than the fact that they have dual heritages, has a significant impact on their overall psychological health and emotional adjustment. The proposed program was created with the intention of addressing the unique needs of biracial African American and Caucasian children as a means to prevent the development of feelings of isolation, marginalization, and psychological distress. The goal of this program is to provide biracial youth with an open and validating environment in which to explore and communicate about their race-related experiences with biracial peers and to develop internally driven and stable racial identities. Another objective of the program is to foster the development of adaptive coping strategies so that the participants can better manage invalidation of their self-defined racial identities by family, peers, and society.

AB  - This study sought to determine the effects of a high blood pressure education program for sixth graders on the preventive hypertension health attitudes and behaviors of their parents. Attention was focused on the role of students ("significant others") in affecting parental attitude and behavior changes relating to the three risk factors of smoking, dietary salt, and high blood pressure. Parents of children exposed to a high blood pressure education program served as the experimental treatment group, and parents of sixth graders not participating in the program served as the control group. A relationship was found between the health locus of control attitudes of parents and their perception of the role of "significant others" in fostering preventive health behaviors. A review of the comparisons between the treatment groups indicated that the preventive health actions of parents in the experimental group were different for the three risk factors. Parents in the control group reported significantly less preventive health actions than the treatment group. Demographic factors of age, race, and education of the parents were not found to be significant. (JD)

AB  - Historical attitudes toward battered women have portrayed them as meek victims, manipulative masochists, or mentally ill. Thus, counselors must scrutinize all mental health problems to differentiate which come from within the person and which come from living in a sexist society. Perception of loss of control is a critical factor causing psychological injury to battered women. Others include feeling betrayed, recognizing the violation of love and trust, and myths about sex role standards expected for women. To minimize these injuries, battered women may adopt behaviors which protect them but frustrate others. The most common coping skills are manipulation, indirect expression of anger, splitting of mind and body, denial, and a willingness to please. The inability of a battered woman to predict whether her behavior will successfully protect her from further abuse creates a perception of no voluntary control over her life, or learned helplessness. Battered women tend to rely on a small repertory of responsive behaviors and become socially isolated. Consequently, the family therapy approach is dangerous with couples in a battering relationship because therapists tend to get enmeshed in their dysfunctional, but powerful system. The article details emotional and behavioral signs of the battered women's syndrome and suggests ways to deal with the question of why the woman stays with the batterer. The author emphasizes that the therapist should focus on the battered woman's personal growth rather than the relationship and discusses the potential for violence in child custody and visitation decisions. Brief mention is made of situations in which confidentiality may have to be broken and a mechanism to combat counselor burnout.

AB  - Available from UMI in association with The British Library. This research project is designed to determine a plan of assessment and intervention, which can be used by nurses in the community to help elderly patients cope with painful conditions. A theoretical model is developed, in which coping is defined in terms of the degree of control experienced over pain and other stressors. This model identifies emotional state as the indicator of coping at any particular time. A study is described, in which subjects were 190 retired patients, who were being visited by a district nurse, and who identified that they had persistent or recurrent pain. Data on pain and coping was collected using semi-structured interview. Mood state was measured as the dependent variable. Independent variables for quantitative analysis included pain intensity ratings, pain duration, disability, health, personal and financial problems, age and locus of control. Qualitative data were collected to validate the quantitative findings. Questionnaire data were collected from nurses for purposes of verification and comparison. Nonparametric correlations, and multiple regression analysis, identified that the variables which directly determined coping were feeling the pain to be under control, being occupied, feeling informed about the painful condition, having regrets and non pain-related personal problems (notably bereavement loss). Those who used active occupational and pain-relieving strategies coped better than those who adopted passive coping strategies. Patients generally valued supportive aspects of nursing care, particularly the provision of encouragement and confidence. Nurses systematically underestimated patients' worst pain and overestimated anxiety. There was a significant association between patients' pain complaints and perceived pain exaggeration. Few nurses used a pain assessment protocol, or had received formal education in the management of chronic pain. These results are used to produce guidelines for the nursing management of elderly patients with pain in the community, with particular reference to assessment and intervention, based upon the nursing process.

AB  - Tactics to deal with growing violence in schools have usually relied on removal of the offender by suspension or placement outside of the mainstream classroom. However, educators and psychologists are considering the prevention of violent behavior as both a more humane and cost-effective response to the problem. The relationship between school climate and school violence, the principal's role in the reduction of violence, strategies for teaching nonviolence to students, and preventative approaches for helping students with serious problems are described. Research has shown that violent student behavior can be alleviated through the development of a caring, inclusive school culture; programs that teach prosocial behavior and foster self-esteem; and collaboration with community social-service agencies. A highly visible principal can create school norms of nonviolence and community by cultivating relationships with students, encouraging a sense of ownership, and comprehensively addressing the roots of violent behavior, such as poverty, racism, and inadequate or abusive parenting.

AB  - This coursebook is intended for use by the instructors presenting a workshop on preventing injuries in the elderly that was developed as a field test of a larger 10-module training program for staff of long-term health care facilities, senior center and adult day care staff, and home health aides. The curriculum guide served as a blueprint for the training modules. Staff from a life-care community, assisted living facilities, nursing facilities, and adult foster care providers located in Nebraska, Michigan, and Maryland tested the prototype module, "Preventing Burns and Scalds." The complete program consists of 10 modules, each of which has four components: (1) an instructor manual; (2) a participant's coursebook; (3) a videotape; and (4) a course examination. The long-range goal of the program is to provide uniform, validated, injury prevention training, and to reduce both the incidence and severity of injuries to elderly people. Included in the coursebook are materials designed to help workshop participants achieve the following objectives: understand the program objectives and their relationship to the training objectives for each module; identify the overall extent and significance of injuries to elderly individuals; identify the mechanics of injuries and their effects on elderly individuals; explain how elderly individuals' characteristics increase their risk of specific types of injuries; identify the hazards and prevention interventions related to injuries; and acquire general awareness of injuries and ways in which caregivers can reduce those injuries among elderly individuals. Among the materials included are the following: workshop objectives; program preface; program objectives; injury prevention model; information on the prevalence/extent of injuries affecting elderly adults, the mechanics of injuries, the characteristics of elderly adults, dementia, and hazards and prevention ideas; and guidelines for teaching the injury prevention modules.

AB  - In 1997, the Community Alternative Placement Scheme (CAPS) was organized by NCH Action for Children (Scotland) to provide family placements for youth who would otherwise enter or remain in secure care. This evaluation study assessed the extent to which CAPS met its goals during the first 3 years of operation and examined the program's impact on the youth placed. Core elements of CAPS included foster care provider payment equivalent to a reasonable salary, intensive support to carers, specialist training, time-limited placement, automatic entitlement to respite care, individualized programs, and educational support. The study followed 20 CAPS youth and a comparison sample of youth in secure care for 2 years after placement started. Data were gathered from case records and interviews with youth, foster carers, CAPS staff, local authority social workers, and managers. Findings revealed that in less than 3 years, CAPS became well established as a key fostering service, attracting people who would not otherwise have considered becoming foster carers. The placement length was revised from the initial 6 months to 6 to 12 months. Over time, the relationship between the carers and the project staff became clarified. CAPS demonstrated the feasibility of this foster care scheme in Scotland. Most of the placements did not end in accordance with planned duration or goals but others provided stable, positive experiences on an enduring basis. In nearly all CAPS placements youth, carers, and social workers thought youth had benefited, but progress measures and outcomes produced mixed results. Improving access to additional educational support and psychological services emerged as a key requirement in extending foster care's potential to provide family-based care for youth with significant difficulties.

AB  - Background: Biomedical research constantly produces new findings but these are not routinely translated into health care practice. One way to address this problem is to develop effective interventions to translate research findings into practice. Currently a range of empirical interventions are available and systematic reviews of these have demonstrated that there is no single best intervention. This evidence base is difficult to use in routine settings because it cannot identify which intervention is most likely to be effective ( or cost effective) in a particular situation. We need to establish a scientific rationale for interventions. As clinical practice is a form of human behaviour, theories of human behaviour that have proved useful in other similar settings may provide a basis for developing a scientific rationale for the choice of interventions to translate research findings into clinical practice. The objectives of the study are: to amplify and populate scientifically validated theories of behaviour with evidence from the experience of health professionals; to use this as a basis for developing predictive questionnaires using replicable methods; to identify which elements of the questionnaire (i.e., which theoretical constructs) predict clinical practice and distinguish between evidence compliant and non-compliant practice; and on the basis of these results, to identify variables ( based on theoretical constructs) that might be prime targets for behaviour change interventions. Methods: We will develop postal questionnaires measuring two motivational, three action and one stage theory to explore five behaviours with 800 general medical and 600 general dental practitioners. We will collect data on performance for each of the behaviours. The relationships between predictor variables ( theoretical constructs) and outcome measures ( data on performance) in each survey will be assessed using multiple regression analysis and structural equation modelling. In the final phase of the project, the findings from all surveys will be analysed simultaneously adopting a random effects approach to investigate whether the relationships between predictor variables and outcome measures are modified by behaviour, professional group or geographical location.

AB  - Aim: To gain an understanding of patients' lived experience following photodynamic therapy (PDT) for the treatment of advanced cancer. Background: Existing literature on PDT tends to be predominantly grounded in basic science and mainly associated with the effect of PDT on the cancer rather than the individual's experience. An appreciation of the impact on patients' day-to-day life may enhance the support and advice offered to patients undergoing this treatment. Method: A Heideggerian hermeneutic phenomenological approach was used as the philosophical framework. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of six participants. Thematic content analysis was adopted to analyse the data, which yielded six themes. Findings: Analysis of the data yielded six themes: the impact on day-to-day life; existential meaning; the physical effects of treatment; kaleidoscope of emotions; information gap; and family burden. Conclusion: PDT offers palliation of symptoms for some participants while offering hope of enhanced quality of life. Patients and their families have to be willing and well-informed of the need to comply with the guidance provided by healthcare professionals and information leaflets to avoid any photosensitive reaction. There is a need for education for healthcare professionals as PDT is not well recognized or understood as a treatment for advanced cancer.

AB  - This dissertation explores the nature of informal support systems in rural communities in Ghana, and the role of social networks in facilitating those practices. Individuals in developing countries often lack access to formal sources of insurance, such as banks and social security. A significant body of research has shown that such individuals instead make extensive use of informal risk-sharing mechanisms. To cope with exogenous shocks, individuals rely on gifts or loans from family members, friends and local organizations. They also adopt self-insurance strategies, saving assets and diversifying their income sources. Similarly, local communities typically lack access to formal sources of public finance based on tax assessments. This leaves them dependent on external donors and the central state or on informal contributions to provide public goods and services. It is not clear that these practices are either equitable or efficient. Informal institutions are social constructs, and may therefore discriminate (intentionally or unintentionally) among individuals. Inequalities among individuals' social networks, status, economic opportunities and family structures may result in unequal access to informal support. The nature of this support therefore needs to be assessed in relation to the social network. This dissertation is directed at better understanding the linkage between the social network and informal support systems in rural communities in Ghana. It considers three aspects of informal support: private contributions to public goods, risk-sharing arrangements, and individual savings behavior. The dissertation makes use of a panel household survey and field experiments conducted during 2009 in four communities in southern Ghana. The survey included a detailed social networks module, which obtained a census of the in-sample social networks in the four communities. The results of the experiments, tracked using the household survey, are evaluated in conjunction with the social networks data to shed light on the nature of giving and transfer behavior in the study communities. The first paper analyzes the willingness of individuals to contribute to the financing of community-level public goods. A unique field experiment was designed to elicit private contributions from respondents to finance a small infrastructure project for their community. The experiment used randomization and a discontinuity design to test two commonly-used mechanisms to encourage charitable contributions: the matching grant and the provision point mechanism. Data on individual contributions are related to data on individual characteristics and the social network. The results yield new insights into the role of the social network and status as determinants of contributions, and inform the design of community-driven development programs. In the second paper, a field experiment was used to generate positive asset shocks within the survey sample. Respondents were selected by lottery to receive cash and livestock prizes. The household survey was used to track the direct impact of these prizes on the recipients' consumption and asset holdings, and their indirect impact on the welfare of others in the recipients' social networks. The experiment thereby yields inferences about the effectiveness of the social network as a redistributive mechanism. By varying the type and publicity of the prizes, the fungibility of cash and in-kind assets and the effect of social pressure on sharing behavior are tested. The final paper of the dissertation considers the implications for welfare of conflicting risk-coping strategies. A theoretical model is developed to explain how individual savings behavior could be adversely affected by a commitment to support other individuals through informal risk-sharing arrangements. This commitment is modeled simultaneously with a buffer-stock savings strategy, which captures the behavior of individuals who lack access to formal credit. The model provides an explanation for why savings rates among the poor are much lower than theory predicts, and why unproductive investments are relied upon more than seems rational. Transfer obligations impose a significant social rate of taxation on individuals, eroding the rates of return on liquid investments. Individuals may thus have an incentive to favor unproductive forms of investment, in order to keep assets 'out of the hands' of others. By combining detailed social network data with two unique field experiments, this dissertation characterizes the role of social structures as a conduit to risk sharing and support in rural Ghana. Insights are gained into individual behavior in response to shocks, the role of transfers as a support mechanism, and the role of status in determining contributions to public goods. Moreover, the dissertation yields insights relevant to policy, about the design of community-driven development projects and the impact of formal cash transfer programs on the welfare of individuals and their communities.

AB  - Summary: Neonatal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure increases anxiety-like behaviour and alters neuroendocrine responses to stress in adult rats. The current study assessed whether this anxiety-related phenotype observed in rats neonatally exposed to LPS is transferable to subsequent generations. Wistar rats were exposed to LPS (0.05mg/kg, Salmonella enteritidis) or non-pyrogenic saline (equivolume) on postnatal days 3 and 5. In adulthood, animals were subjected to restraint and isolation stress or no stress, and subsequently evaluated for anxiety-like behaviours on the elevated plus maze, acoustic startle response, and holeboard apparatus. Blood was collected to examine corticosterone responses to stress and behavioural testing in adulthood. Animals from both treatment groups which exhibited the anxiety-like phenotype were bred with untreated partners. Maternal care of the second generation (F2) was monitored over the first week of life. In adulthood, the F2 generation underwent identical testing procedures as the parental (F1) generation. The F2 offspring of females exposed to LPS as neonates exhibited an anxiety-like phenotype in adulthood and a potentiated corticosterone response to stress (p <.05). F2 offspring of males exposed to LPS as neonates also exhibited an anxiety-like phenotype (p <.05), however, no differences in corticosterone responses were observed. To determine the impact of maternal care on the anxiety-like phenotype, a cross-fostering study was conducted in which offspring of LPS-treated females were fostered to saline-treated mothers and vice versa, which was found to reverse the behavioural and endocrine phenotypes of the F2 generation. These data indicate that a neonatally bacterially induced anxiety phenotype is transferable across generations in both sexes. Maternal care is the mediating mechanism along the maternal line. We suggest that transmission may be dependent upon heritable epigenetic phenomena for the paternal line. The implications of this study apply to potential neuroimmune pathways through which psychopathology may be transmitted along filial lines.

AB  - The barriers that people with disabilities face around the world are not only inherent to the limitations resulting from the disability itself, but, more importantly, these barriers rest with the societal technologies of exclusion. Using a mixed methodology approach, I conduct a quest to revealing several societal factors that limit full participation of people with disabilities in their communities, which will contribute to understanding and developing a more comprehensive framework for full inclusion of people with disabilities into the society. First, I conduct a multiple regression analysis to seek whether there is a statistical relationship between the national level of development, the level of democratization, and the level of education within a country’s population on one hand, and expressed concern for and preparedness to improve the quality of life for people of disabilities on another hand. The results from the quantitative methodology reveal that people without disabilities are more prepared to take care of people with disabilities when the level of development of the country is higher, when the people have more freedom of expression and hold the government accountable for its actions, and when the level of corruption is under control. However, a greater concern for the well-being of people with disabilities is correlated with a high level of country development, a decreased value of political stability and absence of violence, a decreased level of government effectiveness, and a greater level of law enforcement. None of the dependent variables are significantly correlated with the level of education from a given country. Then, I delve into an interpretive analysis to understand multiple factors that contribute to the construction of attitudes and practices towards people with disabilities. In doing this, I build upon the four main principles outlined by the United Nations as strongly recommended to be embedded in all international programmes: (1) identification of claims of human rights and the corresponding obligations of governments, hence, I assess and analyze disability rights in education, looking at United Nation, United States, and European Union Perspectives Educational Rights Provisions for People with Disabilities (Ch. 3); (2) estimated capacity of individuals to claim their rights and of governments to fulfill their obligations, hence, I look at the people with disabilities as rights-holders and duty-bearers and discuss the importance of investing in special capital in the context of global development (Ch. 4); (3) programmes monitor and evaluate the outcomes and the processes under the auspices of human rights standards, hence, I look at the importance of evaluating the UN World Programme of Action Concerning People with Disabilities from multiple perspectives, as an example of why and how to monitor and evaluate educational human rights outcomes and processes (Ch. 5); and (4) programming should reflect the recommendations of international human rights bodies and mechanisms, hence, I focus on programming that fosters development of the capacity of people with disabilities, that is, planning for an ecology of disabilities and ecoducation for people with disabilities (Ch. 6). Results from both methodologies converge to a certain point, and they further complement each other. One common result for the two methodologies employed is that disability is an evolving concept when viewed in a broader context, which integrates the four spaces that the ecological framework incorporates. Another common result is that factors such as economic, social, legal, political, and natural resources and contexts contribute to the health, education and employment opportunities, and to the overall well-being of people with disabilities. The ecological framework sees all these factors from a meta-systemic perspective, where bi-directional interactions are expected and desi… (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The prosody (i.e., acoustic variations in pitch, intonation, stress patterns, and rate of speech) of infant-directed speech is a salient communicative feature (e.g., Fernald, 1989) that aids in the cognitive and language development of infants (e.g., Kaplan, Bachorowski, Smoski, & Hudenko, 2002; Tamis-LeMonda & Bornstein, 2002). The way parents interact with their children also contributes significantly to infant learning and cognitive development (e.g., Riksen-Walraven, 1978; Tamis-LeMonda & Bornstein, 2002). Nevertheless, the detailed mechanisms that outline how prosody and parental behaviors (e.g., pointing to an object, touching the infant, smiling) guide infant learning remain less well understood. One approach to better understanding these mechanisms is to examine the caregiver’s role during infant-caregiver interactions to determine which prosodic aspects of parental speech, and which accompanying behaviors, most influence infant vocabulary and cognitive development. Longitudinal and intervention studies indicate that level of caregiver responsiveness significantly impacts vocabulary development and rate of learning (Hart & Risley, 1995; Riksen-Walraven, 1978). However, real-time, moment-by-moment proximal interactions should also be examined in order to assess these specific mechanisms at the micro level. Furthermore, given that many of our parental behaviors are shaped during childhood (e.g., Serbin & Karp, 2003), before we can fully understand the mechanisms by which prosody and parental behaviors affect infant development, we must first understand how these mechanisms are acquired. An intergenerational approach to infant learning and cognitive development requires a study of infant-sibling interactions, which can be used as a first step to ascertaining how prosody and parental behaviors can lead to long-term positive developmental outcomes for infants. Therefore, the present dissertation extends the research by: (1) exploring the unique idea that older siblings may already be adopting their caregivers’ speech and behavioral characteristics when interacting with infant siblings, (2) examining whether differences in maternal prosody result in differential levels of learning for infants; specifically on infant development of spatial vocabulary, (3) discovering which features of caregiver speech and interaction style are most effective in aiding infant learning and language development, and (4) utilizing the knowledge acquired regarding effective speech and interaction styles to develop an early childhood intervention program. The results of this systematic investigation of parental behavior and prosody add to our knowledge of the relation between parental responsiveness and the subsequent cognitive development of infants. It may also be influential in guiding the way we design early childhood interventions for caregivers and at-risk children. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Twelve married couples fostering special needs children completed a 6-month, weekly, individualized marital strengthening intervention based on Gottman's Sound Marital House model. 66% (8 couples) were located three to seven years later and interviewed about what they have found useful in that experience. The interview was semi-structured and non-directive and informed a grounded theory approach. The findings indicate that, for this sample, some curricular concepts were experienced as important. However, the findings also suggested that family science researchers and program evaluators should consider not just curricular particulars but the entire process of enrolling and participating in such a program, namely, generic therapeutic aspects of participation.

AB  - This book is intended for psychotherapists working with traumatized clients in a range of settings. We focus on recent developments that have fostered greater sensitivity to spirituality in the ways psychotherapists understand and treat trauma. For many years, clinicians neglected the links between religion, spirituality, and trauma or, worse, viewed religion and spirituality stereotypically as forces that interfered with health and well-being. This book helps to provide an important corrective to that bias. This volume has several themes. First, the chapters integrate research and practice. Throughout, we highlight emerging empirical literature that underscores how trauma can affect people not only psychologically, socially, and physically but spiritually as well. In doing so, chapter authors provide case examples and clinical illustrations that bring the empirical findings into sharper, more human focus. Second, the book is balanced, pointing to both the potentially helpful and harmful ways in which religion and spirituality can affect adjustment to trauma. Finally, we attempt to avoid the kind of spiritual reductionism that has plagued work in the field (i.e., spirituality is merely a source of anxiety reduction, social connectedness, control, meaning). A number of the chapters focus on the impact of trauma on spirituality as an important issue in itself and as a target for change. In doing so, we acknowledge that there are both healthy and unhealthy aspects to spirituality. Our hope is to help clinicians differentiate between healthy and unhealthy forms of spirituality across different populations of traumatized clients. Toward that end, the chapters cut across a broad cross section of presenting problems, with specific focus on relational forms of trauma, such as sexual abuse, partner violence, and other familial forms of trauma. Although the chapter authors have unique theoretical backgrounds, there is some emphasis on psychodynamic treatment for adults as well as cognitive behavior therapy for children throughout the book. In compiling the chapters, we sought case studies reflecting a range of racial and ethnic backgrounds, as well as varying spiritual and religious traditions. Though we were largely successful in this regard, there is some emphasis on Christian religious traditions, broadly speaking, because many of the authors and much of the research in this area are from this tradition. Our hope is that this book will help move spirituality from a peripheral interest at best among mainstream trauma researchers and practitioners to a construct and process of central value.

AB  - Animal shelters are often over-crowded with animals, and efforts to match potential adopters with shelter dogs, to improve the quality of adoptions, are increasing. However, a lack of evidence-based practices makes matching difficult. This research was conducted to investigate the role of dog and human personality, using questionnaire-based measurements, on adoption success in two Indiana shelters, Clinton County Humane Society and the Humane Society of Indianapolis. Ultimately, the aim of this project was to assess dog personality, human personality, and satisfaction, to evaluate adoption success in shelter dogs. The present thesis contains three studies exploring dog and human personality traits, and their possible effect on an adopter's satisfaction. The first study, presented in Chapter 4, assessed the agreement of rating dog personality between the relinquishers and adopters. The Monash Canine Personality Questionnaire-Revised (MCPQ-R) was distributed to owners relinquishing their dogs and also to adopters of those dogs two months post-adoption. The MCPQ-R is a 26-item questionnaire which categorizes canine personality traits based on adjective ratings. Possible personality categories were: Extraversion, Motivation, Training Focus, Amicability, and Neuroticism. Relinquisher-rated dog personality was compared to adopter-rated dog personality of each dog (n=197), and results show a lack of agreement between the two responders. The second study, presented in Chapter 5, assessed the relationships between dog personality and human personality. Because the previous chapter's results found that relinquishers and adopters did not agree on rating dog personality, both relinquisher-rated and adopter-rated dog personality were used to assess relationships with human personality. The MCPQ-R data were compared to the 50-item International Personality Item Pool questionnaire (IPIP) completed by the adopter. Human personality was measured with the IPIP, which categorizes personality traits based on the Five-Factor Model (FFM): Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Stability, and Openness. Results suggested that there were no associations between dog and human personality. The third study, presented in Chapter 6, analyzed the predictability of adoption success with dog personality, human personality, and their interactions. The adopter's satisfaction with the new dog was measured using the Lexington Attachment to Pets Scale (LAPS), a 23-item questionnaire. Using linear and logistic regression, the only statistically significant associations found were between adopter-rated dog personality and mean LAPS score, and adopter-rated dog personality and satisfaction. Those adopters who rated their dogs as Motivated, Training Focused, and Amicable were 4.2, 3.1, and 2.2 times more likely, respectively, to be satisfied with the adopted dog than those who rated their dogs as Extraverted. Additionally, those adopters who rated their dogs as Neurotic were 0.4 times less likely to be satisfied with the adopted dog than those who rated their dogs as Extraverted. Collectively, the results presented in this thesis provide a foundation to encourage animal shelters to shift their programs away from personality matching and towards other programs which may better promote a healthy human-animal bond.

AB  - The use of mobile health services (MHS) has contributed much to health care services by educating and treating illnesses that are chronic in patients located in various part of the world. However, mobile health services have not achieved its maximum capacity due to the scarcity of adoption among consumers. The purpose of this quantitative correlational study is to examine the relationship among five factors of the unified theory of use and acceptance technology and consumers' adoption intention of MHS in the U.S., controlling for the age of consumers. The five factors (performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions and threat appraisals) were defined in the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology Model (UTAUT). The questionnaire developed by Sun et al. (2013) called the Unified Model of Health Technology Acceptance (UMHTA) were used to measure the five factors and the outcome variable of adoption intention of MHS. The sample size was 92 individuals ages 18 to 65 who owned or had access to technology, and members of Qualtrics' online survey panel. Data was input in SPSS, a statistical program for data analysis. The results of hierarchical multiple regression analysis revealed that social influence significantly predicted consumers' adoption intention of MHS in the United States, controlling for the age of consumers ( t = 7.76, p .05), effort expectancy (t = .79, p > .05), facilitating conditions (t = 1.80, p > .05), and threat appraisals (t = -1.05, p > .05) did not significantly predict consumers adoption intention. The results of this research study are noteworthy contributions on a practical and theoretical level to the field of mobile health services. A practical recommendation is mobile health providers should work with app developers to design mobile health monitoring apps that permit individuals to connect on a social basis with family and friends to discuss health-related issues. Future research could explore a longitudinal investigation to compare and examine the UTAUT model in dissimilar time epochs, in that way offering an enhanced perception into the acceptance of MHS in the United States of America. Also, future research can expand upon this research study through evaluating the UTAUT2 framework in various provinces in Texas and other parts of the United States.

It examines how this approach may hold the key to improving the emotional and physical safety of students, while also improving academic and behavioral outcomes. Whether in urban, suburban, or rural settings, trauma-informed schools and 0-to-5 programs have the capacity to meet the needs of children and youths suffering from the effects of familial substance abuse, community and neighborhood violence, child abuse and neglect, forced separation through foster care or parental incarceration, and other traumatic experiences.

AB  - Background: Studies suggest that expert performance in sport is the result of long-term engagement in a highly specialized form of training termed deliberate practice. The relationship between accumulated deliberate practice and performance predicts that those who begin deliberate practice at a young age accumulate more practice hours over time and would, therefore, have a significant performance advantage. However, qualitative studies have shown that a large amount of sport-specific practice at a young age may lead to negative consequences, such as dropout, and is not necessarily the only path to expert performance in sport. Studies have yet to investigate the activity context, such as the amount of early sport participation, deliberate play and deliberate practice within which dropout occurs. Purpose: To determine whether the nature and amount of childhood-organized sport, deliberate play and deliberate practice participation influence athletes' subsequent decisions to drop out or invest in organized sport. It was hypothesized that young athletes who drop out will have sampled fewer sports, spent less time in deliberate play activities and spent more time in deliberate practice activities during childhood sport involvement. Participants: The parents of eight current, high-level, male, minor ice hockey players formed an active group. The parents of four high-level, male, minor ice hockey players who had recently withdrawn from competitive hockey formed a dropout group. Data collection: Parents completed a structured retrospective survey designed to assess their sons' involvement in organized sport, deliberate play and deliberate practice activities from ages 6 to 13. Data analysis: A complete data-set was available for ages 6 through 13, resulting in a longitudinal data-set spanning eight years. This eight-year range was divided into three levels of development corresponding to the players' progress through the youth ice hockey system. Level one encompassed ages 6-9, level two included ages 10-11 and level three covered ages 12-13. Descriptive statistics were used to report the ages at which the active and dropout players first engaged in select hockey activities. ANOVA with repeated measures across the three levels of development was used to compare the number of sports the active and dropout players were involved in outside of hockey, the number of hours spent in these sports, and involvement in various hockey-related activities. Findings: Results indicated that both the active and dropout players enjoyed a diverse and playful introduction to sport. Furthermore, the active and dropout players invested similar amounts of time in organized hockey games, organized hockey practices, specialized hockey training activities (e.g. hockey camps) and hockey play. However, analysis revealed that the dropout players began off-ice training at a younger age and invested significantly more hours/year in off-ice training at ages 12-13, indicating that engaging in off-ice training activities at a younger age may have negative implications for long-term ice hockey participation. Conclusion: These results are consistent with previous research that has found that early diversification does not hinder sport-specific skill development and it may, in fact, be preferable to early specialization. The active and dropout players differed in one important aspect of deliberate practice: off-ice training activities. The dropout players began off-ice training at a younger age, and participated in more off-ice training at ages 12 and 13 than their active counterparts. This indicates a form of early specialization and supports the postulate that early involvement in practice activities that are not enjoyable may ultimately undermine the intrinsic motivation to continue in sport. Youth sport programs should not focus on developing athletic fitness through intense and routine training, but rather on sport-specific practice, games and play activities that foster fun and enjoyment.

AB  - Adult adoptees are at risk for psychological distress and some researchers have found that adoptive family relations are more important to adult adoptees' psychological well-being than to their nonadopted peers. However, no research was found that used standardized instrumentation to assess family dynamics in adult adoptees, and research into the mental health characteristics of adult adoptees has been limited to assessing specific symptomatology. This study therefore, examined the relationship between family dynamics and psychological well-being in a convenience sample (N = 88) of adult adoptees recruited through Internet adoption support sites. Based on the conceptual framework of the circumplex model of marital and family systems, family dynamics was measured with the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scales, Fourth Edition, and psychological well-being was measured using the Scales of Psychological Well-Being. Multiple regression analysis revealed a positive, statistically significant relationship between adoptive family dynamics and psychological well-being. Participants who rated their families as more functional also reported higher well-being ratings. Positive social change may be effected by using standardized instrumentation to assess family dynamics of prospective adoptive parents thereby identifying those most likely to engage in healthy functioning relationships. This in turn will increase the likelihood of long-term higher psychological well-being ratings in adoptees. Furthermore, positive social change may be effected by using standardized instrumentation in the provision of mental health services to adoptees and their families, thereby identifying specific areas of concern for treatment which will enhance psychological well-being.

AB  - THE INFORMATION WAS OBTAINED BY THE ALLEGHENY REGIONAL PLANNING COUNCIL IN 1976 THROUGH A SERIES OF PUBLIC MEETINGS AND HEARINGS, A SURVEY USING 30,000 QUESTIONNAIRES DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY, AND A MEETING WITH INMATES OF THE STATE CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION AT PITTSBURGH ABOUT CRIME CAUSES AND PREVENTION. IN THE AREA OF CRIME PREVENTION, THE CONCEPT OF NEIGHBORHOOD COHESIVENESS IS EMPHASIZED. JOB TRAINING AND MEANINGFUL EMPLOYMENT WERE ALSO DEEMED NECESSARY COMPONENTS OF A CRIME PREVENTION PROGRAM. SELF-HELP PROGRAMS ARE RECOMMENDED FOR ABUSIVE PARENTS, AND GUN CONTROL LEGISLATION IS URGED. IN THE AREA OF VICTIM ASSISTANCE, A SEXUAL ASSAULT AND TREATMENT CENTER IS NEEDED TO ATTEND TO THE MEDICAL NEEDS OF VICTIMS AND SPECIAL TRAINING FOR MEDICAL PERSONNEL IS URGED. IN THE AREA OF JUVENILE FACILITIES, MORE GROUP HOMES, FOSTER HOMES, AND DAY TREATMENT HOMES SHOULD BE AVAILABLE AS SENTENCING ALTERNATIVES. ALCOHOL AND DRUG COUNSELING AND AID TO THE MENTALLY DISABLED YOUTH ARE RECOMMENDED. REGARDING ADULT FACILITIES, IT IS FELT THAT MORE VOCATIONAL PROGRAMS ARE NEEDED AS IS FAMILY COUNSELING. SERVICES DESIGNED TO LINK THE OFFENDER TO THE COMMUNITY ARE IMPERATIVE. POLICE OFFICERS NEED CRISIS INTERVENTION TRAINING PROGRAMS. WAYS OF IMPROVING POLICE-COMMUNITY RELATIONS SHOULD BE DEVELOPED, AND COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS NEED TO BE IMPROVED; THIS CAN BE ACHIEVED PARTIALLY THROUGH THE PURCHASE OF NEWER EQUIPMENT. FINALLY, ATTENTION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THE COURTS. PROBLEMS IN COURT ADMINISTRATION, PROSECUTION, AND DEFENSE ARE DISCUSSED. THE SURVEY INSTRUMENT AND A LIST OF PARTICIPANTS IN MEETINGS AND HEARINGS ARE APPENDED. (MLC)

AB  - This thesis addresses the issue of cultural matching in the area of mentoring in youth and social services and examines, within the context of current and future racial relations, the potential messages that cultural matching may be communicating to youth. The beginning chapters historically trace juvenile delinquency and child-saving services and the current status of youth. This is followed by chapters that define and provide various interpretations of mentoring and its history; its program structures, goals, and operations; research evaluating its effects; and other sociological and psychological research in support of its ideology. Next is a discussion on the two perspectives of how matching should be executed, their ideological bases, and how the opposing beliefs can be understood through the application of sociological literature pertaining to the nature of prejudice, intergroup relations, and ideologies of assimilation and multicultural societies. A brief chapter presents research on minority children's racial and ethnic identities, areas often mentioned in defense of cultural matching. Finally, two social-service cases are compared on the basis of their transracial-adoption and human-service relationships. Recommendations for the future of the field and directions for evaluation conclude the paper. An appendix presents study data. (Contains more than 250 references.) (GLR)

AB  - Reviews studies on the etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of fibromyalgia (FM), a complex syndrome characterized by pain amplification, musculoskeletal discomfort, and systemic symptoms. Although its existence has been controversial, many rheumatologists now accept FM as a distinct diagnostic entity. In the US it is the 3rd or 4th most common reason for rheumatology referral. A committee was formed to devise a definition of FM (primary and secondary) for statistical and epidemiologic purposes, which was published and adopted by the American College of Rheumatology in 1990. A study with 293 patients with presumed FM and 265 controls, showed certain criteria (e.g., sleep disturbance, fatigue, paresthesias, anxiety), and widespread pain with tender points locations for FM. Discussion includes predisposing factors and causes of secondary FM, clinical manifestations, FM in children and the elderly, regional myofascial pain and its relationship to FM, diagnostic evaluation of FM and differential diagnosis, psychopathology, prognosis and outcome.

AB  - The purpose of the present study was to examine the construct of hardiness in a sample of male older adults living in a rural setting. Hardiness, a personality construct composed of commitment, challenge, and control, has been conceptualized as a reserve resource that fosters positive outcomes. It was hypothesized that hardiness would mediate the relationship between social support (quantity of family and friend support) and well-being outcomes (depression; life satisfaction; self-reported physical health). Participants, each of whom completed a mail-in survey, comprised 295 males ranging in age from 61-89. Results indicated that hardiness mediated the relationships between family support and depression, life satisfaction, and self-reported health, and between friend support and depression and selfreported health. In addition, hardiness partially mediated the relationship between friend support and life satisfaction. These findings replicate, in part, previous research in this area and suggest that hardiness and social support may provide multiple points of intervention when fostering positive outcomes in older adults.

AB  - Objective: To determine how often and for what reasons a hospital-based multidisciplinary child abuse team concluded that a report of alleged or suspected child abuse was unnecessary in young children with fractures. Methods: A retrospective review was completed of all children less than 12 months of age who, because of fractures, were referred to the hospital multidisciplinary child abuse team for consultation regarding the need to consider child abuse. Results: The team received 99 consultations, reported 92 (93%) children as alleged or possible victims of physical abuse, and did not report 7 (7%). Age at presentation of those who were reported was 4.2 months compared to 3.0 months in the non-reported group. The average number of fractures in the reported group was 2.9 (SD 3.53) compared to 3.4 (SD 4.6) in the non-reported group. Factors that led to cases not being reported included: (a) a trauma history consistent with the fracture (n=4), (b) a diagnosis of bone fragility secondary to genetic, nutritional or medical therapy etiologies (n=2), and (c) iatrogenic fracture (n=1). Conclusions: Seven percent of the children less than 12 months of age and with at least one fracture referred to the multidisciplinary team for evaluation of possible child abuse were not reported as alleged or suspected physical abuse. The involvement of the hospital multidisciplinary child abuse team may have prevented unnecessary investigation by the county social services agency and/or police, and possible out-of-home temporary placement.

AB  - Health is a state of well-being with physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual dimensions that serves as an essential foundation for human life with implications for how all other aspects of life are pursued and evolve. It is also an essential resource to be valued by individuals, families, communities, and our larger global community. Health may vary in how it is defined, qualified, and pursued within diverse communities and for individuals. Not all enjoy a good state of health, and there are vast differences with regard to the markers and indicators of this state, with health varying across races/ethnicities, diverse groups, special populations, socioeconomic classes, geographic regions, and countries within our global community. It is often through contact with others and via processes of simple social comparison or complex statistical analyses that we arrive at an awareness of how states of health can profoundly vary across groups and locals. Consistent with this perspective, this volume seeks to forge equity in health for all. The volume seeks to be a milestone in the study of health disparities, marking a major paradigm shift, while launching a new field of equity in health—as a new global approach to health disparities. One goal of the volume is to foster movement toward framing the discourse in the United States as one focused on the achievement of equity in health. Another goal is to encourage and train researchers and interventionists in the United States to view the national and international health domains as intricately inter-related and include both in their purview, taking a global approach. Our further discussion, as evidenced in this text, demarcates the nature of the shift in the guiding paradigm, the nature of the desired movement toward equity in health, the parameters of the new field of equity in health, while illustrating how researchers and interventionists may practically approach the reality of our interdependence as one global community.

AB  - This study included 9 new teachers all of whom were assigned master teachers as mentors. The study also included 11 mentor teachers who participated in this study. There were 20 participants in this case study. The study was conducted in the Johnson City School System. This qualitative case study was conducted by interviewing 20 participants in the mentoring program. Eleven mentor teachers and 9 new teachers were chosen through purposeful sampling. A list of possible participants was obtained from the Johnson City Schools Central Office and an email was sent to possible participants explaining the nature of the study. Participants signed an Informed Consent Form (Appendix D) and an interview guide was used (Appendix A). Probes, an interview technique that allows the interviewer to delve deeper following an interviewee’s response was used to gain a richer understanding of the respondents’ views (Merriam, 1998). During data analysis, 8 themes were identified as having positive or negative results of the mentoring process. These themes were: (a) relationships, (b) common planning time, (c) similar personality styles, (d) teaching practices, (e) program structure, (f) support system, (g) classroom organization and management, and (h) equal learning opportunities. Based on the research the following conclusions were presented. Mentoring programs are an important part of teacher induction. Positive relationships are critical to fostering successful mentoring teams. Common planning is essential to maximize the mentoring process. Strong support systems assist mentors and new teachers. Mentoring is an important component of successful transitions into a new school. Recommendations for enhancing the mentoring program included the following: (1) To have a long-term study that tracks the progress of new teachers over a 3-year period. (2) To include administration as a part of the initial training program study. (3) To compare and contrast the difference between first career new teachers and those who have had previous careers and examine how the mentoring process affects the different populations.

AB  - THE PROVISION OF A nutritious diet early in life can have an immense effect on future health and wellbeing. The number of children attending child care is increasing, thus this setting is strategically placed to establish positive eating habits. This qualitative study sought to understand the needs of Australian early childhood education and care staff in relation to the provision of a healthy eating environment. Key stakeholders formed a consultancy group to provide feedback and advice. The study was underpinned by the Spiral Action Research model. Analysis of 48 in-depth interviews identified the following themes: healthy eating activities, resources, nutrition training, attitudes towards healthy eating and the proposed intervention, and barriers to healthy eating. Participants were open to using an online repository of nutrition resources and information wrapped in support. This formative data informed the development of a `best practice' website including discussion boards intended to foster an online `community of practice'.

AB  - The need for an empowered human service workforce has become increasingly apparent in a field that strives to foster client empowerment as an indicator of effective intervention. Moreover, the increased utilization of paraprofessional staff in direct service positions heightens concerns about whether and under what conditions workers are empowered. Utilizing Spretizer's (1992) operationalization of psychological empowerment, this study defined an empowered worker as one with a psychological state characterized by perceived meaning of, competence with and influence over important work-related issues. The study assessed the effect of job dimensions, including role ambiguity, role overload, participatory decision making, supervisor-supervisee relationship and peer support on empowerment. Data on The Family Service Worker Questionnaires were administered to 160 paraprofessionals in public and private child abuse prevention and child welfare agencies. The results provided support for hypothesized relationships between job dimensions and empowerment. Each of the theoretically proposed variables predicted empowerment. When entered into a multiple regression, job dimensions predicted nearly one-half of the variance in empowerment. When other socio-demographic predictors, such as age, gender, unit size and tenure were entered into the regression equation, theoretically proposed variables predicted significant additional amounts of variance in empowerment above and beyond the variance accounted for by socio-demographic variables. Results from open-ended questions generally supported findings from the regression analyses and pointed to ways organizations might improve paraprofessional work and empowerment. The potential to influence direct service worker empowerment through structuring staff role assignment, promoting opportunities for participation in decision making, fostering positive supervisory relationships and facilitating collaborative peer relations has implications for personnel training and development across hierarchical positions within human service organizations. Implications for social work research and practice were discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Students with Conduct Disorder (CD) present one of the most difficult philosophical and practical concerns to classroom educators. These students may engage in behaviors that are ostracizing, harmful, oppositional, or frightening. It is important to know that, although these are challenging behaviors, we as educators can make a crucial difference in the outcomes for students with CD. One criterion used to determine whether or not a person has a mental health problem is suffering (Seligman, Walker, & Rosenhan, 2001). That is, if a person is suffering, he or she may be experiencing emotional duress that could be ameliorated by successful behavioral or psychosocial interventions. The evidence suggests that children with CD are suffering, even as the people around them can suffer as a result of their outward behavior. Responding to children with this problem from the spirit of retribution for disruptive behaviors has not been found to help children over the long term. It is much more helpful to conceptualize CD as a problem of skill deficits. Skill deficits fall soundly into the purview of educators. The students themselves have not learned to behave in a way that you find conducive to the classroom. Some of the parents have not learned parenting skills that foster healthy emotional growth and acquisition of prosocial behavior. And sometimes teachers have skill deficits in the behavior management strategies most likely to modify disruptive behaviors. Although some of these skill deficits are beyond your control, some are not. The behaviors associated with CD will be seen in all children occasionally. Behaviors such as biting, hitting, lying, and stealing are not limited to children with significant disruptive behaviors. In fact, any or all of these behaviors may be seen in a 2-year-old child. However, these behaviors usually disappear with teaching and socialization. Fortunately, most educators are trained in human development and thus are able to formulate educated opinions about whether behaviors observed in children in their classes are developmentally appropriate or not. Furthermore, most educators have access to other professionals within the schools who can help with making such determinations, including school social workers, school counselors, and school psychologists. Although the behaviors associated with CD can challenge the patience of even experienced teachers, the evidence is quite clear that you can effectively intervene to ensure that school is a positive and successful experience for all students. Also, the outcome for students with CD is much more likely to be optimistic if they develop the skills needed to succeed in school rather than have their behaviors addressed by the juvenile justice system. The behaviors associated with CD have served a function for these students; however, you can effectively make those behaviors irrelevant with effective behavior management strategies, fostering positive relationships with your students, and patience.

AB  - There is a need for culturally diverse teachers. Weiher (2000) studied the relationship between African American and Hispanic student achievement and schools with teachers from diverse ethnic backgrounds. Results indicated the greater the difference between the percentage of ethnically diverse teachers and the percentage of diverse students, the lower the percentage of students who score proficient on the state test. Exposure to various cultural experiences is important to quality education (Anda 1984; Eubanks & Weaver, 1999; Irvine, 1989; King, 1993; Morris, 1990). These experiences prepare students for success in a global market. In 2004 Hobson-Horton and Owens found almost one third of the student population was non-white, compared to 12% of the teacher population. A lack of ethnically diverse teachers fosters a need to learn about the career decision of African American and Hispanic teachers. Lent, Brown, and Hackett (1994) developed social cognitive career theory (SCCT) which suggests that occupational interests extend from three cognitive variables including self-efficacy beliefs, outcome expectations, and personal goals (Lent & Brown, 1996). Self-efficacy is a person's beliefs in his capabilities to successfully engage in an activity and develops from past performances, vicarious learning, social persuasion, and anxiety management. The origin of self-efficacy relates to one's family, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and level of educational experiences (Betz, 2004). According to Hackett and Byars (1996) the research on career development has not addressed the influences of race and ethnicity. Due to this lack of research, the focus of this research was upon vicarious learning and social persuasion, which deal with cultural and familial influences. Findings indicated that vicarious learning had an impact on the career decision-making process for African American and Hispanic teachers. Social persuasion had little influence on the decision making process. Recommendations for the school district were to begin early developing an awareness of teaching as a career. Interested students should be involved in "teaching experiences". Assigning a mentoring teacher provides vicarious learning opportunities. The district should provide a "Grow Your Own" scholarship program. Community support was essential for encouraging teachers to move into the district.

AB  - Key to understanding the long-term impact of social inequalities is identifying early behaviors that may signal higher risk for later poor psychosocial outcomes, such as psychopathology. A set of early-emerging characteristics that may signal risk for later externalizing psychopathology is callous-unemotional (CU) behavior. CU behavior predicts severe and chronic trajectories of externalizing behaviors in youth. However, much research on CU behavior has focused on late childhood and adolescence, with little attention paid to early childhood when preventative interventions may be most effective. In this article, we summarize our recent work showing that (a) CU behavior can be identified in early childhood using items from common behavior checklists, (b) CU behavior predicts worse outcomes across early childhood, (c) CU behavior exhibits a nomological network distinct from other early externalizing behaviors, and (d) malleable environmental factors, particularly parenting, may play a role in the development of early CU behaviors. We discuss the challenges of studying contextual contributors to the development of CU behavior in terms of gene-environment correlations and present initial results from work examining CU behavior in an adoption study in which gene-environment correlations are examined in early childhood. We find that parenting is a predictor of early CU behavior even in a sample in which parents are not genetically related to the children.

AB  - Cyberbullying, the use of electronic communication to bully another person with intimidation or threatening messages, has become an ever-increasing public safety concern. Lifetime bullying incidences have doubled in the past 10 years. Although all youth are at risk, the risk is significantly higher for minority and disabled children, adolescent girls, and youth with poor interpersonal relationships and low self-esteem. Enhanced by modern technology, cyberbullies experience an online disinhibition effect due to distance from the victim. Risk factors for cyberbullying include substance use, being raised by authoritarian parenting style, and poor relationship bonds. Because one of the most significant protective factors against cyberbullying victimization is social support, interventions have focused on fostering supportive environments. This article reviews behaviors, epidemiology, characteristics of victims and perpetrators, impact on individuals, and prevention and interventions related to cyberbullying.

AB  - The Casey Family Program provides a planned, long-term approach to subsidized foster care for the underachievers of the child welfare system. Its concept is a marriage of what foster care professionals know about effectively helping children and what managers know about effectively running organizations. The purpose of our studies of The Casey Family Program was to determine whether the outcomes of its foster placements were predictable from factors that could be known, at least in principle, at the time the placements were made. We built statistical models of placement maintenance based upon characteristics of (a) the foster child; (b) his or her biological family; and (c) the foster family. We used two main sources of data to construct models: archival material on the child and his or her biological family, and caseworker ratings of various aspects of the child and his or her foster family. Information was derived from a sample of 51 children served by the Montana Division of The Casey Family Program to build the models, which in general provided accurate predictions of placement outcomes. The models were then cross-validated with a sample of 55 children from the Idaho Division. There was a substantial amount of shrinkage in the variance accounted for in the cross-validation sample, but outcomes remained largely predictable. To determine whether predictions of placement outcomes could be based upon brief assessments of factors that could be evaluated at the time placements were made, a third study was undertaken. The results of that study implied that ratings of salient characteristics of foster children and foster families based upon as little as a single day's observation could be used to effectively predict placement outcomes. Several aspects of these studies deserve special emphasis. First, the research confirmed that the children served by the Montana and Idaho divisions of TCFP were among the underachievers of the child welfare system whom Jim Casey desired to reach. It also confirmed that the Montana and Idaho divisions were doing an effective job of serving those children. Their placements were generally stable and both foster children and foster families were rated as functioning at levels that ranged from acceptable to good.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

AB  - Birth centres are an emerging model of maternity care internationally. This paper reviews the literature in relation to birth centre care, including both quantitative and qualitative research papers, in free-standing birth centres (FSBCs) and integrated birth centres (IBCs). Quantitative research designs adopted to evaluate free-standing birth centres were of modest robustness with an absence of randomised controlled trials. However, they suggest that fewer birth interventions occur within these facilities compared with consultant maternity units. Integrated facilities have been the subject of a number of randomised controlled trials, which have been systematically reviewed. A more conclusive and generalisable picture emerges from these which demonstrate a marked reduction in labour and birth interventions and high levels of maternal satisfaction. Qualitative studies reveal some of the contextual characteristics of these environments, including an explicit 'birth as normal' philosophy and an emphasis on relational elements of care. Together, these results support the birth centre model, both as a free-standing and and an integrated option. They present an important alternative to mainstream hospital, obstetric-led care for the majority of women who could expect a normal, physiological birth.

AB  - Theory, research and practice in the field of mental health are inescapably intertwined. Each can inform and enrich the others. As a clinical scholar, educator, and practitioner over the past three decades, I have endeavored to integrate the three in the development of a family resilience framework to guide intervention and prevention efforts with families facing serious life challenges. I have also found it essential to bridge theory and research on 'normal' human development in the social sciences with preoccupations in the field of mental health on individual psychopathology and family deficits. This chapter discusses family resilience for clinical social work practice. The family resilience practice approach described here builds on recent advances in strengths-based, collaborative, systemic therapies in the field of family therapy. It is distinct in focus on strengthening family functioning in the context of adversity. Incorporating a developmental perspective on stress, coping, and adaptation, this approach links presenting symptoms with disruptive stress events, with ripple effects to all members and relationships. How the family responds can foster resilience for all members and their relationships. Beyond coping or problem solving, resilience involves positive transformation and growth. In building relational resilience, families forge stronger bonds and become more resourceful in meeting future challenges. Thus, every intervention has preventive benefits.

AB  - Approximately ten percent of nurse anesthesia graduate students enter a nurse anesthesia training program at 40 years of age or later. In prior research, the category of 'nurse anesthesia students over the age of 40' was seen to be problematic to clinical success. This research study identified and explored success factors of older, non-traditional student registered nurse anesthetists (SRNAs) perceived by nurse anesthesia clinical instructors. A survey questionnaire was randomly distributed to 10,000 CRNAs. A total of 963 study subjects responded to the survey, with 607 participants having experience training older SRNAs. Likert-type items were used to evaluate older SRNA characteristics. Quantitative and qualitative information was collected by the survey questionnaire. Focus groups were conducted to validate and explore findings. This study found no difference in the perception of performance of older SRNAs, compared to younger SRNAs, in the clinical setting. Success characteristics include commitment, judgment, and clinical experience. Characteristics that negatively impact success include flexibility, hardiness or stamina, ability to adapt to technology, and family issues. The age of the clinical instructor, and the age at which the clinical instructor was certified, significantly influenced the perception of older SRNA performance in the clinical setting. The same relationship was not found regarding the gender or experience of the clinical instructor. These findings suggest that age of the SRNA has little or no impact on clinical success. Characteristics such as clinical experience, life experiences, commitment, and judgment positively differentiate older SRNAs from their younger counterparts. Generational differences play an important role in the SRNA / clinical instructor learning process. Understanding characteristics and qualities specific to the older SRNA by clinical instructors will enhance the learning experience for the older SRNA, and foster the satisfaction of clinical training for the clinical preceptor.

AB  - Approximately ten percent of nurse anesthesia graduate students enter a nurse anesthesia training program at 40 years of age or later. In prior research, the category of 'nurse anesthesia students over the age of 40' was seen to be problematic to clinical success. This research study identified and explored success factors of older, non-traditional student registered nurse anesthetists (SRNAs) perceived by nurse anesthesia clinical instructors. A survey questionnaire was randomly distributed to 10,000 CRNAs. A total of 963 study subjects responded to the survey, with 607 participants having experience training older SRNAs. Likert-type items were used to evaluate older SRNA characteristics. Quantitative and qualitative information was collected by the survey questionnaire. Focus groups were conducted to validate and explore findings. This study found no difference in the perception of performance of older SRNAs, compared to younger SRNAs, in the clinical setting. Success characteristics include commitment, judgment, and clinical experience. Characteristics that negatively impact success include flexibility, hardiness or stamina, ability to adapt to technology, and family issues. The age of the clinical instructor, and the age at which the clinical instructor was certified, significantly influenced the perception of older SRNA performance in the clinical setting. The same relationship was not found regarding the gender or experience of the clinical instructor. These findings suggest that age of the SRNA has little or no impact on clinical success. Characteristics such as clinical experience, life experiences, commitment, and judgment positively differentiate older SRNAs from their younger counterparts. Generational differences play an important role in the SRNA / clinical instructor learning process. Understanding characteristics and qualities specific to the older SRNA by clinical instructors will enhance the learning experience for the older SRNA, and foster the satisfaction of clinical training for the clinical preceptor.

AB  - The death of a family member is often a profound loss for the entire family. This chapter presents a family systems conceptual framework for clinical assessment and intervention to facilitate adaptation in the wake of loss. Drawing together developments in theory, research, and practice, I consider the impact of death on the family as a functional unit, with far-reaching implications for all members and their relationships. In this chapter, I describe family challenges and risk factors for maladaptation and highlight transactional processes that foster family resilience.

AB  - The aim of this study was to measure any incremental costs or savings within the health system associated with the introduction of the new technology, prucalopride, for the management of chronic constipation. The study design was based on a budget impact analysis conducted by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE). To validate the findings of the NICE costing template, a case series audit capturing real world data was used to determine the financial impact of adopting prucalopride in 40 women suffering with chronic constipation. This facilitated the application of local unit costs to the resources used and determined whether the use of prucalopride, as an alternative treatment to laxatives, resulted in a reduction in the use of secondary care resources. Patients were treated with an average of 2.6 laxatives in the baseline (laxatives only) scenario. The total medication costs in the baseline (laxatives only) and the new treatment (prucalopride) scenario amounted to a,not sign17,440.84 and a,not sign18,417.62, respectively. There was a significant reduction in the number of investigations and procedures in the 12 months after commencing prucalopride, with cost savings of a,not sign41,923.28 (a,not sign1,048.08 per patient per year) demonstrated. Input cost variables were adjusted as part of sensitivity analysis. This study validated the findings of the NICE costing template and suggests that the use of prucalopride for the treatment of chronic constipation in women refractory to laxatives has the potential to reduce secondary care resource use and hence led to cost savings.

AB  - Purpose: Health professionals view falls after stroke as common adverse events with both physical and psychological consequences. Stroke survivors' experiences are less well understood. The aim of this systematic review was to explore the perception of falls-risk within the stroke recovery experience from the perspective of people with stroke. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted. Papers that used qualitative methods to explore the experiences of individuals with stroke around falls, falls-risk and fear of falling were included. Two reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality of papers. Meta-ethnography was conducted. Concepts from each study were translated into each other to form theories that were combined through a "lines-of-argument" synthesis. Results: Four themes emerged from the six included qualitative studies: (i) Fall circumstances, (ii) perception of fall consequences, (iii) barriers to community participation and (iv) coping strategies. The synthesis revealed that stroke survivors' perceived consequences of falls exist on a continuum. Cognitive and emotional adjustment may be required in the successful adoption of coping strategies to overcome fall-related barriers to participation. Conclusions: Stroke survivors' fall-related experiences appear to exist within the context of activity and community participation. Further research is warranted due to the small number of substantive studies available for synthesis. Implications for Rehabilitation: Health care professionals should recognize that cognitive and emotional adjustment may berequired for stroke survivors to accept strategies for overcoming falls-risk, including dependenceon carers and assistive devices. Several factors in addition to physical interventions may be needed to minimize falls-risk whileincreasing activity participation. These factors could include increasing public awareness about the effects of stroke and falls-risk,and ensuring access to psychological services for stroke survivors. Rehabilitation professionals should reflect on whether they perceive there to be an appropriatelevel of fear of falling post-stroke. They should understand that stroke survivors might not conceptualize falls-risk in this way.

AB  - Effective supervision in doctoral research is critical to successful and timely completion. However, supervision is a complex undertaking with structural as well as relational challenges for both students and supervisors. This instructional paper describes an internationally applicable approach to supervision that we have developed in the health and social care disciplines that offers structure, but is also dynamic and responsive to the needs of students and supervisors and aims to develop the research competency of students. Our approach called Solution Focused Research Supervision (SFRS) is based on solution focused approaches, adapted from Solution Focused Brief Therapy and questioning techniques derived from coaching. This approach has enabled our supervision teams to effectively develop focused research questions and decide on appropriate research methodologies and methods. We offer the SFRS approach as a way of working that seeks to recognize and build upon strengths, foster engagement and openness to learning as well as build trust between students and supervisors. The authors, from (countries deleted for peer review), are supervisors and students who have developed the approach and provide practical examples of its application.

AB  - The death of a family member is a profound loss that ripples through the entire relational network. This chapter presents a systemic framework for assessment and intervention to address bereavement complications and facilitate healing and resilience in the wake of loss. Drawing together developments in theory, research, and practice, the chapter considers the impact of loss for the family as a functional unit, along with the immediate and far-reaching implications for all members and their relationships, reverberating over time and across generations. Attention is given to complex and traumatic loss situations and to the human capacity for resilience. Applying a family resilience framework, practitioners can identify risk factors for maladaptation, and transactional processes that foster adaptation, stronger bonds, and positive growth. Helping family members deal with a loss requires respect for their particular faith beliefs and cultural heritage and encouragement to forge their own pathways through mourning processes and beyond.

AB  - The author discusses major barriers which hinder the accomplishment of effective employee career management and presents Self-Motivated Personal Career Planning as a means to reconcile personal and organizational goals. The plan involves employee planners and management facilitators in a process of self-assessment and goal-setting, which capitalizes on the forces of one's own motivation to succeed in life and seeks to create an organizational climate of interpersonal relationships fostering personal growth and career development. Various steps are followed which lead to the composition of an individual's Personal Career Review and Action Plan Summary. The starting point for self-assessment is the construction of an autobiographical summary of educational preparation, work experience, and personal career accomplishment from analysis worksheets. Psychometric inventories are used for comparison purposes and the Career/Personal Development Profile is used for further specific self-knowledge. Participants then seek information and make predictions about desired or possible next career steps within the organization. The final step is directed toward goal attainment. The program was pilot-tested in 1975 with 80 administrators/managers/supervisors and 100 employees, as part of a company's affirmative action endeavors. A majority of program participants perceived it to be beneficial. (EA)

AB  - Research shows that New Zealand has an approximate population of 600,000 children between the ages of five and fourteen years, and that approximately 80,000 of those children attend an out-of-school-care service each year. The New Zealand government allocates approximately $20 million to suitably approved programs, funding for families of lower socioeconomic status to attend care, and support to a national body known as the OSCAR Foundation (Out-of-School Care and Recreation) to provide "OSCAR advisers" to measure the quality of programs being delivered and to support development of quality programs. The Ministry of Social Development and Families Commission conducted research by meeting with key stakeholders, including families in a variety of communities, in 2006. The research resulted in a draft five-year action plan that focuses on four main categories in which action is required: quality, affordability, availability, and accessibility. The May 2007 budget released by the New Zealand Labor government makes a commitment to invest $17.4 million until 2012 in this sector as a result of the research that took place in 2006. The YMCA of New Zealand is the largest provider of OSCAR programs in the country, and receives considerable Ministry of Social Development (MSD) assistance grant and Work and Income subsidy for lower-income families. Acknowledging that there is a good contribution to the YMCA from these two funding sources, as well as the desire to be the leading provider in OSCAR for the country, the YMCA has moved to create a position to self-monitor its delivery of programs and set a standard to exceed approval norms. This article looks at the potential impact of this five-year action plan on providers, recipients, and quality standards for out-of-school care in New Zealand. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - Because of concerns about the potential overprescribing of psychotropic medications to youths in foster care, oversight of psychotropic prescribing has been recommended. This study assessed whether education of child welfare caseworkers about potentially problematic psychiatric care of youths on their caseloads can enhance their capabilities to initiate discretionary expert medication reviews, a type of psychotropic oversight. Findings demonstrated that the educational program was feasible to implement and highly valued by caseworker participants; enhanced caseworkers’ psychiatric knowledge, beliefs, and self-efficacy; and favorably impacted caseworkers’ management of potentially problematic prescribing practices.

AB  - Emotional factors play a part in the learning process, and, so too for leadership. Fullan (2001) identified self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, social skills, adaptability, stress management and general mood as fundamental characteristics of emotional intelligence. If leaders exemplify these characteristics, this will positively affect the organization, and at all levels, a view supported by Fullan (2003). The author believes that a measure of the effectiveness of any change process is the extent to which the process itself fosters the development of emotional intelligence or wisdom in the people involved. Given all the models of educational leadership and the development programmes that have evolved to support school principals, one may find it easy to lose sight of the factors that underpin the learning of children, teachers and leaders. The author argues that an adherence to a social constructivist approach to leadership aligns it to a sound theory of learning and retains the focus on human dimensions. He has little doubt that experience counts a great deal in these matters, but, where possible, it should be the collective experience of all those involved in the process of change.

AB  - Widely adopted, this state-of-the-art work is grounded in the best available knowledge about substance abuse and its treatment. The editors and contributors are leading authorities who provide a complete introduction to each of today's major evidence-based treatment approaches—from conceptual underpinnings to clinical applications. The third edition has been revised and updated to reflect significant advances in research, theory, and technique. Entirely new chapters cover the biology of substance use disorders, treatment in primary care settings, and case management. The third edition retains the structure that makes the book so popular as a course text and practitioner resource. Following an introductory overview, paired chapters focus respectively on the theory and practice of each approach, including motivational, contingency management, cognitive-behavioral, 12-step, family, and pharmacological models. Theory chapters explain basic assumptions about how people develop, maintain, and recover from substance use disorders and concisely review the research support for each approach. Practice chapters then offer a start-to-finish view of treatment, covering such crucial topics as the therapeutic relationship, assessment procedures, goal setting, the sequencing of interventions, how 'denial' and 'resistance' are addressed, the role of self-help groups, and strategies for preventing and dealing with relapse. Illustrative case examples are included. The volume concludes with three chapters on integrating different techniques to meet patients' needs in a range of clinical settings. Written for a broad audience, this book is an essential text for courses in substance abuse treatment and addiction counseling. Experienced substance abuse clinicians—including clinical psychologists, clinical social workers, psychiatric nurses, counselors, and psychiatrists—will find it a valuable reference for staying up to date on current treatment approaches.

AB  - Background There is a growing call by consumers and governments for healthcare to adopt systems and approaches to care to improve patient safety. Collaboration within healthcare settings is an important factor for improving systems of care. By using validated measurement instruments a standardized approach to assessing collaboration is possible, otherwise it is only an assumption that collaboration is occurring in any healthcare setting. Objectives The objective of this review was to evaluate and compare measurement properties of instruments that measure collaboration within healthcare settings, specifically those which have been psychometrically tested and validated. Inclusion criteria Types of participants Participants could be healthcare professionals, the patient or any non-professional who contributes to a patient's care, for example, family members, chaplains or orderlies. The term participant type means the designation of any one participant; for example ‘nurse’, ‘social worker' or ‘administrator'. More than two participant types was mandatory. Types of intervention(s)/phenomena of interest The focus of this review was the validity of tools used to measure collaboration within healthcare settings. Types of studies The types of studies considered for inclusion were validation studies, but quantitative study designs such as randomized controlled trials, controlled trials and case studies were also eligible for inclusion. Studies that focused on Interprofessional Education, were published as an abstract only, contained patient self-reporting only or were not about care delivery were excluded. Outcomes The outcome of interest was validation and interpretability of the instrument being assessed and included content validity, construct validity and reliability. Interpretability is characterized by statistics such as mean and standard deviation which can be translated to a qualitative meaning. Search strategy The search strategy aimed to find both published and unpublished studies. A three-step search strategy was utilized in this review. The databases searched included PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Emerald Fulltext, MD Consult Australia, PsycARTICLES, Psychology and Behavioural Sciences Collection, PsycINFO, Informit Health Databases, Scopus, UpToDate and Web of Science. The search for unpublished studies included EThOS (Electronic Thesis Online Service), Index to Theses and ProQuest-Dissertations and Theses. Methodological quality The assessment of methodological quality of the included studies was undertaken using the COSMIN checklist which is a validated tool that assesses the process of design and validation of healthcare measurement instruments. Data extraction An Excel spreadsheet version of COSMIN was developed for data collection which included a worksheet for extracting participant characteristics and interpretability data. Data synthesis Statistical pooling of data was not possible for this review. Therefore, the findings are presented in a narrative form including tables and figures to aid in data presentation. To make a synthesis of the assessments of methodological quality of the different studies, each instrument was rated by accounting for the number of studies performed with an instrument, the appraisal of methodological quality and the consistency of results between studies. Results Twenty-one studies of 12 instruments were included in the review. The studies were diverse in their theoretical underpinnings, target population/setting and measurement objectives. Measurement objectives included: investigating beliefs, behaviors, attitudes, perceptions and relationships associated with collaboration; measuring collaboration between different levels of care or within a multi-rater/target group; assessing collaboration across teams; or assessing internal participation of both teams and patients. Studies produced validity or interpretability data but none of the studies assessed all validity and reliability properties. However, most of the included studies produced a factor structure or referred to prior factor analysis. A narrative synthesis of the individual study factor structures was generated consisting of nine headings: organizational settings, support structures, purpose and goals; communication; reflection on process; cooperation; coordination; role interdependence and partnership; relationships; newly created professional activities; and professional flexibility. Conclusions Among the many instruments that measure collaboration within healthcare settings, the quality of each instrument varies; instruments are designed for specific populations and purposes, and are validated in various settings. Selecting an instrument requires careful consideration of the qualities of each. Therefore, referring to systematic reviews of measurement properties of instruments may be helpful to clinicians or researchers in instrument selection. Implications for practice Systematic reviews of measurement properties of instruments are valuable in aiding in instrument selection. This systematic review may be useful in instrument selection for the measurement of collaboration within healthcare settings with a complex mix of participant types. Evaluating collaboration provides important information on the strengths and limitations of different healthcare settings and the opportunities for continuous improvement via any remedial actions initiated. Implications for research Development of a tool that can be used to measure collaboration within teams of healthcare professionals and nonprofessionals is important for practice. The use of different statistical modelling techniques, such as Item Response Theory modelling and the translation of models into Computer Adaptive Tests, may prove useful. Measurement equivalence is an important consideration for future instrument development and validation. Further development of the COSMIN tool should include appraisal for measurement equivalence. Researchers developing and validating measurement tools should consider multi-method research designs.

AB  - Purpose: The purposes of this study were first to identify and describe transition to adulthood pathways of youth with Serious Emotional Disturbance (SED) in regards to the timing and order of transition to adulthood task completion (e.g. completing education, gaining employment, living independently, marrying/close personal relationship, and becoming a parent). It then evaluated the relationship between transition pathway and use of social services (e.g. SNAP, TANF, Medicaid, etc.), and contact with the justice system (e.g. arrest, incarceration, probation). Methods: This study is a secondary data analysis using self-report data from the National Longitudinal Transition Study 2 (NLTS2). A latent class analysis of responses from 950 youth with SED ages 13 to 26 years and their caregivers was conducted to determine how youth with SED experienced transition task completion. Once pathways were identified, social service use and justice system contact were examined by transition pathway for group differences. Results: Two pathways through the transition to adulthood for youth with SED were identified. Approximately half of youth (53%, Class 2) in this study experienced early transition task completion, including school (most by age 19), and a steady rate of gaining employment and independent living. These youth were more likely to be from households above the poverty level, Caucasian, and to report higher social assertiveness skills. Youth in the second identified pathway (47%, Class 1) reported transition task completion as a gradual process. They were more likely to still be engaged in school or other educational programing well into their 20s and less likely to be employed, living independently, or parenting (Class 2). They were also more likely to be from households below the poverty level, less likely to be Caucasian, and reported lower social assertiveness skills. Due to limitations in the data, social service use and criminal justice system contact were not able to be fully examined based on transition pathway. However, consistent with the literature, youth with SED reported a high rate of social service use (TANF 23%, food stamps/SNAP 33%, social security income 39%, Medicaid/Medicare 51%) and justice system contact (arrested 49%, jailed 27%, probation/parole 27%). Conclusions: Findings allowed for the identification of a proportion of youth with SED (47%, Class 1) that achieved transition tasks, markers of independence into adulthood, more gradually than their peers. Based on the characteristics of this subset of youth who were at risk of delayed transition, it is important to focus interventions on minority, low income youth with SED and lower social skills. A key component of intervention should be focusing efforts when youth were still of school age, as findings indicate youth are already on their transition trajectory by age 18. More research is needed to follow youth with SED into adulthood and determine the impact of alternative transition pathways.

AB  - Recently within the juvenile justice system there has been a great deal of attention toward increasing family involvement, with the goal of enhancing the quality of service-delivery for youth active with the justice system and their families, and ultimately achieving better overall outcomes. Many states are adopting new initiatives and policies to improve the involvement and engagement of family members in decision-making, treatment, supervision and overall case management. To date, however, there is little published empirical evidence that demonstrates whether or how such involvement will translate into greater success, increased compliance with treatment and conditions, goal attainment, reduced length of stay/time on supervision, and ultimately lower recidivism rates, for youth active with the juvenile justice system. Furthermore, there is a need to clearly define and operationalize 'family involvement' within a juvenile justice context, which has not yet been clearly conceptualized or operationalized in the literature. While there are a few studies that examine family involvement with justice involved youth, these are generally limited to youth in out-of-home placement facilities. With the majority of youth remaining in the community during their involvement with the juvenile justice system, conducting research within a community-based setting is an integral part of understanding family involvement. The current study sought to provide an understanding of how best to measure and operationalize family involvement in a broader juvenile justice context. In addition to developing a working definition of, and framework for, family involvement, this dissertation examined whether or not family involvement influences recidivism. To examine the relationship between family involvement and recidivism from a community corrections lens, the current study used case record data from a random sample of 300 youth referred to the Dauphin County Pennsylvania Juvenile Probation Department in 2010. In Pennsylvania juvenile probation officers are involved with a case from referral to case closing; therefore, in addition to providing a community corrections setting, the juvenile probation department provides the opportunity to measure family involvement from case beginning to end. Employing a longitudinal cohort design, two years of retrospective data were collected for the 97 females and 203 males included in the study sample. Multivariate analyses were used to measure the relationship between various indicators of family involvement and youth outcomes. Findings show that family member presence at court hearings is a significant predictor of recidivism. Youth whose family members missed at least one court hearing were significantly more likely to have a violation of probation filed, to recidivate, and to have a shorter time to rearrest. Additionally, when exploring familial characteristics that may contribute to family involvement, risk assessment results and family member criminal justice history were significantly related to various family involvement measures. This research helps lay the conceptual and empirical foundation for understanding and testing the impact of family involvement, and its findings contribute to the knowledge of the role of family in the juvenile justice system. This dissertation also suggests new areas of research to assess the effects of family involvement on juvenile justice outcomes. These initial findings assist in understanding the nature and impact of such initiatives, and provide important feedback to policy makers and program officials as they continue to shape the role of a family involvement strategy in juvenile justice, with the primary goal of increasing overall youth success and reducing recidivism.

AB  - Intensive, in-home family-based services were employed in reunifying families separated by the placement of a child in out-of-home care. After a 90-day service period, 93% of the 57 families randomly assigned to receive the intensive treatment were reunited-compared to 28% of the 53 families in a control group who received routine out-of-home care services. Follow-up data were collected six and 12 months after the end of treatment. Estimates of outcomes suggest that the experimental treatment had a substantial impact on families and that treatment effects endured for upwards of 12 months following cessation of direct intervention services.

AB  - An experimental research design was employed in evaluating intensive family preservation services to reunify familuies after out-of-home placement. There was a significant difference between the treatment group and control group in terms of family reunification, but there were mixed findings with regard to the difference between the two groups on measures of family functioning. Although more treatment parents than control parents felt their families were functioning better, there was no difference between scores for the two groups of parents on normed instruments designed to measure family functioning. The author describes the measures of family functioning employed in the evaluation and discussed the confusing findings along with implications for program evaluation.

AB  - As a focus of research, bullying is widely conceptualized as relational violence among children and youth. Focusing on individual behaviour and relations of power between or among children, research is usually concerned with identifying and classifying incidents, and finding ways to reduce rates of occurrence. Definitions of bullying, promoted by research and anti-bullying programs, are typically static. In this dissertation, I focus on bullying not as an empirical given, but rather as a notion contextualized in time and place, socially and politically. Prior to about 1980, bullying was largely considered to be a usual feature of schooling, perhaps even a positive one by which children would develop character and coping skills. By contrast, bullying now garners widespread discussion and allocation of resources for reduction. Public and media pressure have resulted in widespread adoption of regulatory, one-size- fits-all approaches such as zero tolerance policies and codes of student conduct. However, bullying remains a significant problem in schools, particularly for students who are deemed by their peers as being 'different.' Educational policy, like research on bullying, mostly does not take social difference into account. Regulation of behaviour does not address the ways in which bullying reinforces social norms and hierarchies of privilege. Such hierarchies are constituted by an interwoven grid of social categories, such as race, gender performance, and class, among others. Throughout these chapters, I highlight contradictions within generically focused policy and research approaches. Specifically, I weave the issue of gender and sexuality categories throughout the text because bullying is a practice by which normative gender expectations are preserved. For instance, incidents of bullying routinely feature expressions of homophobia. However, difference based on gender variance is rarely addressed in policy or taken up by researchers on bullying. By not addressing how social difference informs bullying, generic policies on school safety are compromised in their attempt to facilitate safety for all students. Employing Michel Foucault's theories of power and discourse, and James Scheurich's application of them to policy analysis, I suggest ways of conceptualizing bullying that more effectively account for social difference, and that address bullying as a practice of social control.

AB  - Predictors of Improvement for Children Served In Developing Systems of Care The research base regarding the effectiveness of systems of care for children with serious emotional disturbances is limited. The incremental development of systems of care in Indiana provides an opportunity to compare the outcomes of children served in these child and family wraparound teams with the outcomes of a matched sample of children receiving usual public mental health services. Functional assessment data from a state database was examined using logistic regression models. The level of development of wraparound services was used as a fidelity measure. Findings suggest circumstances in which systems of care are effective. Children with impairments related to affective disorders who are served through child and family teams with high wraparound fidelity are more likely to experience improvements than children served in usual services. Similar youth served by intermediately developed wraparound teams are predicated to do less well than children served in usual services. However, abused children in intermediate systems of care are predicted to have improvements in community functioning and experience less subsequent abuse. Most youth with disruptive behaviors, other than Hispanic youth, improve in wraparound teams. Families of children who live with their biological parents are more likely to improve than families whose children live in foster care, with extended family, or in out-of-home placements. Youth with serious emotional disturbance who use drugs or alcohol have poorer outcomes in wraparound. Implications include targeting systems of care to subpopulations of children and families for whom there is evidence of greatest effectiveness, Results also indicate that additional training in effective treatment for affective disorders or higher levels of integration of care coordination with effective clinical services may be necessary to improve outcomes for developing systems of care. Integrated models of care may be needed for youth with co-occurring disorders. Additional attention to developing linguistic and cultural competence within wraparound services may be required to effectively serve the growing Hispanic community.

AB  - Background: CCR5 antagonists have clinically been approved for prevention or treatment of HIV/AIDS. Countries in Sub-Saharan Africa with the highest burden of HIV/AIDS are due to adopt these regimens. However, HIV-1 can also use CXCR4 as a co-receptor. There is hence an urgent need to map out cellular tropism of a country's circulating HIV strains to guide the impending use of CCR5 antagonists. Objectives: To determine HIV-1 coreceptor usage among patients attending a comprehensive care centre in Nairobi, Kenya. Methods: Blood samples were obtained from HIV infected patients attending the comprehensive care centre, Kenyatta National Hospital in years 2008 and 2009. The samples were separated into plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Proviral DNA was extracted from PBMCs and Polymerase Chain reaction (PCR) done to amplify the HIV env fragment spanning the C2-V3 region. The resultant fragment was directly sequenced on an automated sequencer (ABI, 3100). Co-receptor prediction of the env sequences was done using Geno2pheno {[}co-receptor], and phylogenetic relationships determined using CLUSTALW and Neighbor Joining method. Results: A total of 67 samples (46 treatment experienced and 21 treatment naive) were successfully amplified and sequenced. Forty nine (73%) sequences showed a prediction for R5 tropism while 18(27%) were X4 tropic. Phylogenetic analysis showed that 46(69%) were subtype A, 11(16%) subtype C, and 10(15%) subtype D. No statistical significant associations were observed between cell tropism and CD4+ status, patient gender, age, or treatment option. There was a tendency for more X4 tropic strains being in the treatment experienced group than the naive group: Of 46 treatment experiencing participants, 14(30%) harboured X4, compared with 4(19%) of 21 of the treatment-naive participants, the association is however not statistically significant (p = 0.31). However, a strong association was observed between subtype D and CXCR4 co-receptor usage (p = 0.015) with 6(60%) of the 10 subtype D being X4 tropic and 4(40%) R5 tropic. Conclusion: HIV-1 R5 tropic strains were the most prevalent in the study population and HIV infected patients in Kenya may benefit from CCR5 antagonists. However, there is need for caution where subtype D infection is suspected or where antiretroviral salvage therapy is indicated.

AB  - This study attempts to show the relationship of the adoption of Extension recommended agricultural practices with 18 variables pertaining to farm operators in Korean farm communities, to understand the time lag between scientific discovery and use of new developments in agriculture; and to contribute to the practical implications for action programs in the promotion of improvements in agriculture, and to the theory of technological and social change. A sample of 266 farm operators were selected for study from three randomly chosen agricultural communities. Five independent variables were used: personal and family variables; socioeconomic status; social participation; communication variables; and scientific farming orientation. Three control variables were introduced in the analysis of the relationship between variables. The Kendall's Tau was used to measure the degree of association, and a significance test, at 5% level, used to determine the reliability of the association. Some of the conclusions were: for the most part selected personal and family variables were associated with practice adoption; however age of farm operators was not significantly related. Experience in farming, and socioeconomic status and social participation, were positively associated with adoption. (Author/PT)

AB  - Results are reported from an investigation of the implementation and effects of The Adaptive Learning Environments Model (ALEM), a program designed to provide special education services for mainstreamed handicapped students in regular classroom settings on a full-time basis. ALEM includes components of prescriptive instruction with informal approaches to foster inquiry, independence, and social cooperation. Effects of implementing ALEM in 26 mainstreaming classrooms were evaluated via measurements of degree of program implementation, classroom process outcomes, student academic and attitudinal outcomes, and teacher and parent attitudes and assessments. Results are detailed for four major topics: degree of program implementation, relationship between implementation and selected student outcomes, relationship between degree of program implementation and classroom processes, and teacher and parent attitudes and assessment of program impact. Overall, results supported the feasibility and efficacy of a full time mainstreaming approach for moderately handicapped students in the ALEM classrooms. Among policy implications noted is that more restrictive placement should be considered only after a full time mainstreaming approach has been tried and found ineffective. (CL)

AB  - The study examined the relationship between parents' marital satisfaction, marital stability, their perceived triangulation in the family, and childhood depression. The author reviewed the biological, developmental, behavioral and cognitive theories on childhood depression, and adopted Minuchin's open systems model and family model to explain the family dynamics of the depressed children. The Marital Adjustment Test (MAT), Marital Status Inventory (MSI), Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), and Nuclear Family Triangulation (TRI), subscale from the Personal Authority in the Family System Questionnaire, Version C, were used to measure respectively marital satisfaction, marital stability, childhood depression, and nuclear family triangulation. It was found that none of the mothers' scores were related to children's depression. Fathers' marital satisfaction and perceived triangulation were related to children's depression as hypothesized. Fathers' perceived triangulation not only was related to children's depression, but also moderated the effects of the fathers' marital stability on children's depression. Implications for marital therapy are given. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Abstract: In the context of aerospace and marine applications there are considerable incentives for designers to adopt thin shells, whose performances are enhanced by appropriately chosen rib stiffeners or using high-performance composite materials. Imperfection-sensitive buckling in these circumstances is controlled by extremely high numbers of independent material and geometric parameters. As a basis for design, traditional reliance upon scatter of test results is suggested to be untenable and the increasing tendency to replace this approach by use of nonlinear finite elements is argued to bring with it all sorts of other quite considerable practical problems. This paper describes how the long established and very simple “reduced stiffness method” (RSM) is able to provide an alternative design strategy. It shows how a very straightforward extension of classical critical load analysis allows the definition of lower bounds to the potential imperfection sensitivity in each mode and consequently the delineation of the mode and load likely to provide the controlling influence on design. Reliability of its predictions is briefly demonstrated through comparisons with extensive test programmes and confirmation through carefully controlled nonlinear numerical studies. Use of the RSM is shown to offer scope for identifying material and geometric parameters that result in improved and even “optimum” buckling loads. Case studies from past and a current programme of research looking at the buckling of composite shells are used to illustrate this design potential.

AB  - Feminist and gender mainstreaming perspectives can help expand consideration of women's health and preventive healthcare beyond maternal and reproductive care to encompass the multiple roles and life span experiences of women. Such a shift may encourage the adoption by nursing professionals of broader viewpoints that address contemporary women's health priorities and facilitate the delivery of more appropriate preventive healthcare. This article discusses the World Health Organization's gender mainstreaming and women's health policies, gender mainstreaming women's health policies in Taiwan, and the roles of nurses in women's preventive healthcare. Based on the Women's Health Policy White Paper proposed by Taiwan's Department of Health, when working with female clients, nurses should play multiple roles that include healthcare provider, information provider, educator, advocate, consultant and researcher. Strategies that may be employed to achieve these roles include: (1) Adjusting perceptions toward traditional reproduction; (2) Providing correct and sufficient medical information; (3) Considering possible adverse effects of medical interventions on women; (4) Considering the healthcare system as a probable stressor for women; (5) Considering women's medical environment and space; (6) Exploring the relationship between socio-culture and women's preventive healthcare and (7) Recruiting women as major subjects in healthcare research.

AB  - Today, China is facing a serious and fast growing challenge of a diabetes epidemic. With the largest diabetic population in the world, 9.7% of Chinese aged 20 and over have diabetes. However, diabetes care is far from satisfactory. The problem is further complicated by the widespread use of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and by disparities in insurance coverage. This dissertation intends to explore quality and utilization of diabetes care in China. A multifaceted approach is adopted in this dissertation. It uses qualitative semi-structured interviews to explore the similarities and differences between TCM and conventional therapy physicians' beliefs and behaviors in outpatient care. Nonparametric propensity score matching is used to explore the effects of TCM and insurance on quality and utilization of diabetes care among hospitalized Chinese patients. Conventional wisdom in China states that TCM is a safer and cheaper alternative of conventional therapy. The findings of this dissertation suggest the opposite. Conventional therapy physicians were reluctant to use TCM treatments in diabetes care because of safety worries. TCM was associated with higher medical costs, longer hospital stays, and no better health outcomes among hospitalized diabetes patients. These findings cast more doubts about TCM and are consistent with the questions raised by the general public and researchers in recent years. The dissertation also finds that TCM physicians and conventional therapy physicians shared similar treatment goals. However, the two groups of physicians might have different practice styles, particularly in type 2 diabetes care. TCM physicians tended to use less aggressive treatments; while conventional therapy physicians was more likely to use aggressive insulin injections alone or in combination with oral medications. The use of non-medication interventions, including education, nutrition therapy, exercise, and psychosocial interventions, seemed to be lower than expected and inconsistent with the accepted medical guidelines. This dissertation did not find significant difference between insured patients and those without insurance on quality and utilization of care. The findings suggest that actions are needed to increase the use of non-medication treatments in diabetes care and advance evidence-based TCM practice.

AB  - This dissertation consists of three essays on hospital-based healthcare delivery. The first essay examines the effect of public reporting of hospital-level surgical mortality rates on patient outcomes in the context of California's coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) report cards and the Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) population from 2004-2007. Compared to control states, I find that observed mortality rates in California improved by 12-19% after the introduction of report cards with the effect relating to quality improvement in all areas of patient care, including initial care of acute patients, surgery characteristics, and postoperative care. The second essay examines the diffusion of robotic surgery technology and its effect on patient treatment patterns. The diffusion of this technology has coincided with a rapid period of growth in surgical treatment of prostate cancer, and this has raised questions of whether technology adoption is driving overtreatment. I find that technology adoption accounts for 37-73% of increased age-adjusted surgery rates, and this is substitution away from radiation therapy. However, robotic surgery adoption explains only 12-24% of the increased total surgical volume.I show that, instead, two population trends account for most of the growth in surgery volume. The third essay examines the relationship between robotic surgery adoption and the market structure of the surgical treatment of prostate cancer. I show strong correlation between hospital robot adoption and increases in market share. Higher diffusion of robotic surgery is associated with exit of small volume providers from this procedure market and growth in the number and size of high volume providers, whose collective market share nearly doubled from 2003 to 2009. This market consolidating effect accelerated the availability of the new treatment to patients and has implications for how strategic competition may drive technology diffusion.

AB  - Abstract: Many antimicrobial peptides from amphibian exhibit additional anticancer properties due to a similar mechanism of action at both bacterial and cancer cells. We have previously reported the cDNA sequence of the antimicrobial peptide temporin-1CEa precursor cloned from the Chinese brown frog Rana chensinensis. In this study, we purified, synthesized and structurally characterized temporin-1CEa from the skin secretions of R. chensinensis. The cytotoxicity and cell selectivity of temporin-1CEa were further examined on twelve human carcinoma cell lines and on normal human umbilical vein smooth muscle cells (HUVSMCs). Our results indicated that temporin-1CEa has the amino acid sequence of FVDLKKIANIINSIF-NH2, and exhibits 50–56% identity with temporin family peptides from other frog species. The CD spectra for temporin-1CEa adopted a well-defined α-helical structure in 50% TFE/water solution. The results of MTT assay showed that temporin-1CEa exhibits cytotoxicity to all tested cancer cell lines in a concentration-dependent manner, being MCF-7 cells the most sensitive. Moreover, temporin-1CEa had lower hemolytic effect to human erythrocytes and had no significant cytotoxicity to normal HUVSMCs at concentrations showed potent antitumor activity. In summary, temporin-1CEa, an amphiphilic α-helical cationic peptide, may represent a novel anticancer agent for breast cancer therapy, considering its cancer cell selectivity and relatively lower cytotoxicity to normal cells.

AB  - Nowadays, many countries including China are experiencing aging populations. Aging has become the major risk factor for many diseases, such as neurodegenerative disease. The studies on the role of epigenetics in the aging process have grown tremendously in recent years. However, no systematic investigations have provided the information on histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) in aged brain and the roles of histone PTMs in brain aging are still unknown. In this study, the brain of senescence accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) mice model was adopted to investigate PTMs state (especially methylation patterns) of core histones (H2A, H2B, H3 and H4). Seven methylated sites (H3K24, H3K27, H3K36, H3K79, H3R128, H4K20 and H2A R89) were detected by tandem matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF MS) analysis. The methylation of H3K27 and H3K36 demonstrated a modulating relationship and methylated H3K27 might contribute to the hypermethylation state and gene repression in aged brain. Western blotting results showed that mono-methylated H4K20 decreased during SAMP8 mice aging and di-methylated H3K79 decreased in the brain of 12-month-old SAMP8 mice compared with age-matched senescence accelerated-resistant mouse (SAMR1) control. Di-methylated H3K79 could express in neuron cells of cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Whereas, the number of H3K79 methylation negative cells was higher in the cortex of 12-month old SAMP8 mice than that of age-matched control SAMR1 mice. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) result indicated homeodomain transcription factor Pbx1 isoform 1 (Pbx1), transcription factors and transcriptional regulator proteins, such as T-box isoform 20, TetR family precursor BAZ2B and ribosomal protein, were recruited to methylated H3K79 site. Therefore, a model of methylated H3K79 on gene transcriptional regulation was proposed. Furthermore, the consequences of decreased H3K79 methylation in Neuro-2a (N2a) cells were investigated via transfection with Dot1 (disruptor of telomeric silencing) siRNA. After transfection, N2a cells displayed shorter neurite and less dendrite. Proteomic change in the N2a cells provided convincing evidence for the multi-function of decreased H3K79 methylation on transcriptional regulation, protein translation and folding, stress response and DNA breaks repair, which would contribute to brain dysfunction during neurodegenerative disease or aging. This study gave a new insight into the link between histone PTMs and brain aging. It could provide the experimental evidence for future studies and help us to better understand aging or neurodegenerative disease at epigenetic level. Furthermore, it could benefit for setting up the strategies for epigenetic therapy to neurodegenerative disease. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The thesis explores the factors affecting the availability and utilization of work-life balance programs in Canadian workplaces and how employee involvement and participation programs can help employees balance their work and life. The introductory chapter provides background information on the importance of balancing work and life. It outlines chapters two, three, and four and reveals the overarching theme that unites them. Chapter Two explores how business strategy affects the availability of work-life balance programs. This chapter uses the 2003 and 2004 Canadian Workplace and Employee Survey to demonstrate that product leadership business strategy is positively related to the likelihood of adopting work-life balance programs (i.e. employee assistance programs, fitness and recreation centers). Cost leadership strategy is shown to be negatively correlated to the adoption of these programs. This study also finds that high performance work systems mediate the relationship between business strategy and employer responsiveness to work-life balance issues. Chapter Three investigates how a company's family-friendly culture affects the likelihood of an employee's use of parental leave. Using a national representative and linked employer and employee survey, this study finds that a long-hour organizational culture, which is revealed through managers' work hours, discourages new parents from taking parental leave. This study also finds that when managers work long hours, it has a greater negative effect on the probability of male employees taking parental leave than female employees. Chapter Four discusses how participation in decision making (PDM) can help employees balance the demands from work and life. Using Karasek's (1979) job demandjob control model, this study finds that PDM can reduce work-life conflict, but the reduction only works for employees who work long hours. For those employees who work short hours, PDM increases their work-life conflict. Chapter Five summarizes the empirical results. Implications for employers, labour unions, and policy makers are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Purpose - This study aimed to focus on developing a career competency model by examining the relationships among career competencies and career success from a career development viewpoint. Design/methodology/approach - This study adopted questionnaire survey to collect data from a sample of 277 respondents at 36 international tourist hotels and used the AMOS statistical software package to perform structural equation modeling (SEM) for analysis. Findings - The results showed that career competency model is a multifaceted construct comprising four competency dimensions that influence the career success of food and beverage (F&B) department employees in international tourist hotels. In particular, the competencies related to ``career adjustment and control{''} competency dimension were the most influential competencies for career success. Originality/value - The career competencies detailed in this study are a potential reference for the planning of core or general education courses in the hospitality domain. Hospitality programs can offer a ``hospitality career and employability{''} course that presents modules such as career recognition, career planning, self-management, job-seeking and mobility techniques, problem solving skills, ethics and safety in the workplace, workplace attitude, teamwork, and communication and networking skills.

AB  - Reports an error in 'Assessing the effects of oral health-related variables on quality of life in Taiwanese adults' by Tze-Fang Wang, Chyuan Chou and Yu Shu (Quality of Life Research: An International Journal of Quality of Life Aspects of Treatment, Care & Rehabilitation, 2013[May], Vol 22[4], 811-825). In the original article, the name of the third author was captured incorrectly. The corrected name of the third author is present in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2013-15003-013[/rid]). Purpose: The impact of oral health status on Taiwanese adults’ quality of life has not been measured definitively. This study evaluated the effects of oral health-related variables on quality of life among adults in Taiwan. Methods: A cross-sectional study design with secondary database analysis was adopted. Information about oral health-related variables in adults aged 18–64 years was collected from the National Health Interview Survey and quality-of-life data from the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36®). Univariate and multivariate regression analysis was used to determine risk factors for oral health and associations between oral health and eight domains of quality of life defined by the SF-36. Results: Gender (P < 0.001), marital status (P < 0.001), monthly income (P < 0.001), disease history (P < 0.001), betel nut chewing (P < 0.001), oral hygiene (P < 0.001), oral health status (P < 0.001), and dental care utilization (P = 0.001) had significant effects on general health as an aspect of quality of life; gender (P < 0.001), marital status (divorced, P < 0.001), income level (20,000–80,000 NTD, P < 0.001), disease history (P < 0.001), oral hygiene, oral health-related food choice limitations (P < 0.001), and dental care utilization (P < 0.001) had significant effects on general mental health. Subjects who practiced dental self-care with tooth brushing had significantly higher social functioning scores than those who did not (P < 0.001). Significant differences were also found in scale items for physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health, bodily pain, vitality, and role limitations due to emotional problems (all P < 0.001). Conclusions: Demographic (i.e., age, gender, and marital status and income levels) and oral health-related factors (i.e., oral hygiene, dental visits, disease history, and lifestyle factors such as cigarette smoking, alcohol use, and betel nut chewing) are all significantly associated with oral health-related quality of life in Taiwanese adults.

AB  - Herpesviruses are prevalent pathogens that establish lifelong latent and persistent infections in immunocompetent humans after an asymptomatic or self-limited primary infection. Members of this family include cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and 2 (HSV-2), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Having a worldwide distribution, these viruses persist in human host cells with minimal viral gene expression and evade host immune responses, yet still retain the capacity to reactivate and produce fully functional viral progenies to cause disease. However, beyond the manifest diseases resulting from viral reactivations that accompany decline in or suppression of cellular immunity, the long-term clinical consequences of herpesvirus infections in otherwise immunocompetent humans are not well understood. The association between CMV and cardiovascular disease has been repeatedly noted, though some studies have reported negative results. We conducted two prospective, observational cohort studies nested in the Women's Health and Aging Studies to examine the effect of baseline serum herpesvirus-specific antibody levels on incident frailty and mortality risk in immunocompetent community-dwelling older women. In the first study, we found that CMV infection is associated with incident frailty and mortality risk and that CMV antibody level is independently predictive of five-year mortality risk. In a subsequent study to assess whether such an association is specific for CMV among herpesviruses, we observed that EBV and VZV are not associated with frailty or mortality, but that HSV-1 and HSV-2 are associated with incident frailty and mortality and HSV-2 antibody level is independently predictive of five-year mortality. Because measurement errors are an inherent limitation of epidemiologic studies, particularly when it comes to the investigation of as complex a multivariate relationship as that between persistent herpesvirus infection and long-term clinical outcome, we adopted a strategy of computer-assisted data simulation to practically assess the bias that measurement errors can introduce into these types of investigations and implications for the ability to reach valid scientific conclusions. We found that measurement errors can lead to a significant underestimation of the effect of CMV infection on chronic disease and mortality risk and, in some instances, can render the effect estimates of other covariates completely misleading. We advise caution in drawing conclusions from and planning interventions based on such results. Future work should focus on better understanding the frequency of herpesvirus reactivations in immunocompetent older adults and the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying these associations, to enable a rational evaluation of whether and how to design interventions to improve outcomes in older adults related to persistent viral infections.

AB  - Objective: To compare costs and utilization for patients with diabetes enrolled in patient-centered medical home (PCMH) practices and non-PCMH practices. Design: Commercial Health Maintenance Organization members with diabetes who enrolled between 2008 and 2011 in 26 Pennsylvania-based PCMH practices that were recognized by the National Committee for Quality Assurance in 2009 were compared with similar patients in 97 non-PCMH primary care practices. A difference-indifferences longitudinal research design was used to analyze differences between both groups on per-member, per-month costs and utilization. The statistical models controlled for baseline practice and patient-level characteristics through 2-step propensity score matching. The regression analysis on program effect further controlled for within-practice variation. Sensitivity analyses were also conducted on patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes separately, and a third analysis was limited to diabetic patients enrolled in practices within Philadelphia. Results: Adoption of the PCMH reduced overall medical costs for diabetic patients by 21% in year 1. This reduction was driven largely by inpatient costs, which fell by 44%. Reductions in emergency department visits, outpatient costs, and specialist visits were also seen in subsequent years among patients enrolled in PCMH practices. Additional sensitivity analyses indicated that adoption of the PCMH model yielded similar results when analyzing patients with type 2 diabetes as well as for diabetic patients enrolled in PCMH practices located within the city of Philadelphia. Conclusions: The cost of care for patients with diabetes can be reduced by securing care at a PCMH practice. Immediate results were seen in reduction of inpatient costs, which indicate that these patients enrolled in PCMH practices were using less costly inpatient services.

AB  - Background Cancer is the leading cause of death among Asian Americans. While Asian Americans are the fastest growing minority population in the United States, they are underrepresented in cancer research and report poor adherence to cancer screening guidelines. Purpose This study utilized data from two large randomized intervention trials to evaluate strategies to recruit first-generation Chinese American immigrants from community settings and Chinese American physician practices. Findings will inform effective strategies for promoting Asian American participation in cancer control research. Methods Chinese Americans who were non-adherent to annual mammography screening guidelines (Study 1 with 664 immigrant women > 40 years of age) and to colorectal cancer screening guidelines (Study 2 with 455 immigrants > 50 years of age) were enrolled from the greater Washington DC, New York City (NYC), and Philadelphia (PA) areas. Both studies trained bilingual staff to enroll Chinese-speaking participants with the aid of linguistically appropriate fliers and brochures to obtain consent. Study 1 adopted community approaches and worked with community organizations to enroll participants. Study 2 randomly selected potential participants through 24 Chinese American primary-care physician offices, and mailed letters from physicians to enroll patients, followed by telephone calls from research staff. The success of recruitment approaches was assessed by yield rates based on number of participants approached, ineligible, and consented. Results Most participants (70%) of Study 1 were enrolled through in-person community approaches (e.g., Chinese schools, stores, health fairs, and personal networks). The final yield of specific venues differed widely (6% to 100%) due to various proportions of ineligible subjects (2%-64%) and refusals (0%-92%). The Study 2 recruitment approach (physician letter followed by telephone calls) had different outcomes in two geographic areas, partially due to differences in demographic characteristics in the DC and NYC/PA areas. The community approaches enrolled more recent immigrants and uninsured Chinese Americans than the physician and telephone call approach (p < .001). Enrollment cost is provided to inform future research studies. Limitations Our recruitment outcomes might not be generalizable to all Chinese Americans or other Asian American populations because they may vary by study protocols (e.g., length of trials), target populations (i.e., eligibility criteria), and available resources. Conclusions Use of multiple culturally relevant strategies (e.g., building trusting relationships through face-to-face enrollment, use of bilingual and bicultural staff, use of a physician letter, and employing linguistically appropriate materials) was crucial for successfully recruiting a large number of Chinese Americans in community and clinical settings. Our data demonstrate that substantial effort is required for recruitment; studies need to budget for this effort to ensure the inclusion of Asian Americans in health research.

AB  - Background. Maternal interactive behaviors theoretically affect developmental outcomes and mastery motivation in young children. However, these associations are inconsistent in the literature. Objective. The purposes of this study were: (1) to examine the differences in maternal behaviors between toddlers with motor delay (MD) and those with typical development (TD), (2) to investigate the correlation of maternal behaviors and developmental quotients (DQs) in toddlers with MD and TD, and (3) to examine the correlation of maternal behaviors and mastery motivation in toddlers with MD and TD. Design. This was a sex- and mental age–matched case-control study. Methods. Twenty-two mother-child dyads of toddlers with MD (ages 23–47 months) and 22 dyads of sex- and mental age–matched toddlers with TD (ages 15–29 months) were recruited. Maternal scores from the Nursing Child Assessment Teaching Scale, 2 indicators of motivation (persistence and mastery pleasure) from individualized mastery tasks and the Dimensions of Mastery Questionnaire, and DQs from the Comprehensive Developmental Inventory for Infants and Children were assessed. Results: Mothers of children in the MD group showed significantly lower cognitive growth fostering scores than mothers of children in the TD group. Maternal total scores were significantly correlated with whole DQs in both groups. In the MD group, maternal total scores correlated significantly with DMQ mastery pleasure but not with mastery task motivation. Limitations. The study design makes it impossible to know the causal relationships between maternal behaviors and children’s DQs and motivation. Conclusions. Mothers of toddlers with MD exhibited less adequate interactive behaviors than mothers of toddlers with TD. Because higher-quality maternal behaviors correlated with higher DQs in the MD group, clinicians should encourage parents to participate in early intervention programs and model high-quality parenting behavior to enhance parents’ and children’s outcomes.

AB  - Soil biogeochemical processes and the ecological stability of wetland ecosystems under global warming scenarios have gained increasing attention worldwide. Changes in the capacity of microorganisms to maintain stoichiometric homeostasis, or relatively stable internal concentrations of elements, may serve as an indicator of alterations to soil biogeochemical processes and their associated ecological feedbacks. In this study, an outdoor computerized microcosm was set up to simulate a warmed (+5°C) climate scenario, using novel, minute-scale temperature manipulation technology. The principle of stoichiometric homeostasis was adopted to illustrate phosphorus (P) biogeochemical cycling coupled with carbon (C) dynamics within the soil-microorganism complex. We hypothesized that enhancing the flux of P from soil to water under warming scenarios is tightly coupled with a decrease in homeostatic regulation ability in wetland ecosystems. Results indicate that experimental warming impaired the ability of stoichiometric homeostasis (H) to regulate biogeochemical processes, enhancing the ecological role of wetland soil as an ecological source for both P and C. The potential P flux from soil to water ranged from 0.11 to 34.51 mg m−2 d−1 in the control and 0.07 to 61.26 mg m−2 d−1 in the warmed treatment. The synergistic function of C-P acquisition is an important mechanism underlying C∶P stoichiometric balance for soil microorganisms under warming. For both treatment groups, strongly significant (p<0.001) relationships fitting a negative allometric power model with a fractional exponent were found between n-HC∶P (the specialized homeostatic regulation ability as a ratio of soil highly labile organic carbon to dissolved reactive phosphorus in porewater) and potential P flux. Although many factors may affect soil P dynamics, the n-HC∶P term fundamentally reflects the stoichiometric balance or interactions between the energy landscape (i.e., C) and flow of resources (e.g., N and P), and can be a useful ecological tool for assessing potential P flux in ecosystems.

AB  - The current study evaluated the effectiveness of the Bullying Literature Project on social-emotional and behavioral outcomes among elementary school students. The Bullying Literature Project is a five-session classroom-wide intervention that uses children’s literature as a springboard to promote adaptive social-cognitive process, teach social skills, and encourage bystander intervention for bullying among elementary school students. A quasi-experimental design with random assignments by classrooms was used to assess the intervention’s effects on students’ involvement in bullying/victimization, prosocial behavior, social emotional assets, and peer friendships. A sample of 168 third- and fourth-grade students from seven classrooms and their teachers participated in this study. The results indicated significant intervention effects on prosocial behavior and social emotional assets. The findings are discussed in terms of school-based interventions to foster students’ social emotional well-being. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Zhi-Zi-Da-Huang decoction (ZZDHD) has been used for treatment of alcoholic liver disease in China for thousands of years. In order to reveal the dynamic biotransformation of the decoction in vivo, a high throughout, sensitive and special method based on high performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode array detection and time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD-TOF/MS) and high performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (HPLC-QqQJMS) was developed and validated. 25 parent compounds and 28 metabolites were characterized, among which, two metabolites were found for the first time and tentatively identified by neutral-loss scan and production scan. All the compounds were assigned to iridoids, flavones, anthraquinones, coumarin or p-coumaric acid, and their biotransformation pathways were found to involve glucuronidation, sulfation, reduction and ring cleavage. Glucuronidation occurred as a major metabolic pathway of genipin and flavanone and the conjugates could be detected almost during the whole sampling duration. To compounds such as anthraquinones, coumarin and p-coumaric acid, sulfation is the only transformation pathway and the metabolites were found at 0-12, 4-18, 4-48 h respectively after administration. Reduction and/or ring cleavage of genipin glucuronide and naringin were also observed obviously. The phenomena that parts of parent compounds and metabolites were able to be detected even 48 h after administration implied that the accumulating effect of these constituents in vivo would happen and the potential toxicity of the decoction might appear if multiple dosing is adopted. The strategy used in this paper was proved helpful to offer important information for the clinical safe use of ZZDHD. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aims and objectives This study aimed to explore the experiences and factors associated with insomnia in Chinese breast cancer survivors. Background Insomnia is a common and significant symptom in breast cancer survivors. Quantitative studies are unable to describe the experience of insomnia and the sleep-associated factors from a personal point of view. A profound understanding of the experience of insomnia in breast cancer survivors can provide information for health workers and caregivers to allow them to provide more effective support. Design A descriptive qualitative research was adopted. Methods In-depth interviews were conducted with 22 insomniac breast cancer survivors. A qualitative content analysis was used to analyse the data. Results Three themes emerged concerning the experiences of insomnia, including sleep neglect, insomnia perception and insomnia anxiety. Participants reported their own opinions on three insomnia-associated factors, including factors associated with hospitalisation, factors associated with breast cancer and the therapies and too much attention placed on sleep. Conclusions Survivors would neglect their sleep problems in the early stage after diagnosis. When they became aware of their sleep problems, they were inclined to worry too much and sought help from traditional Chinese medicine. Anticipatory sleep anxiety, excessive negative cognitive activities and insomnia became a vicious circle for insomniac breast cancer survivors. Relevance to clinical practice The findings provide detailed information to help nurses understand the experiences of breast cancer survivors with insomnia. Nurses could provide proper care to help prevent insomnia or improve sleep.

AB  - Objective: The objective of this study was to examine use of a Web-based self-help intervention program, the Chinese version of My Trauma Recovery (CMTR), among Chinese traumatized individuals, and to investigate the relationship between program use and user characteristics before the intervention and change in outcomes after the intervention and at 3-months’ follow-up. Methods: The sample consisted of 56 urban survivors of different trauma types and 90 rural survivors of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, who used the CMTR in 1 month on their own or guided by volunteers in a counseling center. Predictors were demographics (sex, age, highest education, marital status, and annual family income), health problems (trauma duration, posttraumatic symptoms, and depression), psychological factors (coping self-efficacy), and social factors (social functioning impairment and social support). Program use was assessed by general program usage (eg, number of visiting days) and program adherence (eg, webpages completed in modules). Outcome measures were the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS), Symptom Checklist 90-Depression (SCL-D), Trauma Coping Self-Efficacy scale (CSE), Crisis Support Scale (CSS), and Social Functioning Impairment questionnaire (SFI) adopted from the CMTR. Results: (1) Program use: rural participants had a larger total number of visiting days (F1,144 = 40.50, P < .001) and visited more program modules in 1 month (χ²₃ = 73.67, P < .001) than urban participants. (2) Predictors and program use: total number of visiting days was correlated with CSS at pretest (r = .22, P = .009), and total number of completed webpages was associated with SFI at pretest (r = .19, P = .02). Number of webpages completed in modules was correlated with all demographic, disease severity, psychological, and social factors at pretest. (3) Program use and outcomes change: in general, use of the triggers and self-talk modules showed a consistent positive association with improvement in PDS, SCL-D, SFI, and CSE. The relaxation module was associated with positive change in PDS, but with negative change in CSS and SFI. The professional help module was associated with positive change in SCL-D, but its use on the first day was associated with negative change in CSS and CSE. The unhelpful coping module was associated with negative change in SFI. The mastery tools module showed a consistent association with negative change in PDS and SCL-D. Conclusions: These findings suggest that both individual (eg, demographic, health problems, psychological) and social factors (eg, social functioning, social support) should be considered when delivering Web-based interventions, particularly in collectivist cultures. Specific program adherence indicators (eg, webpages completed in each module, activity types completed), rather than general program usage indicators (eg, total number or time of visiting), should be developed to examine the effectiveness of various program modules or elements.

AB  - Recent studies reveal that tonal language speakers with autism have enhanced neural sensitivity to pitch changes in nonspeech stimuli but not to lexical tone contrasts in their native language. The present ERP study investigated whether the distinct pitch processing pattern for speech and nonspeech stimuli in autism was due to a speech-specific deficit in categorical perception of lexical tones. A passive oddball paradigm was adopted to examine two groups (16 in the autism group and 15 in the control group) of Chinese children's Mismatch Responses (MMRs) to equivalent pitch deviations representing within-category and between-category differences in speech and nonspeech contexts. To further examine group-level differences in the MMRs to categorical perception of speech/nonspeech stimuli or lack thereof, neural oscillatory activities at the single trial level were further calculated with the inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) measure for the theta and beta frequency bands. The MMR and ITPC data from the children with autism showed evidence for lack of categorical perception in the lexical tone condition. In view of the important role of lexical tones in acquiring a tonal language, the results point to the necessity of early intervention for the individuals with autism who show such a speech-specific categorical perception deficit.

AB  - A multiscale model of hospital infections coupling the micro model of the growth of bacteria and the macro model describing the transmission of the bacteria among patients and health care workers (HCWs) was established to investigate the effects of antibiotic treatment on the transmission of the bacteria among patients and HCWs. The model was formulated by viewing the transmission rate from infected patients to HCWs and the shedding rate of bacteria from infected patients to the environment as saturated functions of the within-host bacterial load. The equilibria and the basic reproduction number of the coupled system were studied, and the global dynamics of the disease free equilibrium and the endemic equilibrium were analyzed in detail by constructing two Lyapunov functions. Furthermore, effects of drug treatment in the within-host model on the basic reproduction number and the dynamics of the coupled model were studied by coupling a pharmacokinetics model with the within-host model. Sensitive analysis indicated that the growth rate of the bacteria, the maximum drug effect and the dosing interval are the three most sensitive parameters contributing to the basic reproduction number. Thus, adopting ``wonder{''} drugs to decrease the growth rate of the bacteria or to increase the drug's effect is the most effective measure but changing the dosage regime is also effective. A quantitative criterion of how to choose the best dosage regimen can also be obtained from numerical results. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Recent studies reveal that tonal language speakers with autism have enhanced neural sensitivity to pitch changes in nonspeech stimuli but not to lexical tone contrasts in their native language. The present ERP study investigated whether the distinct pitch processing pattern for speech and nonspeech stimuli in autism was due to a speech-specific deficit in categorical perception of lexical tones. A passive oddball paradigm was adopted to examine two groups (16 in the autism group and 15 in the control group) of Chinese children's Mismatch Responses (MMRs) to equivalent pitch deviations representing within-category and between-category differences in speech and nonspeech contexts. To further examine group-level differences in the MMRs to categorical perception of speech/nonspeech stimuli or lack thereof, neural oscillatory activities at the single trial level were further calculated with the inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) measure for the theta and beta frequency bands. The MMR and ITPC data from the children with autism showed evidence for lack of categorical perception in the lexical tone condition. In view of the important role of lexical tones in acquiring a tonal language, the results point to the necessity of early intervention for the individuals with autism who show such a speech-specific categorical perception deficit.

AB  - Background: This systematic review aimed to identify the unmet care needs and their associated variables in patients with advanced cancer and informal caregivers, alongside summarizing the tools used for needs assessment. Methods: Ten electronic databases were searched systematically from inception of each database to December 2016 to determine eligible studies. Studies that considered the unmet care needs of either adult patients with advanced cancer or informal caregivers, regardless of the study design, were included. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool was utilized for quality appraisal of the included studies. Content analysis was used to identify unmet needs, and descriptive analysis was adopted to synthesize other outcomes. Results: Fifty studies were included, and their methodological quality was generally robust. The prevalence of unmet needs varied across studies. Twelve unmet need domains were identified in patients with advanced cancer, and seven among informal caregivers. The three most commonly reported domains for patients were psychological, physical, and healthcare service and information. The most prominent unmet items of these domains were emotional support (10.1-84.4%), fatigue (18-76.3%), and `` being informed about benefits and side-effects of treatment{''} (4-66.7%). The most commonly identified unmet needs for informal caregivers were information needs, including illness and treatment information (26-100%) and care-related information (21-100%). Unmet needs of patients with advanced cancer were associated with their physical symptoms, anxiety, and quality of life. The most commonly used instruments for needs assessment among patients with advanced cancer were the Supportive Care Needs Survey (N= 8) and Problems and Needs in Palliative Care questionnaire (N = 5). The majority of the included studies investigated unmet needs from the perspectives of either patients or caregivers with a cross-sectional study design using single time-point assessments. Moreover, significant heterogeneity, including differences in study contexts, assessment methods, instruments for measurement, need classifications, and reporting methods, were identified across studies. Conclusion: Both advanced cancer patients and informal caregivers reported a wide range of context-bound unmet needs. Examining their unmet needs on the basis of viewing patients and their informal caregivers as a whole unit will be highly optimal. Unmet care needs should be comprehensively evaluated from the perspectives of all stakeholders and interpreted by using rigorously designed mixed methods research and longitudinal studies within a given context.

AB  - Objective: To explore the influence of psychological nursing towards pediatrics venous transfusion. Methods: We selected 108 children patients having venous transfusion who were admitted by Liaocheng People's Hospital from July 2017 to November 2017 and randomized control method was adopted to divide them into experimental group of 54 children and control group of 54 children. Both groups of patients received pediatrics usual care. On the basis of control group, the experimental group added mental intervention nursing towards the children patients and their family members. Comparisons were made on the treatment compliance, puncture elapsed time, puncture successful rate, re-puncture rate and parents satisfaction degree of the two groups of children patients. Results: The experimental group of children patients exceeded the control group of children patients on treatment compliance and successful rate. And the puncture elapsed time and re-puncture rate of experimental group were obviously lower than those of control group. In addition, the parents satisfaction degree of experimental group was higher than that of control group (all P<0.05). Conclusion: Psychological nursing can improve the treatment cooperation degree and help to complete successfully the transfusion treatment activities and at the same time promote the harmony of doctor-patient relationship.

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the relationships among social support, self-efficacy, and resilience in early career registered nurses. A cross-sectional study was conducted with a convenience sample of 747 early career registered nurses. Data collection was performed between August and November 2015. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Among the three factors of social support, only the impact of coworker support on nurse resilience is fully mediated by self-efficacy; friend support had a significant positive direct effect on self-efficacy and an indirect effect on nurse resilience. This would suggest the importance of administrators/managers understanding how to promote coworker support, increase self-efficacy, foster a positive work climate, and develop effective mentorship programs to improve early career registered nurses resilience and mitigate factors leading to turnover.

AB  - Purpose: Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) is an effective treatment strategy for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. However, the prognoses of patients with portal vein thrombosis, extra-hepatic metastases, or residual tumors remain poor when treated with SIRT alone. In these patients, sequential external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) may offer a chance of salvage. Here, we reported the clinical outcomes and the detailed dosimetry analysis of 22 patients treated with combination therapy. Methods: Between October 2011 and May 2015, 22 consecutive patients who underwent EBRT after yttrium-90 (90Y) SIRT were included in this study. The post-SIRT 90Y bremsstrahlung SPECT/CT of each patient was transferred to dose distribution by adopting the local deposition hypothesis. The patient-specific 3-dimensional biological effective dose distribution of combined SIRT and EBRT was generated. The overall survival and safety were evaluated. The relationship between dosimetric parameters and liver toxicity was analyzed. Results: The mean administered activity of SIRT was 1.50 GBq (range: 0.5–2.8). The mean prescribed dose of EBRT was 42.3 Gy (range: 15–63) in 14 fractions (range: 5–15) and was targeted to the residual liver tumor in 12 patients (55%), portal vein thrombosis in 11 patients (50%), and perihilar lymphadenopathies in 4 patients (18%). The overall 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival rates were 59.8%, 47.9%, and 47.9%, respectively. Overall, 8 patients (36%) developed > grade 2 liver toxicities, and the Child-Pugh score prior to EBRT strongly affected the toxicity risk. A dosimetry analysis restricted to 18 Child-Pugh A/B patients showed that the V100 (The fraction of normal liver exposed to more than 100 Gy) to V140 significance differed between patients who did or did not experience hepatotoxicity. The V110 was the strongest predictor of hepatotoxicity (18.6±11.6% vs 29.5±5.8%; P = 0.030). Conclusion: Combined therapy is feasible and safe if patients are carefully selected. Specifically, 3-dimensional dosimetry is crucial for the evaluation of efficacy and toxicity. The normal liver V100 to V140 values of the combined dose should be as low as possible to minimize the risk of liver toxicity.

AB  - Child aggression and its dire consequences cause social problems. Informed by family systems theory and parenting stress theory, this study specifically examined the mediating pathways from father engagement to child aggression through maternal parenting stress, child resistant attachment, and maternal physical abuse. We conducted a secondary data analysis on 2016 mother-child dyads from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study by building structural equation models. We found indirect effects of father engagement on child aggression through influencing mothers' parenting stress. Children's attachment and mothers' physical abuse mediated the effects of mothers' stress on child behavior-based aggression and verbal- and mood-based aggression. Interventions should target fostering fathers' engagement, alleviating mothers' parenting stress and changing mothers' abusive parenting, and improving mother-child attachment. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The present study aimed at investigating the relationship between the shape and size of ablation zone and the ablation time during radiofrequency ablation (RFA) at different tip temperatures (80, 85, 90, and 95 degrees C). A two-dimensional simulation model of liver RFA using single-electrode was first built by finite element method (FEM). A closed-loop proportional-integral (PI) controller was employed in the FEM model. The heat transfer issues were solved based on Pennes biological equation. To improve simulation accuracy of the FEM models, temperature-dependent forms of the electrical conductivity and the thermal conductivity were adopted in the model. The ablation zone was assessed by 54 degrees C isothermal contour (IT54). The ablation zone sizes obtained from the numerical simulations and ex vivo experiments were compared to evaluate the validity of the numerical model. All the four tip temperatures (80, 85, 90, and 95 degrees C) were tested using 3 ex vivo porcine livers respectively. According to numerical simulation results, the characterization functions of the ablation volume and the ablative margin (AM) were derived. The proposed curve functions could precisely characterize the shape and size of ablation zone at different preset tip values, and the statistical results showed that the prediction curves had a good consistency with simulation curves. This paper proposed the prediction models of the ablation zone in the RFA process, which could be used to achieve accurate planning of RFA needle placements and optimize patient care during temperature-controlled RFA therapy.

AB  - Simultaneous detection of multiple tumor biomarkers in body fluids could facilitate early diagnosis of lung cancer, so as to provide scientific reference for clinical treatment. This paper depicted a multi-parameter paper-based electrochemical aptasensor for simultaneous detection of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) in a clinical sample with high sensitivity and specificity. The paper-based device was fabricated through wax printing and screen-printing, which enabled functions of sample filtration and sample auto injection. Amino functional graphene (NG)-Thionin (THI)- gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and Prussian blue (PB)- poly (3,4- ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)- AuNPs nanocomposites were synthesized respectively. They were used to modify the working electrodes not only for promoting the electron transfer rate, but also for immobilization of the CEA and NSE aptamers. A label-free electrochemical method was adopted, enabling a rapid simple point-of-care testing. Experimental results showed that the proposed multi-parameter aptasensor exhibited good linearity in ranges of 0.01–500 ng mL−1 for CEA (R2 = 0.989) and 0.05–500 ng mL−1 for NSE (R2 = 0.944), respectively. The limit of detection (LOD) was 2 pg mL−1 for CEA and 10 pg mL−1 for NSE. In addition, the device was evaluated using clinical serum samples and received a good correlation with large electrochemical luminescence (ECL) equipment, which would offer a new platform for early cancer diagnostics, especially in those resource-limit areas. • The aptasensor could enable simultaneous detection of two tumor markers in a single sample with high sensitivity. • The aptasensor had a fast response time as a label-free electrochemical detection method was adopted. • The aptasensor was fabricated by wax printing and screen-printing, which could be mass-produced easily with low cost.

AB  - Over the past 3 centuries, physicians, psychotherapists, and researchers have debated the symptom constellation, etiology, and treatment of eating disorders. Even though various theoretical models of anorexia and bulimia appear in the psychological literature, most conceptualizations of eating disorders are drawn from clinical observations rather than from empirical studies. These case studies highlight problems in self-development, interpersonal relationships, coping strategies, family systems, and emotional expression in addition to blatant food and weight concerns. This dissertation applied an object relations perspective and examined individuation conflicts and relational patterns of anorexic and bulimic women. The investigator adopted a combined methodological approach, gathering quantitative and qualitative data. Specifically, this study (N = 90) (a) compared students, aerobic participants, and anorexic and bulimic patients on a demographic survey and an objective measure of object relations functioning and (b) identified common themes in relationships described by a subset of anorexic and bulimic women. A chi-square analysis found higher observed than expected frequencies of pathological scores on six of the seven Bell Object Relations Reality Testing Inventory (BORRTI) subscales for the eating-disordered group (p <.001). In addition, results from a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) displayed statistically significant differences between the eating-disordered group and the two comparison groups on six of the seven BORRTI subscales (p <.001). These empirical findings suggested that the eating-disordered group showed substantial impairment in object relations functioning compared to students and health-conscious individuals. Nine women from the eating-disordered group were interviewed about their significant relationships for the qualitative portion of the study. The following descriptive categories emerged from the data: (a) need for acceptance, (b) fea (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Research indicates that creating a psychologically safe school climate matters for adult learning in the same way it matters for children's learning. School leaders can help teachers feel safe to take risks, share differing opinions, and be vulnerable in front of peers before and during professional learning activities. An example of why psychological safety is important, and how it can be fostered, can be found in the Simple Interactions approach to professional learning. Simple Interactions, a program of the Fred Rogers Center for Early Learning and Children's Media at Saint Vincent College in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, helps educators and other adults build connections with the children and youth they serve. The major task of Simple Interactions' practice-based and theory-informed process is to capture these relationship features on video and emphasize them in professional learning. One of the ways Simple Interactions promotes psychological safety is by focusing on what teachers already do well and value, emphasizing positive developmental interactions with children, something that already resonates with most teachers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The children of parents with a mental illness (COPMI) are at increased risk for developing costly psychiatric disorders because of multiple risk factors which threaten parenting quality and thereby child development. Preventive basic care management (PBCM) is an intervention aimed at reducing risk factors and addressing the needs of COPMI-families in different domains. The intervention may lead to financial consequences in the healthcare sector and in other sectors, also known as inter-sectoral costs and benefits (ICBs). The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of PBCM from three perspectives: a narrow healthcare perspective, a social care perspective (including childcare costs) and a broad societal perspective (including all ICBs). METHODS: Effects on parenting quality (as measured by the HOME) and costs during an 18-month period were studied in in a randomized controlled trial. Families received PBCM (n = 49) or care as usual (CAU) (n = 50). For all three perspectives, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Stochastic uncertainty in the data was dealt with using non-parametric bootstraps. Sensitivity analyses included calculating ICERs excluding cost outliers, and making an adjustment for baseline cost differences. RESULTS: Parenting quality improved in the PBCM group and declined in the CAU group, and PBCM was shown to be more costly than CAU. ICERs differ from 461 Euros (healthcare perspective) to 215 Euros (social care perspective) to 175 Euros (societal perspective) per one point improvement on the HOME T-score. The results of the sensitivity analyses, based on complete cases and excluding cost outliers, support the finding that the ICER is lower when adopting a broader perspective. The subgroup analysis and the analysis with baseline adjustments resulted in higher ICERs. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first economic evaluation of family-focused preventive basic care management for COPMI in psychiatric and family services. The effects of the chosen perspective on determining the cost-effectiveness of PBCM underscore the importance of economic studies of interdepartmental policies. Future studies focusing on the cost-effectiveness of programs like PBCM in other sites and studies with more power are encouraged as this may improve the quality of information used in supporting decision making.

AB  - The passage of the Children Act 1989 in England has raised awareness of the importance of needs assessments to guide program development and ensure the effectiveness of services. Child welfare practitioners have responded to the call for needs assessment by collaborating with researchers, policy makers, and academicians to develop rigorous evaluation theories and procedures. This book outlines the results of attempts to assess the needs of children as a group and individually. The chapters present a framework for thinking about needs and review considerations for needs assessments conducted for different types of purposes. Interagency strategies for evaluating the needs of individual children also are discussed, including cases involving a mentally ill parent or the emotional and behavioral development of foster children. The final chapter identifies issues for policy and practice, such as the application of a developmental perspective for assessment and the development of a coordinated children's service system. Numerous references, 12 figures, 20 tables.

AB  - Background: Optimal diabetes management relies on providers adhering to evidence-based practice guidelines in the processes of care delivery and patients adhering to self-management recommendations to maximize patient outcomes. Purpose: To explore: (1) the degree to which providers adhere to the guidelines; (2) the extent of glycemic, lipid, and blood pressure control in patients with diabetes; and (3) the roles of organizational and patient population characteristics in affecting both provider adherence and patient outcome measures for diabetes. Design: Secondary data analysis of provider adherence and patient outcome measures from chart reviews, along with surveys of facility quality managers. Sample: We sampled 109 Veterans Affairs medical centers (VAMCs). Results: Analyses indicated that provider adherence to diabetes guidelines (ie, hemoglobin A,c, foot, eye, renal, and lipid screens) and patient outcome measures (ie, glycemic, lipid, and hypertension control plus nonsmoking status) are comparable or better in VAMCs than reported elsewhere. VAMCs with higher levels of provider adherence to diabetes guidelines had distinguishing organizational characteristics, including more frequent feedback on diabetes quality of care, designation of a guideline champion, timely implementation of quality-of-care changes, and greater acceptance of guideline applicability. VAMCs with better patient outcome measures for diabetes had more effective communication between physicians and nurses, used educational programs and Grand Rounds presentations to implement the diabetes guidelines, and had an overall patient population that was older and with a smaller percentage of black patients. Conclusions: Healthcare organizations can adopt many of the identified organizational characteristics to enhance the delivery of care in their settings.

AB  - The problem: Rehabilitation professionals recognize the need to adopt a social as well as a medical model of disability, but the full implications of a social orientation towards disability are less easily accepted. If the physical environment can both produce and alleviate disability, so also can the social environment. If disablement is not to be seen as the problem of one individual then problems in rehabilitation must be ‘owned’ not solely by a single patient but also by other people implicated in a situation. It follows that ‘patient-centred care’, where a professional directs assessments and interventions towards one person, has shortcomings in rehabilitation.Theoretical considerations: A human systems model, shifting the focus of rehabilitation towards relationships, enables rehabilitation problems to be seen as provisional and context-dependent; the relational context of problems is clarified, and the positive and negative effects of professional power are more apparent.Clinical implications: Rehabilitation practitioners using a systemic approach would no longer view ‘carers’ and other significant individuals as mere bystanders but would integrate them within rehabilitation’s ethical and therapeutic system. Professionals would more readily recognize their roles within such a system, and would be better positioned to manage their negative as well as their positive effects.

AB  - Concern has been raised recently in relation to excessive use of digital technology and the detrimental effect this has on familial relationships, well-being and development, andon people's connection with nature. This article provides a timely response to this concern by presenting the findings of a qualitative evaluation of a supported nature play programme according to the parents' perceptions. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with six participants and analysed using experiential thematic analysis. Analysis provided three major themes: enhancing interpersonal relationships; connections to nature and fostering emotional wellness. According to these participants, relational, well-being and developmental benefits continued both within and beyond the programme context. It is argued that supported nature play programmes, which include a therapy dog, have the potential to enhance interpersonal, nature and animal connections while simultaneously providing families with opportunities to strengthen their development and well-being.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Many medical trainees seek work among underserved communities but may be unprepared to cope with the challenges. Relationship-centered qualities have been shown to promote physician resilience and prevent burnout. The UCLA-PRIME program aims to prepare medical students to work among vulnerable groups and begins with a 3-week leadership course. We describe this course and share lessons with those seeking to foster leadership, advocacy, and resiliency in our future physician workforce. METHODS: Twenty students participated in our curriculum that emphasized five competencies: leadership, advocacy, teamwork, mindfulness, and self-care. Course activities complemented the students' work as they developed a community outreach project. They assessed and reflected on their leadership, relationship, and team behaviors, were coached to improve these, learned mindfulness meditation, and participated in community forums. Our evaluation assessed course quality, project completion, leadership, mindfulness, and team relational coordination. RESULTS: Students were very satisfied with all aspects of the course. They designed a medical student elective addressing the health challenges of an incarcerated and formerly incarcerated population. While we found no change in leadership practices scores, students had high team relational coordination scores and improved mindfulness scores upon course completion. DISCUSSION: Our course to develop medical students as resilient leaders, team members, and advocates for medically underserved groups consisted of a community-based service project, coupled with a facilitated relationshipcentered curriculum. It promoted qualities in students that characterize effective and resilient physician leaders; they were more mindful, related to each other effectively, and coordinated their activities well with one another.

AB  - Since the deinstitutionalization of psychiatric hospitals in the 1950s, American correctional institutions have become the primary sites for managing mental illness nationwide. Mentally ill inmates present many challenges to correctional administrators, including but not limited to the prevention of suicide, delivery of psychiatric medication, and implementation of key programming services. Moreover, each challenge must be met while ensuring the safety and security of staff, inmates, and the community. To this end, administrators use evidence-based practices that promote safe and efficient service delivery throughout detention and minimize the likelihood of re-offending after release. One of the most widely supported management strategies, known as the risk principle, assesses inmates' likelihood of recidivism and prioritizes the highest-risk inmates for the most intensive institutional programs. Unfortunately, there is very little research that has investigated the impact of risk-based correctional management strategies on mentally ill inmate populations. With data on 866 inmates incarcerated within a Massachusetts house of correction (HOC), this dissertation analyzes how measures of criminogenic risk and mental illness separately and jointly predict key institutional outcomes. Specifically, I use path analyses and logistic regressions to predict mentally ill and non-mentally ill inmates' placements into intensive programming, administrative segregation units, and a pre-release community work program. Results indicate that, in adherence with the risk principle, the highest-risk inmate groups are most likely to be placed into intensive programs. While high-risk mentally ill inmates have at least equal access to intensive programming as their non-mentally ill counterparts, they are much more likely to be administratively segregated. Yet, only criminogenic risk, and not mental illness, achieves statistical significance in the prediction of program placement and segregation. I conclude by discussing the role of mental health needs in risk-based correctional management, ways to measure and define mental illness, and the implications of the findings for correctional theory and practice.

AB  - BackgroundMassachusetts is one of a very limited number of states exclusively employing participant-direction to deliver autism waiver services to children. A crucial element of this waiver program is the work conducted by the state's Department of Developmental Services (DDS) staff and state-approved providers with waiver families to facilitate the implementation of the participant-direction model. Our study investigates the effect of the collaboration between state providers and family caregivers on family well-being. MethodsWe conducted a survey of 74 families who have been utilising waiver services for at least 6 months. Participants were asked to rate the coordination with providers as well as to report on parenting stress and impact of waiver services on family functioning. Data from in-home child and family assessments conducted by the state were also abstracted from program records. ResultsAfter controlling for a host of variables hypothesised to affect the outcomes of interest, we found that the family's view of how well they coordinated with formal providers is significantly associated all of the outcomes. Families who reported greater coordination with state providers experienced lower parenting stress and reported a more positive impact on family functioning. Child externalising behavioural problems and caregiver's health rating also contributed to parenting stress and family functioning. ConclusionsOur findings highlight the importance of establishing a collaborative partnership with waiver families in promoting family well-being. These results suggest that training and/or resources that foster team building and communication can positively impact family functioning among families with young children with autism.

AB  - Previous research supports a link between negative parent responses to emotion expression and poor emotion regulation in children. Additionally, previous research has demonstrated a link between child internalizing and externalizing behaviors and parent negative responses to child emotion as well as poor child emotion regulation. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether child emotion regulation mediates the relation between mothers' negative response to child emotion expression and child internalizing and externalizing behaviors, a relation not yet examined in prior studies. Two hundred and eight 1st graders (53% female) were followed longitudinally through 2nd grade. During children's first grade year mothers (81.6% Caucasian, 14% Native American, and 4.4% Other) completed the Coping with Child Negative Emotion Scale (CCNES). During children's 2 nd grade year they were interviewed at their school using the Child Emotion Management Scale (CEMS) -- Anger and Worry, their mothers completed the CEMS and Child Behavior Questionnaire (CBQ), and teachers and mothers completed the Behavior Assessment System for Children, Second Edition (BASC-II). As hypothesized child emotion regulation (parent but not child report) was found to mediate the relation between mothers' negative response to their children's emotions and both child internalizing and externalizing behaviors (mother but not teacher report). Specifically, poor child anger coping and worry coping were found to mediate the relation between maternal punishing of emotions and child internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Child anger dysregulation and effortful control mediated the relation between maternal punishing and child externalizing. Child worry dysregulation and poor anger coping mediated the relation between parent distress response to child emotions and child internalizing. Based on these findings, promoting positive parent response to child emotions and fostering child emotion regulation abilities in prevention and intervention programs may be important in reducing likelihood of child internalizing and externalizing behavior problems.

AB  - Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the impact of a pilot screening program for rheumatic heart disease (RHD) on patient quality of life (QOL) and health services. Methods: A QOL questionnaire (CHQ-PF28) was used to assess the impact of RHD screening on children with a potentially abnormal screening echocardiogram and matched normal controls. The health service response to a potentially abnormal screening echocardiogram and the impact of the screening program on health services was evaluated using medical record review, carer interviews and surveys of health-care providers. Results: QOL was assessed in 68 children. Potentially abnormal screening echocardiograms were associated with poorer QOL in the General Health Perception (P < 0.05) and Parental Impact -Emotional (P < 0.05) domains. Health services contacted 82% of children with potentially abnormal echocardiograms, and clinical review occurred in 56%. A potentially abnormal echocardiogram was associated with a change in management in 6% (2/34) of children. When surveyed, 49% of health providers were aware of the RHD screening program, 29% had seen children referred with screening abnormalities and 85% of these providers stated this had an impact on local health-care delivery. Conclusions: This pilot RHD screening program was associated with poorer child and carer QOL for those with potentially abnormal results, greater health provider workload and suboptimal clinical follow-up. The adoption of screening for RHD in high-risk populations should be approached cautiously. Further research is required to facilitate and validate improved echocardiographic diagnostic criteria for RHD and the systematic assessment of the benefits and adverse effects of such screening.

AB  - Abstract: Objective: to gain an in-depth understanding of the parenting experiences of bereaved parents in the years following an infant death. Design: an exploratory qualitative study. Setting: semi-structured interview in the participants’ homes. Data were collected over a five-month period in 2008 and analysed using thematic analysis. Participants: a purposive sample of 13 bereaved parents (10 mothers and three fathers) was used. Parents who had accessed the support services offered by two bereavement support agencies were recruited. Participants were asked to describe their experiences of raising their subsequent child. Interviews were conducted when the next born child was at least three years of age. Findings: the parents described a ‘paradoxical’ parenting style where they were trying to parent using two diametrically opposed unsustainable options. For example, they described trying to hold their subsequent child emotionally close but aloof at the same time. Key conclusions and implications for practice: the results from this study indicate that the impact of a loss of an infant has far-reaching consequences on subsequent parenting. Support and early intervention at the time of the stillbirth and subsequent pregnancy are likely to be useful. However, further research is required to determine the extent to which early intervention can alter the tendency towards bereaved parents adopting a paradoxical parenting style. The impact of this style on mental health and the emotional health and well-being of the next born child/ren after perinatal loss should also be further examined.

AB  - Assertiveness can be defined as an interpersonal behaviour that promotes the fact all people in a relationship are equally important. All health professionals including midwives must work with and care for people. At times this will include facilitating interactions that require skilful negotiation and assertiveness. Yet embedding assertiveness education into undergraduate midwifery curricula has not been widely adopted. This paper explores one method of delivering assertiveness training in an undergraduate midwifery course and provides comment on the effectiveness of this strategy in developing assertiveness skills in a cohort of undergraduate midwifery students. We used an assertiveness survey which was administered immediately before and 3-4 months after an assertiveness training workshop. All students (n = 55) attending the training day were invited to participate. Of these 41(77% response) chose to participate in the pre intervention survey and 32 participated (9 students lost to follow-up) in the follow up survey. There was an overall improvement in self-perceived assertiveness scores following the assertiveness training workshop. These findings provide encouraging evidence that educational institutions that offer specific and targeted assertiveness education will be rewarded with more assertive graduates.

AB  - This study examines the socio-emotional and cognitive impact of a three-month literacy centered humane education program on one second-grade classroom of socio-culturally and linguistically diverse children using a qualitative research design. Twenty-five children, ages 7-8 years, participated in a humane education program that focused on developing descriptive profiles for shelter animals (e.g., dogs, cats) awaiting adoption at their community's local animal shelter located in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States of America. The children worked together with the teacher researcher to generate and publish a descriptive paragraph to advertise the adoption of one "difficult to place" dog or cat each week. The children's work was published weekly on the animal shelter's website. The data collection procedures were embedded in the classroom's weekly literacy instruction and occurred within the general education classroom. This study revealed three primary findings. First, the children with pets considered their pets to be family members. Analysis of the children's perspectives on pet topics within their family systems revealed the role of non-human animals as social agents within some children's moral socialization. Second, the children who participated in the twelve-week humane education program exercised empathetic capacity building. This was evidenced through their individual and collective responses to the focal shelter animals over time. Lastly, an examination of the processes by which the children related to the shelter animal topic illuminated a socially distributed account of empathetic development.

AB  - Emergency department (ED) crowding adversely affects patient care and outcomes. Despite national recommendations to address crowding, it persists in most US EDs today. Using nationally representative data, we evaluated the use of interventions to address crowding in US hospitals in the period 2007-10. We examined the relationship between crowding within an ED itself, measured as longer ED lengths-of-stay, and the number of interventions adopted. In our study period the average number of interventions adopted increased from 5.2 to 6.6, and seven of the seventeen studied interventions saw a significant increase in adoption. In general, more crowded EDs adopted greater numbers of interventions than less crowded EDs. However, in the most crowded quartile of EDs, a large proportion had not adopted effective interventions: 19 percent did not use bedside registration, and 94 percent did not use surgical schedule smoothing. Thus, while adoption of strategies to reduce ED crowding is increasing, many of the nation's most crowded EDs have not adopted proven interventions.

AB  - Uncertain future availability of water is one of the most critical current issues, and outdoor water use contributes substantially to the strain on water resources. Much of the nation's outdoor water use is through urban landscape irrigation, and one solution for conservation of this limited resource is to change home landscape irrigation practices. Thus, households that use landscape irrigation are an important audience for Florida extension programs. Complex, statewide water conservation programs are difficult to evaluate because of program variability and limited resources, yet evaluation is an important task that reveals the success, or failure, of a program. This study compared factors between people who have or have not engaged in Florida extension programs. The targeting outcomes of programs model and theory of planned behavior were used as a basis for measuring different levels of possible outcomes. There were no differences in attitudes toward good irrigation practices and perceived ability to adopt them between extension participants and nonparticipants. There were differences between the two groups in perceived normative attitudes, intent to adopt good irrigation practices, and actual engagement in landscape water conservation practices. Findings demonstrate a relationship exists between these characteristics and engagement with extension. The greatest differences were stronger social norms and more engagement in complex conservation behaviors among people who had attended extension programs. It is not known how much externalities play a role in leading certain people to seek out extension education. Extension professionals should use the findings of this study to target nonparticipants and deliver more impactful programs.

AB  - Mental health assessment in child guidance clinics (CGCs) plays a key role in formulating diagnoses, planning treatment, and monitoring change in youth with psychiatric disorders. This information can aid in the improvement of service systems by identifying common problems and widely used services at the local, state, and national levels. The major emphasis on introducing evidence-based treatments (EBTs) to practice assumes the use of reliable and valid measures of child problems. Given the ever growing number of assessment tools, evaluating their efficiency may be helpful for researchers, clinicians, and policymakers. This project evaluated several symptom scales used in the initial assessment in an urban CGC. Using intake data collected from the primary caretakers of 211 youth seeking services, we considered the diagnostic efficiency of the symptom scales as compared to diagnoses on the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children, Version IV (DISC-IV). First, we compared three broad measures of psychopathology: the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), the Ohio Scales, and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Second, we considered the advantages of adding the following disorder-specific scales to the assessment: the Screen for Child Anxiety and Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED), the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ), and the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham-Revised (SNAP-IV). To provide a summary of efficiency across multiple indicators (including Kappa, Sensitivity, Specificity, Likelihood Ratio for a positive test (LR+), Area Under the Curve (AUC), Diagnostic Odds Ratio (DOR), and incremental validity), we adopted a scorecard methodology. When only broad measures were considered, the optimal assessment consisted of the Ohio Scales to assess general mental health services need. Using the severity and functioning scales resulted in sensitivity 85%, specificity 61%, for any diagnosis on the DISC-IV. When disorder-specific scales were added, the optimal assessment consisted of the Ohio Scales for total problems and disorder-specific scales for key areas. For example, to detect internalizing disorders, the SCARED resulted in a sensitivity of 72% and specificity of 81%. Results from this project may be used to help optimize assessment practices within CGCs and to determine the best possible methods for obtaining accurate diagnostic data in a timely and cost-efficient manner.

AB  - Mental health care services are becoming increasingly re-organized under what generally has become known as managed care. This study examined psychodynamic psychotherapists' experience of the impact of managed care on their conduct of long-term psychotherapy in an independent practice setting. An existential-phenomenological approach, which incorporated some concepts from Bourdieu's reflexive sociology, was used to investigate the experience of these psychotherapists. The purpose of this study was to describe the life-world of these psychotherapists and how their professional practice was affected by specific practices of managed care review. This inquiry aimed to articulate the needs and interests of psychotherapists and to demonstrate the relevance of this method of inquiry to decision-makers in the mental health system. Empirical phenomenology guided the selection of research participants and data analytic procedures. Ten self-identified psychodynamic psychotherapists, five from Tennessee and five from Massachusetts, participated in this study. All participated in an open-ended interview about their experiences with managed care. Phenomenological thematic and hermeneutic narrative procedures were used to analyze these interviews. Each participant discussed general situations related to the impact of managed care and specific transactions with managed care reviewers. Each interview was divided into a series of these situations/transactions. The analysis of interviews produced four themes describing the experience of managed care: autonomy, change in therapeutic relationship, change in self, and ethical/moral stance. Dynamic interactions of experiential themes were presented for each of the situations/transactions discussed by all ten participants. Results were discussed with reference to common experiences and concerns of the participants and to the differing strategies they adopted in response to managed care. The diversity of results leads to a reconsideration (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Although the female condom has been introduced into over 90 countries since 1997, it has only been accepted in sexual and reproductive health programmes as a mainstream method in a few. This paper describes introductory strategies developed by Ministries of Health and non-governmental organisations in Brazil, Ghana, Zimbabwe and South Africa, supported by UNAIDS, and the manufacturers of the female condom, which have significantly expanded the number of female condoms being used. These projects have several key similarities: a focus on training for providers and peer educators, face-to-face communication with potential users to equip them with information and skills, an identified target audience, a consistent supply, a long assessment period to gauge actual use beyond the initial novelty phase, and a mix of public and private sector distribution. Female condom programmes require the sanction, leadership and funding of governments and donors. However, the non-governmental and private sectors have also played a major role in programme implementation. To ensure successful introduction of the female condom, it is crucial to involve a range of decision-makers, programme managers, service providers, community leaders and women's and youth groups. The rising cost of inaction and unprotected sex in the spread of HIV and AIDS force us to recognise the high cost of not providing female condoms alongside male condoms in family planning and AIDS prevention programmes. Le préservatif féminin a été introduit dans plus de 90 pays depuis 1997, mais rares sont ceux où il a été accepté comme méthode primaire dans les programmes de santé génésique. Cet article décrit les stratégies d'introduction préparées par les ministères de la santé et des ONG au Brésil, au Ghana, au Zimbabwe et en Afrique du Sud, avec le soutien de l'ONUSIDA, et les fabricants de préservatifs féminins, qui ont nettement accru l'utilisation de ces préservatifs. Les projets ont plusieurs similitudes: une priorité à la formation des prestataires et des éducateurs pairs, une communication personnelle avec les utilisatrices potentielles pour les informer et les former, un public cible identifié, un approvisionnement régulier, une longue période d'évaluation pour estimer l'utilisation réelle après la nouveauté du début, et une distribution partagée entre secteur privé et public. Ces projets exigent l'approbation, l'impulsion et le financement des gouvernements et des donateurs, mais les ONG et le secteur privé ont également joué un rôle majeur dans leur réalisation. Pour une introduction réussie, il faut associer différents décideurs, gestionnaires de programmes, prestataires de services, chefs communautaires et groupes de femmes et de jeunes. Le coût croissant de l'inaction et de relations sexuelles non protégées dans la transmission du VIH nous force à reconnaı̂tre qu'il serait onéreux de ne pas fournir des préservatifs féminins parallèlement aux préservatifs masculins dans les programmes de planification familiale et de prévention du SIDA. El condón femenino ha sido introducido en más de 90 paı́ses desde 1997, pero en la mayorı́a de ellos no ha sido aceptado como un método corriente en los programas de salud sexual y reproductiva. Este artı́culo describe las estrategias para la introducción del condón femenino desarrolladas por los Ministerios de Salud y organizaciones no gubernamentales en Brasil, Ghana, Zimbabwe y Sudáfrica, con el apoyo de UNAIDS y los fabricantes del condón femenino, las cuales han aumentado significativamente el número de condones femeninos en uso. Dichos proyectos comparten varios aspectos claves: un enfoque en la capacitación de los proveedores de servicios y los educadores de pares, comunicación directa con los usuarios potenciales, grupos destinatarios identificados, abastecimiento constante, un perı́odo largo para medir el uso más allá de la fase inicial, y distribución mixta entre los sectores públicos y privados. Estos programas requieren la sanción, liderazgo y financiamiento de gobiernos y donantes. Los sectores no-gubernamentales y privados también han jugado un papel importante en la implementación de los programas. Para asegurar la introducción exitosa del condón femenino, es preciso involucrar una gama de personas responsables de adoptar decisiones, administradores de programas, prestadores de servicios, dirigentes comunitarios, y grupos de mujeres y jóvenes. Las consecuencias de la inacción y el sexo no protegido exigen que reconozcamos el alto costo de no proveer el condón femenino junto con el condón masculino en los programas de planificación familiar y prevención del SIDA.

AB  - The non-cognitive factors (NCFs) endorsed by Sedlacek (2004) appear to align with the core values of rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT). This article explores theoretical and empirical evidence that suggests REBT fosters the development of NCFs. School counselors can promote non-cognitive development by embedding REBT throughout direct and indirect student services. REBT-based strategies and interventions can aid school counselors in their efforts to close the achievement gap and foster college and career readiness among students, especially those from historically underrepresented populations. Recommendations for school counseling practice are provided.

AB  - Much workplace diversity and inclusion research focuses on organizational policies and practices that can foster fair treatment for members of marginalized groups. A top-down approach, however, can provoke backlash or be perceived as hollow political correctness by privileged group members. In contrast, the pursuit of bottom-up and side-ways approaches, namely, starting with privileged group individuals (albeit few) who already support marginalized groups and inspire others all around them to do the same, might augment and expand the repertoire of existing pathways to increasing workplace inclusiveness. However, little is known about how members of privileged groups (e.g., White, heterosexual, or cis-gender male) proactively, authentically, and effectively serve as allies on a day-to-day basis. The purpose of this dissertation was to understand how strong allies tap into their existing virtues and values and engage in positive relational behaviors to best serve their marginalized counterparts. In this dissertation, I introduce a new construct, exemplary allyship, and explore how it develops and how it differs from positive yet normative forms of collegial behaviors. Study 1 used life/career story interviews of exemplary allies (i.e., dominant group members who show extraordinary commitment to allyship in the workplace; n = 25) to (1) identify the virtues that motivate exemplary allyship, (2) understand the interpersonal support given and received by exemplary allies, (3) map the developmental trajectory of exemplary allyship, and (4) capture the benefits of exemplary allyship to the allies themselves. Findings revealed that different types of virtues (e.g., intellectual humility) motivate and activate specific processes of exemplary allies (e.g., intellectual understanding of allyship) at specific developmental stages (e.g., intermediary developmental stages). Further, exemplary allies provide various types of interpersonal allyship support (e.g., mediating between dominant group colleagues and marginalized group colleagues) and also receive interpersonal support (e.g., from 'reflection partners') in order to be successful. Investing in such authentic allyship is experienced as personally enriching and linked to growth and work-family enrichment. Thus, this study offers a nuanced understanding of the functions that virtues play in enabling exemplary allyship action and rendering such behaviors effective. To test and extend some of these findings, Study 2 used a multi-source and multi-method design and examined men's allyship toward women in male-dominated disciplines (e.g., STEM) in elite academic institutions. Specifically, it investigated through women's other-reports (n = 184) and men's self-reports the extent to which exemplary male allies (n = 51) differ from comparison typical male faculty ( n = 109) on hypothesized virtues and allyship-relevant relational behaviors. Further, using data from 101 men-women colleague pairs, it tested links between men's behaviors and women's perceptions on outcomes for women (e.g., inclusion, vitality) and men (e.g., personal growth, work-family enrichment). Results revealed that as hypothesized, men's behaviors and women's perceptions each predicted their own outcomes, however, contrary to hypotheses, women did not perceive men in the same way as men perceived themselves, and this negatively impacted women's outcomes. Using polynomial regression and response surface analyses (n = 101 pairs), I tested the differential impacts of (in)congruence between men's behaviors and women's perceptions on women's sense of inclusion and vitality. Results revealed that when women perceived men as more virtuous and relationally adept than men reported themselves, it positively predicted women's outcomes.

AB  - An evaluation of mindfulness-based childbirth and parenting courses for pregnant women and prospective fathers/partners within the UK NHS (MBCP-4-NHS). Objective : To explore the usefulness within the National Health Service (NHS) of a brief (four week, ten hour) course based upon the Mindfulness Based Childbirth and Parenting (MBCP) programme ( Duncan and Bardacke, 2010 ) described here as MBCP-4-NHS. Background : The National Maternity Review (2016) and report of The Independent Mental Health Taskforce to the NHS (2016a, 2016b ) in England highlight the need for significant investment into perinatal mental health services, with the Government pledging funding to improve such services through a range of measures. Whilst the field of mindfulness during the perinatal period is in need of well controlled trials and studies exploring the mechanisms of action ( Hall et al., 2016 ) the limited research to date supports the potential for mindfulness based interventions in pregnancy and the need for further scientific study in this area (Dhillon et al., 2017; Shi and Macbeth, 2017). Particularly because it may broaden women's repertoire of coping strategies with the potential to improve the developmental trajectory of both parents and infants ( Dunn et al., 2012 ; Duncan and Bardacke, 2010 ; Vieten and Astin, 2008 ). However, most of the studies to date have involved lengthy courses of around 8–9 weeks (24 h) duration, which may not be feasible or economical within a UK NHS setting and therefore, would be unlikely to be adopted as routine practice. Design : An initial pilot study to discover if MBCP-4-NHS is acceptable and feasible within NHS maternity services, comparing maternal and paternal pre and post intervention self-report measures of mental health to begin to explore the effectiveness of this intervention. Setting : NHS antenatal education classes held in children's centres for expectant parents across Oxfordshire. Participants : All expectant parents receiving Oxfordshire maternity services between October 2014 and January 2015 were invited to self-refer into the intervention, of which 155 individuals (86 women and 69 men) took part. Intervention : ‘MBCP-4-NHS’ – A brief (four week, ten hour) course developed from the nine week Mindfulness Based Childbirth and Parenting (MBCP) intervention. Measures : Self-report measures of mental health including low mood/depression, mindfulness, stress, anxiety, pregnancy related distress and experiences. Findings : The results showed a significant increase in both maternal and paternal mental health with women demonstrating a significant improvement in symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression, pregnancy-related distress, labour worry and positive and negative pregnancy experiences; and men improving significantly in symptoms of anxiety, depression and showing a trend for improvement in self-reported symptoms of perceived stress. Conclusions : This is a promising antenatal intervention that can be feasibly implemented within NHS which might have the potential to impact upon parental mental health and, therefore, possibly also the health of next generation. However, caution is needed interpreting these findings given that this study did not include an active control group. Implications for practice : This research provides a clear rationale and justification for a large randomised control trial of this intervention within the NHS, which should include a more diverse population, across multiple centres and should explore both the potential health benefits for parents and infants/children as well as potential economic costs/benefits.

AB  - Whether or not to reunite children in out-of-home care with their families of origin is one of the more complicated decisions that child welfare practitioners and administrators face. Ways in which agencies can assess and improve their service delivery system so as to reunite children and their families effectively and promptly are covered in this guide. It contains information that professionals can use to assess their agency's policies, programs, practices, resources, and relationships with other parts of the service delivery system. The guide is divided into seven parts. An overview of family reunification is covered in part 1 and includes a set of principles or beliefs about practice and policy. Part 2 contains step-by-step instructions, materials, and helpful tips for carrying out family reunification. Part 3 provides a framework for assessing strengths and needs and contains family reunification system components. Numerous resources are also provided. Part 4 consists of an annotated bibliography; part 5 offers selected guidelines and forms to help conduct self-assessment; part 6 contains a selected bibliography on family reunification after foster care; and part 7 reproduces the forms needed to complete the family reunification project.

AB  - Discusses what works in parent–child visiting programs. The author addresses conditions that promote positive visiting and cost-effectiveness. It is concluded that agencies should offer quality visiting services that promote a child's timely return home or make possible a conclusion that the child cannot return to full-time care in the family. The author argues that it is essential that agencies, staff, and foster parents be trained to enable families to use visiting as a laboratory in which children and their parents can learn to be together again.

AB  - In this commentary, the author highlights adoption related themes as they appear in Dr. Henry Kronengold’s clinical material, featured in this issue (see record [rid]2010-20263-002[/rid]). Multiple losses, experiences of exclusion, failed searches, trickery and obstacles to knowledge abound, with attendant painful frustrations and compensatory family romance fantasies emerging. An unacknowledged enactment is hypothesized as a precipitant of the abrupt ending of the treatment. Questions are raised as to the mutative factors, goals, and criteria for termination in child therapy. It is suggested that treatment effectiveness lies in the therapist’s ability to become immersed in the unfolding process, be the recipient of unformulated aspects of the patient’s experience, and appreciate and participate in the co-construction of an increasingly coherent narrative. The incomplete aspects of the work are noted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: We evaluated emotional distress, coping strategy use, caregiver adjustment, and the relationship among these variables in family members (FMs) of patients hospitalized in a neuroscience intensive care unit (NSICU). Methods: Fifty-one primary relatives of NSICU patients were administered the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) and an abbreviated version of the COPE within 2 days of admission to the NSICU, just prior to patient discharge from the unit, and approximately 30 days after patient discharge (follow-up). FMs' adjustment to the role of caregiver was also evaluated at follow-up with the Caregiver Appraisal Scale (CAS). Results: BSI emotional distress levels were higher than those of the nonpatient normative sample at patient admission, but, except for anxiety, were within a standard deviation of the mean of the said group; with the exception of anxiety they declined to below nonpatient normative levels at follow-up. Females' distress levels were higher than those of males'. FMs' use of both problem-focused and emotion-focused coping strategies increased from admission through follow-up. Emotional distress was unrelated to problem-focused coping but was associated with emotion-focused coping at admission and discharge, with use of denial as a coping strategy primarily accounting for this relationship. Extent of use of both problem-focused and emotion-focused coping at admission was associated with better caregiver adjustment at follow-up, but over time only increases in problem-focused coping were associated with better subsequent caregiver adjustment. Conclusions: Findings suggest that interventions fostering increased use of problem-focused coping and sense of control will be effective in lowering FM distress level and enhancing subsequent adjustment in the role of caregiver.

AB  - "CHOICES" Florida's version of ObamaCare was a unique case voted in by the public in Alachua County Florida. A mixed methods research design was utilized and provided context in which policy entrepreneurs operated, as well as an explanatory model of internal determinants. Social, economic and political factors were examined to determine the predictor variable in the adoption of the "CHOICES" health services program. The results revealed that voters 51 years of age and older had a greater probability of voting for the Alachua Referendum. "CHOICES" legality has not been under contention but its effectiveness has. This study found that "CHOICES" has been effective at providing comprehensive primary preventative care in a disjointed incremental system of healthcare by purposefully collaborating with all stakeholders involved. A model for purposeful collaboration is presented and is titled the policy adoption wheel of collaboration. Copies of dissertations may be obtained by addressing your request to ProQuest, 789 E.

AB  - This curriculum guide is the first step in a total home and family life curriculum revision in the state of Washington aimed at helping students solve problems and study issues that have an impact on home and family life. The guide contains two model, nonsequential, comprehensive courses that may be adopted or adapted by school districts. The guide has three major sections. The first section, "Getting Started," has eight topics and seven lessons designed to prepare students at all levels to make decisions, solve problems, assume leadership roles, and achieve goals individually and in groups. The second section, "Personal Choices," examines seven issues of concern to younger students (grades 5-9): self-esteem, getting along at home and with others, handling change, managing money, improving health, and planning the future. The third section, "Management of Home and Work," designed for high school students, focuses on their future lives. Its seven issues and related topics cover healthy and balanced lives, relationships, community service, stress management, preparing for the future, parenting, and coping with crisis. Each lesson issue includes topic, suggested objective, leadership skills, evaluation techniques, resources, activities, and handout/transparency materials. The guide also contains an 18-item thinking skills bibliography, a lesson plan model, and a list of the curriculum team members and contributors. (KC)

AB  - Physical and occupational therapy (PT and OT) services for children with disabilities have shifted from a medical model to a family-centered model. Underlying this change are the assumptions that the family is the most critical component in promoting a child's development, and that PT and OT services should support parents' goals and needs to be most beneficial. The purpose of this study was to examine adoptive mothers' perceptions of the effect of PT and OT services on one aspect of parenting caregiving competency. A qualitative methodology was chosen, using semistructured interviews with mothers and therapists. Results suggest that while traditional therapeutic activities such as the provision of adaptive equipment and exercise programs are important, the mother-therapist relationship and effective communication are essential components in fostering perceived confidence and competence of family members.

AB  - This study examined indicators of psychological adjustment and overall development of children who had been maltreated and placed in foster care. Contextual indicators were also considered, such as the current caregivers' parenting styles, the marital relationship, family support, the neighborhood environment, and maternal education level. A unique aspect of this study was that all of the children in this sample were maltreated and removed from their initial caregivers by eighteen months of age, which provided the opportunity to explore the results of maltreatment and separation in infancy. The LONGSCAN consortium collected the data; the National Data Archive on Child Abuse and Neglect (NDACAN) distributed the dataset. Three hundred and twenty-seven children and their primary caregivers at four years of age participated in the study. Approximately one-third of the children (34.3%) had been reunited with their biological parents at the time of the data collection; the remaining children were living with either kin (17.7%) or non-kin (23.9%) foster parents or had been adopted by kin (6.1%) or non-kin (15.6%). The child outcome measures were the CBCL Total Problem Score (psychological adjustment) and the Battelle Total Score (overall developmental level). Maltreatment information (type of maltreatment, as well as duration, frequency, and severity of maltreatment) was obtained from court records. Family factors and individual child characteristics were included in structural equation models to determine their impact on child outcome. Preliminary analyses indicated that maltreatment variables as measured and type of placement were not significantly related to child outcome. Family support and aspects of the marital relationship, as well as the child's cognitive ability, directly impacted child outcome. Parenting styles neither significantly impacted psychological adjustment nor mediated the influence of family factors on child outcome. Family factors also significantly influenced child outcome. Limitations included the lack of a comparison group and availability of little information about the participants' early history besides maltreatment information. Implications included the importance of education for kin and non-kin foster parents. In addition, early intervention to end maltreatment may be effective in improving child outcome, despite early attachment disruptions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Title V of the Older Americans Act, the Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP), is a 40+-year-old federal program providing subsidized community service and employment training to low-income, unemployed individuals aged 55 and older. It is the only nationally mandated workforce training program for seniors. Because of SCSEP's dual mission, participants added 48 million hours of community service (valued at almost $1 billion) to the U.S. economy in 2008. Almost half (48.9%) of the participants are racial or ethnic minorities, which makes it crucial to understand the program experience of these individuals. Participation, program duration, and employment placement of minorities are examined. Findings show successful enrollment rates, an interactive effect of age and education on program duration, and no indication of a minority disadvantage in employment placement. Recommendations include funding for innovative grants, leveraging of federal partnerships, and targeted technical assistance. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - In the context of a pilot project to implement program-wide change by integrating academic and behavioral supports through an early childhood multi-tiered system of support, one program was challenged to strengthen two process components of its model: 1) the implementation of an evidence-informed approach to shared reading as recommended in their newly adopted curriculum and 2) the provision of effective professional development (PD) in support of practice implementation. The embedded case study describes the impact of a PD model on two teachers' attempts to integrate dialogic reading (Lonigan & Whitehurst, 1998) and related strategies in a whole class setting through a guided interactive shared reading (GISR) routine in each of their classrooms. The PD components included a combination of training, video observation, self-reflection and distance coaching. These components align with recommendations in the literature to: avoid a training only model; maintain a balance between knowledge and practice (Zaslow, Tout, Halle & Starr (2011); and use a relationship based approach to early childhood professional development (Howes, Hamre & Pianta, 2012). The question investigated in this study was: How did the PD effort shape teachers' participation in GISR; and subsequently, how did the effort shape children's participation? I utilize Rogoff's (2003) transformation of participation perspective grounded in sociocultural theory to analyze the changing participation of teachers and children in the GISR sessions, and the changing dynamic of their interactions across the intervention period. Findings suggest the PD model influenced teacher's implementation of GISR with regard to their prompt use and group engagement strategies. Subsequently, the amount and sophistication of children's story related talk changed and the children demonstrated higher levels of engagement.

AB  - Understanding the mechanisms that trigger behaviour change to overcome risky hygiene is critical to improving family health. Research in an integrated health promotion programme in 382 Community Health Clubs (CHCs) in three districts of Zimbabwe showed clearly the value members attached to gaining `knowledge', which was their strongest motivation for joining CHCs. In these rural areas, where only 38% had completed primary school, randomly sampled CHCs ranked the `Need for Knowledge' second highest after `Safety'. A survey of 880 CHC members showed that an average of 80% of CHC members who had `full knowledge of diarrhoea', also practised ten recommended hygiene practices (P > 0.001), compared to 17% who had `some knowledge', and 6% who had safe hygiene, but `no knowledge'. In the control group only 50% with `full knowledge' of diarrhoea, also practised safe hygiene, 30% fewer than the CHCs. Therefore, thorough training is needed to ensure a critical mass have `full knowledge'. This justifies the CHC Model with 24 weekly sessions reinforcing key messages over a six month period. Positive peer pressure through shared knowledge, understanding and experience, combines to change group values ensuring that even uninformed individuals adopt safe hygiene practices through the adoption of a `Culture of Health'.

AB  - Asynchronous online credit recovery programs have been implemented in public schools across the United States for a variety of reasons. In this case, African American female students who are deficient in course credits towards high school graduation have taken advantage of this relatively new e-programming mechanism as a means to capture course credits that were lost during the course of a student's high school career. Female enrollees in the asynchronous credit recovery program are lacking in course credits due to course failure for reasons such as truancy, excessive absences, maternity, incarceration, employment, health associated and domestic related demands outside of school. Beyond the aforementioned, the school climate in terms of organization, discipline, safety, and supportive relationships plays a significant role towards student success or failure. Because African American females are positioned at the bottom of the ethno-gender stratum, concentration on African American females is vital to ensuring academic success in addition to their well being. The purpose of this qualitative study is to investigate and ultimately understand the perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors of a group of African American female graduates while enrolled in an asynchronous credit recovery program. The study was guided by the following research questions: How does enrollment in an asynchronous credit recovery program affect non-traditional African American female's perceptions of education? How does enrollment in an asynchronous credit recovery program affect the lives of non-traditional African American female student participants? What are the factors that contribute to the success of the non-traditional African American female student participants? Data were collected through semi-structured interviews, intense site immersion and observation, and thorough review of school district and student records. At the culmination of the data collection process, data analysis was conducted using the constant comparison method. Results from the data analysis revealed a reinvigorated perception of education as well as a reversal of lowered expectations, behaviors, standards, and attitudes while enrolled in the asynchronous credit recovery program. Enrollment in the asynchronous credit recovery program assuredly fostered academic success and strengthened the independent nature and identity formation of the African American female participants. Several of the implications for practice are: strengthening adult/student relationships; culturally relevant professional development exercises; consideration of a female centered curriculum; address the at-risk student population as early as elementary school; and continuing research on the effectiveness of asynchronous credit recovery programs.

AB  - Purpose: Individual differences and perceived values of technology have received much attention in technology adoption literature. However, there is a lack of understanding of their relationships and effects on online learning adoption. The study aims to investigate the effects of two important personality traits (i.e. openness to experience and neuroticism) and five perceived values (i.e. functional value, emotional value, social value, epistemic value and conditional value) on students' intentions to adopt online learning. Design/methodology/approach: A survey research method was used to collect information from university students. A sample size of 285 was used for data analysis. Structural equation modeling analysis using analysis of moment structure software was used to examine the construct reliability and validity, the model-fit indices and the causal relationships between latent constructs in the proposed framework. Findings: The results show that neuroticism and openness to experience affect students' intentions to adopt online learning through five perceived values of online learning. Particularly, students who are open to experience pay more attention to the quality of online learning. Students who are more neurotic avoid stress from learning in a situation that they are not familiar with. In addition, students tend to adopt online learning when they perceive online learning fulfills their emotional and social needs. Further discussions of the findings and implications for theory and practice are provided. Originality/value: The study extends knowledge and understanding of online learning adoption associated with individual personality and perception of online learning's values. It proposed a new framework to examine the effects of neuroticism, openness to experience and perceived values on online learning adoption. Universities might use the study results to plan and implement their online learning programs that will be considered valuable for students who have different personality traits.

AB  - In stimulating the development and enhancement of effective psychotherapy skills, the reach and relevance of psychotherapy supervision are being recognized internationally as never before, and some competency-based supervision efforts - which potentially have blueprint implications globally for supervision practice - have been set in place. In this brief report, I identify six fundamental areas of psychotherapy supervision competence that appear to now be considered crucial in many corners of the world: (a) knowledge about/understanding of supervision models, methods, and intervention; (b) knowledge about / skill in attending to matters of ethical, legal, and professional concern; (c) knowledge about / skill in managing supervision relationship processes; (d) knowledge about / skill in conducting supervisory assessment and evaluation; (e) knowledge about / skill in fostering attention to difference and diversity; and (f) openness to/utilization of a self-reflective, self-assessment stance in supervision. Those six areas seemingly now provide an organisational net that can be used to: (a) structure families of competences for training purposes; and (b) frame supervision competency discussions worldwide.

AB  - Abstract: What are the competences required to satisfactorily practice effective or 'good enough' psychoanalytic supervision? In this paper, I would like to consider that question. Over the past approximate 15-year period, increasing attention has been directed toward more specifically identifying and defining the components of competent psychoanalytic practice. But any parallel attention toward identifying and defining the components of competent psychoanalytic supervision practice has, in comparison, been sorely limited if not virtually absent. If we are to best practice competent psychoanalytic supervision and best train future psychoanalytic supervisors for competent practice, effort needs to be made to concretely delineate the competences that are requisite for such practice. In what follows, I present and adapt six broad-based families of internationally relevant supervision competence areas for use in psychoanalytic supervision: (1) knowledge about/understanding of psychoanalytic supervision models, methods, and intervention; (2) knowledge about/skill in attending to matters of ethical, legal, and professional concern; (3) knowledge about/skill in managing psychoanalytic supervision relationship processes; (4) knowledge about/skill in conducting psychoanalytic supervisory assessment and evaluation; (5) knowledge about/skill in fostering attention to difference and diversity; and (6) openness to/utilization of a self-reflective, self-assessment stance in psychoanalytic supervision. Although by no means an exhaustive list, 30 supervision competences (five per family) are proposed as significant for guiding competent psychoanalytic supervision practice and supervisor training, and a brief explanatory comment is offered in support of each broad-based family of competences.

AB  - Question: What is the 'lived experience' of people who have diabetes mellitus? Data sources: Unpublished and published studies (including dissertations, theses, articles, and book chapters) were identified by searching 6 databases (Sociofile, PsycLit, Dissertation Abstracts, CINAHL, Medline, and Allied Health); the Canadian Nurses Association library; and refereed nursing, social science, and allied health journals and books published from 1980 to July 1996. Study selection: Studies were included if they were qualitative interpretive research reports of the experience of living with diabetes from the perspective of an insider and included participants with diagnosed diabetes. Data analysis: Data were analysed using meta-ethnographic synthesis (inductive analysis of data from individual studies, hypothesis development, and testing of hypothetical relations). Analyses of individual studies were reviewed by multiple researchers. Main results: 43 reports of 38 studies were identified (6 phenomenological, 5 ethnographic, 2 case, 2 focus group, 9 exploratory, and 19 grounded theory study reports). Most reports included only participants who were white (n = 33) or who had type 1 (insulin dependent) diabetes mellitus (n = 33). Participants were usually married women who had a minimum high school education. Patient experiences of adapting to and managing diabetes are captured by the concept of balance. Patients want to achieve a balance between living with diabetes and the desire for a normal healthy life. Learning to balance involves making the decision to assume control and then actually assuming control. Patients vary in the degree to which they choose to assume control of diabetes management and revise this in response to certain life events (eg, depressive episodes). Assuming control involves knowing one's body, learning haw to manage diabetes, and fostering supportive, collaborative relationships with others. Knowing the body refers to paying attention to the body's cues that blood sugar levels may be high or low, deciphering what the cues mean, recognising unique patterns of body responses that may cause changes in blood sugar levels, and testing blood sugar levels to validate that cues and hypotheses about causes are correct. Learning how to manage diabetes involves a progression of getting regulated, trying out and modifying a prescribed regimen to fit the circumstances, and establishing a unique basic routine. This progression is repeated each time patients encounter unfamiliar body responses to interventions or situations. Basic knowledge of diabetes pathophysiology and the rationale for common interventions, a belief in one's ability to manage diabetes, and certain life events affect the progression of diabetes management. Adapting to diabetes involves accepting one's self as a 'diabetic,' experiencing losses and feelings of being different, and reframing complications in a positive light. Fostering supportive, collaborative relationships involves balancing one's need for support and advice with the need to maintain autonomy and self esteem. Recruitment of 'allies' who have a basic understanding of diabetes and are familiar with a patient's unique responses is important. Allies, often family members, can serve as rescuers when hypoglycaemia occurs and as secondary monitors of body cues. People with diabetes try to maintain a balance between expressing their own needs and being seen as troublesome in their relationships with caregivers. Helpful healthcare interactions are characterised by caregivers who know and value the patient as an individual. Conclusion: The lived experience of patients with diabetes mellitus focuses on learning to balance the management of their disease with the desire for a normal life by making the decision to assume control and then following through.

AB  - This study is based on the hope that we may learn something about sustaining morale through a time of hardship by turning back to a recent crisis in American life to see how our citizens responded during a previous period of stress. We go back to January and February of 1934. Unemployment had risen to an unprecedented high point. That winter, in New York City, an Adjustment Service was organized to give aid and counsel to men and women seeking to find some way of improving their lot in this difficult situation. In all some sixteen thousand people were given interviews, tests, and guidance. From the records of that organization we hope to find out some of the differences between those morale was high, despite their difficulties, and those who more quickly lost their faith and courage. Our study, except for a few comparisons, has been limited to unemployed men. The demand for complete records limited us necessarily to 538 cases. Subjects ranged in age from the late teens to more than sixty, with a median at twenty-six. The first index of morale used in this investigation is the Hall Scale for Measuring Occupational Morale. We sought a broader measure of morale, and developed what is here called a 'Life Satisfaction Index,' using items selected from the Bernreuter Personality Inventory and the Strong Vocational Interest Test. These tests had been given during the counseling program, and we have merely re-tabulated the responses to the selected items to obtain our Life-Satisfaction Index. Case studies were made of 16 men chosen from the highest level of morale, and compared with 16 from the lowest level—as measured, in both cases, by the Life Satisfaction Index. From factors which seem to be related to the maintenance of morale during hard times and unemployment, we draw some conclusions which are put in the form of recommendations. The morale problems of the 1940's will not be identical with those which our clients faced in the 1930's, but from what we know about the psychology of morale in general, we shall try to make our conclusions applicable to coming periods of stress. They are not 'proved' by our study; they remain hypotheses, somewhat clarified and supported, but still hypotheses. 1. Emotional security in home and early childhood lays a necessary foundation for the maintenance of morale during crises. 2. Success in the past is a good foundation for morale in the future 3. Marriage and family life help in sustaining morale. 4. Education is well justified as a morale-building process. 5. Morale is fostered by work which is intrinsically interesting, which is recognised as rendering needed service. 6. The greater the indecision, the lower the morale. 7. Anticipation of disaster may be quite as demoralising as the blow itself. 8. If morale is to be sustained, aspiration must not reach too far beyond realistic opportunities. 9. Social participation is a major factor in maintaining good morale. 10. Religion is properly regarded as making an important contribution to morale. 11. The kind of morale which sustains traditional values despite difficulties is more common in older men; the kind of morale which overcomes obstacles in struggles toward improved social conditions is more apt to be found in youth.

AB  - This section introduces a series of chapters regarding the methodological concerns on the health promotion policy developed by the World Health Organization. In Chapter 5, Dale Webb and David Wright explore the implications of the postmodernist perspective for evaluating effectiveness in health promotion. The chapter considers what constitutes a postmodern approach to health promotion research and practice, focusing on: research methods, the notion of causality, indicators of success, and the language of health care evaluation. Relatedly, in Chapter 6 Paul Flowers, Jamie Frankis and Graham Hart takes up the challenge laid down by Webb and Wright by adopting a multi-method approach encompassing different epistemological frameworks in order to evaluate a peer-led, community-level intervention to promote sexual health among gay men in Glasgow, Scotland. In Chapter 7 Elisabeth Fosse reports the findings of research into the implementation of a national program in Norway, which was intended to enhance intersectoral co-operation and stimulate municipalities to give higher priority to health promotion. Lastly, in Chapter 8 Janine Hale explores the relationship between health economics and health promotion. The chapter argues that any difficulties can only be overcome through collaboration between economists and health promotion specialists/researchers.

AB  - The research on which this thesis is based is a small-scale, qualitative study of 23 men caring for partners with multiple sclerosis. The participants were recruited through the MS Societies of New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory. The data were comprised of transcripts of interviews. The interviews were organised around a series of focus questions. The analysis was conducted in two tiers: a conventional first tier and then a re-analysis in the light of a series of theoretical concerns. The research has had to address the needs and interests of two different research constituencies--the MS Society and the academic community. The impact of this dual character of the research is examined in some detail. The research adopts a feminist standpoint and the thesis sets out to explore the implications of this epistemological and methodological stance. The aim of the research has been to make use of a body of data on men caring for a married partner, to explore a number of ideas within the large and fluid body of caring theory. Some of the concerns that shaped the design of the research at the outset include: the gendered nature of caring; choice in relation to taking on caring responsibilities; emotional work; the moral character of caring; the impact on marriages of care and chronic illness; the shaping (restricting) of both lives in a caring relationship. Other issues emerged as the research progressed: the role of doctors and expert knowledge; the place of diagnosis; workplace participation; informal support; the nature of service use and reasons for non-use; the impact of MS on the wider family as well as the marriage; the ideals of independence and self-reliance; living with uncertainty and the concept of 'ontological security'. The last two themes are given more extensive treatment. The final section of the thesis considers four political issues--the need for an enlarged conceptualisation of care that transcends the public/private divide, the importance of re-thinking our notions of dependency, the need for immediate reform in relation to support for carers and those with a disability and the issue of citizenship.

AB  - Every year hundreds of thousands, if not millions of children in the United States are abused or neglected. Many of those children are removed from their homes in order to put them in a safer setting. In Connecticut, over 2,700 children entered the foster care system in the 2002 fiscal year. Many of these children are placed in foster care settings, while the foster families, and sometimes the social workers, know precious little information about the history of the children. Oftentimes children come with emotional, behavioral, and health issues that significantly impact their ability to cope with daily stressors. Sibling groups are often separated and sent to different foster homes. Many placements are disrupted due to these issues, causing further trauma to these children. This study examined the effectiveness of the 16 Safe Homes operated in Connecticut for the Department of Children and Families. The Safe Home program was developed in an effort to decrease children's disruption of foster care placements after being removed from their parents' care. The program was designed to identify significant problem areas that may lead to children having disrupted placements and to stabilize those children before moving them to foster homes. It was hypothesized that the behavioral problems, medical problems requiring specialized care, whether or not a child was experiencing his or her first removal from the home, the amount of services utilized, and the number of follow-up sessions provided by the Safe Home staff would impact the number of disrupted placements. No significant correlations were found between the Safe Homes in the hypothesized areas, and this may have been due to the small sample size of only 16 Safe Homes. Post hoc correlations were found in some of the outcome data, most notably between children for whom this was a first time out-of-home placement and preserving their initial placement following discharge from the Safe Home.

AB  - While adoption can build strong family ties, many challenges can also develop both during and after the adoption process. Parent/Parents and adopted children face a variety of challenges within the newly formed family unit. Parents struggle with the adoption process, while adoptees from various backgrounds often wrestle with identity development and feelings of loss and grief throughout their life resulting from relinquishment. Our purpose here is to offer a solution in the form of two group interventions: a prevention-based group to help parent/parents navigate effectively through the adoption process and a counseling group aimed at helping adopted adolescents develop a positive identity.

AB  - Recent statistics estimate that there are 783,000 children living in foster care in the United States. This vulnerable population is at risk for academic failure as well as internalizing and externalizing behavioral problems. Compared to their peers, foster youth face significant educational difficulties, including lower levels of academic achievement, increased discipline referrals, and overrepresentation in special education. In addition, they are at an increased risk for memory problems, attention difficulties, sleep and mood disorders, emotional problems, and chronic health problems such as asthma and malnutrition. It is critical to recognize the unique needs of this population in order to improve educational outcomes. For these children, who are often left without assistance to navigate through their educational careers, it is essential to provide consistent interdisciplinary support. Bringing together key stakeholders from home, school, and social service agencies is paramount to success. School psychologists are skilled in home-school collaboration and can connect team members and lead advocacy efforts to improve services for students in foster care. Regardless of educational placement, it is imperative to provide appropriate academic and behavioral supports and interventions for foster youth. In sum, the needs of this unique population require specialized training. School psychologists have the skill to link issues involving learning, behavior, and mental health needs in order to support children in foster care.

AB  - The fields of special education/early intervention and infant mental health are moving closer, as practitioners find common ground in understanding and intervening to support vulnerable infants and toddlers. The importance of the impact of relationships on all developmental domains has been brought to the foreground. This includes relationships between parent and interventionist, as well as parent and child. Ongoing professional development in the form of reflective consultation supports the work of interventionists by fostering reflective functioning and facilitating a greater understanding of the impact of interactions and emotions in their work with families. This may lead to a broader and deeper range of intervention approaches and a better choice of intervention based on a better understanding of individual and family needs. This article describes a collaborative pilot project that integrates an infant mental health approach to support early interventionists within a special education system. The project supported the services of an infant mental health consultant to facilitate ongoing reflective consultation for 2 home-based school district teams working in an urban community. Data were collected to explore the effects of reflective consultation in supporting early interventionists, decreasing burnout, and increasing skills needed to work with diverse families. As a result of this project, the participants advocated for use of district professional development funds to continue reflective consultation with the consultant.

AB  - The purpose of this case study is to describe leadership practices of four principals who completed the Principals' Excellence Program (PEP), either in 2003 or 2004. PEP was a year-long professional development leadership academy collaboratively designed by a rural, high-needs school district and a major state university. One major goal identified for PEP was to reframe the principalship from school management to instructional leadership. PEP participants engaged in a field-based, job-embedded leadership professional development program oriented to instructional leadership. After completing the Principals' Excellence Program, the four principals continued to work at their schools. This case study described how each of the four PEP principals work in his/her school. Then, each principal's work was analyzed using relevant literature to aid in identifying and explaining factors that emerged from the study. Next, a cross case analysis of the data allowed comparisons of how the four principals worked. The cross case analyses enabled the researcher to develop four propositions about the way the principals worked. These propositions include: (1) the greater the attention of the principal to improving school culture and climate, the greater the support for student-learning; (2) the more attention a principal spends on classroom instruction, the more likely teachers will adopt new classroom strategies; (3) the more the principal involves teachers in change processes, the greater the likelihood that changes will be institutionalized: and (4) the greater the perception of a principal in using emotional intelligence to support and foster relationships with students and faculty, the greater the likelihood that students and faculty will be positively motivated. These propositions enabled the researcher to develop a grounded theoretical explanation of highly, effective principals that summarizes what was learned from this study and is presented as a statement that concludes the study: Principals who focus on improving school culture and climate are attentive to instruction, involve teachers in the change process, and use emotional intelligence to enhance student and teacher motivation contributing to increasing academic performance of children who are characterized as low socio-economic and at risk in rural schools in central Appalachia.

AB  - Over the last three decades there has been a growing concern regarding the poor outcomes for the large number of children and youth with serious emotional disturbances (SED) in the United States. The System of Care model has been adopted as a central strategy to address the fragmented, costly, and inaccessible nature of the mental health service delivery systems that has been attributed to these poor outcomes. Yet despite years of research and millions of dollars in federal support, many system of care efforts struggle in transforming their systems to adequately meet the needs of SED youth. One strategy to improve these efforts is the promotion of inter-professional collaboration. While research suggests that inter-professional collaboration is associated with positive outcomes for SED youth, front-line service providers often lack the capacity to engage in these collaborative processes (Fraser & Greenhalgh, 2001; Walker & Shutte, 2005) and there is little research available to guide communities in how to facilitate the process of inter-professional collaboration in their own systems. Drawing upon theories from complexity science, this study aimed to address this gap by introducing the IDeAL Partnerships Framework, an integrated model describing how inter-professional collaboration comes about through the development of four self-organizing capacities (knowledge of the service delivery system, knowledge of provider differences, reflective dialogue skills, and beliefs about collaboration) and the initiation of transformative learning exchanges. The IDeAL Partnerships Framework was used to develop an intervention to increase service providers' self-organizing capacity, transformative exchanges, and collaborative behavior. The IDeAL Partnerships Intervention was implemented with front-line service providers and was evaluated using a longitudinal experimental design. Two waves of data were collected from a total of 33 providers (17 in the intervention, and 16 in a control group). Results found some support for the overall conceptual model within the IDeAL Partnerships Framework: all four self-organizing capacities were predictive of transformative learning exchanges, and transformative learning exchanges were predictive of collaborative behaviors. However, transformative learning exchanges did not fully mediate the relationship between capacity and collaboration as proposed in the framework, and analyses suggested additional relationships between variables in the model. Results also provided some support for the intervention's efficacy. Quantitative results suggested a trend indicating that intervention participants experienced increases in two of the four self-organizing capacities (knowledge of the service delivery system and knowledge of provider differences) and their case-related transformative learning exchanges compared to control group participants. While intervention participants' collaborative behaviors also increased compared to the control group in these analyses, the interaction was driven by a decrease in the control group's behaviors over time. These findings were triangulated by focus groups and follow-up interviews with intervention participants. In addition, these qualitative findings expanded upon the quantitative findings by suggesting that at least some intervention participants also gained reflective dialogue skills and shifted their beliefs about collaboration as a result of the intervention. Follow-up interviews also suggested that many intervention participants were still using many of the self-organizing capacities they gained from the intervention to improve their collaborative exchanges 4 months after the intervention ended. The quantitative and qualitative findings from the study are discussed, as well as their implications for future research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Web-based programs are a potential medium for supporting weight loss because of their accessibility and wide reach. Research is warranted to determine the shorter- and longer-term effects of these programs in relation to weight loss and other health outcomes.Objective: The aim was to evaluate the effects of a Web-based component of a weight loss service (Imperative Health) in an overweight/obese population at risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) using a randomized controlled design and a true control group.Methods: A total of 65 overweight/obese adults at high risk of CVD were randomly allocated to 1 of 2 groups. Group 1 (n=32) was provided with the Web-based program, which supported positive dietary and physical activity changes and assisted in managing weight. Group 2 continued with their usual self-care (n=33). Assessments were conducted face-to-face. The primary outcome was between-group change in weight at 3 months. Secondary outcomes included between-group change in anthropometric measurements, blood pressure, lipid measurements, physical activity, and energy intake at 3, 6, and 12 months. Interviews were conducted to explore participants' views of the Web-based program.Results: Retention rates for the intervention and control groups at 3 months were 78% (25/32) vs 97% (32/33), at 6 months were 66% (21/32) vs 94% (31/33), and at 12 months were 53% (17/32) vs 88% (29/33). Intention-to-treat analysis, using baseline observation carried forward imputation method, revealed that the intervention group lost more weight relative to the control group at 3 months (mean -3.41, 95% CI -4.70 to -2.13 kg vs mean -0.52, 95% CI -1.55 to 0.52 kg, P<.001), at 6 months (mean -3.47, 95% CI -4.95 to -1.98 kg vs mean -0.81, 95% CI -2.23 to 0.61 kg, P=.02), but not at 12 months (mean -2.38, 95% CI -3.48 to -0.97 kg vs mean -1.80, 95% CI -3.15 to -0.44 kg, P=.77). More intervention group participants lost ≥5% of their baseline body weight at 3 months (34%, 11/32 vs 3%, 1/33, P<.001) and 6 months (41%, 13/32 vs 18%, 6/33, P=.047), but not at 12 months (22%, 7/32 vs 21%, 7/33, P=.95) versus control group. The intervention group showed improvements in total cholesterol, triglycerides, and adopted more positive dietary and physical activity behaviors for up to 3 months verus control; however, these improvements were not sustained.Conclusions: Although the intervention group had high attrition levels, this study provides evidence that this Web-based program can be used to initiate clinically relevant weight loss and lower CVD risk up to 3-6 months based on the proportion of intervention group participants losing ≥5% of their body weight versus control group. It also highlights a need for augmenting Web-based programs with further interventions, such as in-person support to enhance engagement and maintain these changes.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01472276; http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT01472276 (Archived by Webcite at http://www.webcitation.org/6Z9lfj8nD).

AB  - Purpose CISV (formerly Children's International Summer Villages) is an international charity established in Cincinnati, USA, in 1950. It offers non-formal educational programmes for children and young people from 11 years. In its intercultural programmes English is used as Lingua Franca while space and opportunities are created for participants to use their first languages. A primary aim of the organisation is to promote intercultural friendship and understanding. This chapter has dual aims. Firstly, it provides a review of the impact of intercultural learning in CISV and its unique multilingual practice on development of friendship and Intercultural Communicative Competence (ICC) among children and youth. Secondly, it investigates the methodological issues in evaluating the development and changes in ICC, specifically, the under-reported problem of 'inflated' perceptions with regard to self-assessment questionnaires. Findings Existing research evidence corroborates the positive and long-term impact of CISV experience on participants' social development (including friendship), cultural awareness, challenges are also identified. For example, how can programme and activity organisers encourage equitable and active participation when participants' language proficiency in the shared language is varied? How do we explain the regression in self-assessment of ICC? In this chapter, we compare three different ways of measuring changes and propose a purposely designed predictive and reflective questionnaire (PaRQ). Open questions ('narrative spaces') in these questionnaires provide the opportunity for participants to comment on their own perceptions of learning and friendship development. Originality/value CISV differs from many other intercultural education organisations in that it offers opportunity for relatively young children, promotes learning and development in a multicultural environment and adopts a language practice that combines English as Lingua Franca (ELF) and a multilingual outlook. Understanding its successes and areas for improvement provides some insight into friendship development in multilingual and intercultural settings.

AB  - Postpartum depression affects some 10% to 20% of mothers. Its impact on the health and well-being of mothers and their infants is well documented. If not identified and addressed early, it can result in emotional burden, costly hospitalization and treatment, and, at worst, suicide and or infanticide. Empowerment theory was the conceptual framework for this hermeneutic phenomenological study. The purpose was to understand the lived experiences of the screening and treatment processes of 10 women from New York City experiencing postpartum depression and their perceived adequacy of the treatment received. In-depth interviews were used to investigate participants' lived experiences of the screening and treatment processes for their postpartum depression and to explore the extent to which they percieved that their emotional needs were met. From the responses to the interview questions, 6 themes emerged: crying and stress during and after pregnancy, inadequate assessment, feeling bad or unlike oneself, lack of understanding, needing to cope, and prayer was essential for recovery. Participants had tearfulness that began during pregnancy and intensified during the postpartum period, were ineffectively assessed, exhibited bizarre behaviors that could not be explained, had little understanding of what they were experiencing, and were sometimes misunderstood by others. Further, participants at times sought treatment on their own in order to cope. Some reported that prayer was central to the restoration of their mental health. Insights gained through this study can be utilized to foster positive social change by heightening awareness and assisting health care providers in planning appropriate screening and treatment to meet the individual needs of women with postpartum depression.

Pediatric Diabetes 2017: 18: 315-319. Background/Objective: The impact of family composition on glycemic control in children with type 1 diabetes remains unclear. We sought to evaluate the relationship between health insurance coverage, family composition, and insulin management, and assess their impact on glycemic control in a pediatric type 1 diabetes population. Methods: A retrospective chart review was completed for patients seen in the Pediatric Endocrinology Clinic at the University of Louisville in 2012. Results: The analysis included 729 patients with type 1 diabetes; 268 (37%) had public insurance while 461(63%) had private insurance. Compared with publicly insured patients, privately insured patients had higher rates of intensive insulin management with multiple daily injections (MDI) plans or pump devices (88 vs. 83.2%, p=0.066) and lower HbA1c levels {[}8.57 vs. 9.39% (70 vs. 79 mmol/mol), p<0.001]. Of the 729 patients, 243 were in single-adult homes (33%). Single-adult homes had higher HbA1c levels than two-adult homes, {[}9.3 vs. 8.6% (78 vs. 70 mmol/mol), p<0.001]. Among publicly insured, there was no difference in HbA1c levels for single-adult vs. two-adult homes {[}9.4 (79 mmol/mol), p=0.868]. For privately insured, patients in single-adult homes had higher HbA1c levels than peers in two-adult homes {[}9.2 vs. 8.4% (77 vs. 68), p<0.001]. Conclusion: Insurance type and family composition have significant associative effects on glycemic control and insulin management that may be mitigated by insulin pump therapy. Identifying and addressing factors such as availability of resources, family education, and adult support and supervision, may help improve glycemic control in high-risk pediatric diabetes patients.

AB  - Background: Women from ethnic minority groups are at greater risk of developing mental health problems. Poor perinatal mental health impacts on maternal morbidity and mortality and can have a devastating impact on child and family wellbeing. It is important to ensure that services are designed to meet the unique needs of women from diverse backgrounds. Aim: The aim of the review was to explore ethnic minority women's experiences of perinatal mental ill health, help-seeking and perinatal mental health services in Europe. Data sources: Searches included CINAHL, Maternity and Infant Care, MEDLINE and PsycINFO with no language or date restrictions. Additional literature was identified by searching reference lists of relevant studies. Design: This was a mixed method systematic review. Study selection, appraisal and data extraction were conducted by two researchers independently. A convergent approach was adopted for the analysis and the data were synthesised thematically. Results: The 15 eligible studies included women from a range of minority ethnic backgrounds and were all undertaken in the United Kingdom (UK). Seven overarching themes were identified; awareness and beliefs about mental health, isolation and seeking support, influence of culture, symptoms and coping strategies, accessing mental health services, experiences of mental health services and what women want. Conclusion: Lack of awareness about mental ill health, cultural expectations, ongoing stigma, culturally insensitive and fragmented health services and interactions with culturally incompetent and dismissive health providers all impact on ethnic minority women's ability to receive adequate perinatal mental health support in the UK. Future research should focus on in-depth exploration of the experiences of these women across multiple European settings and interventions to reduce health inequalities among vulnerable mothers and families affected by perinatal mental ill health.

AB  - Purpose of the Study: To identify risk factors for early nursing home placement (NHP) in Alzheimer's disease (AD), focusing on the impact of longitudinal change in cognition, activities of daily living (ADL), service utilization, and cholinesterase inhibitor treatment (ChEI). Design and Methods: In an open, 3-year, prospective, multicenter study in a routine clinical setting, 880 AD patients were treated with either donepezil, rivastigmine, or galantamine. At baseline and every 6 months, they were assessed with several rating scales including Mini-Mental State Examination, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale (IADL), and Physical Self-Maintenance scale. Moreover, the dose of ChEI, the amount of weekly assistance (home help service and adult day care), and the date of NHP were recorded. Cox regression models were constructed to predict the risk of NHP. Results: During the study, 206 patients (23%) were admitted to nursing homes. Factors that precipitated institutionalization were lower cognitive and functional abilities at baseline, faster rate of decline in IADLs, female gender, solitary living, and a lower mean dose of ChEI. The men living alone and patients with a substantial increase in adult day care also demonstrated shorter time to NHP. Implications: The rate of functional but not cognitive decline was a strong risk factor for NHP. The results could be used to identify the care recipients that might risk early NHP to ensure that these individuals receive a sufficient level of assistance. Furthermore, higher doses of ChEI might postpone institutionalization in AD. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - This chapter follows the development of a friendship in pair therapy between 2 12 yr-old girls at a day treatment school for emotionally and behaviorally disturbed children. A general theoretical understanding of the particular friendship processes to be observed in the case is first established. Research findings regarding the structure and style of preadolescents' intimate friendships, including the consideration of gender differences in these relationships, are then compared to the empirical clinical data offered by this case. Looking at how a 'best friend' relationship is created between 2 girls with impoverished relating skills—as well as traumatic interpersonal histories—may help us to understand what derails relationships and how enduring bonds can be nurtured. We may be able to observe the healing elements of interpersonal intimacy, and thus learn more about how to use relationships in a preventive manner to foster future mental health and adjustment. The case study illuminates the essential role of the therapist in the pair relationship. The reason the children are referred for pairs—their immature capacities for interpersonal understanding—necessitates the therapist's direct involvement both to model and teach broader social skills repertoire.

AB  - The differences between male and female childbearing decisions are attributable not only to their innate biological differences, but also to their socially ascribed gender role differences. Couples are faced with many difficult decisions when attempting to resolve infertility. The goal of this research is to further understand how the desire for genetic relatedness in their offspring differently influences male and female attitudes about parenthood and adoption when faced with unresolved infertility. A sample of 450 women and 389 of their male partners contemplating or undergoing fertility treatment were interviewed and asked to fill out questionnaires at four time-points over an 18 month period. Data was gathered regardless of the couples' treatment decisions or treatment outcomes. On the basis of the entire sample of infertile couples, this study determined that males' desires for genetic relatedness were significantly higher compared to females at the beginning of infertility treatment. Results also concluded that for males and females, the greater the desires for genetic relatedness, the more negatively they viewed adoption. However, no relationship was found between desire for genetic relatedness and attitudes about parenthood. Interestingly, when the couple did not know the cause of their infertility, gender differences in valuing genetic relatedness were most apparent. Results indicated that when there is a female factor infertility problem, males' desires for genetic relatedness lessen and become more similar to their female counterpart in their desires. It is this investigator's hope that this study will encourage continuing research on gender differences between infertile couples. Treatment providers should work to understand and anticipate potential conflicts of gender specific value differences which, if not recognized and addressed, could add undue stress to the infertility treatment process.

AB  - The mental health histories of the 448 children 15 and 16 years of age who were admitted to state-operated children's psychiatric inpatient services in New York during 1982 were reviewed for the 11 year period through April 1993, Thirty-three percent were served as adults (after age 18) in the state-operated adult civil mental health system; 42% of these individuals were still receiving services at the end of the period. 113 of the 146 individuals served as adults were served only in the civil system. Thirteen percent of the cohort received some of their mental health services as adults in the state-operated adult forensic mental health system due to criminal law involvement. This includes nine percent who received mental health services while they were inmates in state prisons. Twenty four of the 57 forensic clients received services as adults only in the forensic system. Diagnostic, demographic, and service history characteristics of the groups were compared to foster an early understanding of policy and programmatic issues related to movement from the child mental health system to the adult system. Baseline (1982) information was used to identify predictors of later service utilization.

AB  - More than simply a source of income, work has become a central source of identity (Beder, 2000; Ciulla, 2000; Clair, McConnell, Bell, Hackbarth & Mathes, 2008; Muirhead, 2004), motivating scholars to engage in a plethora of studies examining the impact of work as a way of defining ourselves, ranging from identification with the organization (Scott, Corman, & Cheney, 1998) to the influence of work on non-work lives (Kirby, Wieland & McBride, 2006). And yet, in such volatile political and economic times, individual's identities as worker are threatened, spurring questions about how to decenter the meaning of work in our lives (Rushkoff, 2011). Despite young people's roles as organizational members, few communication scholars have considered the organizational experiences of youth as a productive area for research and theory (for exception see Myers & Sadaghiani, 2010). I adopt a discursive approach to unpack the multiple ways that discourses, at interpersonal, organizational and social levels, impact and influence youths' identity construction process (Ashcraft & Mumby, 2004; Fairhust & Putnam, 2004). I empirically demonstrate how discourses of work operate simultaneously at multiple levels, interacting and overlapping to position youth as workers. Analysis is based on interviews with youth, ages 12 to 21, participating in a popular national nonprofit organization that serves over four million youth each year. In addition to 49 one-on-one formal interviews, I observed 50 hours of a worker preparation program, which serves as an important context for priming participants and situating our conversations about work. Practically, this project illustrates the influence of organizations to mediate the relationship between discourse and identity. Methodologically, I further clarify discursive analysis as a method by explicitly articulating a concrete framework by which to identify micro-, meso-, and macro-levels of discourse. I also present a qualitative instrument for interviewing youth. Theoretically, this research offers an innovative and necessary expansion to the scope of organizational research by highlighting youth as current and future workers, pointing to the ways they are already engaged in work-life negotiation practices and considering how their micro-discursive practices serve to decenter the organization and make work and family meaningful.

AB  - Chronic illness is endemic in the United States. Though people with chronic illnesses will not be cured, interventions can improve their well-being. Creating art as an intervention has been shown to assist people with chronic illnesses to improve well-being. Though creating art as a health promotion intervention is widespread it has not been well studied and the structure, process and outcomes of the intervention are not well understood.The purpose of this study was to identify and describe various key components of creating visual art as a healing intervention in the context of chronic illness. This study developed knowledge that will assist practitioners who use this complex intervention and researchers seeking to test its effectiveness in health promotion and healing in a chronically ill population.A qualitative descriptive design was used to explore art as a healing intervention. Photographs of art created by participants were observed, and participants were interviewed to collect data on the structure, process and outcomes of art as a healing intervention. The content and descriptive analysis of the data are used to describe the components of art as an intervention as well as the modifiers of the intervention process and the relationship of the components to each other to allow further research to be appropriately focused.Creating art is an intervention that works with a whole person to provide an opportunity for emergent change through disrupting old patterns, creating movement, and providing the opportunity for the participant to adopt new healthier patterns for living with chronic illness. Creating art does not have a predictable outcome, but rather has patient specific outcomes dependent on the patient's particular needs and individual self-organization.This study contributed to knowledge about creating art as a healing intervention by exploring various intervention components that must be explicated prior to development of program initiatives in practice and conducting systematic studies about the effectiveness of this intervention. The results of this study provide a foundation for a research career that both furthers the use of art as a healing intervention and further develops intervention theory to include complex evaluation methods.

AB  - The article discusses a group program called as the Specialized Home Care Program (SHC) of the Cambridge (Massachusetts) Family and Children's Service established to help retarded children and adults maintain and improve the quality of their lives outside of institutional settings. In recognition of the specific parenting problems faced by retarded mothers and of the value of peer support and stimulation in the parent education process, two social workers at the agency initiated a group to help improve the effectiveness of these mothers as parents. Mothers of latency-aged and adolescent children were targeted for service because they frequently become less motivated to reach out for help as their children mature, having survived the fragility of infancy, and gain direct access to a wide range of services through the public school system. Weekly group topics included nutrition, hygiene, grooming, sex education, and advocacy on behalf of the members' offspring. The workers planned to provide information and advice and to encourage discussion and mutual problem solving. However, as they succeeded in fostering an atmosphere of mutual trust and acceptance, the mothers came to share feelings and problems that extended more broadly and reached more deeply than the workers had expected.

AB  - LITTLE RELIABLE EVIDENCE EXISTS, BUT OBSERVERS AGREE THAT MUCH STUDENT-PERPETRATED VIOLENCE AND DISRUPTION ARE CAUSED BY SCHOOL POLICY, SCHOOL, PROCEDURES, AND VARIOUS TYPES OF HABITUAL BEHAVIOR THAT DISTINGUISH DIFFERENT SCHOOLS. FOCUSING REMEDIAL EFFORTS ON THOSE ATTRIBUTES OF SCHOOLS THAT PRECIPITATE DEVIANT OR DELINQUENT BEHAVIOR IS BOTH MORE ECONOMICALLY EFFICIENT AND EDUCATIONALLY PRODUCTIVE THAN DIRECTING RESOURCES TOWARD INDIVIDUAL CONTROLS OR REMEDIATION. MUCH STUDENT BEHAVIOR IS HEAVILY INFLUENCED BY ORGANIZATIONAL ATTRIBUTES THAT ARE NOT DIRECTLY RELATED TO CLASSROOM ACTIVITY. THOSE ORGANIZATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF SCHOOLS THAT CAN CAUSE DELINQUENT BEHAVIOR ARE IDENTIFIED AS IMPERSONAL AND DEPERSONALIZED INSTITUTIONS, MISEDUCATIONAL AND MALADAPTIVE PROCEDURES, AND SUCH VARIOUS ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS AS CENTRALIZATION AND SPECIALIZATION. THESE ORGANIZATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS CONSTITUTE ESTABLISHED NORMS THAT STRONGLY INFLUENCE WHAT PEOPLE DO IN THE SHCOOLS, AND THESE NORMS CAN EVEN INFLUENCE BEHAVIOR IN A NEGATIVE WAY. ENTRENCHED NORMS THAT ARE CAPABLE OF ELICITING UNDESIRED BEHAVIOR LIE IN PATTERNS OF COMMUNICATION, DECISION-MAKING AND AUTHORITY RELATIONSHIPS, RULE-MAKING, RELATIONSHIPS OF TEACHERS WITH PARENTS, AND CURRICULUM AND INSTRUCTIONAL PRACTICES. PERSONNEL IN DISRUPTION-PRONE SCHOOLS MUST LEARN TO RECOGNIZE THESE NORMS AND MUST BE TAUGHT HOW TO IMPLEMENT NEW ONES. THREE POSSIBLE REMEDIES HOLD PROMISE TO REDUCE SCHOOL DISRUPTION: BEGIN NEW MODES OF COMMUNICATION, DECISIONMAKING, AND IMPLEMENTATION, THAT IS, DEVELOP NEW NORMS FOR THE SCHOOLS; START PROGRAMS FOR SCHOOL PERSONNEL TO ENABLE THEM TO PRACTICE SKILLS FOR CHANGING THE SCHOOLS; AND START PRESERVICE AND INSERVICE ADMINISTRATOR TRAINING PROGRAMS TO DEVELOP SKILLS IN PROMOTING COGNITIVE AND BEHAVIORAL DEVELOPMENT IN SCHOOLS. IN ORDER TO DEVELOP CURRICULUM FOR PRESERVICE AND INSERVICE PROGRAMS, AN OUTLINE IS PROVIDED, FOCUSING ON THE TEACHER AS PERSON, THE EFFECTIVE USE OF THE DYNAMICS OF HUMAN GROUPS IN SCHOOLS AND CLASSROOMS, THE FOSTERING OF BEHAVIORAL CHANGES IN STUDENTS, THE OPERATION ON OF THE SCHOOL TO PROMOTE LEARNING, AND THE EFFECTS OF SCHOOL DISTRICT, STATE AND FEDERAL POLICIES ON LEARNING.

AB  - Introduction: An abundance of studies have investigated the many influences on the implementation of healthcare aimed at bridging the gap between recommended practice, what healthcare consumers want and need, and what they actually receive. Yet it is still not well known which implementation approaches work best in the use of knowledge, and the adoption and perpetuation of new ways of providing care in community-based settings. The metanarrative review will purposively inform implementation in the third phase of a programme of research, implementing integrated care for older adults with complex health needs (iCOACH) in New Zealand and Canada. Methods: This work reviewed what is known about implementation that may be suitable to guide the scaling up and evaluation phase of iCOACH. Metanarrative review methods were applied to systematic and narrative reviews of literature on implementation frameworks, theories and strategies. We synthesised heterogenous findings in a way that informs the practice of implementation. Results: Thirty-five systematic and narrative reviews met our inclusion criteria and were appraised, summarised, and qualitatively analysed. The various assumptions, worldviews and findings represented in the literature were subjected to high level analysis and interpretation that identified five metanarratives concerning the constructs, influencing factors, frameworks, and the effectiveness of interventions and strategies employed in implementation. Discussion: A wide range of people have a stake in how to implement what works best and matters most for older adults with chronic health care problems in various community-based settings, not least consumers themselves. We call for collaborative adaptation with stakeholders, most importantly the person receiving care and their family in the implementation of a new model. Conclusions and lessons learned: There is still no 'silver bullet' in implementation science in spite of abundant primary and secondary studies. People- and relationship-centred care is fundamental to integrated, community-based care at all levels in the broader health care delivery system. Yet many implementation theories and frameworks neglect these important considerations. All phases of implementation of a new model of care call for collaborative adaptation with stakeholders, the most important being the person receiving care in terms of what matters most to them. Limitations: While our search strategies were extensive we cannot guarantee that we located every systematic or narrative review on this topic. Suggestions for future research: Participatory research methods and realist evaluation approaches informed by this metanarrative review is required of the implementation of a new model of integrated, community-based care for older adults with chronic health problems to establish what has worked best, for whom and how.

AB  - Psychosocial functioning is compromised following pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI), with the past few decades witnessing a proliferation of research examining the effect of childhood brain insult on a range of psychosocial outcomes. This paper describes the systematic recommendation of outcome instruments to address psychosocial functioning following pediatric TBI.A total of 65 instruments across 11 psychosocial areas (i.e., Global Outcome, Communication, Social Cognition, Behavioural and Executive Function, Other Neuropsychological Functioning, Psychological Status, TBI-related Symptoms, Activities and Participation, Support and Relationships, Sense of Self, and Health-Related Quality of Life) were reviewed using various assessment methods, including working groups, literature searches, comparisons with selection guidelines, and international expert opinion. Each measure was reviewed for its usefulness across early recovery, intervention, and outcome related studies.34 instruments were recommended and classified according to the World Health Organization’s International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health taxonomy and categorised by psychosocial area.This compilation provides a common framework to guide the activities of clinicians and researchers in psychosocial rehabilitation. It is anticipated that these will foster a multidisciplinary approach to psychosocial dysfunction to enhance the evaluation, prediction, and improvement of functional outcomes for those with pediatric TBI.

AB  - Ethical sensitivity enables professionals to interpret and respond to the needs of their clients. Although integral to decision-making and excellent clinical care, the concept of ethical sensitivity is fraught with theoretical confusion. It has been described as a caring response, skill in identifying ethical dimensions of care, intuition regarding other's comfort and well-being, and a component of moral care. There was a need to clarify this concept, and to enhance its utility to research and practice.The Morse Criterion-based method of concept analysis enabled exploration of ethical sensitivity within the postmodern critical social theory research tradition. The analysis was guided by an understanding of professional role as expressed in discursive interactions rather than as domination and control. Data were published literature from selected disciplines included for their accessibility, relevancy, and usefulness to the emerging conceptualization. Overt and covert assumptions underlying definitions of ethical sensitivity were explicated. The meaning, relevance, dimensions, and utility of the concept were examined. Level of maturity or readiness for research was determined using logical, epistemological, linguistic, and pragmatic principles. Analytical questions, formulated from comprehension, provided new insights. Questions included: Is ethical sensitivity innate or acquired? How do organizations foster ethical sensitivity? Scientific rigor was achieved through sample adequacy, depth of analysis, development of argument, intellectual rigor, validity of results, saturation of categories, and contribution to knowledge.Ethical sensitivity was found to require exposure to suffering and vulnerability cues, uncertainty, and relationships characterized by the professional's receptivity, responsiveness, and courage. Attributes (characteristics) of the concept that were identified were moral perception, affectivity, and dividing loyalties. Outcomes included integrity-preserving compromise, client comfort and well-being, and professional learning and transcendence.Results of this concept analysis will provide a strong foundation for positioning future inquiry within a program of research to study ethical sensitivity. These results will provide insight and understanding about an essential aspect of professional decision making influencing efficacy of care. They will contribute to disciplinary knowledge informing the design of person-led care and professional educational programs. The transdisciplinary scope of the research enhances visibility of the nursing contribution to knowledge pertinent to and shared by professional disciplines.

AB  - Individual differences in gene expression and behaviour are the result of an interaction between a given set of genes and a variety of environmental conditions. The study of epigenetics focuses on the nature of this interaction. The early developmental period in the life of a mammal is exquisitely sensitive to environmental cues. One critical question is how is the genome capable of adapting to these developmental or environmental signals? Building on an established rodent model, in which the effects of maternal care have been demonstrated to regulate the development and expression of neurobiological and behavioural measures in offspring as adults, the current project concerns how events during the first week of life can have sustained effects on gene expression, which persist throughout the life of the organism. The research presented in this thesis demonstrates how one facet of mothering style leads to a cascade of molecular and cellular changes, resulting in life-long alterations in the nature of stress responses and neuron survival. Frequent licking/grooming by rat mothers alters DNA methylation of the hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene and acetylation of histones early in life, providing a mechanism for these permanent changes in stress responses. Through postnatal cross-fostering studies, I was able to directly study how an identical gene within the same rat strain is expressed and regulated under the different developmental environments and how such effects on gene expression persist through life. I have also examined the potential for reversibility of the long-term consequences of postnatal environment and have demonstrated that both GR levels and the nature of stress responses exhibit a high degree of plasticity in adulthood in response to both pharmacological intervention and dietary amino-acid supplementation. These results demonstrate that the epigenomic marks established early in life through a behavioural mode of programming, are dynamically maintained and potentially reversible in the adult brain. These results contrast with the very dogmatic view that the genome is rendered fixed and immutable. I next questioned the global effects of early-in-life experience on the hippocampal transcriptome and anxiety-mediated behaviours in adulthood. Microarray analysis revealed > 900 different maternal care-responsive mRNA transcripts. These results suggest that effects of early life experience have a stable and broad effect on the hippocampal transcriptome, which may play a role in the development of anxiety-mediated behaviours through life. Finally, both in vivo and in vitro studies show that maternal behaviour increases GR expression in the offspring via increased hippocampal serotonergic tone accompanied by increased histone acetylase transferase activity, histone acetylation and DNA demethylation mediated by the transcription factor NGFI-A. In summary, this research demonstrates that an epigenetic state of a gene can be established through early-in-life experience, and is potentially reversible in adulthood. We predict that epigenetic modifications of targeted regulatory sequences in response to variations in environmental conditions might serve as a major source of variation in biological and behavioural phenotypes. In the case of GR, the resulting individual differences in behavioural and physiological responses to stress are thought to be a major risk factor for the development of psychiatric and physical illness. Thus, in addition to contributing to our understanding of how gene-environment interactions shape development, our work provides a mechanism that can be targeted for therapeutic intervention to potentially reduce the prevalence of these disorders.

AB  - The early nurturing environment has persistent influences on developmental programming of inter-individual differences in metabolic and endocrine function that contribute to emotional and cognitive performance through life. These effects are mediated, in part, through neonatal programming of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function. Animal models support this hypothesis. For example, in the rat natural variations in maternal care influence HPA axis stress reactivity in the offspring via long-term changes in tissue-specific gene expression. Studies in vivo and in vitro show that maternal licking and grooming increases glucocorticoid receptor expression in the offspring via increased hippocampal serotonergic tone accompanied by increased histone acetylase transferase activity, histone acetylation and DNA demethylation mediated by the transcription factor nerve growth factor-inducible protein-A. These effects are reversed by early postnatal cross-fostering and by pharmacological manipulations, including trichostatin A (TSA) and L-methionine administration in adulthood. These studies demonstrate that an epigenetic state of a gene can be established through early in life experience, and is potentially reversible in adult life. Accordingly, epigenetic modifications in target gene promoters in response to environmental demand may ensure stable yet dynamic regulation that mediates persistent changes in biological and behavioral phenotype over the lifespan.

AB  - The rise in the number of families in the United States choosing international adoption has created increased interest in the development and needs of these children who were adopted from overseas orphanages. Considerable research has been done on how the probable neglect, abuse, abandonment, and inconsistent caregiving that these children received prior to adoption has affected them developmentally and psychologically. However, there is a lack of literature on how these challenges have affected the adoptive parents of these children. Through the methodological use of Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) originated by Smith, Flowers and Larkin (2009), this study explored the perceptions of the adoptive parents as they faced the challenges to meet their child's needs through face-to-face interviews with the primary caregiver. Results reported the importance of attachment and bonding, parental support systems within the family and in the community as well as the need for adoption competent therapists to work with these families. These self-reported experiences could assist in furthering the understanding of the needs of these children and their families for the therapeutic community and allow for parents of international adoptees to have more parenting support and resources in the future.

AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the extent to which a brief tailored parenting program administered in a pediatric clinic can change high-risk parenting behaviors. Parents with a child five years old or younger presenting to a University-based primary care pediatric clinic in a large Midwestern children's hospital were invited to participate in the study. Parents completed RISE UP!, which included an assessment completed on a tablet computer and then received a tailored, printed report that provided recommendations to address the personal high-risk parenting practices identified by the assessment. A follow-up assessment was completed with 125 parents (58%) about six weeks after the pediatric visit. Overall, 75% of parents reported trying at least one of the recommendations included in the report. Analysis of parenting risk indicated that 53% of parents had different highest parenting risk areas after RISE Up! and 33% of identified parenting risk scores decreased after RISE Up! Of the 231 priority unintentional injury risk behaviors identified, 34% were reported as non-risk behaviors at follow-up. Race and education were significantly associated with program effects in bivariate analysis; program effects were also correlated with communication mediators in a strong dose-response relationship. Reducing both child abuse and neglect and pediatric unintentional injuries are global priorities. Several childhood injury prevention frameworks and evidence-based policy recommendations highlight shared etiologies and opportunities for intervention. RISE Up! shows promise for universal prevention to promote the adoption of parenting practices to reduce injury risk and positive parenting behaviors.

AB  - Research has shown that students and teachers can benefit from structured in-school helping relationships in which peers assume formal roles as tutors. For the student in need of academic help, peer tutoring programs provide an opportunity to learn in a more nonthreatening environment than the classroom. Immediate feedback and clarification of information is possible. For the student tutor, these programs reinforce their own knowledge, build their self-esteem, and develop a sense of responsibility. The experience may result in improved attitudes for both the tutor and the learner, and can also foster cross- cultural and interracial awareness. The use of peer tutors in the classroom can make teachers more flexible and enable them to better target their efforts toward individual students. Effective peer tutoring programs have used the follow steps to guide their work: (1) establish a planning group; (2) assess student needs; (3) develop measurable goals and objectives; (4) determine faculty, material, and equipment needs; (5) develop a draft plan for school staff and parental review; (6) formally present a revised plan; (7) conduct an orientation; and (8) conduct ongoing evaluation. Peer tutoring is an underutilized instructional strategy in urban schools. (VM)

AB  - How does living through a crisis affect a child's inner world, behavior, and relationships? What can practitioners do to help children cope with extreme stress and build needed skills for the future? Now in a completely revised and updated third edition, this widely adopted text demonstrates effective play therapy approaches for children struggling with a range of crises in the family, school, and community. More than an update, the third edition has been extensively rewritten with the latest knowledge on crisis intervention, trauma, and short-term play therapy, and 17 of the 21 chapters are entirely new. Accessible, timely, and practical, this is an essential resource for practitioners and students alike. The volume retains the focus on in-depth case studies that made prior editions so popular, providing step-by-step descriptions of individual, group, and family play interventions. Case material is presented in a two-column format that gives the reader not only the content of the therapy sessions, but also the clinicians accompanying thoughts and decision-making processes. Expert contributors explore issues involved in working with children who have experienced such stressful events as parental death or divorce, abuse and neglect, violence in the school or community, and mass trauma. Important new topics include the crisis of parental military deployment, the impact of natural disasters on families, immigration-related trauma, terrorism, and disrupted adoption. Ways to involve parents and caregivers in treatment are discussed, as are strategies for preventing the secondary traumatization of therapists. Throughout, discussion questions and exercises deepen the reader's learning. The Appendix features useful information about play therapy resources and training. Facilitating directed, strengths-based intervention with vulnerable children and families, this book offers indispensable insights and tools for practicing social workers, child and school psychologists, play and art therapists, counselors, family therapists, and psychiatrists. It will serve as a core text in graduate-level courses. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

In conclusion the committee finds it to be very apparent, that present conditions in relation to the illegitimate sale, distribution and traffic in all narcotic drugs and of cocaine throughout the country, in spite of all legislative, executive and administrative efforts to curb it, has materially increased, which is the absolute undeniable, but shameful and sorrowful truth and demands a call for united general public activity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Skin diseases cause negative impact on the emotional state, social relationships and daily activities, due to the stigma caused by the appearance of the lesions. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the quality of life of pediatric patients with skin diseases attending a dermatology service, compare the scores obtained among the dermatoses found in the sample and associate them to the variables, in addition to observing how the skin disease specifically affects quality of life. METHODS: Cross-sectional study, with patients between 5 and 16 years attending the Dermatology Service of the University of Health Sciences of Porto Alegre, Brazil, between July 2010 and February 2011. The data collection instruments were the Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index questionnaire and the AUEQI questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 161 patients were interviewed, with mean age of 9,66 years. The main dermatoses were atopic dermatitis (29.8%), warts (13%) and molluscum contagiosum (7.5%). Chronic diseases (73.9%) were the most prevalent. The overall mean Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index score was 5.01 for chronic dermatoses and 2.07 for acute illnesses, indicating a compromised quality of life among chronically ill patients. The comparison between the scores obtained with the AUEQI scale and the Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index scores indicates that the overall quality of life is less affected than the specific quality of life related to the dermatosis. CONCLUSIONS: The data presented reinforce how important it is that the patients, their families and caregivers understand the symptoms, triggers and treatment of the skin disease in question. This information facilitates adherence to the treatment and justifies the conduct adopted by the dermatologist.

AB  - Reports a study of what characterises urban pedagogy and outlines research to better define the concept as currently debated in one local education authority (LEA). Also considered is a strategy for equipping educational psychologists in training with the research skills required to adopt more agentive roles in organisations. As part of an initial professional training programme, live research commissions were undertaken linked to an LEA development plan. This particular commission included the interviewing and observation of 13 teachers working with pupils at key stages 2–4 in inner city schools, who had been identified as exceptionally skilled by LEA advisers. Findings indicate some of the teachers' priorities, including maintaining control, working at a brisk pace and sustaining pupil engagement. These features are related to the belief systems and models of pedagogy held by the teachers and were deconstructed to 3 main elements: the importance of academic achievement to urban children, a focus on the whole child in the educative process, and a passionate desire to break the cycle of social deprivation. Implications are discussed in relation to LEA policymaking, the initial training of educational psychologists and ways of enhancing future educational psychology services.

From the clinical equipoise literature, future trials are justifiable if there is "honest, professional disagreement in the community of expert practitioners as to the preferred treatment". Empirical data are sparse about how clinicians apply the principles of equipoise to the justification of future RCTs. For example, selective decontamination of the digestive tract (SDD) is not widely used in critical care practice despite the strength of the evidence base and therefore provides a unique opportunity to learn how clinicians think about the ethics of further RCTs in critical care.<bold>Methods: </bold>In an international interview study of views of healthcare professionals about SDD, we undertook a secondary analysis of qualitative data collected using a Theoretical Domains Framework of clinical behaviour. We adopted a general descriptive approach to explore how physicians determined whether another RCT of SDD is ethical. Following a constant comparison approach, three investigators reviewed 54 purposively chosen transcripts from three international regions. We interpreted the data using thematic analysis.<bold>Results: </bold>We grouped participants' responses into four inter-related themes: 1) cultural norms about evidence and practice within healthcare; 2) personal views about what evidence is current or applicable; 3) the interpersonal and relational nature of professional decision making locally; and 4) an a priori commitment to future trials. The analysis also identified several unresolved tensions regarding when a future RCT should be pursued. These tensions focused on a clash between potential benefits to current individual patients and potential future harms to patients more broadly.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Our study suggests that ethical decision making about future RCTs in the field of SDD does not rely strongly on appeals to evidence, even when the quality of the evidence is reasonably high. Rather, "extra-evidential" reasons, including social, professional, and relational factors, seem to influence opinions regarding the ethics of future trials. Further work is required to see if these conclusions are applicable to other clinical topics and settings.

AB  - With the numbers of minority groups being served in community mental health settings increasing, there is a need to better understand how evidence based practices (EBPs) are being tailored to ensure cultural sensitivity and fit with these populations. While cultural adaptations have been made for specific cultural groups, the appeal of the more 'generic' but culturally sensitive EBP is that it is cost effective and allows for more flexibility in program delivery because it can be used with heterogeneous cultural groups rather than single culture groups. Multicultural groups can also foster greater understanding among parents of differing cultural backgrounds and experiences leading to more tolerant and respectful communities. The challenge of this approach is to train therapists to provide the EBPs using culturally sensitive principles that are generalizeable across cultures. The Incredible Years (IY) Parenting program has shown promising effects in many random control group studies with diverse cultures in United States as well as in numerous other countries. This chapter reviews the 'principles' embedded deeply in the IY program, which are designed to provide a culturally sensitive structure to the delivery of the program.

AB  - Background: This study examined cross-sectional data collected from substance-using female sex workers (FSW) and non-sex workers (non-SW) in Pretoria, South Africa, who entered a randomized controlled trial. Methods: Women who reported alcohol use and recently engaging in sex work or unprotected sex were recruited for a randomized study. The study sample (N = 506) comprised 335 FSW and 171 female non-SW from Pretoria and surrounding areas. Self-reported data about alcohol and other drug use as well as treatment needs and access were collected from participants before they entered a brief intervention. Results: As compared with female non-SW, FSW were found to have a greater likelihood of having a past year diagnosis of alcohol or other drug abuse or dependence, having a family member with a history of alcohol or other drug abuse, having been physically abused, having used alcohol before age 18, and having a history of marijuana use. In addition, the FSW were more likely to perceive that they had alcohol or other drug problems, and that they had a need for treatment and a desire to go for treatment. Less than 20% of participants in either group had any awareness of alcohol and drug treatment programs, with only 3% of the FSW and 2% of the non-SW reporting that they tried but were unable to enter treatment in the past year. Conclusion: FSW need and want substance abuse treatment services but they often have difficulty accessing services. The study findings suggest that barriers within the South African treatment system need to be addressed to facilitate access for substance-using FSW. Ongoing research is needed to inform policy change that fosters widespread educational efforts and sustainable, accessible, woman-sensitive services to ultimately break the cycle for current and future generations of at-risk South African women.

AB  - This study examines the relationships among corporate board involvement, total quality management (TQM) adoption, perceived market competition, and the perceived effect of quality improvement (QI) activities for a sample of nursing homes in Pennsylvania. The findings of this study have several implications for healthcare managers interested in maximizing the effectiveness of QI efforts. Board involvement in quality improvement was an important predictor of QI outcomes in the areas of finance, resident care, and human resources. However, TQM adoption had a positive effect on human resources outcomes only. These findings suggest that board involvement in any organized form of QI may be more important than the adoption of a formal TQM program in the nursing home industry. TQM's emphasis on employee empowerment may account for its positive influence on human resources. Perceived competition was associated with better financial outcomes. Low-cost leadership can be a key to survival in more competitive markets, requiring a focus on efficiency and productivity issues in QI efforts. By focusing on process improvement, the facilities may achieve cost reductions that can result in an improved financial position. Facilities perceived to be in more competitive environments were also more likely to adopt TQM. This is consistent with the assertion by resource-dependence theorists that organizations facing competition for resources must be responsive to the needs of resource-providing constituencies.

AB  - In child welfare in Ontario (Canada), neglect is a major concern due to high incidence rates compared with other maltreatment types. This qualitative study examines child welfare service directors' and providers' experiences with implementing the SafeCare® program, an evidence-based intervention that is aimed toward the prevention of child neglect. Service directors (n = 9) and providers (n = 15) were recruited from six Ontario child welfare agencies that had been delivering SafeCare for 1.5 years. Data were gathered using semi-structured focus groups which asked about reasons for adopting SafeCare, positive experiences and challenges with implementation, and SafeCare's sustainability within agencies. Overall, service directors and providers rated SafeCare as a valuable program that contributed to positive outcomes for participants (e.g., family reunification), providers (e.g., enhanced skills), and the agency (e.g., increased value). Among the factors that contributed to a positive implementation experience were the structured and skills-based approach of SafeCare, as well as the flexibility to meet the diverse needs of families. Service directors also described SafeCare as a vehicle for changing views and increasing enthusiasm among providers and the agency toward evidence-based practices within child welfare. In terms of challenges, service directors and providers noted limited financial resources for continued training in the program as well as reluctance toward certain aspects of SafeCare (e.g., audio recording). Findings are important for purposes of refining SafeCare's implementation and better ensuring its sustainability within Ontario child welfare. Findings also provide important information about family-, provider-, and agency-level variables that play a role in successful program implementation and sustainability, as well as in changing perspectives and ensuring the engagement of child welfare toward structured evidence-based programs.

AB  - This article discusses the LosAngeles LGBT Center's Recognize, Intervene, Support and Empower (RISE) Initiative's training evaluation; trainers' experiences with bias, and the impact that participant bias had on the delivery of the training intervention. This article also discusses ways in which the Outreach and Relationship Building (ORB) personnel mitigated risks, and how the short-term outcomes were interpreted in the context of the experiences of bias. This article proposes that, after initial training on youth who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or questioning (LGBTQ), staff need coaching and follow-up training to effectively address and reduce the mistreatment of this population in child welfare settings and decrease anti-LGBTQ+ bias.

AB  - Schistosomiasis is a major neglected tropical disease that afflicts more than 240 million people, including many children and young adults, in the tropics and subtropics. The disease is characterized by chronic infections with significant residual morbidity and is of considerable public health importance, with substantial socioeconomic impacts on impoverished communities. Morbidity reduction and eventual elimination through integrated intervention measures are the focuses of current schistosomiasis control programs. Precise diagnosis of schistosome infections, in both mammalian and snail intermediate hosts, will play a pivotal role in achieving these goals. Nevertheless, despite extensive efforts over several decades, the search for sensitive and specific diagnostics for schistosomiasis is ongoing. Here we review the area, paying attention to earlier approaches but emphasizing recent developments in the search for new diagnostics for schistosomiasis with practical applications in the research laboratory, the clinic, and the field. Careful and rigorous validation of these assays and their cost-effectiveness will be needed, however, prior to their adoption in support of policy decisions for national public health programs aimed at the control and elimination of schistosomiasis.

AB  - Objective: To develop and validate a questionnaire based on agency theory to measure continuity of care in a community-based diabetes control program in Shanghai, China. Study Design and Setting: Continuity of care was conceptualized in relation to two domains: information transfer and goal alignment. The questionnaire combined scales adopted from two validated questionnaires: the Primary Care Assessment Survey and the Summary of Diabetes Self-care Activities Measure. Patient interviews were conducted with 156 diabetes patients in the intervention group and 182 in the control group in two community health settings in Shanghai, China. The questionnaire was validated in terms of Likert-scaling assumptions, data completeness, score distribution, construct validity, and sensitivity. Results: All scales consistently showed strong measurement properties in item reliability and validity. Requirements of data completeness and distribution were achieved in all scales. Principal components analysis of six scales provided a satisfactory explanation of the hypothesized scale-domain construction. Conclusions: The validation results suggested that the scales in our continuity of care questionnaire are consistent with the concept of continuity of care based on agency theory.

AB  - Objective. There are conflicting views on the postoperative stability of surgery-first and surgery-early approaches in orthognathic surgery. We systematically reviewed the literature to compare the difference in postoperative stability between a surgery-first/early orthognathic approach (SFEA) and a conventional orthodontics-first approach (COA). Study Design. PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched for studies related to the postoperative stability of SFEA. The primary outcome was the horizontal relapse at the pogonion. Weighted mean differences with 95% confidence intervals were pooled using a random-effects model. Results. We analyzed 12 studies (total of 498 participants). The pooled estimate suggested that the SFEA group manifested less postoperative stability than COA group (weighted mean difference, 1.50; P < .00001), with moderate heterogeneity (I-2 = 53%). The result of subgroup analysis yielded no subgroup difference. Sensitivity analysis conducted by omitting one study at a time further validated the robustness of the result. Conclusions. Based on the meta-analysis, the mandible tends to rotate counterclockwise more in the SFEA group, which indicate a poorer postoperative stability than in the COA group. Patient screening and treatment plans should be reviewed carefully to compensate for possible postoperative relapse when adopting SFEA.

(2005) Journal of Advanced Nursing49(5), 513–521Stages of change for physical activity among family caregiversThis paper reports a study exploring the factors that affect stages of change for regular physical activity in family caregivers in Taiwan.In Chinese society, family caregivers play a significant role in the treatment of mentally ill patients in home care because of Chinese cultural obligations. Prochaska and DiClemente's transtheoretical model suggests that individuals adopting physical activity behaviour move through five stages of change. Discovering the factors that affect the stages of change for physical activity of family caregivers of mentally ill patients could have a significant impact on the health of this population, as well as on the health of the patients for whom they care.Family caregivers’ stages for regular physical activity were assessed using The Stages of Change for Regular Physical Activity Questionnaire. Demographic factors were measured using The Family Caregiver's Demographic Characteristic Questionnaire. Data were collected from 108 primary family caregivers of mentally ill patients receiving home care from a psychiatric hospital in southern Taiwan.Older caregivers were more likely to be in the action/maintenance stage compared with younger caregivers age [rs(108) = 0·24,P < 0·05]. Caregivers’ stages of change were significantly associated with caregivers’ relationship to the patient [χ2(6,n = 108) = 13·68,P = 0·03], and marital status [χ2(4,n = 108) =10·56,P = 0·03].The findings on relationships between stage of change for physical activity, caregivers’ age, relationship to the patient, and marital status represent a first step in better understanding those who do and do not intend to engage in a regularly active lifestyle among family caregivers in Taiwan. This study reveals that cultural issues may play a critical role in physical activity behaviour among Taiwanese family caregivers and need to be further investigated.

AB  - Aim This study examined the reliability and validity for Taiwanese populations of three Chinese-version tasks of the Mayer--Salovey--Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT): a face task (FT), emotional-management task (EMT) and emotional-relations task (ERT). Background For patients with schizophrenia and affective disorders, one aspect of successful outcomes of treatment and nursing care in primary healthcare is patients' ability to manage emotions (Russell & Potter 2002). Emotional management is the ability to modulate one's own and others' feelings to deal with stress and to promote self-understanding and growth (Mayer et al. 2003, Green et al. 2005). This ability can be assessed in western populations using the MSCEIT, as recommended by a National Institute of Mental Health conference breakout group, Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (NIMHMATRICS) (Green et al. 2005). The MSCEIT is a valid and reliable self-administered tool to assess emotional intelligence that is a cognitive- and emotional-processing ability (Mayer et al. 2003). However, no scale assessing these abilities in Taiwanese populations was found in a literature review. The MSCEIT includes eight tasks in four branches: perceiving emotions, facilitating emotions, understanding emotions and managing emotions (Mayer et al. 2003). The perceiving-emotions branch includes face and picture tasks that measure ability to recognise feelings. The facilitatingemotions branch includes two tasks that measure ability to generate emotions to foster ideas. The understanding-emotions branch includes two tasks that measure ability to understand simple and complex emotions. The managingemotion branch contains EMT and ERT that measure ability to manage emotions in solving problems. This study followed the NIMH-MATRICS suggestion to assess emotional-management ability using three tasks (FT, EMT and ERT). In the FT, participants identify degree of facial expression. In the EMT, participants identify effectiveness of strategies to manage their emotions to solve problems. In the ERT, participants identify effectiveness of strategies needed to incorporate emotions into decision-making involving other people (Mayer et al. 2003). Methods A non-experimental cross-sectional survey was used with a convenience sample of three groups of adults (age ≥18 years). Group 1 (53 undergraduate and graduate students) was used for reliability testing. Group 2 (40 security guards and maintenance personnel) and group 3 (38 clinical patients with schizophrenia and affective disorders) were used for validity testing. Participants in group 2 and 3 had no significant differences in age and educational level. After the study site's institutional ethics committee approved the study, data were collected. The study purposes and procedures were explained, and subjects' confidentiality and anonymity were assured. All individuals signed written informed consent before participation. Data were collected by personal data sheet, three Chineseversion MSCEIT tasks (Mayer et al. 2003) and the Wong and Law Emotional Intelligence Scale (WLEIS) (Shi & Wang 2007). The personal data sheet recorded sex, age, educational level and marital status. The three Chinese-version MSCEIT tasks tested participants' emotional intelligence. The WLEIS tested the criterion validity of MSCEIT subscales. The WLEIS is a 16-item self-report measure with a seven-point Likerttype scale for assessing emotional intelligence based on a trait-oriented model. The 49 items of the three Chinese-version MSCEIT tasks were satisfactorily translated and back-translated from English to Mandarin Chinese in this study. The 20-item FT includes four item parcels, each with five responses on a fivepoint scale. The 20-item EMT includes five parcels with four responses each. The nine-item ERT includes three parcels with three responses each. The stability of MSCEIT subscales was established by intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) for group 1. Item-scale correlations were analysed by Pearson's coefficients. MSCEIT internal consistency was established by Cronbach's alpha for three groups. The criterion validity of the MSCEIT tasks was analysed by the ICC correlations between their scores and the WLEIS scores for group 3. Differences between the three groups were assessed by ANOVA ANOVA. Results The total sample was on average 29.9 years old (SD 9.54), with 13.91 years (SD 2.78) of education. The majority was women (n = 78, 60%). Subjects' mean scores by group and Cronbach's alpha for each task are reported in Table 1. For group 1, the six-week, test--retest correlation for 49 items was 0.76 (ICC), with confidence interval 0.337-0.802. High ERT scores were associated with high EMT (r = 0.53, p<0.01) and FT (r = 0.37, p < 0.05), but EMT and FT scores were not significantly associated. In validity testing, high WLEIS scores were mildly correlated with high FT (ICC = 0.28), EMT (ICC = 0.31) and ERT (ICC = 0.23) for 38 clinical patients with schizophrenia and affective disorders, but only EMT reached significance. In cross-sample validity testing, the three groups differed significantly in scores for the three tasks (Table 1). Conclusions This study provides evidence for the stability, internal consistency, criterion validity and cross-sample validity of three Chinese-version MSCEIT tasks, which are stable subscales for assessing emotional intelligence. Cronbach's alpha and item--scale correlations indicate that FT and ERT form coherent subscales. Our EMT scores had a lower internal consistency than that previously reported (Mayer et al. 2003), suggesting that EMT may not be appropriate to use separately for Taiwanese people. However, we found the three MSCEIT tasks had low correlations with the WLEIS for clinical psychiatric patients. This unexpected finding may be attributable to the two scales assessing different types of emotional intelligence (Goldin et al. 2008). The MSCEIT measures test-related emotional intelligence and the WLEIS measures self-perceptions about emotional intelligence. Finally, the cross-sample test showed that the three tasks had enough sensitivity to measure performance differences between different groups. To conclude, the construct validity of the three Chinese-version MSCEIT tasks needs to be examined by factor analysis on larger clinical samples with psychotic disorders. The tasks are reliable tools that may be suitable for measuring ability to manage emotions in Taiwanese individuals with psychosis. Relevance to clinical practice Emotional intelligence plays a meaningful role in clinical nursing practice (Akerjordet & Severinsson 2007). Managing emotions such as aggression, anger, fear, anxiety and depression is a mental health issue in primary healthcare for both health providers and psychotic patients (Russell & Potter 2002). The three Chinese-version MSCEIT tasks include 49 items that can easily be applied to assess ability to manage emotions. These tasks can help in assessing the emotional intelligence of Taiwanese individuals with mental illness. The three tasks may also be used to evaluate treatment effects or nursing care outcomes aimed at improving patients' ability to manage emotions in solving daily problems.

AB  - Introduction: Rapid laboratory glucose testing assists prompt on-site treatment for abnormal glycaemic episodes. New generation Point-of-Care Testing (POCT) for whole blood glucose analysis have high sensitivity and short processing time, which is competent for on-site rapid glucose testing. Aim: To assess the accuracy and Turn Around Time (TAT) of the POCT (Rightest GM700 Pro) compared with the Central Laboratory Testing (CLT) at a National Level, Urban Hospital. Materials and Methods: A retrospective study of 1,812 patients was conducted for glucose testing at the Laboratory Department of Cathay General Hospital from November 2016 to November 2017. Consistency between GM700 Pro and Beckman Coulter AU680, used as CLT, was analysed. TAT was measured from phlebotomy to result availability in Laboratory information system (LIS). Two widely accepted standards for blood glucose meters ISO 15197:2013 (for self-monitoring) and USFDA Prescription Point-of-Care Use (for hospital use) were adopted to evaluate the accuracy. Pearson's correlation and Passing-Bablok regression were used for the analysis. Bland-Altman analysis was used to determine the agreement between POCT and CLT glucose results. Results: Linear regression analysis of GM700 Pro showed significant agreement (y=0.97x-0.89, r³ =0.99) with CLT. Results of TAT indicated that POCT generated glucose report for clinical decision-making was 7 times faster than CLT (p<0.0001) in general practice. Conclusion: Point-of-Care Testing GM700 Pro is reliable and efficient for on-site glucose analysis.

AB  - The influence of family relationships on the management and outcomes of chronic disease is addressed. The scope of the report was limited to disorders conventionally referred to as medical rather than psychiatric or behavioral. Included are diseases that require continuing management, and diseases that pose a continuing threat of recurrence. The goals of the report are to describe a theoretical model of linkages among family relationships, disease management, and chronic-disease outcomes; to provide an overview of the literature on family factors that are known to influence chronic disease, on the basis of empirical data; to review family-focused intervention trials in chronic disease; and to provide a set of recommendations for the next stage of research on family interventions aimed at improving the management of chronic disease. A family-centered rationale for adopting a social-context perspective in disease management as a basis for integrating personal, social, and community factors that affect disease outcome is presented.

AB  - This study implemented a qualitative approach to examine the phenomenon of "inquiry-based science pedagogy or inquiry instruction" as it has been experienced by individuals. Data was collected through online open-ended surveys, focus groups, and teacher reported self-reflections to answer the research questions: 1) How do middle level science teachers conceptualize "inquiry-based instruction?" 2) What are preferred instructional strategies for implementation in middle level science classrooms? And 3) How do middle level science teachers perceive the connection between science instruction and student learning? The participants within this research study represent 33 percent of teachers in grades 5 through 9 within six school districts in northeastern Pennsylvania. Of the 12 consent forms originally obtained, 10 teachers completed all three phases of the data collection, including the online survey, participation in focus groups, and teacher self-reflection. 60 percent of the participants taught only science, and 40 percent taught all content areas. Of the ten participants, 50 percent were certified teachers of science and 50 percent were certified as teachers of elementary education. 70 percent of the research participants reflected having obtained a master's, with 60 percent of these degrees being received in areas of education, and 10 percent in the area of science. The research participants have a total of 85 collective years of experience as professional educators, with the average years of experience being 8.5 years. Analysis of data revealed three themes related to research question #1) How do middle-level science teachers conceptualize inquiry-based instruction? and sub-question #1) How do middle-level science teachers characterize effective instruction? The themes that capture the essence of teachers' formulation of inquiry-based instruction that emerged in this study were student centered, problem solving, and hands-on. Analysis of data revealed one theme related to research question #2) What are preferred instructional strategies for implementation in middle level science classrooms? and topical sub-question #2) How do middle level science teachers structure instruction. The theme that emerged was needs of students. Analysis of the data revealed one theme related to research question #3) How do middle level science teachers perceive the relationship between science instruction and student learning? and topical sub-question #3) How do middle level science teachers view their role in relation to student learning? This theme is meaning making. Analysis of the data related to meaning making revealed two sub-themes of application and relationships. It is clear that middle level science teachers have a vision for inquiry-based science instruction, but implementation is inhibited by a variety of factors including curricular programming that is very broad and lacks depth, the scheduling of time and resources for science, and the absence of a clear model of inquiry-based instruction. In addition, only one participant referenced students investigating their own authentic questions and no participants reflected on the importance of students using evidence in their explanations of scientific phenomenon. Additionally, participants continually reflected on the needs of their students informing instructional practices, and it is wondered if there is a clear understanding among middle level teachers of how students learn science. Real world applications were recognized as important within science learning and the researcher questions whether teachers of science have adequate opportunities to explore real world application of science concepts throughout their careers in order to foster connections within the classroom. These findings support the need for strong, job-embedded professional development, the cultivation of learning communities dedicated to the investigation and implementation of inquiry-based science, the focusing of curricular programming to allow for in depth investigation of scientific concepts, and the commitment of time and resources to support effective science instruction. In addition, it is recommended that additional support be provided to teachers of science to engage in job shadowing, field experiences and internships to allow for the uncovering of applications of science beyond the classroom. Throughout the United States, there continues to be a clear call for reform in the area of science education. These research findings must inform the work of the educational reformers, professional developers, teacher preparation programmers, and researchers as they aspire to improve the quality of student learning and science instruction. In addition, this research supports the need for ongoing reform efforts to science curriculum, instruction and assessment and the need for more effective teacher preparation programs and professional development programs for teachers of science.

AB  - Physicians experience many emotionally challenging situations in their professional lives, influencing their emotional state through emotion contagion or social appraisal processes. Successful emotion regulation is crucial to sustain health, enable well-being, foster resilience, and prevent burnout or compassion fatigue. Despite the alarmingly high rate of stress-related disorders in physicians, affecting not only physician well-being, but also outcomes such as physician performance, quality of care, or patient satisfaction, research on how to deal with emotionally challenging situations in physicians is lacking. Based on extant literature, the present article proposes a theoretical model depicting emotions, emotion regulation, and empathy-related processes and their relation to well-being in provider-client interactions. This model serves as a basis for future research and interventions aiming at improving physician well-being and professional functioning. As a first step, interviews with 21 psychiatrists were conducted. Results of qualitative and initial quantitative analyses provided detailed descriptions of the model's components confirming its usefulness for detecting mechanisms linking emotion regulation and well-being in psychiatrist-patient interactions. Additionally, results lend preliminary support for the validity of the model, suggesting that successful regulation of emotions (i.e., achieving a desired emotional state) elicited by cyclical transfer processes in provider-client interactions is associated with both short-and long-term well-being and resilience. Furthermore, empathy-related emotions and their regulation seem to be linked to well-being. Based on the results of the present study, a prospective longitudinal study is under preparation, which is intended to inform effective interventions targeting emotion transfer, empathy-related processes, and emotion regulation in physicians' professional lives. The model and results are also potentially applicable to other health care and social services providers.

AB  - The patient who is admitted into a state mental hospital does not merely enter into a group of separate individuals who are placed together in the same building or buildings. Instead, he enters a social community, with traditions and fixed roles for the hospital staff and for the patients. These status positions have explicit and definite rules and, through the years, have become reinforced by traditions, rituals, and institutionalized ways of doing things. Also, the mental hospital is a relatively self-contained and isolated community. Like any other isolated community, it changes slowly. Innovations are suspect, and disruptions in the patterned routines are often opposed. The way of life in the hospital is such that the personnel who are recruited and who remain reinforce these traditional routines. These observations point to the need of understanding the mental hospital as a social setting for the mental patient. The relationships between the staff and the patients in the mental hospitals can be analyzed and assessed by the ways the staff use their dominance in dealing with the patients. The state mental hospital can be considered a caste-like, relatively isolated, and slow-changing social community. Although the shortage of personnel affects the treatment of the patients, the attitudes of the employees are even more crucial in this respect. The village-like character of the hospital, as shown in its gossip and rumor, tends to type each employee in the eyes of the rest of the personnel and to induce a defensiveness in his personal activities. The formal hospital organization tends to intensify the sense of status--a condition which fosters petty irritations and controversies over the exercise of authority. These intrastaff tensions, as well as the general orientation, affect their attitudes toward the patients. The dominant group, the employees, in the caste-like structure of the hospital, orient their control of the patients predominantly toward custody. Psychotherapy is given minor consideration. The attitudes of the doctors and other members of the professional staff are primarily diagnostic and medical. These diagnostic procedures in some respects have become ends in themselves rather than means to therapy, particularly for the personality psychoses. The pervasive organic approach to disorders, the many patients per doctor, the resistance of some psychotic disorders to short-term psychotherapy, and the traditions of custody discourage systematic psychotherapy and counseling in the typical state mental hospital. The attendants who have the most decisive influence upon the patients are usually a marginal, unskilled, and unstable group whose knowledge of the personal disorders and organic disorders is frequently minimal. Their intent is to see that the patients remain controllable, do not escape, and do their chores. Relations other than those of the commanding and forbidding types are kept to a minimum. The character of treatment and care in the state mental hospitals is largely a function of the attitudes of the citizenry to the mental hospital. Despite the relative indifference of the public and of many public officials, a number of state mental hospitals are in a state of transition not only with reference to improved custodial conditions and practices but also in encouraging research in psychological as well as physical mediums for facilitating the improvement of the patients.

AB  - THE COMPLETE TEXT OF "THE INTEGRATION CRISIS," ISSUED BY THE COUNCIL OF SUPERVISORY ASSOCIATION (CSA), IS PRESENTED. THE COUNCIL STATES ITS OPPOSITION TO CERTAIN POLICIES ADOPTED BY THE SUPERINTENDENT OF NEW YORK CITY SCHOOLS, ITS APPROVAL OF OTHERS, AND ITS PROPOSALS FOR BETTER EDUCATION FOR ALL STUDENTS. THE COUNCIL OPPOSES JOINT ZONING AND EXTENSIVE BUSING OF ELEMENTARY AND JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS. IT FEELS THAT THE CONCEPT OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD SCHOOL IS SOUND, FREE CHOICE OF SCHOOLS SHOULD BE ALLOWED, AND TRANSPORTATION SHOULD BE PROVIDED FOR CHILDREN WHOSE PARENTS WANT THEM TO BE EDUCATED IN OTHER SCHOOLS. THE COUNCIL OPPOSES THE DECISION TO DISCARD GROUP INTELLIGENCE TESTS BECAUSE OF THEIR ALLEGED UNFAIRNESS TO CULTURALLY DEPRIVED CHILDREN--HOWEVER, THE TESTS CAN BE VERY USEFUL IF USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER FACTORS. THE COUNCIL PROPOSES THAT ALL GROUPS CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN THE STRUGGLE FOR INTEGRATION AND BETTER EDUCATION SHOULD UNITE TO ACHIEVE GOALS, THE VARIOUS PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS OF EDUCATORS SHOULD MERGE FORCES, AND A CONCERTED EFFORT TO ACHIEVE AN OPERATING BUDGET OF $1,000 PER PUPIL PER SCHOOL YEAR SHOULD BE SET AS THE IMMEDIATE GOAL. EXCELLENCE IN EDUCATION FOR ALL STUDENTS CAN BE ACHIEVED BY VOLUNTARY PUBLIC NURSERY SCHOOL PROGRAMS, REDUCED CLASS SIZE, A GREATLY EXPANDED GUIDANCE PROGRAM, INSERVICE DEVELOPMENT IN HUMAN RELATIONS, AN ACCELERATED PROGRAM OF SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE, GREATER EXPERIMENTATION WITH NEW EDUCATIONAL APPROACHES, AN INTENSIFIED HIGH SCHOOL PLACEMENT PROGRAM, NEW AND BETTER CURRICULUM MATERIALS, AND FEDERAL SUPPORT FOR DEPRIVED NEIGHBORHOODS.

AB  - This publication aims to present findings of recent research studies, especially relevant to everyday school practices, which affect the provision and realization of equal educational treatment. First, three historical studies which challenge three misconceptions that form the heritage of racial segregation and discrimination in the U.S. are discussed. Several studies address the issue of economics of equality or inter- and intradistrict financial inequalities. Among the issues that are addressed under a section titled the possibilities of school learning is that of autonomous school effects on achievement. Two major studies analyze the subject of desegregation and achievement. One evaluates the federal Emergency School Aid Act (ESAA). The research problem was to discover whether the federal dollars were educationally effective. The second study, undertaken by the Educational Testing Service, was concerned with learning how to foster effective desegregation and integration. It is noted that the ratio of studies focusing on the relationship between desegregation, self-concept, and aspirations is very low. Most difficult is the failure of investigators to develop universally recognized measures of self-concept and aspirations. The development of racial prejudice in children is one of the issues discussed in the section on desegregation and student interaction. The last section addresses desegregation and the role of teachers, principals, and administrators in schools in making desegregation work or not. (Author/AM)

AB  - Objectives: To investigate whether, in the short and medium term, additional support by (a) a physiotherapy assistant improved physical function in young children with spastic cerebral palsy and (b) a family support worker improved family functioning. Design: This was a multi-centre randomised controlled trial (RCT) with blinded assessments and a cost-effectiveness analysis. The children studied had spastic cerebral palsy that was the consequence of perinatal adversity. All were less than 4 years old on entry to the study. Setting: In the child development centre and in the home. Participants: Seventy-six families completed the intervention period. Forty-three families were reassessed 6 months after the end of the intervention and 34 of these after a further 6-month period. Interventions: Randomisation was to: (a) a group who received extra physiotherapy from a physiotherapy assistant; (b) a group who received standard physiotherapy; and (c) a group where the child received standard physiotherapy and the family was also visited by a family support worker. Children in all groups continued to receive standard physiotherapy in addition to the study interventions. Main outcome measures: The child outcome measures were motor functioning, developmental status and adaptive functioning. The family outcome measures were self-reported maternal stress, level of family needs and parental satisfaction. Results: There was no evidence that additional physical therapy for 1 hour per week for 6 months by a physiotherapy assistant improved any child outcome measure in the short or medium term. Intervention by a family support worker did not have a clinically significant effect on parental stress or family needs. Over the 6-month period the total cost of services for each child ranged from 250 pound to 6750 pound, with higher costs associated with children with more severe impairments. No significant relationship was found between measures of intensity of services received by the children and families and the main outcome measures. Low-functioning children, in terms of both motor and cognitive function, were more likely to receive more services in terms of range and frequency. Parents generally reported high satisfaction ratings after all interventions and some stated that the interventions had benefited the child and/or the family. There was therefore a discrepancy between the perceptions of these parents and the objective, quantitative measurements. The family support workers identified a small number of families who were experiencing considerable family problems, but who had not been referred for appropriate support by any other agency. Conclusions: The findings of this study provide support for the current literature that there was no evidence that additional intervention (in this case by a physiotherapy assistant or family support worker) helped the motor or general development of young children with spastic cerebral palsy. Nor was there any quantitative evidence that providing extra family support helped levels of parental stress and family needs. The implication was that the provision of extra physical therapy does not necessarily improve the motor function of a young child with cerebral palsy and additional family support should not automatically be assumed to be beneficial. In addition, no significant association was found between the intensity of the local services provided and any outcome measure, other than a slight association with lowered family needs. The provision of local services was related to the severity of the child's impairments and not to family difficulties. A small group of families with complex family problems needed more service input. There was a wide range in the costs of services. Research is needed to examine what `sufficient' levels of provision or therapy might be for which children and which families. A time series of different levels of input and outcomes would provide valuable information for practitioners. It is also recommended that future assessments of therapies of this type adopt a similar multifaceted approach, which is likely to be more suitable than a simple RCT for the evaluation of clinical interventions where the effects are complex. The most appropriate measures of outcome should be used, including assessment of provision of information and emotional support for families.

AB  - Purpose: To improve the potential for finding clinically important subtypes of patients with lower urinary tract symptoms we developed the CASUS (Comprehensive Assessment of Self-reported Urinary Symptoms). We used it to present data on the experiences of lower urinary tract symptoms in treatment seeking women and men from a prospective observational cohort. Materials and Methods: We created an initial list of lower urinary tract symptoms that were confirmed in 22 qualitative interviews with providers, and 88 qualitative interviews with care seeking and noncare seeking women and men with lower urinary tract symptoms. Items from extant measures were adopted and revised, and new items were developed. All items were evaluated for understanding in 64 cognitive interviews. Items were administered to a prospective cohort of female and male patients with lower urinary tract symptoms who were seeking care. Analyses were done to describe item response distributions and correlations among item responses separately for women and men. Results: A total of 444 males and 372 females provided responses to the CASUS. Several sets of items showed different relationships for women compared to men. In particular the associations between sensation related items and incontinence related items were generally positive among females but often negative among males. Conclusions: After using an intensive development process the CASUS addresses a wide range of lower urinary tract symptoms. It should help identify clinically important subtypes of patients. Further, item collection can provide the foundation for shorter measures for use in the clinic and as trial end points.

AB  - Noting that, in terms of language acquisition, the "basics" at schools should parallel the "basics" of common sense family life, this book examines the connections between play, language development, and learning in young children. Chapter 1 deals with the role of the teacher in a changing society. Chapter 2 addresses some of the important issues regarding the education of young children. Chapter 3 discusses the problem of class size, and chapter 4 outlines ways in which the educational system must change in order to prepare children for the future. Some of the authors' developmental research on children's conceptions of play are reviewed in chapter 5. Chapter 6 examines how play serves to link children's imaginations and fantasies to the real world. Chapter 7 explores the differences between imagination and pretend play, both of which serve to foster cognitive development, while chapter 8 looks at developing a curriculum to promote optimal language development and examines how the social nature of play provides a natural environment for complex language use within the classroom setting. Different perspectives on the topic of second language learning are offered in chapter 9. Chapter 10 focuses on some of the problems associated with teaching children to read. The final three chapters of the book are concerned with the use of play as an effective diagnostic and therapeutic tool for emotional and developmental problems. Contains over 100 references. (TJQ)

AB  - The goal of this study was to examine the effect of resiliency and family support on depression symptoms among 110 indigent adolescents attending a family planning clinic in a large urban city in the US. Findings suggested that several of the resiliency domains, on the Individual Protective Factors Index, as well as family support measured by the Family Support Scale, were associated with depression symptoms. Scores on the self-concept and positive outlook dimensions of the Personal Competence domain, the confidence and assertiveness dimensions of the Social Competence domain, and family support correlated with depression symptoms. The findings also suggested that 16.4% of the teens in this clinic would be classified as clinically depressed and as needing further evaluation. It seems reasonable to conclude that resilient adolescents may possess characteristics, and supports which enable them to cope with life stressors more effectively and avoid depressive symptoms than those who are not as resilient. Given the prevalence and extent of depression among adolescents, it is important to develop interventions to foster attachment and enhance individual protective factors in primary prevention programs as such interventions may ameliorate the effects of high-risk environments.

AB  - Altruism is a prosocial trait that demonstrates selfless concern for others. Lack of altruism can result in school violence and truancy. Educational inclusion has been found to positively impact students with varied disabilities and their peers, socially and academically, but no studies investigated the relationship between general education students and altruism in inclusion settings. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of inclusion on altruism for general education elementary students based on social cognitive theory. This quasi-experimental study measured the effect of inclusion of students with emotional disturbance on the altruism levels of general education students using the Child Altruism Inventory (CAI). A sample of 158 nondisabled, 3rd and 4th grade boys and girls completed the CAI before and 12 weeks after integration of students with emotional disturbance. A control group in a noninclusion classroom and a treatment group from an inclusive classroom with peers with an emotional disturbance were utilized at each grade level. Results of ANOVA testing demonstrated a significant relationship between inclusion on altruism. Regression analyses showed that female students demonstrated higher altruism at pretest and posttest than males, and 9-year-old students demonstrated higher altruism than 8 and 10 year olds. Findings indicated integrating students with emotional disturbance into classrooms significantly raised the altruism levels of their peers. This could result in positive social change because the altruistic benefit of inclusive educational practice may foster heightened sensitivity to individual differences, reduce classroom truancy and violence, and increase prosocial behaviors in future diverse communities.

AB  - To evaluate the type and quality of child care used by low-income families who were either receiving or not receiving subsidized child care, we interviewed 111 African American parents from a randomly selected sample of low-income families. We inquired about their child-care use, satisfaction with care, work stress, and employment history. Using standardized assessment instruments, independent observers in the children's child-care setting evaluated the quality of the care and characteristics of the providers. We found that families using subsidized child care were more likely to use center care and other more formal types of care, while families not using subsidized child care were more likely to use a relative in the relative's home. Families using subsidized care tended to use licensed and registered child-care arrangements more than non-subsidized families. Also, subsidized families spent approximately half as much out-of-pocket money for child care. However, we found no evidence that the care used by families using subsidized care was of any higher quality than that used by non-subsidized families. We examine the possibility that child-care subsidy programs may not be adequately designed or funded to increase the availability of quality child care to low-income families. Educators and policy makers may want to consider additional means of increasing access to quality care in low-income families.

AB  - Objective. Hunger, with its adverse consequences for children, continues to be an important national problem. Previous studies that document the deleterious effects of hunger among children cannot distinguish child from family hunger and do not take into account some critical environmental, maternal, and child variables that may influence child outcomes. This study examines the independent contribution of child hunger on children's physical and mental health and academic functioning, when controlling for a range of environmental, maternal, and child factors that have also been associated with poor outcomes among children.Methods. With the use of standardized tools, comprehensive demographic, psychosocial, and health data were collected in Worcester, Massachusetts, from homeless and low-income housed mothers and their children (180 preschool-aged children and 228 school-aged children). Mothers and children were part of a larger unmatched case-control study of homelessness among female-headed households. Hunger was measured by a set of 7 dichotomous items, each asking the mother whether she has or her children have experienced a particular aspect of hunger during the past year-1 concerns food insecurity for the entire family, 2 concern adult hunger, and 4 involve child hunger. The items, taken from the Childhood Hunger Identification Project measure, are summed to classify the family and divided into 3 categories: no hunger, adult or moderate child hunger, or severe child hunger (indicating multiple signs of child hunger). Outcome measures included children's chronic health condition count using questions adapted from the National Health Interview Survey, Child Health Supplement, and internalizing behavior problems and anxiety/depression, measured by the Child Behavior Checklist. Additional covariates included demographic variables (ie, age, gender, ethnicity, housing status, number of moves, family size, income), low birth weight, child life events (ie, care and protection order, out of home placement, abuse, severe life events count), developmental problems (ie, developmental delay, learning disability, emotional problems), and mother's distress and psychiatric illness. Multivariate regression analyses examined the effect of child hunger on physical and mental health outcomes.Results. The average family size for both preschoolers and school-aged children was 3; about one third of both groups were white and 40% Puerto Rican. The average income of families was approximately $11 000. Among the school-aged children, on average 10 years old, 50% experienced moderate child hunger and 16% severe child hunger. Compared with those with no hunger, school-aged children with severe hunger were more likely to be homeless (56% vs 29%), have low birth weights (23% vs 6%), and have more stressful life events (9 vs 6) when compared with those with no hunger. School-aged children with severe hunger scores had parent-reported anxiety scores that were more than double the scores for children with no hunger and significantly higher chronic illness counts (3.4 vs 1.8) and internalizing behavior problems when compared with children with no hunger. There was no relationship between hunger and academic achievement.Among preschool-aged children, who averaged 4 years of age, 51% experienced moderate child hunger and 8% severe child hunger. For preschoolers, compared with children with no hunger, severe hunger was associated with homelessness (75% vs 48%), more traumatic life events (8.5 vs 6), low birth weight (23% vs 6%), and higher levels of chronic illness and internalizing behavior problems. Mothers of both preschoolers and school-aged children who reported severe hunger were more likely to have a lifetime diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder.For school-aged children, severe hunger was a significant predictor of chronic illness after controlling for housing status, mother's distress, low birth weight, and child live events. For preschoolers, moderate hunger was a significant predictor of health conditions while controlling for potential explanatory factors. For both preschoolers and school-aged children, severe child hunger was associated with higher levels of internalizing behavior problems. After controlling for housing status, mother's distress, and stressful life events, severe child hunger was also associated with higher reported anxiety/depression among school-aged children.Conclusion. This study goes beyond previous research and highlights the independent relationship between severe child hunger and adverse physical health and mental health outcomes among low-income children. Study findings underscore the importance of clinical recognition of child hunger and its outcomes, allowing for preventive interventions and efforts to increase access to food-related resources for families.

AB  - This chapter provides a foundation for understanding the role illness plays in family systems and the implications for effective intervention. Topics include: a biopsychosocial perspective; research about illness; reactions to a diagnosis of serious illness; implications for the family and general caregiving issues. A biopsychosocial approach to helping families who have as their newest member a chronic illness requires that therapists, medical practitioners, and family members create a new system of functioning with each other and the family. Changes that support the interpersonal relationships within the family sustain intimacy and nurture communication create hope and foster coping.

AB  - Recent developments in the neurosciences have led to dramatic breakthroughs in the area of brain development and the understanding of consequences of neglect. Because this process was heretofore not understood, legislators have been wary of drafting child protection statutes that afforded the possibility for arbitrary interference with families. Strict statutory standards have been adopted that allow coercive intervention only in cases where the child is at substantial risk of imminent physical harm, or after some of the most severe consequences of neglect have been identified. These laws do not consider developmental harm because it does not present an imminent danger of physical injury, yet such harm will affect a child throughout life. Current understanding of brain development demonstrates the need for proper nutrition and stimulation during the first three years of life in order for the brain to develop the crucial neurological networks that are foundational to the functioning of an individual. The inadequacy of early brain development has permanent and irreversible consequences, leading to problems in physical, cognitive, emotional, and social domains. Costs to individuals and society as a result of these consequences are generally overlooked. Public policy should be based on current knowledge of brain development and its significant impact on adult functioning. Major preventive efforts must be applied and made available to every child. The focus of these efforts must be child-centered and seen as a basic form of education.

AB  - Women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) develop cardiovascular disease (CVD) earlier and at a more accelerated rate compared to women without SLE. Many women with SLE are unaware of their increased risk despite years spent in the health care system, thus giving the atherogenic process time to accrue damage. Research has not explained fully why women with SLE are unaware of their increased risk for CVD or why awareness does not correspond to risk reducing behaviors. Stage theories of behavior like the Precaution Adoption Process Model (PAPM) propose that health behavior change proceeds through qualitatively different stages, and people at one stage face similar barriers before they can progress to the next. The Common Sense Model (CSM), a self-regulatory model of health behavior, explains the emotional and cognitive processes involved in progression from one stage to the next and the formation of a personal risk/illness representation. Combining the PAPM and CSM helps understand the relationship between risk perception and adoption of risk reducing behaviors. The specific aims of this study were to assess in women with SLE: (1) general knowledge of heart disease compared to women without SLE; (2) awareness of increased CVD risk and CVD risk factors; and (3) personal and healthcare system factors that influence awareness of increased CVD risk and adoption of risk reducing behaviors. Sixty women with SLE, 18 years of age or older, were recruited to participate in this descriptive study. Data included demographic information, self-report questionnaires (perceived CVD risk, CVD risk factors, depression, physical activity), body measures (height, weight, waist circumference, blood pressure), and blood samples for physiologic markers of traditional and novel CVD risk factors (glucose, insulin, lipoprotein lipids, creatinine, C-reactive protein, homocysteine, antiphospholipid antibodies). The Beck Depression Inventory-Primary Care and the Physical Activity Disability Survey were used to determine depression and activity level respectively. General knowledge of heart disease was assessed using the American Heart Association (AHA) National Survey on women's awareness of heart disease. Logistic regression was used to categorize participants into subgroups according to perceived risk and identify important factors that influenced their PAPM stage categorization. Women with SLE in this study were more aware of women's leading cause of death than United States women who responded to the 2006 AHA survey (73% v 57%), but fewer than 25% perceived themselves at increased CVD risk. Age was a significant predictor (p=0.05) for awareness of increased risk; younger age correlated with increased awareness. Most women received information about heart disease from public media. On average, women had 4 CVD risk factors, but they perceived they had only 2. The number of perceived risk factors predicted adoption of risk reducing behaviors (p=0.03). Women in this study with SLE underestimated their CVD risk factors and did not personalize their increased CVD risk. Healthcare providers' identification and discussion of CVD risk factors in women with SLE may enhance their risk awareness and the adoption of risk reducing behaviors. This information may contribute to the development of stage-matched interventions, a potentially more effective and efficient approach than a generic program of risk-reduction, especially in individuals with SLE who face the additional burden of a chronic illness.

AB  - Content and linguistic analyses were conducted on transcripts of unstructured feedback sessions held by psychologists with seven couples who had recently adopted older previously maltreated children. Issues related to attachment difficulties played a prominent role in parents' remarks, particularly regarding children's excessive attention- and proximity-seeking behaviors and concomitant difficulties accepting closeness from others. The four main issues of concern uniquely related to the adoption experience that emerged in feedback interviews were, in order of frequency, attachment, loss and rejection, issues of control, and identity and belonging. Other general parenting and child-rearing issues not specifically related to adoption were also discussed at some length. Parents expressed more negative than positive feelings about the adoption experience, made about equal numbers of references to their children's positive and negative emotional states, and expressed overwhelmingly positive feelings about the helpfulness of feedback sessions. Consistent with the selflessness required of parents during the initial phases of late-placed adoption adjustment, parents used significantly fewer first person pronouns and words relating to self, and a significantly greater percentage of third person pronouns and words related to other people than did a comparison sample of 1695 individuals whose patterns of word usage were analyzed in 43 previous studies using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count Program (LIWC). Parents' remarks also contained significantly more words related to social processes and fewer words related to friends than the comparison sample, perhaps reflecting parents' focus on helping children interact appropriately within the family unit and establish positive emotional bonds with their new adoptive parents. The present study offers a rich analysis of the unique needs and concerns of families who have adopted older children with histories of maltreatment. Mental health care providers and those involved in legal and policy decisions associated with adoption should be cognizant of the substantive differences between the experience of infant adoption and late-placed adoption for adoptees and their families.

AB  - Marriage and family therapists (MFTs) are well prepared to work with clinical issues related to adoption, foster care, and child welfare. Yet, it is unclear how many MFTs see these as viable career opportunities, and it is also unclear if typical clinical training includes content in these areas. Surveys were sent to Commission for Accreditation for Marriage and Family Therapy Education (COAMFTE), Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP), and Council of Social Work Education (CSWE) clinical training programs to assess levels of training in three content areas: adoption, foster care, and child development. Results indicated that many graduates from COAMFTE accredited programs enter adoption and foster care work settings. Although COAMFTE graduates are well trained in child development, most MFFs, social workers, and counselors lack specific training in adoption and foster care. This study has curricular, funding, and mental health parity implications.

AB  - Purpose: This overview of reviews analyses the existing evidence base of functional family therapy (FFT), which is a manualized, family-based intervention for youth with behavioral problems and their families. FFT has been implemented among youth aged 10–18 at risk of, or presenting with, behavioral problems such as delinquency, violence, substance abuse, sexual perpetration, and truancy. Method: A multipronged search was conducted across 15 databases, 10 websites, and expert contacts in February 2018. Results: The search yielded 159 hits of which 31 were included and critically appraised. Included reviews were published between 1986 and 2018 and the number of included studies ranged from 1 to 18 (including 20–5,344 participants). Main effects of the intervention on core outcomes (recidivism and substance abuse) were modest and out-of-home placement was not reported. Secondary outcomes were also modest but generally positive. Conclusions: Findings demonstrate that overall quality of reviews is low, which makes any certainties about FFT inconclusive; this overview provides a concise, valid, and methodologically sound synthesis of the research into FFT, which requires more rigorous investigation.

AB  - Explores the impact of gender and sexual norms on young women's sexual experiences, social expectations, and vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. It is argued that the power imbalance characteristic of sexual relations among adults—with women having less access to critical resources than men—has many of its roots in adolescence. The data that support these findings were collected from studies conducted in Africa, Latin America, and Asia and the Pacific as part of the Women and AIDS Research Program of the International Center for Research on Women. Findings demonstrate that young women are at risk of unintended pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections and HIV/AIDS because of unprotected sexual activity. However, data also highlight that cultural and socioeconomic factors restrict their ability to adopt protective behaviors. It is concluded that interventions to increase the adoption of protective behavior must be based on an understanding of the socioeconomic context of the lives of young people, sexual meanings in their culture, and gender dynamics in the household, community, and intimate relationships. Recommendations for educators, therapists, and counselors who work with young people and their families are given. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Nonhuman animal welfare professionals have been critical of adoption programs that do not charge a fee for adult cats, despite the high euthanasia rate for cats due to a reported lack of homes. The argument against the free cat adoptions cites a devaluation of the cat, which may affect the adopter’s perceived value of the cat and subsequent care. It may also attract low-income adopters who are perceived as unable to fulfill the financial responsibility of acting as caregiver (owner) of a companion animal (pet). This study examined adopters’ attachment to their cats in relation to the payment or waiver of an adoption fee using the Lexington Attachment to Pets Scale and perception of the shelter. No significant differences were found between groups on either measure. Programs such as this create an opportunity to positively affect cats in animal shelters by finding more homes; programs such as this also affect cat overpopulation by putting more altered cats into the community.

AB  - The process of translating scientific findings into clinical and public health settings has only recently received priority attention within the scientific community. Fueled by ``Funding Opportunity Announcements{''} from the National Institutes of Health and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, scientists have begun to explore the pathways to effectively ``transfer{''} promising research accomplishments into effective and sustainable service programs within the health care delivery system. Using Glasgow's RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance) model as a guide, this research team enrolled 428 socially disadvantaged, culturally diverse women living with HIV/AIDS to test the dissemination and implementation of an evidence-based behavioral intervention designed to improve and sustain the physical and emotional health of participants into the Community Health Center (CHC) setting when conducted by trained CHC staff. Findings demonstrate the ability of trained CHC staff group leaders to attain results equivalent or superior to those achieved when conducted by research staff on the three principal study outcomes: depression, medication adherence and HIV viral load. Four of five CHCs involved in the study also identified and successfully obtained funding to continue to run intervention groups, supporting the adoption and sustainability components of the translation model. This study confirmed (a) the ``translatability{''} of the Stress Management And Relaxation Training/Emotional Supportive Therapy (SMART/EST) Women's Program, from academic to CHC settings in two geographic regions with high HIV prevalence among women, (b) the ability of local staff (using the ``train the trainer{''} model) to successfully achieve program fidelity and clinical outcomes, and (c) the sustainability the program beyond the auspices of research support, through supportive CHC leadership securing continued program funding.

AB  - This opening chapter provides an overview of the book. Chapter 2 of the book summarizes current data for problem behaviors among adolescents across five areas including: (1) substance abuse; (2) sexual behavior; (3) delinquency and violence; (4) depression and suicidal ideation; and (5) school failure. Next, chapter 3 addresses the efforts to stem drug use among children and summarizes effective school-based drug prevention programs. Chapter 4 reviews the limited progress made toward reducing early sexual behavior and pregnancy, and the lack of contraceptive use among adolescents. In chapter 5 the increasing threat of youth violence to the public health is examined. Chapter 6 discusses the tendency for depression to co-occur with other debilitating conditions and the deleterious effects of depression in childhood. Chapter 7 provides an overview of what schools can do to address the issue of youth suicide. Chapter 8 addresses the issue of poor nutrition in children and how healthier dietary behaviors can be encouraged. Chapter 9 addresses prevention strategies relating to accidental injury. Lastly, chapter 10 addresses school success as both academic and bonding with the institution's staff to protect against the pitfalls discussed in the previous chapters. The chapter concludes by noting that, as comprehensive as "Healthy People 2000" is, it does not go far enough in addressing the health problems and needs of children and youth. The present volume makes clear that the widespread dissemination of effective health promotion practices and policies to foster social and environmental supports for children's social, emotional, and physical wellness are our best bet toward improving their current functioning as well as their health as adults. Contains 28 references. (SD)

AB  - For decades, empirically tested youth interventions have prevented dysfunction by addressing risk and ameliorated dysfunction through treatment. The authors propose linking prevention and treatment within an integrated model. The model suggests a research agenda: Identify effective programs for a broadened array of problems and disorders, examine ethnicity and culture in relation to intervention adoption and impact, clarify conditions under which programs do and do not work, identify change mechanisms that account for effects, test interventions in real-world contexts, and make tested interventions accessible and effective in community and practice settings. Connecting the science and practice of prevention and treatment will be good for science, for practice, and for children, adolescents, and their families.

AB  - Objective: For child protective services (CPS) youth who may have experienced more than one form of maltreatment, the unique contribution of emotional abuse may be over-looked when other forms are more salient and more clearly outside of accepted social norms for parenting. This study considers the unique predictive value of childhood emotional abuse for understanding adolescent post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology and dating violence. Further, PTSD symptomatology is assessed as an explanatory bridge in the emotional abuse—teen dating violence link. Methods: A random sample of 402 youth from the active caseload of a large urban CPS catchment area participated as part of a larger longitudinal study on adolescent health behaviors. Mid-adolescent youth across types of CPS status were targeted. CPS youth reported on lifetime maltreatment experiences, PTSD symptomatology, and past year dating experiences, using published scales. Results: Over 85% of CPS youth had begun dating. For dating youth, some level of dating violence was common: over half of females (63–67%) and nearly half of males (44–49%). Taking into account other forms of maltreatment, emotional abuse emerged as a significant predictor of both PTSD symptomatology and dating violence among males and females. PTSD symptomatology was a significant mediator of the male emotional abuse-perpetration and the female emotional/physical abuse-victimization links, indicating a gendered patterning to findings. Conclusions: These results indicate that: (1) CPS youth are a high priority group for dating violence and PTSD-linked intervention; and (2) CPS youth continue to experience the unique negative impact of childhood emotional abuse in their adolescent adjustment. All CPS children should be evaluated for emotional abuse incurred, and appropriate intervention attention be given as to how it specifically impacts on the child's approach to relating to themselves and to others. Practice implications: The present study directs practice implications in regards to: (1) the problem of teen dating violence, (2) the salience of childhood emotional abuse; and (3) the importance of targeting PTSD symptomatolgy among CPS youth. A substantial number of CPS youth report early engagement in violent romantic relationships and require support towards attaining the non-coercive relationship experiences of their non-CPS-involved age mates. The topic of dating, healthy dating relationships, and dating violence may need to be part of the regular casework, with a view towards supporting youths’ conceptualization of and skill set for healthy, close relationships. Further, this knowledge needs to be translated to foster parents and group home staff. With regard to the impact of childhood emotional abuse, CPS workers need to be sensitive to its potential for long-term, unique impact impairing relationship development. Emotional abuse is (a) unique among genders (i.e., for females, it clusters with physical abuse) and (b) uniquely predictive of PTSD symptoms and dating violence. Finally, as is consistent with theory and biopsychosocial evidence, PTSD symptomatology is a key causal candidate for understanding maltreatment-related impairment. Attention to targeting PTSD symptoms may be preventative for dating violence; attention to targeting emotional abuse experiences may be preventative for PTSD symptoms. CPS youth are an important population to involve in research, as their inclusion adds to the evidence-base to achieve evidence-informed practice and policy within child welfare.

AB  - Childhood maltreatment captured medical attention almost 50 years ago. Reviews considering the evidence for published maltreatment prevention programming emerged about 20 years ago. In the second decade of the 21st century, evidence-based maltreatment prevention is a reality for at-risk groups; however, the research-to-practice and policy gap remains in most countries. This article considers the importance of personal financial health and how that is necessarily the building blocks of national health. It argues for the primacy of the goal of problem prevention--the prevention of childhood maltreatment. A twofold approach is suggested: (1) broad-scale adoption of evidence-based prevention and (2) and on-going commitment to refining the evidence base for effective, promising, and novel intervention.

AB  - Obtaining informed consent can be challenging in stressful and urgent circumstances. One example is when potential participants have recently had their child removed into care; intervention is urgent and mandatory whereas participation in associated research is voluntary. Using a nested qualitative study, we examined experiences of consent processes in a randomised controlled trial of a family assessment and intervention service for maltreated young children. Some potential participants found it difficult to use information; some believed consenting might influence the return of their child. In response to these ethical challenges, we propose reversing the typical process of securing consent, so that randomisation to an intervention occurs before inviting potential participants to consider the trial. This will avoid delays, delineate research from intervention, and make it easier to consider information. We suggest that this innovation could be useful in trials across service areas that incorporate urgent and complex interventions.

AB  - This dissertation answers the question, 'Why do female adolescents leave prior to completing the residential phase of a drug treatment program?' A consistent pattern of leaving such programs has been documented in the literature but not explained. There are very few studies of the treatment process, especially those aspects of it that contribute to the departures of adolescent females. The program examined in this study was a traditional therapeutic community for adolescents that adopted a confrontational encounter group as a primary intervention. The residential portion of treatment was designed to be completed in approximately one year, during which time residents were to progress through four phases by demonstrating compliance with program rules and objectives. On-site school, family therapy, and occupational training and job placement were also part of the program. A year of post-residential follow-up, called 'live-out', preceded graduation. Qualitative research methods were used in this study. Informants were asked about their backgrounds, family relationships, and all aspects of their experiences in treatment. Multiple interviews were conducted with 28 females (20 who left and 8 who reached live-out). Twelve males (5 who left and 7 who reached live-out) were also included as a comparison group. It was found that, for females who left, a desire to change, initial positive perceptions of the program, confidence in their ability to complete the program, and lack of a desirable alternative to treatment, did not ensure completion. Rather, their motivation to complete the program deteriorated over time as a function of program barriers (e.g. verbal assaults during encounter groups, lack of trust in peers and staff) and lack of strong family support. Males left for basically the same reasons. Both females and males who completed the program expressed many of the same perceptions as those who left. Nevertheless, they believed the program helped them achieve their goal (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This report presents findings from the evaluation of the Regional Adoption Program in New York, a program designed to recruit adoptive families for hard-to-place children. Two hundred children averaging 11 years in age constituted the project's target population. Nearly half these children had a diagnosed medical problem, one fourth a diagnosed psychological problem, and more than half a caseworker-noted behavioral problem. Of the 108 families initially recruited, 61 continued on to a second group session in which background information relevant to adoption of such children was provided. Data from the analysis of the project children are compared with data from the target population of Operation Placement, a similar demonstration project in another geographic area. The relationships between medical, psychological or behavior problem conditions noted in the children and their length of time in foster care, their placement likelihood, and placement disruptions are examined. The effects of the children's sex and race on placement likelihood is also examined. Data for project-recruited families are compared to data for families who had been approved as potential adoptive families by the agency prior to the inception of the Regional Adoption Program. The two family groups are compared on: (1) age, (2) education, (3) income, (4) whether both parents work, (5) whether they already had children, and (6) how many were matched with an adoptive child. The mode of publicity most effective in recruiting project families is also examined. Evaluation and program barriers are described and the feasibility of replicating the project is discussed. (CM)

AB  - Objective. The objective of our research is to examine the impact of New Jersey's welfare reform called the Family Development Program (FDP) on child fostering among children on welfare. Methods. The research and analytical methods we use include an experimental design and probit regressions. Results. Our results show that FDP impacts are confined to children of short-term welfare recipients (new cases) but affects both African-American and white children in this welfare group. Among new cases, FDP decreases the probability of African-American children living in foster families, resulting in a 28 percent change from the baseline prevalence rate of 7.2 percent. In contrast, FDP increases the likelihood of white children living in foster families, leading to a 70 percent change from the baseline occurrence rate of 1.4 percent. Conclusions. We conclude by discussing the policy implications of such segmented impacts of welfare reform for vulnerable child populations.

AB  - Childhood maltreatment has lasting negative effects throughout the life span. Early intervention research has demonstrated that these effects can be remediated through skill-based, family-centered interventions. However, less is known about plasticity during adolescence, and whether interventions are effective many years after children experience maltreatment. This study investigated this question by examining adolescent girls' ability to make advantageous decisions in the face of risk using a validated decision-making task; performance on this task has been associated with key neural regions involved in affective processing and executive functioning. Maltreated foster girls (n = 92), randomly assigned at age 11 to either an intervention designed to prevent risk-taking behaviors or services as usual (SAU), and nonmaltreated age and socioeconomic status matched girls living with their biological parent(s) (n = 80) completed a decision-making task (at age 15–17) that assessed risk taking and sensitivity to expected value, an index of advantageous decision making. Girls in the SAU condition demonstrated the greatest decision-making difficulties, primarily for risks to avoid losses. In the SAU group, frequency of neglect was related to greater difficulties in this area. Girls in the intervention condition with less neglect performed similarly to nonmaltreated peers. This research suggests that early maltreatment may impact decision-making abilities into adolescence and that enriched environments during early adolescence provide a window of plasticity that may ameliorate these negative effects.

AB  - Explores the effects of childhood parentification on adults and presents an individualized, interactive object relations approach (C. Glickauf-Hughes and M. Wells, e.g., 1995) to the treatment of 2 distinctive parentified personality styles (i.e., masochistic and narcissistic) previously described by R. Jones and M. Wells (1996). The authors focus on 3 core clinical issues manifested by parentified adults—shame, splitting, and projective identification. The object relations model of therapy perspective adopted in this chapter focuses the treatment on the relationship between the parentified adult client and the therapist. It is noted that the ultimate goal with parentified clients is to activate real self experiences that have been buried by a family system that required the child to accommodate to and service the needs of parents. In addition, as parentified adults learn empathy for their shamed identities, these clients can be helped to form relationships with others that do not require submission or self-aggrandizement, but instead are built on a foundation of mutuality, respect, and real love.

AB  - This study examines the experiences of treatment foster mothers. It is part of an ongoing longitudinal study of the use, implementation, and effectiveness of treatment foster care. The study sample is 43 treatment foster mothers. Study data are from in-person interviews with mothers in which each is asked to talk about the youth in her care and her experience of being the youth's treatment foster mother. Mothers' responses were analyzed through an inductive and iterative process. The analysis yielded six mutually exclusive categories of experience. Each category was labeled with a name that reflected a critical element of its definition: Strategic, Struggle, Satisfaction, Mothering, Rejection, and 'Other'. Findings suggest wide variation in how treatment foster mothers experience their role and relationships with youth. Study strengths, limitations, and relevant theoretical frameworks for further work are discussed.

AB  - When a new health product becomes available, countries have a choice to adopt the product into their national health systems or to pursue an alternate strategy to address the public health problem. Here, we describe the role for product development partnerships (PDPs) in supporting this decision-making process. PDPs are focused on developing new products to respond to health problems prevalent in low and middle income settings. The impact of these products within public sector health systems can only be realized after a country policy process. PDPs may be the organizations most familiar with the evidence which assists decision making, and this generally translates into involvement in international policy development, but PDPs have limited reach into endemic countries. In a few individual countries, there may be more extensive involvement in tracking adoption activities and generating local evidence. This local PDP involvement begins with geographical prioritization based on disease burden, relationships established during clinical trials, PDP in-country resources, and other factors. Strategies adopted by PDPs to establish a presence in endemic countries vary from the opening of country offices to engagement of part-time consultants or with long-term or ad hoc committees. Once a PDP commits to support country decision making, the approaches vary, but include country consultations, regional meetings, formation of regional, product-specific committees, support of in-country advocates, development of decision-making frameworks, provision of technical assistance to aid therapeutic or diagnostic guideline revision, and conduct of stakeholder and Phase 4 studies. To reach large numbers of countries, the formation of partnerships, particularly with WHO, are essential. At this early stage, impact data are limited. But available evidence suggests PDPs can and do play an important catalytic role in their support of country decision making in a number of target countries.

AB  - OBJECTIVE. This study evaluated the effectiveness of neurocognitive habilitation, a group therapy intervention for foster and adoptive caregivers and their children who were prenatally exposed to alcohol. METHOD. Participants were recruited from clients seeking evaluation for fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND) and were randomly assigned to treatment and no-treatment control groups. Forty children participated in the treatment program and were compared with 38 control participants using the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) and the Roberts Apperception Test for Children (RATC). RESULTS. Significant differences between the treatment and control groups were demonstrated on the BRIEF and on the RATC, suggesting that the intervention improved executive functioning and emotional problem-solving skills. CONCLUSION. These findings yield promising evidence of the effectiveness of the neurocognitive habilitation intervention in improving executive functioning and emotional problem solving in children with FAS or ARND.

AB  - In this chapter we present the relational trust theory, which we are developing to address the particular relational stresses that affect couples in which one or both partners experienced abuse in childhood.. We have found that not all adult survivors suffer relational distress. Nonetheless, it is important to assess for the impact of childhood maltreatment, since it is common and its effects can range along a continuum of 'a remote, almost irrelevant event for some survivors and a central, continually potent experience for others'. We illustrate the theoretical constructs of relational trust theory through the use of case examples. From our experience, we have learned that when working with adult-survivor couples, clinicians can be challenged to recognize and attend to the intermingling influences of gendered power dynamics between partners and the emotional power responses of the adult survivor evoked by power imbalances in couple interactions. Viewing gendered power imbalances in couple interactions as triggering distrustful emotional responses from the adult survivor, which is a key aspect of relational trust theory, we work to help the couple engage in the emotionally and relationally safe interactions of a trusting 'we' approach. The mutuality processes in SERT's Circle of Care can provide an excellent guide for fostering relational connection. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In recent years, several countries have experienced increases in the incidence of serogroup C meningococcal disease. It can be controlled with older polysaccharide vaccines and particularly the recently developed conjugate vaccines. For 21 developed countries, we investigated the role that economic evaluation played in the decision to introduce the conjugate vaccine into either the routine childhood vaccination schedule, as a mass vaccination ‘catch-up’ campaign or not at all. A literature review was performed and experts from these countries were contacted. For six countries, we identified published economic evaluations for meningococcal C conjugate vaccination. In four of them (Australia, Canada [Quebec], The Netherlands and the UK) the analyses were performed before a decision about the use of the conjugate vaccine was made. In all of these countries, the economic evaluation offered guidance as to the most efficient way to add the conjugate vaccine to the routine infant immunisation schedule and, in three countries, this advice was adopted by decision makers. In Portugal and Switzerland, initial vaccination decisions were made without the economic evaluations that are influencing current decision making. Of the countries without economic evaluations, six implemented vaccination programmes. Overall, there was a positive correlation between the reported incidence of meningococcal C disease and (a) the decision to vaccinate and (b) performing an economic evaluation. All economic evaluations were modelling studies. The reported cost-effectiveness ratios were sensitive to the age of vaccination, the future meningococcal incidence, vaccine price and some methodological characteristics that varied widely between studies making direct comparisons difficult. In conclusion, in almost all countries where economic evaluations for meningococcal C conjugate vaccinations have been conducted, their results had an important role in the decision-making process. However, in most countries with strongly increasing meningococcal incidence, public health considerations took precedence. In order to improve the international comparability of such studies, firmer national and international modelling guidelines and better adherence to such guidelines seem necessary.

AB  - Objective: To compare single women, lesbian couples, and heterosexual couples receiving therapeutic donor insemination (TDI). Design: Chart review followed by anonymous mail questionnaires to donor insemination recipients and their partners. Setting: Infertility clinic in a university hospital. Patients: One hundred fifteen women receiving donor insemination were identified by chart review. Results: Too few single women responded for reliable comparison. Lesbian women were similar to married women in age, education, duration, and outcome of donor insemination. When considering alternatives to TDI, married women were more likely to consider adoption and lesbians were most likely to consider using a known semen donor or having intercourse with a man aware of their desire to have a child. Married couples were less likely to tell others, including the child, about conception by donor insemination. They were also less likely to support disclosing identifying data about the donor to the child. Lesbians were more likely to report stress in their relationships as a result of TDI. Married men were most likely to support mandatory counseling before TDI initiation.

AB  - Carmela Wenger explores and demonstrates the usefulness of superheroes in the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of a young male client with reactive attachment disorder. The focus of treatment was on improving the quality of interaction between Damien and his adoptive parents and siblings. The stages of play therapy with Damien paralleled the course of healthy development, moving from the establishment of trust to exploration, risk taking, and ultimately more mature levels of cognitive and affective processing.

AB  - The phonological processing deficit is the major cognitive impairment of developmental dyslexia in alphabetic countries. Some researchers have suggested that there are different subtypes in dyslexia, such as surface or delayed dyslexia and dyslexia with rapid naming deficit. Chinese characters belong to ideogram, with one character usually denoting one morpheme; they do not bear a grapheme-phoneme correspondence. An important question for developmental researchers is what the dominating cognitive deficit is in Chinese developmental dyslexia. Researchers in Hong Kong found that the rapid naming deficit and orthographical skills deficit were the primary cognitive deficits, and there was lower incidence with phonological deficit. However, researchers in Beijing found that Chinese developmental dyslexics mainly possessed morphological awareness deficit. One possible cause of the inconsistency was that the analysis of subtypes in the studies was based on chronological-age controls, which might make the direction of causality unclear between some cognitive deficits and dyslexia because the cognitive skills and reading abilities usually contained interactive relations. In the present study, we intended to further examine the subtypes of Chinese developmental dyslexia, in order to clarify the cognitive deficit profile in Chinese dyslexia. According to the low achievement definition, we selected 29 dyslexics from 654 children aged 9-12.8 years, and comparison groups with appropriate chronological-age (26) and reading-levels (28). Five reading-related cognitive skills were examined, including phonological awareness, rapid automatic naming, morphological awareness, orthographic skills and homophone choice task. Adopting one standard deviation cutoff criterion for every variable based on scores of reading-level controls, we explored the cognitive deficit profile of 29 Chinese developmental dyslexics. Finally Chinese character recognition test was administered in order to investigate whether the children's error pattern and regularity and frequency effect were distinct in different subtypes while reading characters. The main results are as follows. 1. There were different subtypes in Chinese developmental dyslexia, mainly including phonological dyslexia, dyslexia with rapid naming deficit, and dyslexia with double deficits of phonological awareness and rapid naming skills. A small proportion of dyslexics displayed orthographic-skill deficit. Finally, about one quarter of the dyslexics showed no severe cognitive deficits. 2. The dyslexics with phonological deficit exhibited more semantic errors while reading Chinese characters and were less able to detect the partial phonological information of the phonetic-radical in semantic-phonetic compounds. 3. The regularity-frequency effect patterns of children with rapid naming deficit were similar to those of the reading-level controls and revealed a general delay of reading development. They tended to recognize characters by the phonetic-radical. 4. The dyslexics with double or multiple cognitive deficits manifested the most severe reading impairment. The results indicate that the cognitive deficit profiles of Chinese developmental dyslexia were consistent with the double-deficit hypothesis of English developmental dyslexia, illustrating a cross-character consistency. Furthermore, the interaction among the reading-related cognitive skills likely determined the severity of dyslexia. The findings have implications for the diagnosis and intervention of Chinese developmental dyslexia. However the origin of phonological and rapid naming deficit needs to be investigated.

AB  - The recent concern with health care economics has fostered the development of a new discipline that is generally called clinical microeconomics. This is a discipline in which microeconomic methods are used to study the economics of specific medical therapies. It is possible to perform stand alone cost analyses, but more profound insight into the medical decision making process may be accomplished by combining cost studies with measures of outcome. This is most often accomplished with cost-effectiveness or cost-utility studies. In cost-effectiveness studies there is one measure of outcome, often death. In cost-utility studies there are multiple measures of outcome, which must be grouped together to give an overall picture of outcome or utility. There are theoretical limitations to the determination of utility that must be accepted to perform this type of analysis. A summary statement Of outcome is quality adjusted life years (QALYs), which is utility time socially discounted survival. Discounting is used because people value a year of future life less than a year of present life. Costs are made up of in-hospital direct, professional, follow-up direct, and follow-up indirect costs. Direct costs are for medical services. Indirect costs reflect opportunity costs such as lost time at work. Cost estimates are often based on marginal costs, or the cost for one additional procedure of the same type. Finally an overall statistic may be generated as cost per unit increase in effectiveness, such as dollars per QALY. All these measures may be varied by sensitivity analysis to determine the robustness of outcome for medical decision and policy making purposes.

AB  - Florida's foster children are remaining in the foster care system longer than the foster care counselors there to serve them. National foster care indicators reflect a general decline in the time foster care children remain in foster care, while Florida shows a gradual increase. The 12 month median tenure of foster care counselors, is the prime reason for the already extensive and steadily increasing time foster children remain in foster care. Foster care counselors do not have the two years necessary experience to affect the permanency planning process, because 78% of them scored higher on the emotional exhaustion subscale, and 55% of them scored higher on the depersonalization subscale than the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) national sample mean for their peer group, in a job nonsupportive of their operational and basic needs. The purpose of the study was to: (1) identify and understand the relevant retention and burnout issues; (2) assimilate the necessary remedies and coping skills; and, (3) examine the perceptions of the foster care counselors and foster care supervisors as to what should be done. This triangulated study used a qualitative and quantitative research methodology linked to a State foster care program sample base population of five foster care units from Orange County, Florida; and, theoretical consideration was given to the work of Herzberg, Maslow, and Maslach. The MBI and a 67 question survey were given to 36 foster care counselors and compared with 31 interview questions from the five respective foster care supervisors representing 52.5 years of experience in the field.

AB  - The relationship between public and voluntary agencies in the child care field is examined in this discussion of how patterns of public financing of voluntary agency foster care have been influenced by recent changes in public policy. Responses to a 1975 questionnaire sent to state departments administering or supervising services for dependent and neglected children are compared with 1957 data obtained from a similar questionnaire. In the intervening years, changes in federal government policy have encouraged the use of voluntary agencies to provide service through contract arrangements. The period saw an increase in the proportion of total child care programs represented by public fund payments to the voluntary agencies, along with an increase in public control of planning for the children in their care. No state response made reference to the voucher system for promoting consumer choice, although the pros and cons of third-party payment have been much discussed in the literature. Accountability, another aspect of public control of voluntary agencies, was an area of marked development, with child welfare agencies subject to licensing laws in more states in 1975. Increasing reliance on tax funds is seen as a possible threat to the autonomy of the voluntary agencies and to their social action role. Disadvantages of the government's contracting with the lowest bidder involve lowering the quality of service through elimination of programs for staff development, experimentation and advocacy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE-The International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) recently recommended new criteria for diagnosing gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). This study was undertaken to determine whether adopting the IADPSG criteria would be cost-effective, compared with the current standard of care. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS-We developed a decision analysis model comparing the cost-utility of three strategies to identify GDM: 1) no screening, 2) current screening practice (1-h 50-g glucose challenge test between 24 and 28 weeks followed by 3-h 100-g glucose tolerance test when indicated), or 3) screening practice proposed by the IADPSG. Assumptions included that 1) women diagnosed with GDM received additional prenatal monitoring, mitigating the risks of preeclampsia, shoulder dystocia, and birth injury; and 2) GDM women had opportunity for intensive postdelivery counseling and behavior modification to reduce future diabetes risks. The primary outcome measure was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS-Our model demonstrates that the IADPSG recommendations are cost-effective only when postdelivery care reduces diabetes incidence. For every 100,000 women screened, 6,178 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) are gained, at a cost of $125,633,826. The ICER for the IADPSG strategy compared with the current standard was $20,336 per QALY gained. When postdelivery care was not accomplished, the IADPSG strategy was no longer cost-effective. These results were robust in sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS-The IADPSG recommendation for glucose screening in pregnancy is cost-effective. The model is most sensitive to the likelihood of preventing future diabetes in patients identified with GDM using postdelivery counseling and intervention.

AB  - In the current study we aimed to improve center-based child care quality with an attachment-based program: The Video-feedback Intervention to promote Positive Parenting and Sensitive Discipline for Child Care (VIPP-CC). Professional caregivers (N = 64) from child care centers in urban areas in the Netherlands participated in our pretest-posttest randomized controlled trial. The VIPP-CC was effective for increased observed sensitive responsiveness in the group setting of the professional caregiver and led to a more positive attitude towards caregiving and limit setting. Post hoc analyses revealed that the intervention effect was apparent for caregiver sensitive responsiveness in structured play situations. The VIPP approach can now be expanded from the family setting to out-of–home group settings with larger groups of children and professional caregivers. This is a promising conclusion for millions of children enrolled in center child care from a very young age. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Internationally, a typical model of maternity care is a medically led system with varying levels of midwifery input. New Zealand has a midwife-led model of care, and there are movements in other countries to adopt such a system. There is a paucity of systemic evaluation that formally investigates safety-related outcomes in relationship to midwife-led care within an entire maternity service. The main objective of this study was to compare major adverse perinatal outcomes between midwife-led and medical-led maternity care in New Zealand.Methods and Findings: This was a population-based retrospective cohort study. Participants were mother/baby pairs for all 244,047 singleton, term deliveries occurring between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2012 in New Zealand in which no major fetal, neonatal, chromosomal or metabolic abnormality was identified and the mother was first registered with a midwife, obstetrician, or general practitioner as lead maternity carer. Main outcome measures were low Apgar score at five min, intrauterine hypoxia, birth-related asphyxia, neonatal encephalopathy, small for gestational age (as a negative control), and mortality outcomes (perinatal related mortality, stillbirth, and neonatal mortality). Logistic regression models were fitted, with crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) generated for each outcome for midwife-led versus medical-led care (based on lead maternity carer at first registration) with 95% confidence intervals. Fully adjusted models included age, ethnicity, deprivation, trimester of registration, parity, smoking, body mass index (BMI), and pre-existing diabetes and/or hypertension in the model. Of the 244,047 pregnancies included in the study, 223,385 (91.5%) were first registered with a midwife lead maternity carer, and 20,662 (8.5%) with a medical lead maternity carer. Adjusted ORs showed that medical-led births were associated with lower odds of an Apgar score of less than seven at 5 min (OR 0.52; 95% confidence interval 0.43-0.64), intrauterine hypoxia (OR 0.79; 0.62-1.02), birth-related asphyxia (OR 0.45; 0.32-0.62), and neonatal encephalopathy (OR 0.61; 0.38-0.97). No association was found between lead carer at first registration and being small for gestational age (SGA), which was included as a negative control (OR 1.00; 0.95-1.05). It was not possible to definitively determine whether one model of care was associated with fewer infant deaths, with ORs for the medical-led model compared with the midwife-led model being 0.80 (0.54-1.19) for perinatal related mortality, 0.86 (0.55-1.34) for stillbirth, and 0.62 (0.25-1.53) for neonatal mortality. Major limitations were related to the use of routine data in which some variables lacked detail; for example, we were unable to differentiate the midwife-led group into those who had received medical input during pregnancy and those who had not.Conclusions: There is an unexplained excess of adverse events in midwife-led deliveries in New Zealand where midwives practice autonomously. The findings are of concern and demonstrate a need for further research that specifically investigates the reasons for the apparent excess of adverse outcomes in mothers with midwife-led care. These findings should be interpreted in the context of New Zealand's internationally comparable birth outcomes and in the context of research that supports the many benefits of midwife-led care, such as greater patient satisfaction and lower intervention rates.

AB  - This case series study investigated the effectiveness of an integrative eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) and family therapy model, specifically the Integrative Attachment Trauma Protocol for Children (IATP-C), for improving traumatic stress, attachment relationships, and behaviors in children with a history of attachment trauma; specifically, adopted children with a history of maltreatment and foster or orphanage care. Of the 23 child participants, one family dropped out at 6 months, and 22 completed treatment in 6–24 months. Mean treatment length was 12.7 months. Statistical analysis demonstrated significant improvement in scores on children's traumatic stress symptoms, behaviors, and attachment relationships by the end of treatment. Statistical analysis of secondary measures showed significant improvement in mothers' scores related to symptomology and attitudes toward their child. Gains were maintained for the 15 families who complied with completion and returning of follow-up measures. Limitations of the study include the lack of a control group and small sample size. Future directions include controlled efficacy studies with larger sample sizes as well as exploration of application of the model to a similar population of children in other cultures and to children who are not residing in permanent placements.

AB  - The West Virginia Early Childhood Transition Initiative is an interagency systems change effort started in 1993 to develop a seamless system of service for children, ages birth to 5 years. The initiative's training and technical assistance component is known as Operation Tadpole. A state level steering committee coordinates the initiative on an interagency basis. The intended impact of the initiative is to have maximum positive child outcomes through effective early childhood programs that are compatible as the child moves from one to another; positive ongoing relationships among families and professionals; and an effective transition process for children, families, and involved agencies. Interactive training was held in 1994 and 1995 for county and community teams to help them identify strategies that would work in their communities. The process, outcomes, and impact of the transition initiative is being monitored through a multi-year evaluation plan based on the Concerns-Based Adoption Model. Operation Tadpole has had the following outcomes thus far: (1) development of interagency agreements reflecting awareness of need for collaboration; (2) increased use of transition activities; (3) increased compliance with federal and state transition regulations; (4) collaborative training of agency personnel and families; (5) increased interagency childfind activities; (6) pooled resources for childfind and interagency activities; (7) re-evaluation of priority entry criteria to meet identified service gaps; and (8) increased family involvement in transition.

AB  - This dissertation consists of three independent essays on politics and policy in the public sector. The first essay analyzes the political origins of collective bargaining for public employees. I show that the organization of government workers depended first on the effective implementation of civil service reform. However, mandatory bargaining policies were adopted only after the organized labor movement formed an electoral alliance with the Democratic Party. The institutionalization of collective bargaining within government opened to public employees a new avenue of influence, altering the dynamics of bureaucratic governance and partisan competition. The second essay, co-authored with Ludger Woessmann, uses individual-level data from the Third in International Math and Science Study to examine the relationship between class-size and student achievement in eighteen school systems. We combine fixed-effects and instrumental-variables identification strategies to decompose the correlation between class size and achievement into three parts: (i) the effect of class size on achievement; (ii) the sorting of students between schools with different average class sizes; and (iii) the sorting of students within schools into smaller or larger classes. Smaller classes improve test scores in only two countries. Lower achieving students are sorted into smaller classes within and between schools in most countries. Only the United States, a country with decentralized education finance and considerable residential mobility, exhibits regressive between-school sorting. Between-school sorting is more compensatory in systems with ability tracking. Within-school sorting is more compensatory where administrators rather than teachers assign students to classrooms. The third essay, coauthored with Paul Peterson, compares the response of low-performing Florida elementary schools to stigma and competitive pressures under a state accountability plan and the federal law, No Child Left Behind. Estimations rely on individual-level data and exploit cut-points within the school grading systems. Students in schools assigned a low grade and threatened with vouchers made modest gains on the state's accountability exam. No improvements were observed among schools failing to make adequate yearly progress and threatened with public school choice under No Child Left Behind. The results indicate that choice threats within accountability regimes can boost achievement at low-performing schools, but that program design is crucial.

AB  - The pharmaceutical industry has a unique dual role within society in that the companies within the industry develop and distribute health care products in a for-profit manner. The purpose of this study was to examine practices and perceptions of CSR within the pharmaceutical industry. Specifically, the study sought to gain an understanding of the perceptions of middle and senior managers of why and how their companies engage in CSR. The study consisted of two qualitative and complementary research methods. The primary research method was semi-structured interviews with managers lasting up to one hour. The secondary research method involved the collection and analysis of CSR-related publications from pharmaceutical companies. A multiple source approach was used for three specific reasons: 1) triangulate and confirm validity of primary data; 2) identify new areas or gaps in the literature not previously identified; and 3) create a more well-rounded understanding of why and how the pharmaceutical industry engages in CSR. For the interview portion of the study, the population consisted of middle-to-high-level managers of multinational pharmaceutical companies operating in North America, who either had significant responsibilities related to their company's CSR decision-making process or were participants in such programs. The study population for the publication analysis included those pharmaceutical companies whose managers participated in the interview portion of the study. Formal e-mail correspondence was used to contact and invite potential study participants who were informed of the purpose and scope of the research. Non-random, purposive sampling was used to select those within the two key groups of managers deemed to be in a position to provide rich perspectives on the CSR decision-making process within their companies; those engaged with external stakeholders and those with defined roles in CSR. A constructivist grounded theory methodology was applied to the interview process, including the interview guide and data analysis, with the end goal of creating a substantive theory. Coding and categorizing began during the collection of data, and proceeded in a non-linear fashion to allow for the constant comparing and analyzing of the data. These iterative and circular processes developed into theoretical pathways that required further examining and provided additional data. Memos and diagrams were used as markers for thoughts and creative tools to further analyze the components of the developing theory. The result was a theory constructed from multiple perspectives and woven into a multi-story narrative. Managers from eleven companies (nine brand name and two generic) participated in the study. In total, 22 interviews were completed, and consisted of fifteen Canadian managers, six American managers, and one British manager. Additionally, there were three companies where interviews were conducted with managers from both Canadian and American affiliates of the same company. The positions held by respondents within their respective companies included those directly involved in creating, implementing, and reporting on CSR programs and policies, and those distanced from, but still affected by them. The range of perspectives based upon the positions held by participants provided an insightful range of interpretations regarding CSR within the pharmaceutical industry. The resulting substantive theory and its accompanying model present an evidence-based framework for the industry's process of CSR evolution (core category) and articulate the relationships, interactions, and influences of its four subcategories: 1) social context; 2) CSR perspectives; 3) continual development and reinforcement process (CDRP); and 4) symbiotic continuum. The substantive theory suggests that the pharmaceutical industry is in a process of institutional change, with previously taken-for-granted perspectives and strategies in conflict with, and contested within, the social context of the industry. CSR is no longer just a pragmatic/moral strategy to gain, maintain, and repair legitimacy using loosely coupled practices and structures. Logical connections and framing developed and reinforced by institutional entrepreneurs and their resources have constructed the identity of CSR as an umbrella business strategy that can universally resonate with stakeholders and thereby create greater connectedness with operational locals and stakeholders. Subsequently, CSR can be used to mitigate risks and uncertainties while also fostering a motivated and controlled workforce by reinforcing the internalization of desired meanings relating to the role of CSR. By integrating and merging internal and external conceptions of what is considered "right' and how to serve the self-interest of others in addition to their own, companies capture wider social movements in an attempt to find or construct opportunities to enhance their potential for long-term success and sustainability. If these opportunities mean diverting assets and expertise to address social needs, and in so doing, result in tangible (e.g. market entrance) and intangible (e.g. motivated workforce) returns on these investments, then CSR becomes justified and legitimized by bridging the changing institutional logic.

AB  - Background: Alcohol Management Plans (AMPs) were first implemented by the Queensland Government a decade ago (2002-03). In 2008, further stringent controls were implemented and alcohol was effectively prohibited in some of the affected remote Indigenous communities. With the Queensland Government currently reviewing AMPs, prohibitions may be lifted making alcohol readily available once more in these communities. As yet no work explores the impact of alcohol related injuries in relation to individual, family and community resilience in Indigenous Australians. A resilience model recognises individuals and families for their strengths rather than their deficits. By revealing how some individuals and families survive and thrive, new ways of working with families who need support may be identified and adopted. The research will explore in detail the long-term impact of this kind of injury on individuals, families and communities. Methods/design: This project will use a sequential explanatory mixed method design. Four discrete Indigenous communities in Cape York, far north Queensland are included in this program of research, chosen because there is previous data available regarding injury and alcohol related injuries. Four sequential studies will be conducted in order to address the research questions and provide a rich description of the impact of alcohol related injuries and resilience in these populations. The time period January 2006 to December 2011 was chosen because it captures the three years before and three years after 2008 when tight alcohol restrictions were implemented in the four communities. Discussion: Long term effects of the AMPs are as yet unknown and only fragmented attempts to look at the impact of injury related to alcohol have been conducted. A well-structured research program that explores the long-term impact of alcohol related injuries in these communities will help inform policy development to capture the current situation and so that appropriate benchmarking can occur. The project has been approved by the James Cook University Human Research Ethics Committee H5618 & H5241.

AB  - Abstract: This study explores how the lived experience of court-involved youth impacts learning and school culture, and solicits youth voice in creating a trauma-informed intervention to improve student educational well-being. Thirty-nine female students, with ages 14 to 18, participated in focus groups to describe externalizing behaviors that they have both witnessed and personally struggled with in the classroom, discuss the perceived causes of these behaviors, and their suggestions for improving school culture to reduce these behavior manifestations in the classroom. Two major categories of behavior were identified, including: “anger emotions” and “aggressive actions.” Students described the causes of behavior as, “environmental influences” and “triggers.” The most common solutions that students gave to reduce externalizing behaviors in school settings included “encouraging respect of others” and “improving behavior management to enhance student engagement.” An additional solution suggested by the students included the “monarch room as support.” The Monarch Room is an alternative intervention to traditional suspension/expulsion polices that provides students in need of specific emotional support an opportunity to redirect/de-escalate externalizing behavior or mood in the school setting. This study highlights the need for trauma-informed approaches in school settings, and the importance of the inclusion of a youth voice in developing and implementing these intervention models.

By revealing how some individuals and families survive and thrive, new ways of working with families who need support may be identified and adopted. The research will explore in detail the long-term impact of this kind of injury on individuals, families and communities. Methods/design This project will use a sequential explanatory mixed method design. Four discrete Indigenous communities in Cape York, far north Queensland are included in this program of research, chosen because there is previous data available regarding injury and alcohol related injuries. Four sequential studies will be conducted in order to address the research questions and provide a rich description of the impact of alcohol related injuries and resilience in these populations. The time period January 2006 to December 2011 was chosen because it captures the three years before and three years after 2008 when tight alcohol restrictions were implemented in the four communities. Discussion Long term effects of the AMPs are as yet unknown and only fragmented attempts to look at the impact of injury related to alcohol have been conducted. A well-structured research program that explores the long-term impact of alcohol related injuries in these communities will help inform policy development to capture the current situation and so that appropriate benchmarking can occur. The project has been approved by the James Cook University Human Research Ethics Committee H5618 & H5241.

AB  - There are hundreds of thousands of children involved in the child welfare system in the United States. Many of the 20,000 adolescents who age out of foster care every year don't have the skills, support, and connections to successfully transition to adulthood. The three studies presented here apply an ecological framework to understand trajectories for well-being, dysfunction, and activity participation, and their inter-relationships amongst child welfare involved adolescents. All three studies utilize data from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-being (NSCAW), a nationally representative longitudinal sample of adolescents touched by the child welfare system. Study 1 applies structural equation modeling using second order factors to estimate latent growth trajectories for a broad spectrum of adolescent well-being and dysfunction outcomes amongst child welfare involved adolescents. Study 2 examines a trajectory model of activity participation, and compares these trajectories by key demographic and foster care related variables. Study 3 combines the approaches of Study 1 and Study 2 to consider activity participation as a possible promotive/preventative pathway for adolescent well-being and dysfunction outcomes. Results suggest Well-being and Dysfunction represent distinct trajectories on which child welfare involved adolescents vary over time. On average, well-being is increasing and dysfunction is decreasing over time, although there are differences by gender, age, race/ethnicity, and risk level. Participants also varied significantly in their initial levels of activity participation, and their rates of change over time, but the majority of this variability was explained by person-level covariates. Finally, participation in activities has the potential to prevent dysfunction amongst these high risk adolescents, but results were limited to demographic subgroups with the highest base rates of participation, high initial levels of well-being, and high initial levels of dysfunction. The findings have intervention implications for child welfare practice and policy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This report presents an evaluation of family preservation programs in Kentucky, New Jersey, and Tennessee, and a county program in Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania. Key goals of these programs were reducing foster care placement, maintaining child safety, and improving family functioning. The statewide programs employed the Homebuilders program model, and the county program used a broader, home-based service model. Volume 1 of the report describes the study implementation, the study sites, and families in the Homebuilders model sites. Volume 2, which includes an executive summary, examines services and outcomes for both types of programs, analyzes attrition, and presents conclusions. In the evaluation, families were randomly assigned to a family preservation program or to regular service of the child welfare system. Information on parenting practices, family functioning, child well-being, and caseworker-caregiver interaction was collected through interviews. Information on family functioning was assessed at the beginning of services, at the close of Homebuilder services, and 1 year after services began. Administrative data provided information on childrens placements, reentries, and subsequent abuse/neglect allegations up to 18 months after experiment entry. Staff attitudes and characteristics were collected through questionnaires. Discussions with personnel of provider agencies provided information about services, policies, staffing, training, and the service context. Findings revealed that the experimental group received more services and more intensive services than the control group in all four states. There were no significant group differences on family-level placement rates, proportion of time in substitute care, case closings, or subsequent maltreatment. There were a few child and family functioning items in which the experimental group displayed better outcomes than the control group at the end of Homebuilders services, but these results did not occur in more than one state. There were very few differences at the 1-year follow-up. The report's discussion focuses on implications and highlights the need to rethink the functions, target group, and characteristics of services and to examine the issues of program specialization, length, and intensity. Each report section contains references or endnotes. Volume 3 of the report comprises 11 appendices, which include the screening protocol, worker safety checklist, secondary analyses for chapters in volume 2, and study instruments.(KB)

AB  - Objective: Few research designs look at the deep structure of complex social systems. We report the design and implementation of a multimethod evaluation model to assess the impact of computerized order entry systems on both the technical and social systems within a health care organization. Design: We designed a multimethod evaluation model informed by sociotechnical theory and an appreciation of the nature of wicked problems. We mobilized this model to assess the impact of an electronic medication management system via a three-year program of research at a major academic hospital. Measurements: Model components include measurements relating to three dimensions of system impact: safety and quality, organizational culture, and work and communication patterns. Results: Application of the evaluation model required the development and testing of purpose-built measurement tools such as software to collect multidimensional work measurement data. The model applied established research methods including medication error audits and social network analysis. Design features of these tools and techniques are described, along with the practical challenges of their implementation. The distinctiveness of doing research within a unique paradigm of complex systems, explicating the wickedness and the dimensionality of sociotechnical theory, is articulated. Conclusion: Designing an effective evaluation model requires a deep understanding of the nature and complexity of the problems that information technology interventions in health care are trying to address. Adopting a sociotechnical perspective for model generation improves our ability to develop evaluation models that are adaptive and sensitive to the characteristics of wicked problems and provides a strong theoretical basis from which to analyze and interpret findings.

AB  - This study investigated the relationship between organizational identification, work-life balance (WLB) program factors and employee outcomes. Organizations currently invest in initiatives such as WLB programs in attempt to improve employee morale, but research shows that many available WLB programs have proven to be inadequate in helping employees achieve the intended balance between work and home (Grosswald, Ragland, & Fisher, 2001). Understanding the necessary factors of a successful work-life balance program is vital. In addition, this study explored organizational identification—a variable that helps align employees with their organizations, as a possible mediator between work-life balance initiatives and employee outcomes. By aligning these organizational and personal boundaries, this study found that the identification process played a critical role in understanding how work-life balance programs affect employee outcomes. In addition, this study revealed six factors that should be addressed in worklife balance program delivery in order to foster organizational identification. A sample of working adults at a medium-sized consumer goods headquarter location served as participants. Keywords: Organizational identification, work-life balance programs, organizational citizenship behaviors, turnover intentions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Intervening early and effectively in the lives of at-risk children improves long-term outcomes across many domains and also confers economic benefits. Early Childhood Mental Health Consultation is an evidence-based model of intervention that seeks to transform systems of early education by promoting teacher competence and fostering optimal social emotional development in children. The present study analyzed the utility of the Devereux Early Childhood Assessment, Clinical Form (DECA-C) in the context of an Early Childhood Mental Health Consultation Program. Parent and teacher DECA-C forms for 90 children were included in the analysis. Comparison of means revealed significant differences between parent and teacher forms. There was also a significant negative correlation between protective factors and behavioral concerns. Contrary to the hypothesis of this researcher, more elevated DECA-C scores did not predict increased ECMHC program resources. Behaviors reported at referral were also not well-aligned with DECA-C scores. Interpretations and implications of these results are discussed.

AB  - Background Mental health problems are increasing among children and adolescents worldwide, and parental support programmes have been suggested as one preventive intervention. However, the actual impact and low rates of adoption and sustainability of prevention programmes have proven to be a concern, and thus, further studies on their implementation are needed. Aim This study focused on the initial implementation of the International Child Development Programme ( ICDP) in primary care. The aim was to investigate the involved actors' views on factors likely to affect implementation and the strategies used to manage them. Design A case study design with a mixed-methods approach combining quantitative and qualitative data from questionnaires and interviews was used. Methods Eighty-two professionals at different positions in the involved organisations participated. Directed content analysis was used for analyses, focusing on perceived levels of importance and the manifestation of implementation factors. Findings Interviews and questionnaires provided descriptions of factors influencing the initial ICDP implementation. Uncertainty on how to manage important factors and vague change strategies was reported. Discrepancies in the perceived levels of importance versus manifestation were found regarding several factors, including hands-on support, time and resources, communication and information, a comprehensive plan of action, follow-ups, and external and internal collaborations. Manifested factors were a need for change, motivation and the ICDP's compatibility with existing norms, values and practices. Conclusions Implementing a parental support programme in a complex setting will benefit from being preceded by a thorough examination of the intervention and the target context and the development of clear implementation strategies based on the results of that examination. This study provides insights into how and by whom knowledge on implementation is applied during the launch of a health promotion programme, and these insights might help increase the rate of adoption and the use of such programmes and thereby increase their effectiveness.

AB  - The present investigation was undertaken to study the significance of frequently repeated professional tooth cleaning for healing results following periodontal surgery. 24 patients suffering from moderately advanced periodontal disease were selected for the study. Following a <em> Baseline examination</em> comprising assessment of oral hygine status, gingival conditions, probing depths and attachment levels, all patients were given detailed instruction in proper oral hygiene measures. They were then subjected to periodontal surgery using the modified Widman flap procedure. During the initial 6 months after surgery all patients were enrolled in a maintenance care program which included measures such as scaling and professional tooth cleaning. The patients were randomly distributed into 3 different maintenance care groups. 8 patients (Group 1) received maintenance are once every 2 weeks, another 8 patients (Group 2) received a similar treatment once every 4 weeks while the remaining 8 patients (Group 3) were recalled once every 12 weeks. Following a reexamination at the termination of this 6-month period the recall program was changed. Thus, during the subsequent 18 months of maintenance (<em>the maintenance phase</em>) all 24 patients were recalled for prophylaxis once every 3 months. A final reexamination was performed 24 months after completion of active therapy. The reexamination performed 6 months after surgery revealed that while patients who had been recalled for professional tooth cleaning once every 2 weeks had low numbers of inflamed gingival units and deep (>3 mm) periodontal pockets, test subjects recalled less frequently exhibited an increasing number of inflamed gingival units and deep pockets. In addition, the frequency of sites exhibiting attachment loss of >1 mm was closely related to the frequency of maintenance care. Patients recalled once every 12 weeks for maintenance therapy had 3 times the number of sites with attachment loss (gt; 1 mm) as compared to those who were recalled once every 2 weeks. Within the use of regression analysis critical probing depth values were calculated. This analysis showed that while the critical probing depth value was low in patients frequently recalled during the healing phase, this parameter adopted gradually increasing values in patients recalled with less frequent intervals. Between the 6- and 34-month reexaminations there were no significant alterations of the oral hygiene status, the gingival condition on the probing depth and attachment level data in any of the 3 groups of patients. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Le but de cette étude a été d'examiner l'influence de fréquents nettoyages dentaires professionnels sur la cicatrisation après chirurgie parodontale. 24 patients souffrant de maladies parodontales modérément avancées ont été sélectionnés pour l'étude. Apr&egraves un <em>examen intial</em> comprenant l'enregistrement des niveaux d'hygiène buccale, des conditions gingivales, des profondeurs au sondage et des niveaux d'attache, tous les patients ont re&ccedile;u des instructions détaillées concernant les measures d'hygiène buccale appropriées. Le procédé chirurgical du lambeau de Widman modifié leur a ensuite été appliqué. Durant les 6 premiers mois après la chirurgie, tous les patients ont suivi un programme d'entretien comprenant des measures telles que détartrage et nettoyage dentaire professionnel. Les patients ont été réparties su hazard en 3 grupes différents d'entretien de l'hygiène. 8 patients (Groupe 1) ont re&ccedile;u des soins d'entretien une foits toutes les 2 semaines, 8 autres patients (Groupe 2) ont re&ccedile;u un traitement semblable une fois toutes les 4 semaines, tandis que les 8 derniers patients (Groupe 3) n'ont été rappelés qu'une fois tutes les 12 semaines. Après un nouvel examen à la fin de cette période de 6 mois, le programme de rappel a été changé. Donc, Durant les 18 mois d'entretien subséquents (<em>phase d'entretien</em>), tous les 24 patients ont été rappelés pour la prophylaxie une fois tous les 3 mois. Un examen final a été réalisé 24 mois aprè l'achèvement de la thérapie active. Le nouvel examen effectué6 mois aprè la chirurgie a révélé que les patients rappelés pour le nettoyage dentaire professionnel une fois tutes les 2 semaines avaient un plus petit nombre d'unités gingivales enflammées et de poches parodontales rofondes (>3 mm)que les sujets-tests rappelés moins fréquemment don't le nombre d'unités gingivales enflammées avait augmenté et don't les poches singivales étaient plus profondes. De plus, la fréquence des sites montrant une perte d'attache > 1 mm était étroitement liée &agravel la fréquence des sons d'entretien. Les patients rappelés une fois toutes les 12 semaines pour la thérapie d'entretien présentaient un nombre de sites avec perte d'attache > 1 mm 3 fois supérieur à celui des patients rappelés une fois toutes les 2 semaines. Les valeurs de profoundeur critique au sondage ont été claculées en utilisant l'analyse de régression. Cette analyse a montré que les valeurs de profondeur critique au sondage, basses chez les patients rappelés fréquemment Durant la phase de cicatrisation, augmentaient graduellement chez les patients rappelés à des intervalles moins fréquents. Entre les réexamens après 6 et 24 mois, il n'y avait pas d'altérations significatives de k'état d'hygiène buccale, des conditions gingivales ou de la profoundeur au sondage et des sonnées du niveau d'attache, dans chacun des 3 groupes de patients. (French) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Die vorliegende Untersuchung wurde konzipiert, um die Bedeutung der Vorkommenshäufigkeit professioneller Zahnreinigung für die Heilungsvorgäange nach parodontaler Chirurgie zu studieren. 24 Patienten mit mässig fortgesehrittener Parodontalkrankheit wurden für diese Studie ausgewählt. Nach der <em>Ausgangsuntersuchung</em>, die den Status vorliegender oraler Hygiene, die gingivalen Verhältnisse, Sondierungstiefen und attachmentniveaus beinhaltete, wurden alle Probanden genauestens über die Technik oraler Hygiene instruiert. Darauf wurde die parodontalchirurgische Behandlung mit der modifizierten Widman'schen Lappenmethode eingeleitet. Während der dann folgenden 6 postoperativen Monate wurden alle Patienten in ein Nachsorgeprogramm eingeschleust das Zahnsteinentfernung und professionelle Zahnreinigung enthielt. Die Patienten wurden zufälling in 3 verschiedene Nachsorgegruppen eingeteilt. 8 Patienten (Gruppe 1) erhielten ihre Nachsorgebehandlung jede 2. Woche einmal, 8 weitere Patienten (Gruppe 2) wurden jede 4. Woche mit den gleichen therapeutischen Massnahmen behandelt. Die verbleibenden 8 patienten (Gruppe 3) wurden jede 12. Woche einmal zur Nachsorgebehandlung einbestellt. Anschliessend an eine Nachuntersuchung einbestellt. Anschliessend an eine Nachuntersuchung am Ende der 6 Monate andauernden Versuchsperiode wurde das Nachsorgeprogramm geändert. So wurden während der dann folgenden 18 Nachsorgemonate (die eigentliche <em>Nachsorgephase</em>) alle 24 Patienten jeden 3. Monat einmal zu einer Prophylaxebehandlung einbestellt. Die Schlussuntersuchung wurde 24 Monate nach der Beendigung der aktiven Therapie vorgennommen. Die 6 Monate nach dem chirurgischen Eingriff vorgenommene Nachuntersuchung zeigte, dass bei Patienten, die alle 14 Tage einmal zu professioneller Zahnreinigun einbestellt worden waren, entzündete gingivale Einheiten und tiefe parodontale Taschen (gt;3 mm) nur selten vorkamen. Bei weniger häufig einbestellten Probanden zeigte sich, dass die Vorkommenshäufigkeit entzündeter gingivaler Einheiten und tiefer Taschen anstieg. Darüberhinaus war die Vorkommenshäufigkeit von Regionen mit dem Attachmentverlust von > 1 mm eindeutig von der Häufigkeit der Nachsorgebehandlungen abhängig. Bei Patienten, die nur jede 12. Woche einmal einbestellt worden waren, verdreifachte sich das Vorkommen von Regionen mit einem Attachmentverlust von > 1 mm gegenüber der Patientengruppe, bei der die Nachsorgebehandlung jede 2. Woche stattfand. Mit Hilfe einer Regressionsanalyse wurden kritische Sondierungstiefen berechnet. Die Analyse zeigte, dass die Werte der kritischen Sondierungstiefen bei den während der Heilungsphase häufig einbestllten patienten, niedrig waren. Bei Patienten mit weniger häufigen Nachsorgeintervallen zeigte dieser Parameter dann allmählich höhere Werte. Zwischen den Ergebnissen der Nachuntersuchungen nach 6 und 24 Monaten wurden bei keener der 3 patientengruppen abgesicherte Veränderungen des orale Hygienestatus, der gingivalen Gesundheit, der Sondierungstiefen oder der Attachmentniveaus gesehen.

AB  - The ability to think critically, and sensitively, is an essential component of competent oncology nursing practice. The impact of an innovative project designed to foster such thinking is examined in the one-year evaluation data from 90 nurses. The enduring influence of the critical thinking experience is highlighted and implications for oncology nursing practice are discussed. The purpose of the project was to enhance competency in critical thinking and foster change in clinical practice. Small discussion groups of inpatient and outpatient nurses, facilitated by clinical educators, critically analyzed a videotape compiled from interviews with six oncology patients. The patients had been asked to describe their experience of living with cancer. The ONS 14 high-incidence problem areas provided the framework for organizing the interview excerpts, and video collages were developed to support a 4-year clinical education plan. Brief biographies and treatment histories were used to frame each patient's experience. A facilitator guide was formulated specific to disease pathophysiology, diagnostic work-up, staging, psychosocial adjustment, and treatment regimens and their complications. Evidence-based nursing strategies were stressed. The nurses shared clinical anecdotes, insights, and learning with colleagues as they reflected on the rich dimensions of patient and family experience portrayed. The 2-hour module created a unique opportunity for nurses to translate patient experiences into new clinical realities. Evaluation data were obtained immediately after and at one year following the sessions. Scaled self-report responses indicated the sessions positively affected daily practice through enhanced communication skills and oncology knowledge, strengthened relationships with colleagues, and improved patient and family teaching. Themes of enhanced sensitivity to patient and family experience, a broadened oncology knowledge base, and a heightened sense of self-confidence and esteem for colleagues emerged from the qualitative data. The use of a didactic method, grounded in patient stories, provides an engaging and non-threatening opportunity for nurses to experience shared learning. Critical thinking is enhanced when it is based in clinical reality and directly applicable to each nurse's practice. This innovative approach of thoughtful clinical inquiry is relevant for all dimensions of oncology nursing.

AB  - As a member of a significant helping profession, the Social Worker is engaged in relationship activities not unlike those of the counselor of guidance worker. The present study set out to investigate certain performance aspects demonstrated to be important to the level of relationship functioning in the social work field. Specifically the research project set out to examine three different but related areas of social worker functioning: (1) Employing the Carkhuff-Bereson model of helper effectiveness, five population samples were assessed on the 'helper' index of discrimination and communication; (2) An experimental study involving Social Service trainees was designed to investigate several dimensions hypothesized to relate to variables for counselor effectiveness; and (3) The third phase of the investigation was to determine the efficacy of incorporating a Human Relations Training program as an integral part of their regular training program in an attempt to increase level of functioning in the variables outlined above.

AB  - Background: New pharmacological therapies are challenging the healthcare systems, and there is an increasing need to assess their therapeutic value in relation to existing alternatives as well as their potential budget impact. Consequently, new models to introduce drugs in healthcare are urgently needed. In the metropolitan health region of Stockholm, Sweden, a model has been developed including early warning (horizon scanning), forecasting of drug utilization and expenditure, critical drug evaluation as well as structured programs for the introduction and follow-up of new drugs. The aim of this paper is to present the forecasting model and the predicted growth in all therapeutic areas in 2010 and 2011. Methods: Linear regression analysis was applied to aggregate sales data on hospital sales and dispensed drugs in ambulatory care, including both reimbursed expenditure and patient co-payment. The linear regression was applied on each pharmacological group based on four observations 2006-2009, and the crude predictions estimated for the coming two years 2010-2011. The crude predictions were then adjusted for factors likely to increase or decrease future utilization and expenditure, such as patent expiries, new drugs to be launched or new guidelines from national bodies or the regional Drug and Therapeutics Committee. The assessment included a close collaboration with clinical, clinical pharmacological and pharmaceutical experts from the regional Drug and Therapeutics Committee. Results: The annual increase in total expenditure for prescription and hospital drugs was predicted to be 2.0% in 2010 and 4.0% in 2011. Expenditures will increase in most therapeutic areas, but most predominantly for antineoplastic and immune modulating agents as well as drugs for the nervous system, infectious diseases, and blood and blood-forming organs. Conclusions: The utilisation and expenditure of drugs is difficult to forecast due to uncertainties about the rate of adoption of new medicines and various ongoing healthcare reforms and activities to improve the quality and efficiency of prescribing. Nevertheless, we believe our model will be valuable as an early warning system to start developing guidance for new drugs including systems to monitor their effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness in clinical practice.

AB  - Purpose: Instrument development consistent with best practices is necessary for effective assessment and evaluation of learners and programs across the medical education continuum. The author explored the extent to which current factor analytic methods and other techniques for establishing validity are consistent with best practices. Method: The author conducted electronic and hand searches of the English-language medical education literature published January 2006 through December 2010. To describe and assess current practices, she systematically abstracted reliability and validity evidence as well as factor analysis methods, data analysis, and reported evidence from instrument development articles reporting the application of exploratory factor analysis and principal component analysis. Results: Sixty-two articles met eligibility criteria. They described 64 instruments and 95 factor analyses. Most studies provided at least one source of evidence based on test content. Almost all reported internal consistency, providing evidence based on internal structure. Evidence based on response process and relationships with other variables was reported less often, and evidence based on consequences of testing was not identified. Factor analysis findings suggest common method selection errors and critical omissions in reporting. Conclusions: Given the limited reliability and validity evidence provided for the reviewed instruments, educators should carefully consider the available supporting evidence before adopting and applying published instruments. Researchers should design for, test, and report additional evidence to strengthen the argument for reliability and validity of these measures for research and practice.

AB  - In the current dissertation project, a needs assessment was conducted to identify the needs of female inmates transitioning to Jefferson County communities from the Kentucky Correctional Institution for Women (KCIW). Jefferson County is located in Louisville, Kentucky. Louisville is a large metropolitan area with a population of 699,017 located in the upper southeastern part of the United States. A needs assessment was also conducted with Jefferson County community agencies to identify the services available to meet female releasee needs. The purpose of the needs assessments was to compare the needs of the female releasees with the available resources in the community and to identify areas lacking in service or capacity. The categories identified as significant needs within the female releasee population include: housing, education, employment, financial assistance, mental health care, substance abuse treatment, medical health care, and relationship issues. Based on both needs assessments, there were three main difficulties that were common across need. These three components were: (1) problems obtaining appropriate referrals and coordination of services, (2) lack of ongoing support from the community as well as from family/friends, and (3) difficulties with maintaining motivation for change and priority for meeting needs. When comparing specific need category with community services the result suggested that there were a group of needs for which there was seemingly adequate service capacities (housing, education, and financial assistance), a group of needs for which there appeared to be adequate service capacity yet providers of services often had strict criteria that limit accessibility (substance abuse treatment, mental health counseling, and medical health care), and a group of needs that could not be met appropriately because of a lack of service capacity within the community (employment referrals, psychiatric medication treatment, reintegration/parenting programming, and community education). After reviewing the data from the two needs assessment, the current project proposed a transitional program to address the difficulties meeting female releasees' needs in Jefferson County. The main components of the program include intensive case management and service coordination, provision of social support, assistance in maintaining motivation and priority, and direct service provision. The mission of this program help female releasees make a more seamless transition to the Jefferson County community and, ultimately, reduce female releasee recidivism and foster community safety.

AB  - Hospitalized older adults may experience a decline in functional status from their preadmission baseline, over the course of a hospital stay, and often improve little by the time of discharge, regardless of the admitting diagnosis. Elements of hospitalization including the physical environment and some patient care practices can contribute to poor outcomes; one area in which older hospitalized patients are at high risk is functional decline. Models of care have been designed to prevent functional decline and achieve better outcomes for hospitalized elders. The Acute Care for the Elderly (ACE) model integrates a physical environment designed to foster functional independence along with changes in nursing and medical care delivery, specially trained staff and an interprofessional team approach.The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of the Acute Care for the Elderly model on functional decline and associated nurse sensitive outcomes (falls, nosocomial pressure ulcers, and nosocomial urinary tract infections) compared to a regular medical unit. This study was a prospective observational trial that utilized a quasi-experimental, potentially non-equivalent, control group design to compare complications in two different hospital treatment groups (ACE unit and a regular medical unit).There was a significant difference in percentage change in functional status between the two groups, participants on the ACE unit improved in their ability to perform basic activities of daily living as compared to participants on the comparison unit, controlling for medical comorbidities and level of orientation (F=18, p<0.0001). On average, participants on the ACE unit improved their functional status by 49%, while those on the comparison unit demonstrated, on average, functional decline of 7%. There were not enough occurrences of falls, nosocomial pressure ulcers and nosocomial urinary tract infections in this sample for statistical modeling.The ACE unit is one model of care that has strong evidence that it is possible to prevent the hazards of hospitalization and promote positive outcomes by redesigning the hospital unit and care delivery. The findings of this study support the ACE model of care and its role in improving outcomes for hospitalized older adults.

AB  - Since 1985 the Department of Health has been providing child care research overviews as a means of bringing together the findings of its funded research programmes. With each successive publication a pattern of design and dissemination has emerged. This is illustrated by Child Protection: Messages from Research (Department of Health 1995), an overview of 20 studies of child protection. It included an introductory essay, summaries of each project and a set of ‘True for Us’ exercises. Publication was followed by national seminars and widespread distribution of free copies. Given the substantial investment, it seems timely to assess the impact of the dissemination process in terms of reaching and affecting practice. The survey sought to assess awareness, use and opinions of the report from social services, education and health professionals. It consisted of questionnaires administered by post and telephone calls to a representative sample of 600 professionals working in child protection, 292 of whom replied. The results demonstrate that the book is very well known among most professionals working in child welfare, particularly in social services, and is perceived to have affected the practice of over half of the respondents. The study supports the structure adopted for the report but suggests further benefits in employing a variety of dissemination strategies for different professional groups. Finally, the paper discusses the relationship between overviews and evidence-based services.

AB  - The "New Century High Schools Initiative" is a program designed to improve large, under-performing high schools by transforming them into small schools with links to community organizations. "New Century High Schools" each have about 400 students; the small size is intended to foster strong relationships between students and educators. These schools commit to a broad set of educational principles, but are free to make their own choices about curriculum. Typically, schools choose a curriculum that has a theme or career focus, such as engineering, health science, or theater. Each New Century High School is designed in partnership with a community organization that can participate in curriculum development, school management, after-school activities, or other operational aspects of the school. These organizations include arts and cultural institutions, universities, and social service groups. Partnership with community organizations is intended to bring schools additional expertise and resources related to the school theme or career focus. "New Century High Schools" are expected to maintain benchmarks of 80 percent on-time graduation rates and 92 percent attendance rates. No studies of the "New Century High Schools Initiative" that fell within the scope of the Dropout Prevention review meet What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) evidence standards. The lack of studies meeting WWC evidence standards means that, at this time, the WWC is unable to draw any conclusions based on research about the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of "New Century High Schools."

AB  - Character education is an inclusive concept regarding all aspects of how families, schools, and related social institutions support the positive character development of children and adults. "Character" in this context refers to the moral and ethical qualities of persons as well as the demonstration of those qualities in their emotional responses, reasoning, and behavior. Character is associated with such virtues as respect, responsibility, trustworthiness, fairness, caring, and citizenship. Character education "programs" are activities and experiences organized by a provider for the purpose of fostering positive character development and the associated core ethical values (also described as moral values, virtues, character traits, or principles). The What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) review of this topic focuses on character education programs designed for use in elementary, middle, or high schools with attention to student outcomes related to positive character development, prosocial behavior, and academic performance. Closely related program areas, such as social-emotional learning, conflict resolution, violence prevention, social skills training, service learning, and the like, may be addressed in future WWC reviews but are not intended to be covered by this one. A systematic review of evidence in this topic area addresses the following questions: (1) Which character education programs have proven effective for improving student outcomes related to positive character development, prosocial behavior, and academic performance? and (2) Are different character education programs effective for improving different outcomes, particularly academic performance?

AB  - The article presents information on a study which analyzed women's responses to medicalization when coping with breast cancer and infertility. When facing infertility, there are three options for women, namely, medical/infertility treatment, adoption, or remaining childfree. Each option has inherent costs and benefits. Medical treatment and adoption hold the promise of motherhood in a pronatalist society, but these options are time consuming, costly, and physically as well as emotionally demanding. Additionally, medical treatment carries the possibility of short term or long term physical side effects with it resulting from hormone and other drugs used which are used to promote fertility.

AB  - Setting personal goals to inform the rehabilitation process is a technique used in many clinical settings, such as neurology, but it is less frequently adopted with people who have early-stage dementia. A pilot study of goal-oriented cognitive rehabilitation (CR) provided evidence that people with early-stage dementia are able to set meaningful individual goals relevant to their everyday functioning and rate their performance in these areas (Clare et al 2011). These goal performance ratings proved to be a reliable and sensitive indicator of clinically significant outcomes in that study (Clare et al 2010), in addition to giving a clear demonstration of the progress made to the participants, carers and the Occupational Therapist involved the CR process. Based on this pilot, goal-setting is now being used in the GREAT trial, a large multi-centre randomised controlled trial of goaloriented CR for people with early stage Alzheimer's and related dementias funded by NIHR HTA (Clare et al 2013). Here we explore the goals set by 175 participants enrolled in the trial to date. Typically participants set two or three goals at assessment. The procedure and process for identifying, setting and rating these goals, using the Bangor Goal Setting Interview, will be described. The nature of the goals chosen will be examined and categories and common themes will be identified. It is anticipated that through the identification of common themes across the goals set by individuals participating in the trial, therapists will gain a person-led perspective on what is therapeutically important to people with early stage dementia in order to assist them in their everyday lives.

AB  - Background: Sustainable tailored integrated care for older people in Europe (SUSTAIN) is a Horizon 2020 nine country collaborative project that aims to improve existing integrated care initiatives for older people living at home with multiple health and social care needs, ensuring they are patient-centred, prevention-oriented, efficient, and safe. This paper to be presented will describe our approach to evaluation and present some early findings of its application in practice. In the world of integrated care, health and social care solutions involve complex problems in complex community and healthcare environments, faced by complex patients, settings, and cultures. These challenges demand evaluation approaches that can accommodate this complexity but ensure robust and timely outcomes, creating evidence that is based on the experience of those who know, live, and work with the problem that the evidence needs to solve (Green 2001). The Evidence Integration Triangle model: With its origins in implementation science, the Evidence Integration Triangle (EIT) (Glasgow 2013) moves away from often unreliable and slow efficacy approaches towards creating a dynamic and transferable flow of high quality evidence to practice, ensuring a rapid and informed response to change and improvement. The EIT is a participative approach, including practitioners, policymakers, and citizens, and fosters robust and high-impact knowledge implementation by practitioners and community partnerships. Such knowledge is created through 'rapid learning cycles' and can support sustainability of initiatives. The EIT depicts in a simple framework the complex multilevel factors affecting the integration of scientifıc knowledge into practical applications. There are three main components to the model, namely the evidence-based intervention; participatory implementation processes; and practical measures of progress and outcome. Bringing evidence and relevant stakeholders together is central. These three components enable stakeholders to use scientific evidence to maximise positive health impact and encourage development and sharing of new knowledge to inform future interactions. The high participation and user involvement levels within this evaluation model enable the research to be relevant and applicable from the onset, and ensure that indicators and measures generated to gather evidence remain sensitive and applicable to the research and practice environment. Qualitative and quantitative evidence is accumulated and used throughout so that the change process remains responsive to improvement. Context is pivotal to the EIT. The conditions surrounding health problems and intervention opportunities in a particular place with a particular population, is a key starting point. Context also changes over time, and continually informs the other key components. The EIT model promotes a reorientation of the current clinical effectiveness research paradigm toward greater recognition of innovation and practice-based approaches to evidence (Green 2008). Within this model, a multi-method evaluation encompasses both an outcomes-based and a process evaluation in order to comprehensively identify whether and how improvements in integrated care initiatives came about. Translating the model to SUSTAIN: • the intervention will focus on existing integrated care sites and the over 65s living at home, and consist of a tailored set of improvements constructed with stakeholders, aimed at the micro, meso, and macro levels within the health and social care system; • the practical measures will consist of 1) a core set of qualitative and quantitative indicators measured at intervals; 2) multi-method process evaluation focusing on implementation processes and perceptual outcomes; • the participatory implementation process will consist of key stakeholders attached to the existing integrated care initiatives (e.g. decision-makers, policy makers, senior citizens, health insurers, health and social care providers, commissioners and representatives from the technology industry). They will use the on-going data collection and analysis and their own experiences to give regular feedback informing on progress, identifying problems and creating solutions and modifications to further the intervention improvements to service delivery. Conclusions: This approach is highly suited to SUSTAIN. Given the integrated care complexities and associated difficulties identifying meaningful outcomes, this methodology will help us to find out what works for whom, how, in what context and with what outcomes. In terms of the wider research agenda, the EIT model can also identify and guide strategic decision-making about research areas to pursue as initiatives are rolled out, so that evidence can inform health promotion and healthcare-quality research.

AB  - Introduction: Integrated healthcare models are increasingly being implemented to reduce health system fragmentation and costs related to high service utilization through increased community intervention (e.g., home care) for populations with complex care needs like older adults. These models are intended to increase coordination of the healthcare system, and improve the patient and caregiver experience. However, these models have returned mixed results and the context and mechanisms of integrated care programs have not yet been established. We conducted a realist review of the evaluative evidence on integrated care programs for older adults to identify key processes that lead to the success or failure of these programs in achieving outcomes such as reduced healthcare utilization, improved patient health, and improved patient and caregiver experience. Theory and Methods: The realist review method sought to identify the relationship between program mechanism, context and outcomes, through processes of initial theory-building, literature search, extraction, quality appraisal and synthesis. Initial theories guiding the review included trust in multidisciplinary team relationships, organizational readiness, and the role of leadership to establish an organizational culture receptive to integrated care programs. We searched for international academic literature in 12 indexed, electronic databases and grey literature through internet searches, to identify evaluative studies on integrated care programs for older adults, published between January 1980 and July 2015, in English. Results: A total of 65 articles, representing 28 integrated care programs, were included in the review. We identified two context-mechanism-outcome configurations (CMOcs): 1) trusting multidisciplinary team relationships, and 2) provider commitment to and understanding of the model. Discussion and Lessons Learned: The review emphasizes the importance of trusting multidisciplinary team relationships for processes of effective communication and knowledge sharing, and for program success. Contextual factors such as strong leadership that sets clear goals and establishes an organizational culture in support of the program, along with joint governance structures, supported team collaboration and subsequent successful implementation. Furthermore, provider commitment to and understanding of the model (organizational readiness), as fostered by strong leadership, clear governance, time to build an infrastructure to implement and flexibility in implementation, emerged as key processes instrumental to success of these programs.

AB  - This case study examined the integration of the PICCOLO tool within home-based services using an infant mental health approach with a family at risk. The tool was identified as best practice in Michigan and fits well with basic infant mental health theory. A narrative case example shows the use of the tool with a family and in supervision. Some of the benefits of using the PICCOLO within an infant mental health approach include (a) fostering a paradigm shift in multiple relationships from a deficit model toward a focus on strengths, (b) promoting efficacy and a positive outlook in parents, (c) documenting the impact of services on the parent-infant relationship, (d) providing a concrete structure for developmental guidance and strategies for using existing strengths to drive interventions, (e) allowing better sensitivity to unique strengths in families with children with special needs, (f) increasing observation skills and reflective capacity for the therapist.

AB  - Examined the effects of a prenatal intervention for preventing child abuse and neglect. 204 low-education adolescent mothers (aged 13–21 yrs at birth of 1st child) enrolled in an 18–27 mo home visitation intervention program before or after the birth of their 1st child. Ss were classified as low-risk, high-risk intervention graduates, or high-risk drop-outs. Results show that acceptance of high-risk mothers into the program prior to the infant's birth exerted a significant effect in preventing later child abuse and neglect. Child abuse and neglect rates and subsequent parity rates were not different between high-risk intervention graduates and low-risk Ss. Child abuse and neglect rates for both these groups differed significantly from rates of those dropping out of the intervention. Program costs were significantly lower than county foster care costs for children placed because of child abuse. It is concluded that a prenatal initiation program for high-risk pregnant adolescents may provide a cost-effective boost for family mental health and prevent child abuse and neglect by at-risk families.

AB  - This article expands the frame of psychoanalytic consideration to include the environment as a relational context and conceptualizes the potential psychological impact of natural disaster, in this case the devastating tornadoes that struck central Oklahoma in May of 2013, as being a sudden sense of estrangement from one’s empathic atmosphere and the loss of any textured understanding of what will come next. By drawing from psychoanalytic complexity, intersubjective-systems, self psychology, and Native American perspectives, I articulate a deeply interrelated view of existence, inclusive of and emphasizing a total relational atmospheric context. I then demonstrate that therapeutic responsiveness at the community level serves powerfully reunifying psychological functions in the immediate aftermath of such catastrophes due to its experiential reassertion of an empathic (human) atmosphere, which underscores the value of actively embracing interrelatedness and of psychoanalytically informed engagement at these and other frontiers beyond the usual treatment situation.

Cet impact est décrit comme un sentiment soudain de séparation de son climat empathique familier et la perte de tout élément de compréhension de ce qui va suivre. M’appuyant sur les théories psychanalytiques de la complexité, des systèmes intersubjectifs, de la psychologie du soi, ainsi que sur la pensée amérindienne, je synthétise une vision de l’existence profondément interreliée, en insistant sur la dimension relationnelle du contexte environnemental. Par la suite, je montre qu’une réponse thérapeutique à un niveau communautaire a un effet psychologique puissant de réunification, immédiatement après la catastrophe, par sa réaffirmation expérientielle d’un climat (humain) empathique. Est ainsi soulignée l’importance d’adopter une position psychanalytique engagée et interreliée dans ces situations extrêmes situées au-delà de la situation habituelle du traitement.

AB  - This article is a commentary advocating for dissemination and implementation workers to incentivize the adoption of evidence-based practices (EVBPs) with youth. Treatment-as-usual in community settings yields weak effectiveness results. EVBPs for youth exist but are not widely adopted. Consequently, “lemons” or poor treatments are added to the behavioral health care marketplace. The economic concept of lemon market theory is explained and its relevance to the behavioral health care marketplace is illustrated. Several recommendations based both on economic and learning theory are offered. The article argues for the increased use of incentives as behavior modifiers for clinicians’ practices. More specifically, proper branding and fidelity, quality improvement measures, and pay for performance initiatives are discussed.

T1  - Which factors enable older adults with multimorbidity to adapt and selfmanage to increase health? A narrative literature review.
JF  - International Journal of Integrated Care (IJIC)

KW  - eppi-reviewer
AB  - Background: As ageing is accompanied by chronic illnesses, and chronic diseases account for most of the expenditures of the healthcare system, older people constitute an increasingly important population that is characterized by multiple medical conditions, cognitive and functional impairment and social problems. Multimorbidity leads to complex care through the use of different treatment strategies and the involvement of various health care professionals, which may lead to opposing advices or medications. Therefore patients with multimorbidity are at risk for suboptimal treatment, unsafe care, inefficient use of health care services, unnecessary costs and consequently higher risk for adverse events (van Oostrom, 2012). Challenges for current and future healthcare delivery are the growing group of older adults, the heterogeneity of this group, and the increasing healthcare costs for people with chronic conditions. As these people have to cope with physical, emotional, and social challenges of their chronic diseases and disabilities the question is which factors enable older adults with multimorbidity to adapt and self-manage.In this context the WHO definition formulated in 1948 can no longer be used. This definition describes health as "a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity (WHO, 2003). Therefore in this research the new proposed concept of health as "the ability to adapt and to self-manage" is used (Huber, 2011). Method: In this research the effect of multimorbidity on self-management and adaptation is explored by conducting a narrative literature review over the last fifteen years in English, German or Dutch on the key words older adults, coping, self-management, self-related health and multimorbidity. References lists from selected studies were evaluated to identify any additional relevant articles. Articles were excluded if they addressed one specific disease or health topic or if they did not address coping with multimorbidity in older adults. Literature review: The literature shows several factors that influence health and the perception of health of older people with multimorbidity: social network, socio-economic status, cultural and personal attitudes to health and disease, prior experiences with the health care system, living alone status, education level and patient's coping strategies (Ament, 2012). Patients with multimorbidity and chronic diseases perceive their health differently, depending on somatic, social, mental and cognitive variables and patients adapt in multiple different ways(Strumberg, 2014 B). There is a strong association between increasing medical comorbidity with reported worse self-related health (Perruccio, 2012; Berglund, 2014; Nützel, 2014). Self-rated health correlates with more urgent service use, hospitalization and mortality and reflects an individual's health trajectory, and is predictive for the need for support for self-management activities (Martin, 2014; van Houtum, 2013). Medically complex patients and patients with increasing age tend to think their circumstances are controlled by outside factors (external locus of control). This highlights the importance of attending to psychological needs of individuals with multimorbidity, particularly as providers engage patients in decision-making processes and care plans (Henninger, 2012; Schnee, 2013). Patients with multimorbidity want convenient access to health care, individualised care plans, support from one coordinator of care, and continuity of relationship with health professionals (Bayliss, 2008; Shadmi, 2006; McCormack, 2008). People with multimorbidity experience a poorer quality of life, yet they try to preserve their autonomy to the most possible extent and hold positive attitudes towards life (Loffler, 2012). They hope to find meaning and purpose, and desire to regain identity and sense of self-worth (Fortin, 2004; Duggleby, 2011;Holm, 2013). Therefore health care delivery systems should take patients potential for pro-active cooperation into account as they uniquely possess knowledge of their condition and circumstances (Edgren, 2012). Aim should be integrating patients' needs and expectations in their care in order to result in higher self-related health (Strumberg, 2014A; Loffler, 2012). Many current programs mention self-management interventions, but rarely define selfmanagement and describe how the intervention is supposed to work (Ouwens, 2005; Boult, 2009; Wolff, 2009; de Bruin, 2012; Spoorenberg, 2013). This is relevant because there is often little association between disease complexity and level of self-management behaviors (Battersby, 2003). Discussion: As health is the ability to adapt and self-manage health systems need to adopt these perspectives into in the development and evaluation of care trajectories for older adults with multimorbidity. The process of irreversible decline and the coping style of patients should also be addressed as well as the fact that many older adults with multimorbidity cope, not on their own, but with assistance from informal caregivers (Lanoix, 2013). To empower older adults in daily practice in maintaining balance, stability and adjusting a framework, like for instance the Neuman Systems Model, should be adopted by healthcare providers that takes physiological, psychological, sociocultural, developmental, and spiritual factors into account (Merks, 2012).

AB  - Counseling in audiology is an important aspect of service delivery. How audiologists interact with patients and foster counseling relationships to help patients and families understand and live with hearing loss can impact outcomes of audiological interventions. Currently, variability exists in how graduate training programs are teaching counseling skills, and the extent to which counseling skills development is supported in clinical experiences is unclear. This article seeks to explore the perspectives related to the importance of counseling and counseling training experiences received through clinical instruction of Au.D. students beginning their final year of study, to identify where counseling training might be limited, and to examine how counseling skills might be better supported. Findings revealed that students generally appreciate the importance of counseling in audiology. Data suggest that how students are supported in developing counseling skills appears to be variable and unstructured.

AB  - More pupils with autism are now being educated in mainstream settings and inevitably there is increased interest in their interactions with their peers. In this article, Philip Whitaker, of the Educational Psychology Service in Northamptonshire, describes his study of shared play between children with autism and their mainstream peers. The study involved ten youngsters with severe autism, educated in a unit attached to a mainstream school, and a group of volunteer‘peer tutors’. The children met in weekly interaction sessions designed to promote shared play and communication. The peer tutors were provided with some coaching in interaction techniques and the impact of the intervention was evaluated through analysis of video recordings of play sessions made at the beginning and end of the project. The peer tutors and their parents were also interviewed at the end of the project to explore their experiences.The results Philip Whitaker reports are encouraging. All parents were strongly supportive of their children's participation. All but one of the peer tutors found the experience challenging but rewarding and wanted to continue their involvement beyond the 20-week project. The video evidence revealed that the peer tutors, with relatively limited preparation, were able to engage the youngsters with autism in high and sustained levels of shared play. The frequency of requesting by children with autism increased substantially over the course of the project, although levels of initiation of shared attention remained consistently low. Philip Whitaker concludes his report with a series of suggestions for enhancing the impact of this interesting work.

AB  - Since the passage of the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (AACWA) (P.L. 96-272) a case review system has been required for all foster care programs across the United States. Foster care review has been required by federal and state law for more than twenty-five years; however there is little academic literature published related to this subject. The general intent of this study was to define the administrative case review as a social work intervention and further explore if as a social work intervention, it moderates the effect of child welfare case practice and thus improves child welfare outcomes for children in out-of-home care in Colorado. This study can be summarized as an examination of the relationship between the administrative case review intervention, review findings and child welfare outcomes in Colorado. Using a quantitative approach, this study explored if different levels of timely case review moderated the effect of case practice (i.e. appropriate placement, case planning, contacts, services, and visitation), as measured by case review findings, and further examined if different levels of timely case review was a factor related to four child welfare outcomes including: length of stay in out-of-home care, permanency, placement stability, and length of time to reentry into out-of-home care. A naturally occurring correlational research design was used to examine the relationships between several variables and the child welfare outcomes. The major findings show that timely administrative case review and increased levels of review attendance (mother, father, GALs, and foster parents) are predictors of the child welfare outcomes of permanency and length of time in out-of-home care. The results of this study identify that the timeliness of the administrative case review intervention is related to shorter lengths of stay for all children served, and has a more intense effect when caseworker contacts are low and the levels of timely case review are high. Findings from this study show that timely case review has a main effect on a child achieving permanency and the length of time a child spends in out-of-home care. Additionally, the results show that timely care review moderates the underlying casework process related to caseworker contacts, demonstrating that a child's length of stay differs depending on the level of timely case review. This study concludes that the administrative case review intervention in Colorado is a social work intervention that promotes shorter lengths of stay and improves permanency for children in out-of-home care. In essence, the administrative case review process in Colorado is effectively achieving what it was originally created to achieve. Hopefully, the findings of this study will be used as a catalyst to further refine and improve policy, practice, and use of case review as an effective intervention for improving the lives of children in foster care.

AB  - Most histories of psychiatry attribute the emptying of mental hospitals in the United States and other western countries to the development of chlorpromazine and other antipsychotic drugs in the 1950s, and view this as a watershed moment in society's care of the mentally ill. Yet there are many reasons to question this story of progress, at least in the US. Since the arrival of chlorpromazine, the percentage of Americans disabled by mental illness has jumped fivefold (Whitaker, 2005). There are many mentally ill people who are homeless or locked away in prisons in the US. Those who remain fairly stable on antipsychotic drugs are regularly beset by a host of physical problems. There is also evidence that the drugs may lead to early death. One can make the case that the most progressive form of care we've ever had, at least in the US, both in terms of its humanity and its capacity for helping people recover, occurred in the early 1800s, when Quakers championed the idea of moral treatment, where the mad could be cared for in small retreats. The downfall of moral treatment was set in motion in the 1840s. In response to Dorothea Dix's emotional appeals, states generously responded with a wave of asylum building. However, as this wave of asylum building occurred, states began dumping people with all kinds of illnesses into the institutions. The small 'retreats' turned into crowded and poorly funded hospitals that housed 500 or more patients, and those with organic illnesses—old age senility, cerebral arteriosclerosis, brain tumors, and dementia associated with end-stage syphilis—naturally had no hope of recovery. The institutions filled up with chronic patients. Moral therapy came to be seen as a failed form of care. With the end of World War II and the full revelation of the horrors of Nazi Germany, eugenics became a shamed science. No longer was it acceptable to argue that the insane needed to be segregated because of their bad 'germ plasm' and at that moment states began talking about pursuing alternatives to mental hospitals. The true period of deinstitutionalization in the US was from 1963 to the late 1970s, the exodus driven by a change in social and fiscal policies. The first well-designed study of the efficacy of neuroleptics was conducted by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in 1961. It was a nine-hospital trial of 344 schizophrenia patients, and at the end of six weeks, 75 per cent of the drug-treated patients were 'much improved' or 'very much improved' compared to 23 per cent of the placebo patients. That six-week study is still cited today as proving the efficacy of neuroleptics for curbing acute episodes of schizophrenia. However, the follow-up study done by the NIMH investigators told a very different story. They found, that at the end of one year 'patients who received placebo treatment were less likely to be rehospitalized than those who received any of the three active phenothiazines' (Schooler et al, 1967). This result raised an unsettling possibility: While the drugs were effective over the short term, perhaps they made people more biologically vulnerable to psychosis over the long run, and thus the higher rehospitalization rates at the end of one year? Other reports soon deepened this suspicion. All of that evidence was in place 25 years ago, and there have been a number of studies since that confirm that the standard of care in the US—which involves telling all schizophrenia patients that they have an incurable brain disease and must be on antipsychotic drugs for the rest of their lives—has been an abysmal failure, and does not arise from 'evidence-based medicine'. There are, of course, people with schizophrenia who benefit from neuroleptics, and thus the challenge is to extract from the outcomes research a different paradigm for their use. A model for reform of care in the US is outlined, along with the likely reasons why such a plan will not be adopted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Abstract: For nearly three decades foster care review has been required and practiced in the United States. It is well established that foster care review was designed with the intent to reduce the time children spend in foster care and increase permanent placements for children. This article presents that foster care review, as practiced in Colorado, is a social work intervention and quantitative results of this study demonstrate that as an intervention, timely administrative case review is an effective social work intervention related to improving child welfare outcomes for the children and families served in Colorado. The major findings show that timely administrative case review and increased levels of review attendance (mother, father, Guardian ad litem''s, and foster parents) are predictors of the child welfare outcomes of permanency and length of time in out-of-home care. Bivariate results indicate a median length of stay approximately 10.76 months longer for children who do not consistently receive timely case reviews. Additionally, the results show that timely care review moderates the underlying casework process related to caseworker contacts, demonstrating that a child''s length of stay differs depending on the level of timely case review. In essence, the administrative case review process in Colorado is effectively achieving its goal and is an effective intervention for improving the lives of children in foster care.

AB  - Special attention was focused on the criminal justice system's treatment of child sex abuse victims. The analysis, based on raw data from the American Bar Association's 1981 mail survey of prosecutorial practices used with child victims, identified jurisdictions implementing progressive approaches in working with child victims. Of these jurisdictions, Des Moines, Iowa; Milwaukee, Wis.; Orlando, Fla.; and Ventura, Calif.; received indepth investigations. Legislative issues addressed and procedures used in these jurisdictions pertain to the competency of child witnesses, the exclusion of trial spectators, avoidance of direct confrontation, videotaped depositions and statements, special exceptions to hearsay, and the use of expert witnesses. Other innovations are the use of victim advocates and the streamlining of the adjudication process. Reforms favored by this study include the abolition of special competency requirements for children and the adoption of special hearsay exceptions to admit certain out-of-court statements. Appendixes contain guidelines for interviewing child victims, conditions for the use of videotaped testimony, and guidelines for such videotaping. Tables and exhibits.

AB  - Technological advances that have been hailed as solutions to the trauma suffered by child victims testifying in court are discussed. Results of a recent survey (N not provided) for the National Instit of Justice indicate that many of the reforms are rarely used, & that the courtroom audience is not a major concern for most children. Two areas of statutory reform are suggested as necessary & beneficial to many child witnesses: abolishing special competency requirements for children, & adopting special hearsay exceptions for certain out-of-court statements made by child victims. Sensitive treatment of the child throughout the pretrial period, along with creative interpretations of available statutes & case law precedent, to ameliorate the trauma of testifying may be as effective as technological interventions. 22 References.

AB  - This article discusses the political rights of women. The citizen is to be regarded as both the agent and product of civilisation. And since men and women are partners in the enrichment of civilisation, it is the differences between them rather than the sameness that are of importance. Women has probably contributed to the civilisation's aspect of order than to that of progress, and institutions such as the home, social customs and morality owe much to their influence. They doubtless may be deemed founder of the family. And the family, as the institution where egoisms began to be subordinated to altruism, is the basis of civilisation; and therefore one of the greatest of social changes is due in the main to women. The life within the family has a deep effect on the whole moral nature. It supplies it with relations so close and varied that they foster in turn all the feelings of sympathy. The family led to the beginnings of home life, and then began refinement, in the sense of greater cleanliness and orderliness. Good manners were born in homes, and education may be said to have originated with the mother's treatment of her children. Women at first tilled the ground, while man hunted and fought. Therefore they were responsible to a great extent for a settlement on the land, and so for the beginning of villages.

AB  - Sixty-eight fifth and sixth graders participated in a study of the relationship between self-concept, need achievement, and reading achievement and of the effects of a supplementary program designed to enhance self-concept and need achievement. The California Reading Test, the Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale, the Socio-Cultural Experience Checklist, and the N Achievement Checklist were administered. The students were divided into two groups: the experimental group was taught through the school's adopted reading program and a supplementary program designed to enhance self-concept and need achievement; the control group was exposed only to the school's adopted reading program. Multiple regression analyses indicated that, as measured in this study, need achievement, but not self concept, was a useful predictor of reading achievement. The supplementary program was not shown to be useful in improving reading achievement. (Author/AA)

AB  - The Northwest Foster Care Alumni Study examined the effects of family foster care on adult substance dependencies. The study focused on young adults (N = 479) who were served by a private (Casey Family Programs) or public foster care agency in Washington and Oregon states. This paper describes (1) prevalence rates of alcohol dependence and drug dependence, (2) the relation between risk factors and experiences in foster care and adult substance dependencies, and (3) statistical simulations showing how adult substance dependency rates may be reduced through improvement of the foster care experience. The rate of alcohol dependence within the past 12 months (3.6%) among alumni was not significantly different from that of the general population; the rate of drug dependence within the past 12 months (8.0%) was significantly higher among alumni. Optimization of foster care experiences (i.e., improving care) was associated with significant reductions in the estimated prevalence of these two dependencies.

AB  - Childhood obesity has reached epidemic proportions in the United States and has been linked to hypertension, especially among African American youth. Optimistic bias leads youth to underestimate their susceptibility to negative health outcomes. Public health officials want to reduce risk factors to result in significant long term reduction in cardiovascular disease. The purpose of this study was to explore adolescent behavior practices in a school district and prevalence of high blood pressure and obesity in that population. The health belief model guided the framework for this study. Research questions examined relationship between individual health risk practices and optimistic bias on health outcomes. Using a correlational research design, 433 African American high school students were administered a face-to-face survey and had their obesity and blood pressure measured by the school nurse. Canonical correlational analyses were used to examine relationships between health risk practices and descriptive statistics for optimistic bias and health outcomes. Among the health risk practices, engaging in moderate exercise for at least 30 minutes in the last 7 days and lower blood pressure was the only statistically significant relationship. Despite presence of clinical risk factors for hypertension and obesity, two-thirds of the students did not perceive themselves to be at risk of developing cardiovascular disease, with males at greater risk than females. Reducing health optimistic bias is viewed as an effective way of motivating young people to adopt more positive behaviors. This study has social change implications for using educational institutions to implement intervention programs that promote positive health behavior among youth not as an individual responsibility but as a way to reduce health disparities at the systemic level.

Participants were recruited through college-based programs as well as work-study programs that help formerly incarcerated individuals. This study uses a qualitative phenomenological method with a semi-structured interview to explore each individual's experience of the penal system. Eight participants who have successfully reentered society were interviewed. This study found that during incarceration, the penal system was perceived by participants as problematic in some way, leading to a desire to change. External support was found to be the primary external variable that contributes to successful reentry. This support was evidenced by others showing interest in participants as well as the availability of tangible resources (e.g., higher education, housing, or employment). All participants cited introspection and a deep commitment to change (as compared to desire alone) as helpful internal variables. The common phenomena identified by this researcher are 1) a significant identity shift either during incarceration or after release, 2) a marked change in thought process adopted by the participant, and 3) a drive to be altruistic after release. For this population, clinical implications include the need to focus treatment on the following: risk reduction, setting realistic goals, frustration tolerance, emotional regulation, individual strengths, understanding one's locus of control, and preparing for acculturation during reentry. Treatment for trauma and substance abuse should be available for those that need it, and when possible, incorporating family therapy and altruistic activities for individuals is strongly encouraged. Each participant spoke to the need for systemic change; better communication and collaboration is needed between prison staff, policymakers, healthcare professionals, law enforcement, and current and former inmates. Through access to improved resources for formerly incarcerated individuals after release, the hope is that crime rates and recidivism will reduce, and taxpayers will save money.

AB  - Research related to child welfare often suggests complicated relationships between child maltreatment, social disadvantage, program and policy effects, individual development, and population conditions that interact and change over time. New theories and conceptual models that account for this complexity are needed. The main point of this article is that the life course perspective is a useful paradigm for developing and organizing theories, concepts, and hypotheses in child welfare research. The life course perspective also helps researchers tackle methodological challenges common to longitudinal child welfare studies, such as confounding due to age, policy, and cohort effects. This article introduces key principles of the life course perspective, discusses concepts relevant to child welfare using concrete examples from prior research, highlights methodological challenges, and suggests implications for future studies.

AB  - Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) careers experienced a growing deficit in the number of qualified replacements for an aging population of workers. Introductory Agricultural Mechanics (IAM) courses as part of Secondary Agricultural Education Programs provide foundational skills students build upon throughout their agricultural mechanics careers. The purpose of this study was to utilize the Concerns-Based Adoption Model to describe the integration of STEM into the Idaho IAM curriculum, including the units of instruction taught in those courses and teachers' concerns relating to STEM integration into their IAM courses. Utilizing a survey of Idaho Agricultural Science and Technology Instructors, 19 units of instruction were identified as the core of IAM courses in Idaho. Teachers' Stages of Concern relating to the integration of STEM into IAM courses revealed teachers were interested non-users who may have competing ideas relating to the integration of STEM. Comparisons on demographic variables of years of experience teaching IAM courses, gender, certification pathway, and holding an additional science certification yielded few differences in teachers' importance ratings or time spent teaching the units, indicating Idaho teachers hold similar views relating to IAM and STEM integration. Stages of Concern Profiles for Idaho Agricultural Science and Technology Teachers with six to 10 years of experience teaching IAM and female teachers suggest they are less likely to have competing ideas in relation to integrating STEM into IAM courses than other groups. Targeted in-service activities focusing on these two groups may lead to faster integration of STEM. Recommendations include creating a cooperatively defined vision for what a STEM-integrated IAM course looks like utilizing Innovation Configuration Maps and active monitoring of the utilization of STEM integration based on the developed Innovation Configuration Maps. Clinical assessments of the methods teachers utilize to improve student learning utilizing active learning and STEM best practices are needed to improve IAM courses. Modification of IAM laboratory teaching strategies utilizing teachers as researchers was recommended. National replication of this study could improve the infusion of STEM principles in IAM courses.

AB  - Childhood obesity has reached epidemic proportions and is linked to hypertension among African American youth. Optimistic bias influences behavior of youth causing them to underestimate their susceptibility to negative health outcomes. This study explored adolescent behaviors and prevalence of high blood pressure and obesity in a school district. We examined the relationship between individual health risk practices and optimistic bias on health outcomes; 433 African American high school students were administered a survey and had their obesity and blood pressure measured by the school nurse. Canonical correlational analyses were used to examine relationships between health risk practices and descriptive statistics for optimistic bias and health outcomes. Engaging in moderate exercise for at least 30 min in the last 7 days and lower blood pressure was the only statistically significant relationship. Two-thirds of the students did not perceive themselves to be at risk of developing cardiovascular disease with males at greater risk than females, despite the presence of clinical risk factors for hypertension and obesity. Reducing health optimistic bias is an effective way of motivating young people to adopt more positive behaviors using educational institutions to implement intervention programs that promote positive health behavior as a way to reduce health disparities.

AB  - Recent concerns about the poor quality of healthcare and diminishing compassion within patient care have prompted many healthcare organisations to adopt ‘compassion’ and ‘care’ into their value and mission statements. Productive Ward: Releasing Time to Care (PW) is a quality improvement (QI) programme designed to meet the value and mission intentions around quality and compassion. The purpose of this study is to measure the impact that PW has on direct patient care (DPC) times and the capacity of ward-based teams to provide compassionate care. This study used an exploratory longitudinal, cohort design (with an experimental test outcome, using a matched control group) to examine DPC times and ‘engagement’ (the antithesis of ‘burnout’ and ‘compassion fatigue’) amongst ward-based teams involved the PW QI initiative in Ireland. Ward-based teams involved in PW reported higher baseline levels of ‘engagement’ (vigour, absorption and dedication) compared to a control group which remained unchanged after a 12-month period. DPC times improved in just over half the study sites, but no significant changes were observed. No statistically significant relationships between ‘engagement’ and DPC were established. This study demonstrates that PW does not necessarily ‘release time to care’ in every instance and that many factors influence this. Compared to a control group it does, however, show encouraging signs that it may engage ward-based teams, thus creating some of the conditions and capacity in which compassion and quality can flourish.

AB  - Academic success can be considered a core metric by which to measure the relative success of a youth's childhood as the skills conveyed and measured in school are such as to foster positive long-term outcomes. Therefore, all efforts ought to be made towards encouraging this achievement. School success however, is a complex phenomenon shaped by a wide variety of factors and many Latino adolescents are missing opportunities to develop their full potential in the United States educational system. The goal of this project was to present a perspective on students' relationship to their academic outcomes that emphasizes the role of the mental health and self-efficacy of Latino youth towards their learning and academic success. The present study examined the relationship between students' broad mental health risk, general self-efficacy, and achievement outcomes. The district in which this study was conducted has one of the lowest graduation rates in the state of New Jersey (under 60%) and reading and math testing scores ranking below the 15th percentile. The high school was comprised of 1397 students, grades 9 through 12 of whom 485 met criteria for further analysis by virtue of being Latino, completing the Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC) and the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE) as well as meeting other demographic criteria. The results of this study indicated that mental health risk's impact on academic achievement outcomes are mediated by perceived general self-efficacy. This finding appears most significantly for the relationship between internalizing symptoms and final Language Arts grade as well as GPA. Specifically, the current study found that when an adolescent's self-reported internalizing symptoms go up by 1, the indirect, mediated effect by self-efficacy is that final Language Arts grade goes down by .16 and GPA goes down by .01. Broadly, the effect sizes reflecting these findings are small, but add to the field suggesting that academic self-efficacy is a predictor of school success for Latino students. The findings here offer an important potential area for intervention that can and ought to be explored in furtherance of the goal of encouraging school achievement in at-risk populations.

AB  - Much of the activity in critical care is complex but repetitive. In order to standardize care and maintain safety, delivery of care is often directed by protocols and care bundles. This case study will reflect on an instance where care transcended the standard protocol‐directed path to be more individualized, creative and compassionate. Acts like these can be unique for the practitioners involved and require an element of positive risk taking, which happened here. It will look at the decision‐making, planning and risk involved in preparing for a terminally ill patient, who was inotrope and high‐flow oxygen dependent, to go home to have treatment withdrawn there instead of in the hospital. This was to fulfil his wish to die at home. In unpicking the circumstances where this positive risk taking led to the desired outcome and the relationship between safety, uncertainty and risk, three themes arose. These were the journey to safe uncertainty; decision‐making with uncertain outcomes; and the importance of robust human factors, particularly effective communication and inter‐professional teamwork. If positive risk taking can result in enhanced outcomes for the patient, then the question of how this behaviour can be fostered and encouraged must be addressed.

AB  - While premature infants have a high need for positive interactions, both infants and their mothers are challenged by the infant's biological immaturity. This randomized clinical trial of 198 premature infants born at 29-34 weeks gestation and their mothers examined the impact of the H-HOPE (Hospital to Home: Optimizing the Infant's Environment) intervention on mother-premature infant interaction patterns at 6-weeks corrected age (CA). Mothers had at least 2 social environmental risk factors such as minority status or less than high school education. Mother-infant dyads were randomly assigned to the H-HOPE intervention group or an attention control group. H-HOPE is an integrated intervention that included (1) twice-daily infant stimulation using the ATVV (auditory, tactile, visual, and vestibular-rocking stimulation) and (2) four maternal participatory guidance sessions plus two telephone calls by a nurse-community advocate team. Mother-infant interaction was assessed at 6-weeks CA using the Nursing Child Assessment Satellite Training-Feeding Scale (NCAST, 76 items) and the Dyadic Mutuality Code (DMC, 6-item contingency scale during a 5-min play session). NCAST and DMC scores for the Control and H-HOPE groups were compared using t-tests, chi-square tests and multivariable analysis. Compared with the Control group (n = 76), the H-HOPE group (n = 66) had higher overall NCAST scores and higher maternal Social-Emotional Growth Fostering Subscale scores. The H-HOPE group also had significantly higher scores for the overall infant subscale and the Infant Clarity of Cues Subscale (p < 0.05). H-HOPE dyads were also more likely to have high responsiveness during play as measured by the DMC (67.6% versus 58.1% of controls). After adjustment for significant maternal and infant characteristics, H-HOPE dyads had marginally higher scores during feeding on overall mother-infant interaction (beta = 2.03, p = 0.06) and significantly higher scores on the infant subscale (beta = 0.75, p = 0.05) when compared to controls. In the adjusted analysis, H-HOPE dyads had increased odds of high versus low mutual responsiveness during play (OR = 2.37, 95% CI = 0.97,5.80). Intervening with both mother and infant is a promising approach to help premature infants achieve the social interaction patterns essential for optimal development. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Across the political spectrum, high-quality early care and education (ECE) is viewed as essential to educational reform. No ECE program can succeed without teachers who can establish warm and caring relationships with children, light the fires of children's curiosity and love of learning, and foster their development and readiness for school. Practitioners and policy makers are increasingly embracing higher qualifications for ECE teachers as one means for ensuring better care for children. In K-12 education, too, highly politicized issues are at stake, with ongoing controversy about the merits of certification, the value of college and university schools of education, teacher accountability for student outcomes, the best ways to measure teacher effectiveness, and how to guide new teachers through the critical first five years of service. Based on an increasing emphasis on evidence-based policy and practice, many have turned to the existing research literature for answers about the most appropriate and effective types of teacher preparation and professional development for both ECE and K-12 education. Ideally, the scientific wisdom and evidence accrued in one sector of education should inform and advance research, policy, and practice in the other. But because infrastructures and career pathways are significantly different in these two fields, researchers in K-12 and in ECE have tended to pose questions and formulate answers in fundamentally different ways. The purpose of this two-part paper is to help bridge the worlds of ECE and K-12, and to help shape a coordinated research agenda, by examining their differing vantage points, language, and terminology, and the current state of knowledge about the effective preparation of excellent teachers. Part I summarizes the differences between the two fields, while finding enough similarities to warrant a close consideration, in Part II, of the combined knowledge of both fields, and of what remains to be learned, about teacher preparation, concluding with a set of key recommendations for research and policy.

AB  - Purpose: Pregnancy and childbirth are normal conditions, but complications and adverse outcomes are common. Both genetic and environmental factors influence the course of pregnancy. Genetic epidemiologic research into pregnancy outcomes could be strengthened by the use of common measures, which would allow data from different studies to be combined or compared.

AB  - Purpose: Pregnancy and childbirth are normal conditions, but complications and adverse outcomes are common. Both genetic and environmental factors influence the course of pregnancy. Genetic epidemiologic research into pregnancy outcomes could be strengthened by the use of common measures, which would allow data from different studies to be combined or compared. Here, we introduce perinatal researchers to the PhenX Toolkit and the Collections related to pregnancy and childbirth.Methods: The Pregnancy and Birth Collections were drawn from measures in the PhenX Tooklit. The lead author selected a list of measures for each Collection, which was reviewed by the remaining authors and revised on the basis of their comments.

AB  - Study Design. Within-study cost-utility analysis. Objective. To explore the cost-utility of implementing stratified care for low back pain (LBP) in general practice, compared with usual care, within risk-defined patient subgroups (that is, patients at low, medium, and high risk of persistent disabling pain). Summary of Background Data. Individual-level data collected alongside a prospective, sequential comparison of separate patient cohorts with 6-month follow-up. Methods. Adopting a cost-utility framework, the base case analysis estimated the incremental LBP-related health care cost per additional quality-adjusted life year (QALY) by risk subgroup. QALYs were constructed from responses to the 3-level EQ-5D, a preference-based health-related quality of life instrument. Uncertainty was explored with cost-utility planes and acceptability curves. Sensitivity analyses examined alternative methodological approaches, including a complete case analysis, the incorporation of non-back pain-related health care use and estimation of societal costs relating to work absence. Results. Stratified care was a dominant treatment strategy compared with usual care for patients at high risk, with mean health care cost savings of 124 pound and an incremental QALY estimate of 0.023. The likelihood that stratified care provides a cost-effective use of resources for patients at low and medium risk is no greater than 60% irrespective of a decision makers' willingness-to-pay for additional QALYs. Patients at medium and high risk of persistent disability in paid employment at 6-month follow-up reported, on average, 6 fewer days of LBP-related work absence in the stratified care cohort compared with usual care (associated societal cost savings per employed patient of 736 pound and 652 pound, respectively). Conclusion. At the observed level of adherence to screening tool recommendations for matched treatments, stratified care for LBP is cost-effective for patients at high risk of persistent disabling LBP only.

AB  - Substance use often begins earlier among American Indians compared to the rest of the United States, a troubling reality that puts Native youth at risk for escalating and problematic use. We need to understand more fully patterns of emergent substance use among young American Indian adolescents, risk factors associated with escalating use trajectories, and protective factors that can be parlayed into robust prevention strategies. We used growth mixture modeling with longitudinal data from middle-school students on a Northern Plains reservation (Wave 1 N = 381, M age at baseline = 12.77, 45.6 % female) to identify subgroups exhibiting different trajectories of cigarette, alcohol, and marijuana use. We explored how both risk (e.g., exposure to stressful events, deviant peers) and protective (e.g., positive parent–child relationships, cultural identity) factors were related to these trajectories. For all substances, most youth showed trajectories characterized by low rates of substance use (nonuser classes), but many also showed patterns characterized by high and/or escalating use. Across substances, exposure to stress, early puberty, and deviant peer relationships were associated with the more problematic patterns, while strong relationships with parents and prosocial peers were associated with nonuser classes. Our measures of emergent cultural identity were generally unrelated to substance use trajectory classes among these young adolescents. The findings point to the importance of early substance use prevention programs for American Indian youth that attenuate the impact of exposure to stressful events, redirect peer relationships, and foster positive parent influences. They also point to the need to explore more fully how cultural influences can be captured. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - A large percentage of women receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) — known colloquially as welfare—have experienced domestic violence in their lives, with studies reporting that upwards of 50% of welfare recipients have been abused at some point. Receiving TANF benefits can provide the financial stability that is necessary for a woman to leave an abusive relationship, though some TANF provisions, such as child support reporting requirements, may also put victims of domestic violence at risk. Under TANF, states may adopt the Family Violence Option and waive many program requirements, including time limits, work requirements, and child support reporting requirements, for victims of domestic violence. Given the importance of TANF for those trying to leave, or who have left, abusive situations, this article asks: Who represents the interests of these women in the states? To answer this question, I employ a mixed methods approach, combining a quantitative analysis of the diversity of interest groups in the states with a case study of Connecticut and New Jersey. I find that feminist and domestic violence organizations do not consistently have a significant effect on the adoption of policy accommodations for survivors, but these groups are speaking out.

AB  - In July 1990, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania adopted the Instructional Support Team initiative to identify those students who experience academic, behavioral, social-emotional, and/or communication difficulties, and to provide the needed support to help them succeed. A study evaluated the effectiveness of middle school Instructional Support Teams (IST) in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania with respect to "quality point average" (QPA) changes after a student had gone through the IST process. The IST initiative includes a mandated team of the building principal, classroom teacher, and support teacher. Various other adults such as counselors, psychologists, nurses, speech therapists, other teachers, and parents may be included on the team. The team works together to problem-solve and develop strategies that will help at-risk students to succeed in the regular classroom. Questionnaires were mailed to 13 school districts in the county who have IST in place in a middle school building. Completed questionnaires were received from 11 districts representing 47 students who were at-risk for school failure. Results indicated a significant improvement in QPA scores for the academically at-risk students who have gone through the IST process during the first semester of the 1995/1996 school year. Future research should focus on specific reasons why IST students are experiencing academic success. (Contains 22 references and 4 charts; appendixes contain a cover letter and the questionnaire.)

AB  - Across the fifty states, there is considerable variation in child welfare services. A study was conducted to understand this policy variation in terms of important contextual factors. Lawsuits against state child welfare systems, adoption of multi-disciplinary teams, surveys of state programs, and state experiments with developments like managed care and dual-track assessment are among the reforms and innovations examined both longitudinally and in cross-sectional analysis for the fifty states. Control variables, political variables, and economic variables were examined for their impact on these state policy adoptions. Identifying important structural, demographic, political or economic factors associated with the adoption of reform will deepen our understanding of the policy process. This enhanced understanding, in turn, can strengthen and inform the efforts of advocates.

AB  - The emerging field of 'neuroprediction' or 'predictive analytics' in mental health has promise for revolutionizing clinical practice by moving towards personalized or precision medicine. The core idea is that brain measures at a given time may predict individual future behavioral outcomes, presumably because specific structural or functional brain characteristics constrain the trajectories of evolving behavior over time. For basic science, discovery of such brain measures identifies particular neural circuits that constrain specific future behaviors. For clinical science, such brain measures may support identification of vulnerabilities that could be treated preventively to minimize poor mental health outcomes. In this thesis, I first provide an overview of the key questions and challenges in the field of predictive analytics, aiming to (1) propose general guidelines for predictive analytics projects in psychiatry, (2) provide a conceptual introduction to core aspects of predictive modeling technology, and (3) foster a broad and informed discussion involving all stakeholders including researchers, clinicians, patients, funding bodies and policymakers. Next, I discuss two strategies for identifying, in a developmental context with children, brain vulnerabilities for future mental health difficulties. First, I used resting state functional connectivity, measured via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to discover whether children without depression but with heightened familial risk for major depression disorder (MDD) had brain differences indicative of risk for depression. At-risk children, compared to children not at familial risk, exhibited significant differences in functional brain connectivity in three brain networks. Classification between at-risk versus control children based on resting-state connectivity yielded high accuracy with high sensitivity and specificity that was superior to traditional clinical rating scales. Second, I examined whether variation in functional connectivity could predict the trajectory of clinical symptomology over the ensuing four years in a longitudinal study with a normative child sample. Variation at age 7 in specific networks predicted individual children's developmental trajectories at age 11 towards attentional problems characteristic of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or internalizing problems characteristic of MDD. The predictive network for internalizing problems was one of the networks that had been atypical in children at familial risk for MDD. These studies identify variation in brain networks indicative of risk for two of the most common disorders of adolescent mental health, and suggest that such measures may support targeted early and preventive interventions. The conclusion of the thesis provides a discussion of these findings, future directions, theoretical implications, clinical applications and ethical considerations.

AB  - Under the auspices of the Massachusetts Advisory Council on Education, the status of science teaching in Massachusetts elementary schools was studied by the project staff of the Office of Tests at Harvard University. The quality and use of the National Science Foundation (NSF)-supported programs were analyzed through a historical discussion of contemporary reform movement in elementary science. Information about use of the Elementary Science Study, Science Curriculum Improvement Study, Science - A Process Approach, and Minnesota Mathematics and Science Teaching curricula was collected from superintendents' responses. Questionnaires, interview results, meetings, and informal conversations were used to determine teachers', principals', and science coordinators' attitudes and experiences. Fifth- and sixth-grade children's interests were surveyed to explore relationships between teachers' characteristics and their impact on children's attitudes. Adoption of the NSF curricula was found to produce lively and interesting instruction in classrooms, and teacher specialization was described as a problem in practical implementation. Included are 13 recommendations and tables of operational differences among NSF and non-NSF systems, perceived strengths and weaknesses of NSF curricula, numbers of the classrooms and buildings involved, and percentages of use by grade.

There were 13 adopted grandparents averaging 77 years of age and thirty 6-, 7-, and 8-year-old children. Objectives were to stimulate sharing of talents, knowledge and skills, to encourage caring and helping relationships and to help children recognize and accept the aging process. The children visited the nursing home regularly, wrote letters and read to grandparents, helped plan parties, music, games, and arts and crafts activities and planted a flower garden. A detailed log book was kept which included happenings, conversation and comments of the children, the elderly and the nursing home staff. During the 1974-75 school year a study was conducted to identify the effects of the program on children's attitudes toward the elderly. Pretests and posttests were given to children in the program and to a control group. Although no statistical differences were found between the two groups, it appeared that both the adopted grandparents and the children benefited from the contact and that the experimental group more frequently had attitude changes in a positive direction toward elderly persons.

AB  - Mental health issues continue to present barriers for Canadian children, in terms of both psychological and academic outcomes. Growing numbers of students are placed "at risk" as a result. A mental health promotion approach suggests that students can develop a number of skills and competencies, namely those related to social-emotional learning (SEL), which can reduce their chance of developing mental health difficulties. In Canada, a wide range of curricula, frameworks, initiatives, and programs have been put in place that address elements of SEL. In this paper, a sampling of these drawn from across the country is described. The emphasis on SEL apparent in many provinces and territories is evidence of the shared understanding of its importance with respect to improving student outcomes. However, a lack of evidence to support these approaches, inconsistencies in terms of terminology and practices, the lack of alignment between SEL and academics, and the piecemeal approach adopted within some provinces leave SEL and mental health promotion approaches vulnerable to being labelled "add-ons" and becoming transient initiatives.

AB  - Reviews the book, Adolescent girls in crisis: Intervention and hope by Martha B. Straus (see record [rid]2007-15651-000[/rid]). Millions of adolescent girls today are in a crisis of rage and despair. They disappear through starvation, get pregnant, run away from home, self-mutilate, attempt suicide, and abuse drugs and alcohol. Less severe but equally troubling, many hide weeping in their rooms, bully and endure bullying, feel afraid, lonely, and unloved. Perhaps the most troubling aspect of this crisis is that adults—parents, researchers, teachers, therapists, the very people who care about adolescent girls—have remarkably little insight into just how they feel, how they spend their days, how they are facing this crisis of rage and despair, and what they are doing to cope. Programs, experts, and interventions abound, with seemingly little impact on the collective distress of adolescent girls. For every success in turning a troubled girl around, there seem to be new, even sadder cases to take its place. As veteran clinician Martha Straus explains, the list of reasons for our failure are complicated and varied, much like the girls themselves: weak, fragmented interventions; overwhelmed institutions with inadequate resources; unaware, busy parents; overcrowded schools; riskier-than-ever experimentation; an increasingly violence-saturated society; marginalization of girls in the press and on the Internet; a backlash against feminism—the list could go on. With 25 years of clinical experience treating this challenging population—and several more years of personal experience raising her own two teenage daughters—Straus writes from the trenches, delving into the world of adolescent girls, setting the record straight on what's going on, and providing clinicians and caregivers with better information and real, effective strategies to help. Adolescent Girls in Crisis begins by exploring what Straus terms 'the culture of rage and despair'—the insidious ingredients that can lead to disturbed behavior and feelings, including stress, sadness, anger, aggression, self-doubt, defiance, and anxiety. By examining the adolescent passage, the role of consumerism and the media, developmental stages, and aspects of school and home life, Straus lays the groundwork for the practical interventions presented in the second half of the book. Targeting specific problematic behaviors—affective and anxiety disorders; eating disorders and self-mutilation; attachment and trauma problems; ADHD and oppositional-defiant disorder; sex and conduct disorders, and substance abuse. Straus goes on to provide concrete strategies and treatment methods for helping girls overcome their distress and climb out of crisis. Additional chapters on drug treatment, hospitalizations, and other out-of-home interventions are also covered. Adolescent girls face more hurdles to healthy, safe development than ever before, with greater-than-ever risks. Though they need us now more than ever, taking on the responsibility of helping them is unarguably challenging and frightening. However, as reflected in Straus's final chapter, 'Ten Reasons for Hope,' we are in the midst of important changes in how we understand girls, adolescence, the life course, and the impact of culture. Highly practical and compassionate. Adolescent Girls in Crisis guides us in this understanding, showing us how to make effective, lasting changes in the lives of our teenage girls. With admirable comprehensiveness, this book provides a well-constructed life raft of knowledge and skills for anyone willing to wade into the waters with them. Everyone, from seasoned therapist to first-time parent of an adolescent, will find more than enough tools—and hope—to warrant reading. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Developmental theory that addresses criminality and psychopathic features often cites the processes by which one fails to adopt socially acceptable behavior (e.g., Lykken, 1995). Investigations of socialization processes have examined the process of passive avoidance learning (PAL), or the process by which one learns to avoid responding to a stimulus that has been previously linked to punishment. Numerous empirical investigations have identified deficient PAL as a reliable correlate of psychopathic traits in adult offenders (e.g., Newman & Kosson, 1986; Newman & Schmitt, 1998). The current study was designed to test the relationships between psychopathic features, trait anxiety, and PAL performance in a sample of 92 incarcerated adolescents, utilizing the Psychopathy Checklist: Youth Version (PCL:YV; Forth, Kosson, & Hare, 2003). Results suggest that, although it appears that higher levels of psychopathic features predict PAL deficits in adolescents, IQ is an important covariate to consider in this relationship. When estimated full scale IQ was controlled, the effect size of the relationship between psychopathic features on PAL performance was reduced. Results also suggest that psychopathic features and trait anxiety are unrelated, and that trait anxiety does not predict PAL performance. Given that this is the first PAL investigation with adolescents to include trait anxiety and IQ as independent variables, it is recommended that separate measures of these constructs be incorporated into future studies of PAL and psychopathic features in youth. Psychopathy is a complex psychological disorder for which etiology remains unknown. Individuals relatively high in psychopathic traits are characterized by emotional callousness, shallow affect, and a diminished capacity for remorse. These individuals are often superficially charming and seem to have little capacity to experience or understand emotion. They are also notorious for their poor behavioral control, and they often commit poorly planned crimes and repeatedly engage in behaviors that have previously been punished (Cleckley, 1976, Hare, 1991). Given that individuals with psychopathic features commit a highly disproportionate amount of criminal activity and are prone to high rates of recidivism (Hare, 1993, Lykken, 1995), psychopathy is a well-established construct in the clinical assessment of adult offenders (Hare, 1996). Although many clinicians remain hesitant to highlight psychopathic features in children and adolescents, it is likely that the personality traits and behaviors that characterize adult psychopaths are, to some extent, present at an early age (e.g., Lahey & Kazdin, 1990). In order to begin to develop more effective intervention programs and treatment methods for individuals affected by this complex condition, it is crucial that researchers and clinicians begin to determine if behavioral correlates of psychopathic traits that are present in adulthood are also present earlier in life. Deficient passive avoidance learning (PAL) is one of the most well replicated behavioral correlates in adult offenders with psychopathic traits (e.g., Newman & Kosson, 1986; Newman, Patterson, & Kosson, 1987; Newman & Schmitt, 1998; Thornquist & Zuckerman, 1995). The current study was designed to investigate the relationship between psychopathic traits and PAL in a sample of incarcerated adolescents.

AB  - Awareness of cases of fatal child maltreatment has risen significantly in recent years suggesting the presence of a serious threat to young children despite extensive child welfare, clinical and legal responses to the issue. The purpose of this study was to identify differences between high risk child maltreatment and fatal risk cases and associated child protective service factors. For this study, 50 cases of fatal and near fatal child maltreatment were compared to a random sample of 50 moderate to severe maltreatment cases to determine predictors of group affiliation using a transactional model of child maltreatment to guide model development. Results indicate that recognition of having a male perpetrator, in cases of physical abuse, in families with approximately two children living in more rural environments notably improved the odds of predicting fatal risk cases. Prior referrals to Adult Protective Services, less out of home care and poor utilization of in-home services were also noted differences in the service records of the groups. Implications regarding early intervention and child protection measures that could be utilized to reduce risk are offered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Family literacy programs are based on theories positing that children’s early learning is supported through interactions with adults—parents in the home environment and caregivers in early learning environments. Most family literacy programs include the provision of services for parents to learn about how to support children’s language and literacy through effective parenting and structured literacy interactions, as well as an early childhood education component that provides supports directly to children. Evaluations of family literacy programs show only few, scattered effects on child outcomes. In order to better understand why these programs do not have greater impacts for young children, it is imperative that evaluators broaden their focus to include measures of not only the literacy skills the program is targeting, but also the processes that are hypothesized to lead to those outcomes. Given their centrality in fostering children’s language and literacy development, it is critical that evaluations of family literacy programs include assessments of the quality of adult-child relationships.

AB  - The growing movement for teaching about religion in the public schools, as distinguished from religious instruction or devotional exercises, reflects widespread concern regarding the phenomenon of religious illiteracy and the lack of knowledge or understanding of the significant role played by religion in U.S. life, past and present, and in world history generally. Such teaching, recognized as constitutional and in accord with separation of church and state, acknowledges the formative influence of religions in culture. A principal concern of those who would implement such programs is how to deal fairly with the religious and cultural diversity of U.S. life without fostering indifference to questions of truth and related values. Some who oppose teaching about religions believe its effect might be to further relativism. One approach distinguishes pluralism from relativism by defining the first as a way of living with authentic differences that can coexist in the body politic when it is informed by freedom of conscience, religious liberty, and traditions of civility. Teaching about religions, as distinguished from values education, civil religion, and similar movements, is intended to be disinterested, comprehensive, and sensitive to the complexities of faith, careful to avoid even the appearance of advocacy in belief or practice. Defining religion for teaching programs presents another difficulty, requiring that students discriminate between narrow and broad categories and that teachers avoid both religious and secularist bias. A descriptive approach can help students perceive the relationship between religion and culture by examining world faiths. The report lists proposed general goals for such programs, typical problems that hinder their implementation, and guidelines for attaining them. Finally, specific curricular materials and programs are cited as exemplary models for emulation and further development. (DB)

AB  - Exploring the experiences of children with substance abusing mothers is significant to professional psychologists and mental health providers. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services (Department of Health and Human Services) reported in 2005 that 80% of the 590,759 women in drug treatment centers report having at least 1 child. Yet, little research considers the life experience of these children. This research describes and analyzes the unique personal perception and experiences of individuals with substance abusing mothers, and specifically investigates the emotional, behavioral, and physical health aspects of the experience. It also considers the impact of receiving primary care from nonmaternal caregivers, including family members and foster care. Findings from this study suggest a large number of children of drug-addicted mothers are in the custody of their drug-addicted mother; however, the grandmother provides care. The caregiver is the person who provides day-to-day food, clothing, and shelter for the child. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Bullying is a common problem among youth, whether they have been a bully, victim, or both. The concern with bullying among youth is that it does not just start and stop at school and will impact a child's interactions in a variety of settings, including out-ofschool time activities. Therefore, as youth workers in the field of parks and recreation, we must seek ways to help children address issues related to bullying. Additionally, like with many aspects of children's lives, we have to consider and foster ways to engage parents, noting that they play a key role in guiding young people's behavior. Based on this understanding, we felt it was imperative to explore the perspectives of youth and their parents regarding approaches to addressing bullying among youth. To this end, we conducted a study to examine personal experiences and strategies guided by the following three goals: a) to understand how youth and their parents conceptualize bullying, b) to examine how youth and parents address bullying, and c) to explore the types of bullying issues that youth experience. We examined these goals by conducting individual interviews with eight children and eight parents in a rural community in the northeastern United States. Grounding the analysis in Social Cognitive Theory (Bandura, 1986), we found that due to a lack of knowledge and understanding of bullying, parents and youth frequently blur the lines between bully, victim, and friend. Additionally, both parents and youth had reactions toward incidents of bullying that varied from ignoring to directly acknowledging the situation through confrontation with the presumed bully. Children attempted a variety of strategies to combat personal experiences with bullying and often found parental advice to be ineffective. We concluded that youth workers in the field of parks and recreation must continue to provide spaces and programs for young people to develop strategies to address negative peer interactions in a positive and proactive way. Additionally, we suggest that youth workers should take a lead role in facilitating communication between parents, youth, and themselves in order to proactively address issues of bullying in advance of escalation.

AB  - Aspiring actors are often cautioned by those currently working in the field: if you can see yourself doing anything else, do it. The subtext suggests pursuit of an acting career is only for those who possess a deep desire, perhaps even an elemental need, to perform. In fact, many performers truly cannot see themselves doing anything else; they are intrinsically motivated. This dissertation investigates the experiences of professional actors who possess such motivation, colloquially labeled the acting bug, which is a phenomenon rooted in notions of identity---when, why, and how people identify themselves as performers, and the effects of that self-identification on future choices. Existing literature characterizes the acting profession as stressful and volatile, identifying disparities among job training, availability, and stability in the arts; yet some arts education programs gloss over inevitable future challenges, adopting instead a follow-your-dreams rhetoric that fails to outline difficult truths about a professional life in the arts. While not all actors experience the acting bug in relation to educational factors, established research indicates the propriety of holistic considerations of the role of work in people's lives. One simply cannot investigate career choice without contemplating influential personal and societal factors; therefore, this dissertation includes acute conscientiousness of possible educational intersections, since more nuanced understandings of the relationship between student identity and future choices could instigate a reevaluation of best practices in order to better prepare students for future artistic work. For a group so present in the public eye, professional actors' voices are noticeably absent across academia; but rich experiential data from a diverse group of professional actors could provide new insight into responsible inspiration---fostering passion for the arts while heightening awareness of occupational possibilities. Through an arts-based phenomenological research paradigm, this study aims to present such data as a means of promoting understanding of a shared, lived phenomenon, championing actors' voices in formal research settings, inciting conversation, activating future research, and (ideally) generating strategies to challenge the perpetual stereotype of the starving artist.

AB  - This paper argues for the importance of adopting a population-level approach to promote more effective parenting and to reduce the risk of child maltreatment. Family-based interventions based on social learning principles have been shown to make a useful contribution in the treatment of child maltreatment. However, typically such programmes have been used to treat parents who have already become involved in the child protection system. We argue that the creation of community-wide support structures to support positive parenting is needed to reduce the prevalence of child maltreatment. Such an approach requires several criteria to be met. These include having knowledge about the prevalence rates for the targeted child outcomes sought, knowledge about the prevalence of various parenting and family risk factors, evidence that changing family risk factors reduces the prevalence of targeted problems, having culturally appropriate, cost-effective, evidence-based interventions available and making these widely accessible.

AB  - While research consistently demonstrates that behavioral self-regulation (BSR) is associated with early academic abilities, it may not yet account for the multiple ways in which young children symbolically communicate their knowledge. This study builds on previous research in the areas of early learning and self-regulation by including children’s drawings as a method of accessing and assessing young children’s learning and by exploring this relation over a two-year kindergarten program. Measures of BSR and academic skills (math, reading, writing, and drawing) were administered at the end of a two-year kindergarten program (Mage = 70.25 month) to 109 children (49 girls, 60 boys). Results from four separate hierarchical multiple regression analyses demonstrated that BSR significantly predicted academic skills (math, reading, writing, and drawing) after controlling for age and maternal education. Practical implications of these findings highlight how self-regulated behaviour in kindergarten fosters a wide range of academic development including drawing.

AB  - Undergraduate students in Christian Liberal Arts Universities are often compelled to learn and develop attributes that correspond with the Protestant faith tradition, through various methodologies. Empathy is one particular character trait that is often discussed but inadvertently neglected in the research. However, in this study focuses on an Anabaptist Liberal Arts university in United States that takes pride in its cross-cultural study program and its ability to foster the development of empathy in its undergraduate students. This particular study investigated empathy development in a group of undergraduate students who embarked on a five-week cross-cultural learning experience to Lesotho, in Southern Africa. Along with home stays, students were engaged in a service-learning project that involved developing and working in an AIDS/HIV garden. Using a quasi-experimental design with a control and experimental group, data was obtained from the Balanced Emotional Empathy Scale (BEES) (Mehrabian, 1996, 2000) to assess whether empathy development occurs in undergraduate students through the cross-cultural learning experience. The results of the study indicated there was no significant change in empathy development in the 22 undergraduate students who participated in the Southern Africa cross-cultural learning experience.

The focus is on the social context of infertility and on women''s perceptions of and experiences with IVF. Methods: Twenty-two childless women/couples who sought IVF. The sample was drawn from consenting clients of clinics in two major Indian cities, viz. New Delhi and Mumbai. Result: In-depth interviews revealed that infertility is deeply feared, women''s status and security are affected, and they experience stigmatisation and isolation. IVF was pursued after less intrusive avenues had been exhausted. Inadequate information/counselling is provided, success rates are low, IVF is commercialised and the process is physiologically, emotionally and financially stressful. Conclusion: In Indian society fertility defines womanhood and motherhood, and infertility is stigmatised. Women faced a lot of pressures to produce a biological child, and go through all kinds of treatments, including the expensive ARTs, to have a child. Practice implications: Integration of infertility services into the state''s reproductive health programme and disseminate information on infertility and to offer other appropriate choices, such as adoption. Effective counselling on coping with psychosocial/sexual problems. Monitoring of the prevalence of sex preselection.

AB  - This dissertation explores relational communication of in-laws in multi-religious families of American Orthodox Christians and represents an interpretive analysis of collected personal narratives. These narratives describe American Orthodox Christian identity in in-law relationships that is directly tied to ethnic identity. Thus, the presented research is built on the findings about multi-religious and multiethnic family relationships in the fields of relational communication, family therapy, and religious studies. I argue that religion and ethnicity are fundamental bases for the formation of family identity and family culture. Therefore, this dissertation focuses on how religious differences impact the relational health and quality of communication among the in- laws. The theoretical framework of the study is Relational Dialectic Theory; I focus on its two major premises: (1) relationships are products of cultures in which they develop and (2) the broader cultures offer a variety of meanings that we attach to our relationships, many of them are oppositional to each other. To explain relational dialectics in in-law relationships, I used the concept family culture and adopted the critical perspective on acculturation. I argue that there exists a natural connection between acculturation and relational dialectical tensions: people find themselves in constant push towards and pull away from a non-native family culture. (For example, identified in my research dialectical tensions of integration – separation, closedness – openness, which constitute discursive oppositions of wanting to preserve old family culture – wanting to develop independent new family culture and stigmatized – stigmatizing Orthodox identity, provide support for my argument.) The combination of these theoretical frameworks allowed me to offer another perspective on existing research of in-law relationships. Particularly, I provide a critique to Morr Serewicz' in-law love triangle and argue that it is an amorphous structure in which the composition of its relationships perpetually changes in the relational contexts defined by constantly fluctuating dialectical tensions. In addition, this dissertation focuses on the intersections of religious, ethnic, and gender identities in in-law relationships. The attention to these intersections helped to reveal that the meanings participants attach to their faith are influenced by the larger political discourses about ethnicity, faith, and gender.

AB  - Discusses 5 major theoretical approaches to crime and delinquency and describes recent developments in the field of criminal justice in relation to psychology. Psychological theories of criminal behavior that are explored include behavior theory, social learning theory, cognitive social learning theory, attachment theory, and social control theory. The authors discuss the stability of aggressiveness and how early behavior problems can predict later behavior problems. The reciprocal nature of parent–child relationships is discussed, as well as the transactional perspective on behavior, which acknowledges the continual interplay between parent and child. Protective factors such as dispositional attributes, environmental conditions, biological predispositions, and positive events can help to mitigate early negative conditions. The influence of temperament, cognition, and emotion are discussed in relation to how individuals perceive and respond to events. Early intervention programs that appear to be effective have adopted a multidimensional approach with a variety of components. The authors describe the link between mental disorders and violence and crime and how disaggregation and classification are involved in this relationship.

AB  - Describes a 6-yr intervention with a young Black mother whose depression and inability to cope were exacerbated by her 4 children under the age of 4 yrs. The children exhibited severe developmental and emotional problems and were placed in foster care. Because an effective pattern of intervention was provided and used, the birth of another child provided a chance for success and mastery rather than further failure. Work with the foster mothers is described. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - IN GENERAL, FAMILY-TYPE INSTITUTIONS ARE SMALL, WITH SEPARATE LIVING FACILITIES, PERSONAL EDUCATOR-CHILD RELATIONSHIPS AND NO PRONOUNCED POWER STRUCTURE. THEY VARY ACCORDING TO THE EDUCATOR SYSTEM, THE AMOUNT OF SUPERVISION, THE TREATMENT ORIENTATION, AND TREATMENT POSSIBILITIES OUTSIDE THE INSTITUTION. FAMILY HOUSES WITH LIVE-IN NONPROFESSIONAL EDUCATORS ARE SUITABLE FOR CHILDREN OF ALL AGES WHOSE PROBLEMS ARE NOT TOO SERIOUS, WHILE FAMILY GROUP HOUSES PROVIDE GROUP LIVING ARRANGEMENTS FOR CHILDREN OF ALL AGES WITH EITHER LIVE-IN OR EXTERNAL, PROFESSIONAL EDUCATORS. BROWNDALE HOUSES TREAT EMOTIONALLY DIFFICULT JUVENILES ON AN INTENSIVE LONG-TERM BASIS USING PROFESSIONAL PERSONNEL WHO LIVE OUTSIDE THE FACILITY. INTENSIVE CARE UNITS FURNISH SHORT-TERM CRISIS ASSISTANCE TO CHILDREN OF PRESCHOOL AGE WITH NO SERIOUS EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCES. LIVING GROUP HOUSES HAVE TWO OR FOUR EXTERNAL PROFESSIONAL STAFF OR LIVE-IN MARRIED COUPLES TO SUPERVISE CHILDREN OF ALL AGES AND TO SUPPLY IN-HOUSE IDENTIFICATION AND SOCIALIZATION TREATMENT. BOARDING SCHOOLS CONCENTRATE THEIR EFFORTS ON TREATMENT RATHER THAN SOCIALIZATION OF SCHOOL-AGE CHILDREN BY PROFESSIONAL STAFF WITH WHOM CHILDREN DO NOT FORM CLOSE PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS. COMPARISON OF ALL THE INSTITUTIONS SUGGESTS THAT BOARDING SCHOOLS HAVE THE MOST IN COMMON WITH INTENSIVE CARE UNITS, FAMILY HOUSES WITH LIVING GROUP HOUSES, AND BROWNDALE HOUSES WITH FAMILY GROUP HOUSES. BOARDING SCHOOLS PROVIDE THE FEWEST SOCIALIZATION POSSIBILITIES. BOARDING SCHOOLS AND INTENSIVE CARE UNITS FOSTER EDUCATION RATHER THAN CLOSE PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS. BOARDING SCHOOLS, FAMILY GROUP HOUSES WITH PROFESSIONAL STAFF, AND BROWNDALE HOUSES HAVE THE BEST FACILITIES FOR TREATING CHILDREN WITH PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT EDUCATIONAL PROBLEMS. CHILDREN WITH CLOSE RELATIONSHIPS TO THEIR OWN PARENTS MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY ACCEPTING ANOTHER MARRIED COUPLE AND ARE LIKELY TO ADJUST BETTER TO EXTERNAL PROFESSIONAL GROUP LEADERS IN ONE OF THE INSTITUTIONAL TYPES. BOARDING SCHOOLS AND INSTITUTIONS BASED ON THE FAMILY MODEL ARE NOT SUITABLE FOR SMALL CHILDREN IF STAFF TURNOVER IS HIGH. (English)

AB  - <B>Objective:</B> The purpose of this research was to study the personality variables of empathy and narcissism in a sample of child abuse perpetrators and a comparison sample of foster parents, conceptualized as nonabusive parents, in order to gain further understanding of perpetrators and to provide clues for intervention.<B>Method:</B> The sample consisted of two groups: physically and emotionally abusive parents (<F>n=52</F>) and foster parents (<F>n=101</F>). Participants responded to three instruments: the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI), an instrument measuring individual differences in empathy, and two instruments measuring narcissism: the Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI) and the Hypersensitivity Narcissism Scale (HSNS).<B>Results:</B> Statistically significant differences were found between the two groups on three of the four subscales of the IRI: perspective-taking, empathic concern, and personal distress. Based on the definition of these subscales, the abusive parents as compared to the foster parents were not able to take the perspective of another or see things from another’s viewpoint, showed less warmth, compassion and concern for others, and experienced difficulty in tense interpersonal situations. Statistically significant differences were found for the two groups on three of the six subscales of the NPI: authority, exhibitionism, and superiority, and on the HSNS. The abusive parents demonstrated less self-confidence, a greater lack of impulse control and were more narcissistic than their foster parent counterparts.<B>Conclusions:</B> The results suggest that it is how the perpetrators experience aversive behavior in their children that may provoke them to physically and emotionally abuse their children. Their self-centeredness in addition to their deficiencies in empathy may cause them to experience their children’s misbehavior as an affront to their authority. Implications for treatment are made from this conceptualization of parental abuse.

AB  - This study explored the implications of communication and information flow in relation to various organizational concepts (particularly social service referral and delivery) of 91 social service agencies. Representatives at each hierarchical level within all of the agencies were interviewed and completed a questionnaire. In addition, the perceived similarity with regard to the agency's services as compared to all other agencies was ascertained. Four communication networks were generated from the questionnaire responses of members of 65 social service agencies that allowed for the construction of communication maps with regard to topic areas such as client referrals, direct treatment/service delivery, planning/innovation and interpersonal relations. These four networks then allowed for the reconstruction of the actual communication patterns among 65 social service agencies. From the findings, the consolidation and application of current technology is recommended as well as consistent checks on communication flow by network-analytic techniques for badly needed coordination, client referral, and other interorganizational efforts.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to discover the best practices of the Oklahoma Technology Center superintendents. This specialized group of superintendents oversee and lead high school and adult career programs, as well as community and business training. They also lead and oversee several new business incubator projects annually for the community. Due to these activities, Oklahoma Career and Technology Superintendents have unique needs compared to other superintendents. This dissertation is a qualitative study in which 11 Oklahoma Superintendents were contacted to determine the answers to two questions. First, what best practices are used to successfully operate an Oklahoma Technology Center school district? Second, what best practices are helpful for new Oklahoma Technology Center superintendents? A review of the literature identified six best practice themes which are grouped as follows: (a) history of Oklahoma technology center leaders; (b) leadership theories; (c) leadership best practices; (d) professional growth; (e) mentorship, coaching, and guiding; and (f) collaboration and strong relationship building. The results focused on the perceptions and lived experiences that were crucial to the superintendents. Once the data was analyzed, the findings produced evidence to support recommendations for superintendents concerning communication, professional growth, ethics, mentoring, collaboration, empowering staff, and culture. The best practices for new Oklahoma technology center superintendents were inspiring followers, continuous improvement, and collaboration with peers, data-driven decisions, and fostering the culture of the organization.

AB  - • Summary: This article reports findings from a longitudinal study of outcomes for a sample of children who had become, or who were considered at risk of becoming looked after. Using a multi-case study design, two stages of the project are reported here. In Stage One, information was gathered from and relating to 21 young people. In Stage Two, semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 32 social workers, and 31 parents and carers regarding 52 children. Eleven of these young people also volunteered to be interviewed. Standardized measures were utilized including the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, Adolescent Well-Being Scale, and Rosenberg Self-Esteem and Self-Efficacy scale.• Findings: The study highlights the need for preventive multi-agency work with families with multiple risk factors and the importance of education and children’s social care working co-operatively together on behalf of children in need. The study demonstrates the ongoing challenges in providing low level emotional therapeutic work, building on young people’s prosocial relationships with peers, and finding effective ways of improving children’s self esteem and self efficacy. In this local authority children did not feel routinely involved in decision-making. Placement stability, meeting the short and longer-term needs of all placed children, and addressing the needs of foster carers and residential children’s home staff, also presented challenges.• Application: The study highlights the importance of the organizational context when meeting young people’s needs, including strong leadership, quality assurance, ongoing assessment and focused interventions.

AB  - Experience in institutional/orphanage care has been linked to increased mental health problems. Research suggests that children adopted from institutions experience specific difficulties related to inattention/overactivity. Evidence of internalizing and conduct problems relative to non-adopted peers has been found in early childhood and early adolescence, but problems may not differ from other adopted children. This study clarifies the understanding of behavioral and emotional symptoms of post-institutionalized (PI) children during middle childhood. Eight- to eleven-year-old PI children ( n = 68) and two comparison groups, children internationally adopted from foster care ( n = 74) and non-adopted children ( n = 76), and their parents completed the MacArthur Health and Behavior Questionnaire related to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), externalizing, and internalizing symptoms. Group means for symptom level and number of children with symptoms above clinical cutoffs were compared. PI children displayed an increased level of ADHD symptoms per parent report. PI child and parent report indicated a higher number of PI children above clinical ADHD cutoff. Both groups of internationally adopted (IA) children had higher levels of externalizing symptoms relative to non-adopted children, with parent report indicating higher numbers of IA children above the externalizing clinical threshold. Informants differed in their report of internalizing symptoms. Parents indicated that both IA groups displayed increased internalizing symptom levels and greater numbers above clinical threshold; however, children reported this to be true only for the PI group. PI children differ from non-adopted peers across symptom domains in middle childhood. Whether these concerns were more broadly associated with international adoption rather than institutional care depended on symptom domain and informant. An understanding of this variability may be beneficial for treatment and intervention. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - PurposeFood literacy is an emerging concept associated with the skills, capabilities and knowledge to prepare a healthy diet and make healthy food choices. This study aims to examine how a dietary gatekeeper's intentions to prepare a healthy diet for their family, and the subsequent satisfaction that a healthy diet is achieved, is influenced by their food literacy and by barriers to healthy eating. Design/methodology/approachA two-stage cross-sectional study was undertaken with 756 dietary gatekeepers who completed a baseline (time 1) and a three-month follow-up (time 2) questionnaire. Partial least square-structural equation modeling was used to estimate relationships between gatekeeper food literacy, their demographic characteristics, socio-cognitive factors, time 1 satisfaction with the healthiness of the household diet and intention to provide a healthy family diet. The follow-up survey assessed subsequent satisfaction with the healthiness of the household diet and barriers to achieving it. FindingsThe results highlight the significance of the dietary gatekeeper's food literacy in overcoming barriers to healthy eating and fostering increased satisfaction with the healthiness of the family diet. The research further highlights the influence of past satisfaction, attitude, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control. Several demographics factors are also highlighted as influential. Research limitations/implicationsThe research offers new insights into the role of food literacy in the home environment including its influence on the dietary gatekeeper's satisfaction with the family diet. The current model also provides strong evidence that food literacy can reduce the impact of barriers to healthy eating experienced by gatekeepers. The research has limitations associated with the socio-economic status of respondents and thus offers scope for research into different populations and their food literacy, younger and early formed cohabiting and the negotiation of food and dietary responsibility and on intergenerational food literacy. Practical implicationsThe current findings regarding the impact of food literacy have significant implications for government agencies, non-profit agencies, educational institutions and other related stakeholders in their effort to curb obesity. Implications exist for micro-level programmes and actions designed to influence gatekeepers, family members and households and at the macro level for policies and programmes designed to influence the obesogenicity of the food environments. Originality/valueThe current study is one of the first to offer evidence on the role of food literacy in the home environment and its ability to overcome barriers to healthy eating. The research provides social marketers and public policymakers with novel insights regarding the need for increased food literacy and for developing interventions to improve food literacy in dietary gatekeepers.

AB  - Outmoded cultural expectations concerning motherhood are described, and problems arising from the conflict between the myth of the perfect mother vs societal pressures toward equality are cited. It is observed that the personality theory of A. Adler (1957) has proven to be an effective counseling model for working with discouraged mothers who are struggling to free themselves from the overpowering burden of assuming total responsibility for their family and children. Under Adler's therapeutic system of individual psychology, counseling strategies include (a) establishing a relationship through the techniques of understanding and encouragement, so that a woman may develop a sense of responsibility for her own behavior; (b) uncovering the dynamics of the client's transactions and fostering in her an awareness that she does not cause her children's behavior, but merely provides an atmosphere for interactions to occur; (c) establishing interepretation culminating in insight; and (d) reorienting mother-child interactions through action methods such as encouragement of the child in the direction of self-respect and allowing the child to experience the logical consequences of his/her behavior.

AB  - A common thread to several classic fairy tales (e.g.. Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella), reinforced by their modern cinematic instantiations, is that women are timid, delicate souls requiring rescue from their humble existence by dashing, daring, princely saviors. The fairy tale's contemporary counterpart, the romantic comedy, frequently perpetuates this theme. Most people, perhaps biased by their exposure to those stereotypical depictions, believe that real-world dating scripts involve men actively pursuing prospective romantic partners and women patiently and passively waiting for the man of their dreams to sweep them off their feet. As another stereotype of women's passivity, though decidedly less romantic, the lay conception of prehistoric relationships involves brawny cavemen clubbing one another over the head and staggering away with female conquests in tow. Evolutionary psychological approaches to human mating are often accused of reinforcing stereotyped representations of mating processes (see Smith & Konik, 2011, for a review of such critiques). Indeed, a general conclusion of several lines of research is that men opportunistically seek multiple mating prospects with young, attractive, fertile women who are portrayed as the spoils in male-male competition (e.g.. Buss, 1989; Schmitt et al., 2003; Schmitt & Buss, 1996). Although men are generally inclined toward short-term mating opportunities and women are generally inclined toward long-term mating opportunities, a more refined analy-sis of the evolutionary psychological literature reveals that individuals' mating strategies are flexible in response to contextual factors, individual differences, and life history stages (Buss Sc Schmitt, 1993; Gangestad & Simpson, 2000; Schmitt, 2005). Indeed, psychological and anthropological evidence has been used to argue for humans being monogamous, polygynous, and/or promiscuous (see Schmitt, 2005, for a review). Humans are highly altricial, requiring significant parental investment, a quality typically observed in monogamous species (Lovejoy, 1981). But opportunistic promiscuity, has likely pervaded human evolutionary, history as well, given the several adaptations to sperm competition possessed by modern humans (Shackelford, Pound, Goetz, & Lamunyon, 2005). We adopt a pluralistic perspective, suggesting that women (and men, for that matter) often seek long-term committed mates, but that short-term trysts occur when such liaisons offer certain advantages (e.g., copulating with a partner of high-genetic quality). Important for the present purpose, whether they are seeking a long-term companion or a short-term sexual partner, women actively and judiciously select their suitors—there may be some truth to the claim that men sweep women off their feet, but we argue that women clearly provide the broom. The remainder of the chapter will paint a richer portrait of female mating behavior by reviewing sexual selection theory which argues that females ought to be very selective about with whom they mate. We will illustrate this argument with analogues from the animal behavior literature and by describing research; that highlights females' active control over the mating process. The core of our chapter will focus on the role of humor in human mating. Research in this domain is an illustrative microcosm of the contrast between passive and active accounts of women's role in the mating process, with findings from our own research program supporting the active account (Wilbur & Campbell, 2011).

AB  - This study investigated the lived experiences of eight adoptive families who adopted from seven countries. Eight adoptive mothers participated in interviews, answering open-ended questions through which they were asked to describe in detail their experience of adopting a child. The researcher sought to discover the prevalence and degree of postadoption stress, anxiety, or depression for adoptive parents of domestically or internationally, postinstitutionalized adopted children and by what mechanisms the child's and parents' responses are triggered and healed. A phenomenological research methodology was used in an effort to establish naturally emergent commonalities of the adoption experience and the development of standardized education and treatment models. The interviews took place over the phone, and the participants were asked to describe their feelings and experiences prior to adopting their child and after they brought home their child. Follow-up questions were asked to clarify the experiences of the families and the treatments they implemented to help heal their children. The results of the study supported the research literature regarding the neuroscience of early trauma, issues in attachment, and therapeutic parenting, and illuminated the need for more research on the psychological and neurobiological impact of early trauma on both the children and their adoptive families. The results revealed gaps in knowledge and treatment interventions among adoption professionals, therapists, and pediatricians. A critical need for adoption-preparedness training and post-adoption support services became starkly obvious. Children who experience early trauma often miss critical developmental milestones, which results in neurodevelopmental deficits that affect attachment, learning, and affect regulation. The 14 children of the families in the study suffered from numerous disorders such as sensory processing disorder, reactive attachment, attention deficit and hyperactivity, depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress, for which their parents were largely unprepared. Because of the lack of preparedness training for adoptive parents and support services for their children, all eight mothers reported suffering from one or a combination of chronic stress, depression, or anxiety after their adoptions. The mothers found healing for their children and for themselves when they connected with other adoptive families and alternative healing practitioners whom they met on online support groups.

AB  - Designed for early childhood educators working with children who have a wide variety of disabilities, this manual discusses the ways in which assistive technology can facilitate the child's active participation in developmentally appropriate activities and offers ideas for incorporating devices and strategies into daily school and home routines. Chapters 1-5 provide an opportunity to explore and review the foundations of assistive technology including relevance to real life tasks, legislative mandates which have created the framework for accessible technology, services to people with disabilities, and the importance of a team-based technology selection and service delivery process. Specific assistive technologies for positioning, access, communication, play, and computer use that are available to enhance a child's independence and skill development are introduced. Chapters 6, 7, and 8 focus on implementation issues: curricular issues that foster and support a "big picture" approach to assistive technology use in educational settings; the relationship between the Individualized Education Program process, technology implementation, and functional outcomes; and funding options. The final section offers guidelines and suggestions for training personnel to become effective assistive technology trainers. Appendices include instructions for creating many of the low cost and simple technology items mentioned throughout the manual. (Contains 67 references.) (CR)

AB  - Although much research considers the relationship between family income and child maltreatment, contact with child protective services (CPS), and out-of-home placement, little research provides a strong causal test of these different relationships. And, as such, it remains unclear how increasing or decreasing the generosity of social welfare programs could affect children's risk of experiencing maltreatment, CPS contact, and out-of-home placement. In this article, we use Danish registry data and a 2004 policy shock to estimate the effect of a substantial decrease in welfare generosity—a monthly reduction in disposable income of 30% for those who were on a specific form of welfare for six consecutive months or more—on children's risk of out-of-home placement. Our results indicate that this decrease in welfare generosity increased children's risk of out-of-home placement by about 1.5 percentage points in any given year, representing an increase of about 25% in the annual risk of out-of-home placement. The results also indicate that in a similar group of welfare-dependent individuals who were not affected by the policy shock, there is only a negligible increase in the risk of out-of-home placement, further buttressing the case for causal effects. Taken together, this article shows that substantial changes in the economic conditions of the poorest families can have a substantial effect on the probability that their children will be placed in out-of-home care.

AB  - Using data from the Parent and Family Involvement in Education (PFI) survey of the National Household Education Surveys Program (NHES) and from an original school choice dataset, I explore the effects of school choice options on parent participation in schools of choice and in neighborhood public schools. Adopting Hirschman's (1970) categories of alternative strategies for institutional improvement, 'voice' and 'exit,' I investigate whether the proliferation of school choice reforms causes democratic participation in public education to increase, decrease or remain unchanged. After using logistic and OLS regression models to explore the possible tension between exit and voice, I examine the policy implications of the voice-exit relationship. If exit strategies cause parental voice to decline in schools left behind, or if parents previously using voice diminish their voice after exiting, exit strategies could offset any positive effects of competition. If so, the net impact of exit on school improvement would be nil or negative. If exit strategies compelled less vocal parents who remain in neighborhood schools to increase their voice, or if exiting parents feel more entitled to exercise voice in their chosen schools, choice policies could have additional, hitherto unnoticed, benefits. The findings suggest that only in their infancy do exit policies attract the highly active parents. Over time the voice-exit relationship dissipates. In fact, once institutionalized public exit options appear to attract minority and low SES parents, who participate less. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - For a social prescribing intervention to achieve its aims, clients must first be effectively engaged. A 'link worker' facilitating linkage between clients and community resources has been identified as a vital component of social prescribing. However, the mechanisms underpinning successful linkage remain underspecified. This qualitative study is the first to explore link workers' own definitions of their role in social prescribing and the skills and qualities identified by link workers themselves as necessary for effective client linkage. This study also explores 'threats' to successful linked social prescribing and the challenges link workers face in carrying out their work. Link workers in a social prescribing scheme in a socioeconomically deprived area of North East England were interviewed in two phases between June 2015 and August 2016. The first phase comprised five focus groups (n = 15) and individual semi‐structured interviews (n = 15) conducted with each focus group participant. The follow‐up phase comprised four focus groups (n = 15). Thematic data analysis highlighted the importance of providing a holistic service focusing on the wider social determinants of health. Enabling client engagement required 'well‐networked' link workers with the time and the personal skills required to develop a trusting relationship with clients while maintaining professional boundaries by fostering empowerment rather than dependency. Challenges to client engagement included: variation in the volume and suitability of primary‐care referrals; difficulties balancing quality of intervention provision and meeting referral targets; and link workers' training inadequately preparing them for their complex and demanding role. At a broader level, public sector cuts negatively impacted upon link workers' ability to refer patients into suitable services due to unacceptably long waiting lists or service cutbacks. This study demonstrates that enabling client engagement in social prescribing requires skilled link workers supported by healthcare referrer 'buy‐in' and with access to training tailored to what is a complex and demanding role.

AB  - Background: Personal health records (PHRs) provide patients with access to personal health information (PHI) and targeted education. The use of PHRs has the potential to improve a wide range of outcomes, including empowering patients to be more active participants in their care. There are a number of widespread barriers to adoption, including privacy and security considerations. In addition, there are clinical concerns that patients could become anxious or distressed when accessing complex medical information. This study assesses the implementation of a PHR, and its impact on anxiety levels and perceptions of self-efficacy in a sample of breast cancer patients. Methods: A quasi-experimental pre-test/post-test design was used to collect data from participants to evaluate the use of the PHR. Study participants completed background and pre-assessment questionnaires and were then registered into the portal. By entering an activation key, participants were then able to review their lab results and diagnostic imaging reports. After six weeks, participants completed post-assessment questionnaires and usability heuristics. All data were collected using an online survey tool. Data were cleaned and analyzed using SAS v9.1. Results: A total of 311 breast cancer patients completed demographic and pre-assessment questionnaires, 250 registered to use the online intervention, and 125 participants completed all required study elements. Matching the pre- and post-anxiety scores demonstrated a decrease in mean anxiety scores (-2.2, p = 0.03); the chemotherapy sub-group had a statistically insignificant mean increase (1.8, p = .14). There was no mean change in self-efficacy scores. Conclusions: Participants generally found the portal easy to use; however, the perceived value of improved participation was not detected in the self-efficacy scores. Having access to personal health information did not increase anxiety levels. While these results suggest that the use of this PHR may be of benefit for informing patients, further research is required to investigate the impact on the patients experiences, their participation in their care, their relationships with the health care team, and their health outcomes.

AB  - A recent National Academies Report (NRC, 2009) indicates that informal learning experiences—including those occurring in museums—can be valuable to the development of crucial understandings of culture and science even for pre-kindergarten children. In the current study, we systematically investigated characteristics of parent-child interactions in a museum exhibit that are most effective in fostering young children's learning and retention of information. Specifically, we aimed to encourage greater object manipulation and more descriptions of evidence and explanations as parents and children learned about ancestral Puebloans in an exhibit at The Field Museum. We further examined if parents and children were able to retain and use what was learned in the Pueblo (1) to understand a different culture (the Central Plains Pawnees) featured in a different exhibit and (2) to report their experiences days and weeks after the museum visit. The sample of 83 children (M age = 4.9 years; 41 girls) and their parents (1/3 recruited through Chicago Public Schools) were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: (1) Objects-Only, (2) Cards-Only, (3) Objects + Cards, or (4) No Cards or Objects (Control). Before entering the exhibit, families in the Objects and Objects + Cards conditions were presented with six 'target' objects to manipulate (e.g., a mano and matate, a device for grinding corn). These objects were also featured prominently in the exhibit. Prior to exhibit entry, families in the Cards and Objects + Cards conditions were given pictures of these same objects on cards that also included Wh-questions about these objects (e.g., 'What do you think this is used for?'). Analyses of parent-child interactions in the exhibit reveal that our intervention was largely successful. For example, families who manipulated objects prior to entry into the exhibit (Objects-Only and Objects and Cards groups) were more likely than those who did not to be classified as high in object manipulation in the Pueblo exhibit. As shown in Figure 1, parents in groups that received cards (Cards-Only and Objects and Cards) asked more Wh-questions about the target objects in the exhibit than those who did not receive cards. Parents who received cards prior to exhibit entry also asked more Wh-questions relating that which was being experience to what their children already knew (associations), and more Wh-questions about the functions of target and nontarget objects in the exhibit. With regard to the memory conversations, our analyses show that after a 24-hour delay, parents in the Objects + Cards group were asking more Wh-questions and their children were recalling more information in comparison to Control parents and children. Following a two-week delay, children in the Objects + Cards group were recalling the most information. Additional analyses of parent-child talk in the Pawnee exhibit is presented that further suggest substantial impacts on learning for young children who are engaged both in object manipulation and conversation during informal educational experiences.

AB  - Background: Our current knowledge of the epidemiology of infertility is limited and outdated. Health care provision for infertility in the UK attracts public interest because of restrictions on access to services. Objective: To describe the incidence, prevalence, referral patterns and outcomes of infertile couples, presenting in general practice in UK. Methods: A population-based retrospective observational outcome study of infertile couples from general practices in Northumberland, Tyne and Wear, UK (population 1 043 513). Outcome data at 1 year were collected on all couples who presented to their GP between the 1st January 2005 and 30th June 2006 with a fertility problem. Results: Thirty-four per cent of general practices in the study area contributed data (population 404 263). The incidence of infertility was 0.9 couples per 1000 general population. The average age of women was 31 years, and the average time attempting conception was 18 months. Treatment end points for half of all couples were in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Over half of the couples in the study were not eligible for National Health Service (NHS) fertility treatment on social criteria. At 12 months, 27% of all couples in the study achieved a pregnancy spontaneously and a further 9% with treatment. Conclusions: Infertile women present to their GP later in life compared with 20 years ago, and after a shorter period of infertility. Half of the couples required treatment with IVF or ICSI. Adopting the British Fertility Society recommendation of allowing couples, where one or both partners has a child in a previous relationship, will result in an additional 26% of infertile couples becoming eligible for NHS fertility treatment.

AB  - Two case examples of abused adopted adolescents (15-yr-old male and 13-yr-old female) are discussed to highlight tension within the treatment relationship when the therapist is expected to accept without question a clearly unbelievable story. These examples illustrate how the lies of such youths can function as narrative truth. The unbelievable tales that emerge in the therapeutic work effectively alter the adolescents' perceptions about the perplexing loss of continuity, both internal and external, that occurred when they were removed from their homes. Characters in the stories represent fragmented self and object-representations as victim, abuser, rescuer, and passive onlooker. Counterparts to the patient as victim, abuser, rescuer, and passive onlooker can be recognized in the therapist's subjective responses. If the therapist can use countertransference to inform an understanding of the treatment process, an appreciation emerges that the truth of the lie is in its impact. Decisions about how to intervene can then be crafted. The second separation-individuation intrinsic to adolescent development is understood to provide an opportunity for this working-through process.

AB  - This study examined risk, resilience, and achievement in gifted high school students with disabilities in learning, behavior, and/or communication. The students had once been or were currently enrolled in a special program in a mid-size southwestern city. Phase I of the study utilized quantitative methodology to describe individual, family, and peer-school-community characteristics of the sample. Individual attributes of twice-exceptional high school students were assessed through school and special education records, survey and questionnaire forms completed by the students and parent(s), and a life events checklist. Family attributes were examined using student and parent survey instruments and questionnaires. Peer-school-community attributes were identified through student and parent survey instruments and questionnaires. Descriptive, relational, and inferential statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS. Student attributes were explored, including demographic, status, and achievement variables. The study compared characteristics of performance groups: above-average, average, and below-average groups, as measured by cumulative grade point average. Relationships between patterns of influence (personal, family, and peer-school-community) and achievement outcomes in high school were examined for the total sample and the performance levels. Phase II of the study utilized a qualitative methodology, the focus group interview, to investigate students' perceptions of their academic performance, as well as the internal and external factors that they believed had influenced their performance. The study compared and contrasted students' perceptions of influences with results of Phase I. Results of phases I and II of the study confirmed a profile of twice-exceptional youth as a heterogenous group. Although the groups were similar in intellectual abilities and disabilities, differences were found between the three performance groups on academic achievement, academic commitment, perceptions, family and school variables. Risk factors that were related to a below-average grade point average (D or below) were such factors as (a) school placement in a program of general, gifted, and special education classes, (b) illness as an adolescent, and (c) less parent help with homework. Protective factors that were related to positive outcomes included (a) participation in after-school activities, (b) participation in school-related activities and electives that foster self-expression, (c) higher reading scores, and (d) higher student aspirations for their future educational attainment.

AB  - In this chapter I have argued that adolescents are not the maladjusted children that we think, and for those that are in trouble it may well be because the older generation is presenting poor role models in terms of how to manage relationships with significant others. Society-wide changes in the structure of families may be the major contributor to these problems and the biggest challenge is how to deal with the impacts on children and adolescents. While much attention is focused on therapy and interventions for adolescents, perhaps we should be more focused on how to support and assist functional and constructive relationships between their parents. To that end, it may be the case that broad, educational approaches such as Couple Relationship Education may have wider benefits beyond the couple themselves. If as a society we can be persuaded that it is not only in our best interests but in our children’s best interests to maintain and foster our intimate interpersonal relationships, then perhaps we can also combat misconceptions of the troubled teen and take up the challenge as the two most important attachment figures in most adolescents’ lives—their mother and father.

AB  - Background: Children and adolescents with callous unemotional (CU) traits are at risk of severe and persistent antisocial behavior. It is commonly assumed that these children are difficult to treat but it has been proposed that they may benefit from being involved in interventions that go beyond typical parent training programs. This systematic review sought to answer two previously unanswered questions: do interventions involving young people reduce levels of CU traits? Do CU traits predict the effectiveness of interventions for antisocial behavior involving young people? Method: Studies were included that adopted an randomized controlled trial, controlled or open trial design and that had examined whether treatment was related to reductions in CU traits or whether CU traits predicted or moderated treatment effectiveness. Results: Treatments used a range of approaches, including behavioral therapy, emotion recognition training, and multimodal interventions. 4/7 studies reported reductions in CU traits following treatment. There was a mixed pattern of findings in 15 studies that examined whether CU traits predicted treatment outcomes following interventions for antisocial behavior. In 7/15 studies, CU traits were associated with worse outcomes, although three of these studies did not provide data on baseline antisocial behavior, making it difficult to evaluate whether children with high CU traits had shown improvements relative to their own behavioral baseline, despite having the worst behavioral outcomes overall. CU traits did not predict outcomes in 7/15 studies. Finally, a single study reported that CU traits predicted an overall increased response to treatment. Conclusions: Overall, the evidence supports the idea that children with CU traits do show reductions in both their CU traits and their antisocial behavior, but typically begin treatment with poorer premorbid functioning and can still end with higher levels of antisocial behavior. However, there is considerable scope to build on the current evidence base. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Gas, bloating, and belching are associated with a variety of conditions but are most commonly caused by functional gastrointestinal disorders. These disorders are characterized by disordered motility and visceral hypersensitivity that are often worsened by psychological distress. An organized approach to the evaluation of symptoms fosters trusting therapeutic relationships. Patients can be reliably diagnosed without exhaustive testing and can be classified as having gastric bloating, small bowel bloating, bloating with constipation, or belching disorders. Functional dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome, and chronic idiopathic constipation are the most common causes of these disorders. For presumed functional dyspepsia, noninvasive testing for Helicobacter pylori and eradication of confirmed infection (i.e., test and treat) are more cost-effective than endoscopy. Patients with symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome should be tested for celiac disease. Patients with chronic constipation should have a rectal examination to evaluate for dyssynergic defecation. Empiric therapy is a reasonable initial approach to functional gastrointestinal disorders, including acid suppression with proton pump inhibitors for functional dyspepsia, antispasmodics for irritable bowel syndrome, and osmotic laxatives and increased fiber for chronic idiopathic constipation. Nonceliac sensitivities to gluten and other food components are increasingly recognized, but highly restrictive exclusion diets have insufficient evidence to support their routine use except in confirmed celiac disease.

AB  - Background: Mobile technologies are emerging as tools to enhance health service delivery systems and empower clients to improve maternal, newborn, and child health. Limited evidence exists on the value for money of mobile health (mHealth) programs in low-and middle-income countries. Objective: This study aims to forecast the incremental cost-effectiveness of the Mobile Technology for Community Health (MOTECH) initiative at scale across 170 districts in Ghana. Methods: MOTECH's ``Client Data Application{''} allows frontline health workers to digitize service delivery information and track the care of patients. MOTECH's other main component, the ``Mobile Midwife,{''} sends automated educational voice messages to mobile phones of pregnant and postpartum women. We measured program costs and consequences of scaling up MOTECH over a 10-year analytic time horizon. Economic costs were estimated from informant interviews and financial records. Health effects were modeled using the Lives Saved Tool with data from an independent evaluation of changes in key services coverage observed in Gomoa West District. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were presented overall and for each year of implementation. Uncertainty analyses assessed the robustness of results to changes in key parameters. Results: MOTECH was scaled in clusters over a 3-year period to reach 78.7% (170/216) of Ghana's districts. Sustaining the program would cost US $17,618 on average annually per district. Over 10 years, MOTECH could potentially save an estimated 59,906 lives at a total cost of US $32 million. The incremental cost per disability-adjusted life year averted ranged from US $174 in the first year to US $6.54 in the tenth year of implementation and US $20.94 (95% CI US $20.34-$ 21.55) over 10 years. Uncertainty analyses suggested that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was most sensitive to changes in health effects, followed by personnel time. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses suggested that MOTECH had a 100% probability of being cost-effective above a willingness-to-pay threshold of US $50. Conclusions: This is the first study to estimate the value for money of the supply-and demand-side of an mHealth initiative. The adoption of MOTECH to improve MNCH service delivery and uptake represents good value for money in Ghana and should be considered for expansion. Integration with other mHealth solutions, including e-Tracker, may provide opportunities to continue or combine beneficial components of MOTECH to achieve a greater impact on health.

AB  - This study sought to determine whether the self-concepts of African American at-risk and not-at-risk elementary school students differed significantly. The research was based on the self-concept theories of Mead, Lehy and Shirk, and Purkey. Ninety-four fifth and sixth grade students from a South Mississippi school district, half of them at risk, half not, responded to the "About Me Self-Concept Report," a 30-item Likert-type scale. Significant differences were found between the two groups on the "general self," the "self in relation to others," and the "physical self." No difference between the groups was found on the "achieving self" and the "self-in-school" items. Since there is evidence that early intervention can improve the self-concepts of at-risk students, guidance services should be extended so more children can be counselled, and counselors should help elementary school teachers plan and implement effective activities to foster positive self-concepts among at-risk students. A list of 25 references is included, and a table presents the findings statistically. (WS)

AB  - This report describes and evaluates two programs which deal with chronic status offenders: the Grimes Alternative School Program, a delinquency prevention project which targets intermediate school (grades 4 and 5) students with chronic discipline and/or truant behaviors, and the Home Remedies Program, a short-term crisis intervention and family-centered therapy program which targets families with a child who is at risk for an out-of-home placement due to delinquent or chronic status offenses, emotional disturbance, or abuse and neglect. Data are presented from field interviews with program staffs, a staffing with the Home Remedies counselors, home visits with both programs, classroom observations and interviews, and written materials. For each program, discussions focus on the program's philosophy and goals, operation, and effectiveness. The Grimes program is described as serving from 9 to 12 children each school year who participate in a special "no failure" classroom with a special education teacher, aide, and counselor. It is noted that the project has demonstrated its ability to improve the children's school attendance, academic performance, and classroom behavior, and to minimize juvenile court involvement. Findings reported from the Home Remedies Program show that families receiving services remained intact for at least 6 months after the intervention, and that family functioning increased during program participation and continued to improve for at least 6 months after program completion.

AB  - This exploratory study examines the ways in which mental health programs for children and youth in a southeastern state have used knowledge about cultural competence to improve services for children who are members of racial and ethnic groups of color. These children may receive inappropriate and differential services when their families seek assistance for diem. In 1999, to remedy this problem, the Child and Adolescent Service System Minority Initiative issued a national call for cultural competence. Cultural competence is defined as the convergence of program structure and climate as well as a congruent set of behaviors, policies, and practices that enable programs and service providers to operate effectively with people from diverse backgrounds. Child mental health programs are the objects of the national appeal for child-centered community-based, and culturally competent services. These programs must cope with in demographic diversity in their service delivery area and must effectively meet the needs of vulnerable youth within a climate characterized by constant change and fiscal constraint. This study uses a cross-sectional, telephone administered, computer-misted survey to examine how publicly funded child mental health programs in a southeastern state use knowledge about cultural competence. The diffusion of innovation model provides a theoretical lens (1) to investigate the strategies used by child mental health programs to implement culturally competent care for children and youth, and (2) to explore the correlates of these strategies. The innovation, cultural competence, is an idea, technology, or practice that is perceived as new by potential adopters Program Coordinators were interviewed to gather data about themselves and the programs they supervise. Thirty-two of the 40 programs in the state completed interviews for a response rate of 80%. The Effort Toward Cultural Competence scale was developed to measure program activities in three arenas that are critical to implement cultural competence: personnel and staff development, outreach and environmental relationships, and program and milieu. Independent variables related to the coordinator, the program, and the communities served by the program were examined to assess their relationship with effort toward cultural competence as measured by the Effort Toward Cultural Competence scale. Programs tended to scare higher on the Personnel measure as compared to the Outreach and Milieu measures. In addition, programs led by coordinators who were in their positions longer than average scored significantly higher on the total scale score and on the milieu subscale. Other variables significantly related to at least one subscale are professional discipline, level of education, participation in national meetings, and percentage of clients who are children of color. Examination of open-ended responses suggests that the diffusion effort is still in process. Although coordinators have information about cultural competence, it does not appear that coordinators are able to use this information to change program policy, climate, and practice. It is speculated that utilization of knowledge about cultural competence is constrained by insufficient information and ability to operationalize the construct. A further constraint may be found by examining the influences of cultural, political, and interpersonal processes within the organization. Further studies, especially qualitative studies, are needed to better understand the factors that affect how programs use knowledge about cultural competence.

AB  - Objective: To examine the cost effectivess of a stratified-care regimen for patients with migraine - in which patients are stratified by severity of illness, and then prescribed differing treatments according to level of severity - compared with a conventional stepped-care approach. Design and methods: A decision analytic model was constructed to simulate a controlled clinical trial in which patients with migraine receiving primary medical care were randomly assigned to treatment under a stepped-care or a stratified-care regimen. A health service payer perspective was adopted and the time horizon was 1 year. Data inputs were: the frequency and disability of migraine, derived from population-based studies; disability level-specific treatment response rates for over-the-counter analgesics,aspirin/metoclopramide and zolmitriptan as the representative of high-end therapy obtained from an international consensus opinion enquiry; and unit costs of healthcare obtained from UK health service sources. Main outcome measures and results: The estimated 1-year direct healthcare costs per primary care patient with migraine were pound sterling (£) 156.82 for stepped care and £151.57 for stratified care. Estimates of treatment response rates were 40 and 71% for stepped and stratified care, respectively. The cost per successfully treated attack was £23.43 for stepped care and £12.60 for stratified care. Stratified care remained cost effective when tested in a wide range of one-way sensitivity analyses, and probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed the cost effectiveness of stratified care to be significant at the 3% level. Conditional confidence analysis showed that the level of confidence in the cost effectiveness of stratified care varied positively with the case mix, i.e. in populations where the proportion of moderate and severely disabled patients with migraine was greater than 25%, the cost effectiveness of stratified care remained statistically significant. Conclusion: A stratified-care treatment strategy (including zolmitriptan as the representative of high-end therapy) is a highly cost-effective method of managing migraine in the primary care setting compared with stepped care, delivering improved clinical outcomes at no additional cost.

AB  - This study investigated counseling psychologists' use of the Family Environment Scale (FES) as a developmentally oriented assessment within the treatment foster care setting (TFC) to promote the optimal development of adolescents. Participants for this study consisted of a population of the treatment foster care families and adolescents who were placed in a (TFC) setting for the treatment of clinical issues in the state of New Mexico. The TFC treatment coordinator and TFC counselor, who were responsible for the formal assessment process of the adolescent and TFC family, completed the FES Forms R (Real) and E (Expected). Three subscales containing the greatest difference between the obtained scores on the FES Forms R and E served as the focus for treatment intervention with TFC families to promote optimal family functioning, thus promoting optimal adolescent development and placement stability. The Behavioral and Emotional Rating Scale (BERS) and TFC records relative to reported disruptive incidents were utilized to assess adolescents' level of developmental functioning and placement stability, preintervention, post intervention, and at 3 months post intervention. Results of the statistical analysis revealed significant results supporting two of the primary research hypotheses. Significance was found for the FES-Directed intervention group's reduction in placement disruptions (at 3 months post intervention) above that of the Non-FES-Directed intervention and no intervention control groups. This finding provides support for the use of the FES as a developmentally oriented assessment for promoting placement stability within treatment foster care. In addition, significance was found for the FES-Directed intervention and the Non-FES-Directed intervention groups' reduction in placement disruptions above that of the no intervention control group (at 3 months post intervention). This finding supports both the use of the FES and the intervention model (at 3 months post-intervention) to promote placement stability within treatment foster care. The secondary hypothesis could not be statistically analyzed due to an absence of males and an insufficient representation of ethnicities in the control group. A nonsignificant novel finding related to males showed greater gains in developmental functioning. This is discussed, as well as the implications of this research for counseling psychologists and for future research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In this review of a recent set of faculty development initiatives to promote geriatrics teaching by general internists, nontraditional strategies to promote sustained change were identified, included enrolling a limited number of ``star{''} faculty, creating ongoing working relationships between faculty, and developing projects for clinical or education program improvement. External funding, although limited, garnered administration support and was associated with changes in individual career trajectories. Activities to enfranchise top leadership were felt essential to sustain change. Traditional faculty development programs for clinician educators are periodic, seminar-based interventions to enhance teaching and clinical skills. In 2003/04 the Collaborative Centers for Research and Education in the Care of Older Adults were funded by the John A. Hartford Foundation and administered by the Society of General Internal Medicine. Ten academic medical centers received individual grants of $91,000, with required cost sharing, to develop collaborations between general internists and geriatricians to create sustained change in geriatrics clinical teaching and learning. Through written and structured telephone surveys, activities designed to foster sustainability at funded sites were identified, and the activities and perceived effects of funding at the 10 funded sites were compared with those of the 11 highest-ranking unfunded sites. The experience of the Collaborative Centers supports the conclusion that modest, targeted funding can provide the credibility and legitimacy crucial for clinician educators to allocate time and energy in new directions. Key success factors likely include high intensity and duration, integration into career trajectories, integration into clinical programs, and activities to enfranchise institutional leadership.

AB  - Virtual reality (VR) has been demonstrated to offer learning benefits over traditional instructional methods in many technical and occupational areas. However, in the framework of Rogers' innovation diffusion theory, adoption of VR in Career and Technical Education and occupational programs appears to be lagging. This study used experimental methodology to test the possibility of positively influencing the dispositions of occupational educators toward desktop VR through application of prime theory in a context of supplantation and technology self-efficacy theory. Supraliminal bipolar primes were used to test whether a positive disposition more conducive to VR adoption could be created in a sample of 30 occupational educators prior to introduction of a desktop VR presentation, with "disposition" defined as a pair of specific performance measures. Intended as a pilot study, this inquiry used ANOVA and correlation statistical analyses to produce sufficient indications of relationships between positive primes, VR viewing time, and perceived confidence in VR to merit recommendation of further investigation.

AB  - Purpose. The purpose of this study was to identify and describe how children in their early stages of development, ages five to nine, are affected by the stigma of having their mother incarcerated, as perceived by the foster parent, teacher, social worker, and counselor. In addition, it was the purpose of this study to identify and describe the impact of the mother's incarceration and how it affects child development, self-esteem, and socialization in schools. Methodology. The researcher used a case study type approach for a qualitative research with an ethnographic design. The research focused on the experiences of children ages five to nine who have incarcerated mothers. There were several interviews conducted with teachers, counselors, foster parents, and social workers. The population in this study includes nearly 20,000 children who are affected by having a mother who is incarcerated. There was a process of randomly selecting from those willing to participate who met the criteria of the study. After five cases were identified, there were interviews with those involved. Findings. The study found the following: (1) The majority of students were academically low. The emotional development seemed to be the biggest concern for the majority of respondents. (2) The majority of the students knew that their mother was incarcerated, and some had negative behaviors attached to their mother's incarceration. (3) Many of the students were able to make friends but only a small percentage could maintain friends. Many of the students initiated conflicts. Conclusions. Based on the outcomes of this study, further research should be done in the following areas: There must be satisfactory consideration paid to the social development and academic achievement of children. In addition, if educators can identify the unique behavior patterns of children in school, experiencing, shame, guilt, or stigma, they can overcome those barriers through interventions that promote socialization. Special attention must also be paid to the cognitive and behavioral implications of stereotypes or stigmas. It is imperative to pay close attention to the various effects of attachment in the early stages of childhood. The foster care system must also be a component of further research as well as resiliency. It would be insightful to do a comparison study of fathers versus mothers.

AB  - Children living in foster care are an especially vulnerable population who often come to the attention of Medicaid mental health providers. These children experience a high incidence of emotional and behavioral disorders and may have specialized treatment needs related to their living arrangement status. This study assessed whether Children’s Psychosocial Rehabilitation could effectively treat youth with severe emotional and behavioral disorders who live in foster care. Analysis of data from an open trial of 218 clinically-impaired youth, aged 3–18 years, revealed no reliable differences in treatment outcome between foster versus non-foster children, with a trend toward more favorable outcomes for foster youth. Findings justify further study of the effectiveness of this Medicaid-funded service for the treatment of youth in care.

AB  - 'Not every child has an equal talent or an equal ability or equal motivation, but children have the equal right to develop their talent, ability, and their motivation.' (John F. Kennedy). Today's schools serve a diverse student body, and are comprised of individuals who have an array of talents, skills and levels of motivation. Secondary schools, in particular, have a tremendous responsibility, which is to prepare students for exodus into society. For decades; however, students with learning disabilities have faced a myriad of challenges, which include lowered teacher expectations, low self-determination skills, and poor transition services (Mainzer et al., 2003) As a result of these challenges, students with disabilities must be provided challenging standards based curriculum, modified and supplemented to meet their individual needs (Pugach & Mellan, 2002). This descriptive, single case study embodies a constructivist qualitative paradigm whose primary focus is to examine the extent to which students with learning disabilities (LD) are given authentic opportunities to access the general curriculum as compared to their non-disabled peers. A thorough analysis of the data revealed: (1) Teachers need ongoing training to develop strategies that could potentially aide student success in the general education classrooms. (2) Administrative support is the key not only to creating more succinct programs, but in fostering collaborative relationships. (3) When students are supported by teachers, counselors, administrators and their parents, they are more likely to play an active role in their lives, leading to increased levels of self-determination. Implications for practice include providing ongoing training opportunities for staff to better meet the needs of students with disabilities. To motivate students and staff, it is suggested that administrative support be increased and collaborative partnerships established. It is also recommended that students take an active role in the decision making processes that will ultimately impact their future endeavors. Finally, schools need to ensure that students with disabilities have access to general curricular materials that are rigorous and challenging; modifying and adapting content to meet each individual's need.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to identify and describe to what degree foster care students perceive that the elements of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) affect their academic performance in postsecondary education. In addition, it was the purpose of this study to identify the perceived impacts of internal and external influences on the college enrollment of students who grew up in foster care. Finally, it was the purpose of this study to identify intervention strategies that can enhance the development and success of these individuals. Methodology: The subjects of this study were 563 former foster youth attending a California community college. Using a mixed-method, descriptive study structure, subjects participated in an online survey producing quantitative results and qualitative data gathered from 16 follow-up telephone interviews. Findings: All the survey respondents suffered from one or more of the symptoms of PTSD and this they felt had an impact on their academic performance in college. External influences and internal drive all had an impact on their decision to enroll in college. Intervention strategies identified by former foster youth which assisted with staying in college was internal drive and help with financial aid and Chafee application as well as academic counseling. Conclusions: The literature and the data analysis findings brought to the forefront conclusions surrounding the academic impact of PTSD on former foster youth in the California community college system. Recommendations: The research literature supports the conclusions of this study regarding the high percentage of students entering college experiencing PTSD, and the data clearly demonstrates that directed programs within each California community college could benefit this population.

AB  - Background: This paper focuses on the qualitative component of a study evaluating a hope intervention, entitled Living with Hope Program (LWHP), designed to foster hope in female caregivers of family members living with advanced cancer. The purpose of this research is to share, in the form of a story, the experiences of rural female caregivers caring for family members with advanced cancer, focusing on what fosters their hope. Hope is a psychosocial and spiritual resource that has been found to help family caregivers live through difficult transitions and challenges. Methods: Twenty-three participants from rural Western Canada completed daily journal entries documenting their hopes and challenges. Cortazzi's (2001) method of narrative analysis was used to analyze the data, which was then transcribed into a narrative entitled 'hope against hope.' Results: The journal entries highlighted: the caregivers' hopes and what fostered their hope; the various challenges of caregiving; self-care strategies, and; their emotional journey. Hope was integrated throughout their entire experience, and 'hope against hope' describes how hope persists even when there is no hope for a cure. Conclusions: This research contributes to the assessment of caregiver interventions that impact hope and quality of life, while illustrating the value of a narrative approach to both research and practice. Journaling may be particularly valuable for rural caregivers who are isolated, and may lack direct professional and peer support. There is an opportunity for health professionals and other providers to foster a relationship of trust with family caregivers, in which their story can be told openly and where practitioners pay closer attention to the psychosocial needs of caregivers.

AB  - Purpose. The purpose of this study was to identify and determine the extent to which each of Kotter's 8 steps to effective change was present in the implementation of the Kaiser Permanente Southern California Healthy Bones Model of Care as perceived by physician champions and Healthy Bones care managers. A secondary purpose was to identify effective steps to change that were not expressed. A third purpose of the study was to identify incidents or strategies that occurred that refute the importance of one or more of Kotter's change strategies. Methodology. The subjects in the study included 20 physician champions and 35 Healthy Bones care managers employed in the Kaiser Permanente Southern California Healthy Bones Model of Care. Twenty-five had been employed in their current role since the implementation of the program. Of those, 16 agreed to participate. The interview instrument was an e-mail interview. Findings. Examination of qualitative data resulted in 8 major findings. Among the findings were the following: 9 effective and 6 ineffective themes were identified, 10 best practices emerged, 6 ineffective strategies confirmed Kotter's list of common errors, and nothing in the narrative responses from participants refuted Kotter's 8-step change model as an effective model for managing change. Conclusions. The results of the study supported the conclusion that Kotter's 8-step change model, coupled with the findings of this study, can be an effective guide for healthcare reform initiatives at the national, corporate, and medical center levels. Recommendations. Proponents of improvements to the American healthcare system can use Kotter's change model and recommendations from this study to remove obstacles and barriers to change and foster supportive participation from participating healthcare professionals.

AB  - Over the past 13 years, the U.S. has been engaged in 'the long war,' a battle that has been chronicled by many, but fought by few. The burden of carrying the long war, marked by repeated and extended deployment, has taken its toll on service members and their families. Many psychologically injured service members are parents returning home to their families, tasked with rebuilding relationships with children who have grown physically and developmentally. Indeed, over 42% of children of active duty parents are between the ages of 0 to 5. Young children are particularly vulnerable to environmental stress and impaired parental capacity. Nonetheless, research focusing on the experiences of young children affected by their parents' deployment experiences is limited. The study utilized secondary analysis of data derived from the first wave of the 2010 longitudinal Military Family Life Project (MFLP), conducted by the Human Resources Strategic Assessment Program (HSRAP), Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC). Bivariate and multiple regression analysis were used to examine the interplay of risk and protective factors influencing the emotional health of young children, ages 0-3, affected by post-deployment circumstances. Several psychosocial variables emerged as predictors of young children's emotional health in the context of reintegration, including the civilian parent's (CP's) perception that the public supports the war, CP stress, couple readjustment, community support, military satisfaction, imminent deployment, perception that deployed service members are making a difference, family support, military parent (MP) distress, and marital satisfaction. The findings suggest that both interdisciplinary professionals and policy makers should consider the needs of both the parent and child in fostering resilience across the family unit. Furthermore, professionals and policy makers are urged to strengthen family and community resources, as well as programs and services across systems, on behalf of families and their young children. These mechanisms of support can be leveraged to reduce parental stress, foster optimal couple readjustment, and promote positive family schemas that, in turn, contribute to the emotional health of the military's youngest family members.

AB  - School readiness includes not only the early academic skills of children but abstract also their physical health, language skills, social and emotional development, motivation to learn, creativity, and general knowledge. Families and communities play a critical role in ensuring children's growth in all of these areas and thus their readiness for school. Schools must be prepared to teach all children when they reach the age of school entry, regardless of their degree of readiness. Research on early brain development emphasizes the effects of early experiences, relationships, and emotions on creating and reinforcing the neural connections that are the basis for learning. Pediatricians, by the nature of their relationships with families and children, may signifi cantly infl uence school readiness. Pediatricians have a primary role in ensuring children's physical health through the provision of preventive care, treatment of illness, screening for sensory defi cits, and monitoring nutrition and growth. They can promote and monitor the socialemotional development of children by providing anticipatory guidance on development and behavior, by encouraging positive parenting practices, by modeling reciprocal and respectful communication with adults and children, by identifying and addressing psychosocial risk factors, and by providing community-based resources and referrals when warranted. Cognitive and language skills are fostered through timely identifi cation of developmental problems and appropriate referrals for services, including early intervention and special education services; guidance regarding safe and stimulating early education and child care programs; and promotion of early literacy by encouraging language-rich activities such as reading together, telling stories, and playing games. Pediatricians are also well positioned to advocate not only for children's access to health care but also for highquality early childhood education and evidence-based family supports such as home visits, which help provide a foundation for optimal learning.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to examine the effects of customized individual counseling interventions on the career and college readiness of adolescents within foster care. An intervention program, consisting of customized individual interventions, entitled "Students That Are Reaching Success" ("S.T.A.R.S.") was created by the counselor/investigator. The three female participants were adolescents in foster care custody by a department of social services in a southeastern county and attended different high schools. The conceptual frameworks for "the S.T.A.R.S." program were: the Ecological Model for Human Development, Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT), Cognitive Information Processing Approach (CIP), and the American School Counselor Association's National Model. They were used as a foundation for creating individualized counseling interventions for each participant. An N = 1/A-B-A single-subject experimental design was replicated three times to enhance generalization of the findings and offset possible attrition of participation. After baseline (Phase A1) data were collected over a two-week period, participants met with the counselor/investigator individually for one hour, once per week, for six weeks during the treatment intervention program (Phase B). Outcome data were collected throughout Phase B. Following the six-week intervention, there was a two-week hiatus from the treatment when outcome data were collected again (Phase A2 repeated-withdrawal). The Career and College Readiness Self-Efficacy Inventory (CCRSI) was the measure from which the dependent variables were derived. The customized individual career and college readiness counseling intervention was the independent variable, and the four CCRSI career and college readiness self-efficacy factors were the dependent variables. The four CCRSI factors were: (a) college knowledge, (b) positive personal characteristics, (c) academic competence, and (d) potential to achieve future goals. Data from the baseline (A1), treatment (B), and withdrawal (A2) phases were analyzed via an R software package used for analyzing single-subject data. Descriptive data were presented. Autocorrelations were also calculated for each phase of each factor of the intervention for each participant. A regression analysis was used to determine if there was significant trend in any phase for each factor of the intervention. The Robust Conservative Dual-Criteria (RCDC) method was then used as a statistical analysis tool, and the G-index statistic was used to calculate effect size. A visual analysis was conducted in the form of line graphs and regression plot graphs. Furthermore, the fidelity of treatment was recorded in the counselor/investigator's field notes, and unforeseen participant and setting changes were both documented and discussed. Overall, the customized career and college readiness intervention program was most effective for increasing academic competence self-efficacy across all three participants. Very little change was shown for the potential to achieve future goals factor due to the high level of self-efficacy each participant presented initially as indicated by the high, consistent baseline scores. The intervention program was also most effective for increasing college knowledge self-efficacy in participants 2 and 3 and positive personal characteristics self-efficacy in participant 2. The Attitude Toward Treatment (ATT) social validity measure revealed there was a significant treatment effect across all three participants who all scored within the high range for attitudes toward treatment. Limitations related to methodology and recommendations for counseling practice and future research were shared. Recommendations for practice included the need for school counselors to create customized counseling interventions to meet the individualized career and college readiness needs of foster care youth, the need for counselors to establish bidirectional relationships between themselves and other members of the foster youths' support networks, and the need for college counselors to create support groups for transition-aged foster care youth within the post-secondary educational environment. Recommendations for future research included replication of the current study to increase generalizability to adolescents in foster care, research on the impact support networks have on the career and college readiness of adolescents in foster care, and additional research on the role school counselors can play in the career and college readiness of foster care youth.

AB  - The African-American male has historically underperformed when compared to other subgroups on academic measures, and research shows that academics are impacted by social and emotional skills (Hymel & Schonert-Richel, 2007). Despite the compelling research connecting social and emotional learning to improved academics, the nation's schools have been slow to adopt social and emotional learning programs as part of the overall curriculum. This study sought to describe the social and emotional differences between proficient readers and non-proficient readers for African American male students of poverty. It also sought to describe the perceptions and beliefs of teachers of students of poverty around social and emotional learning. The researcher found the Social Emotional Assets and Resilience Scales (SEARS)-T short form scores for proficient readers were significantly higher than their non-proficient peers. The data reveal the social emotional competencies of responsibility, self-regulation, and empathy as likely to impact reading achievement. The beliefs and perceptions of social and emotional learning for teachers in high poverty environments are also described in detail. Themes emerged in the areas of professional development, the influence of the home, the need for differentiated student support, and social emotional differences of proficient readers.

AB  - Research has indicated that LGB (lesbian, gay, bisexual) individuals are at elevated risk for psychopathology when compared with their heterosexual peers, a finding that was highlighted in the Institute of Medicine's report on The Health of LGBT People (Cochran & Mays, 2000; Cochran, Sullivan, & Mays, 2003; IOM, 2011; King et al., 2008). Sexual minorities and sexual minority couples also have been found to have greater romantic relationship difficulties than heterosexual peers (Balsam & Szymanski, 2005; Frost & Meyer, 2009; Mays, Cochran, & Roeder, 2003; Meyer & Dean, 1998; Otis, Rostosky, Riggle, Hamrin, & Cramer, 2006; Spencer & Brown, 2007). Therefore, this study targeted sexual minorities exclusively and separately from their heterosexual peers to elucidate the patterns of vulnerabilities that underlie poor outcomes and to better account for resilience and positive outcomes when observed. This study premised that individuals in society are often exposed to homophobic beliefs. For LBG persons, this exposure occurs at an early age and throughout the lifespan. These beliefs are subsequently internalized and can lead to negative feelings about oneself as a sexual being with same sex attractions. This last process is termed 'internalized homophobia' or 'internalized heterosexism' abbreviated as (IH). However, many sexual minorities are able to counter, manage, and even learn to accept that they have internalized certain heterosexist assumptions from the larger society, even as they love, form healthy romantic relationships, work, and lead fulfilling adult lives --- in a word, these individuals tend to have a lesser degree of internalized heterosexism and suffer less from negative psychological and social outcomes, even in the face of heterosexist attitudes held by society, and often held by those whom they value most. This study found that negative psychological and social outcomes, including psychological distress, low self-esteem, poor romantic relationship quality, and poor social supports, related to negative early relational experiences and negative evaluations of the self as a sexual being. Specifically, negative outcomes were moderately, but significantly, predicted by negative early relational experiences, a factor comprised of the following three variables: insecure attachment to the primary caregiver/s, early relational trauma, and negative parental attitudes toward homosexuality. In addition, one-third of the relationship found between early relational difficulties, and later negative outcomes, was explainable by the presence of a high degree of internalized heterosexism within the sexual minority women in this sample. Overall, this study has provided empirical support for the mediating role of internalized heterosexism in the lives of sexual minority women who have had early traumatic, rejecting, and abusive experiences, and now suffer from negative psychological and social outcomes. Therefore, this study supports the need for the creation of better social and clinical interventions aimed at understanding and ameliorating internalized heterosexism to reduce risk and foster adaptation in this marginalized group with relational difficulties and psychological distress.

AB  - Knowledge of ‘what works’ in early-intervention family services has prompted moves away from approaches which see varied services working autonomously with individual family members, towards provision of multi-agency cross-sector programmes working at a family level. Latterly, some such programmes have adopted Restorative Approach in the belief that delivering services using a more participatory relationship-based framework will support families more effectively. To consider this shift towards use of a Restorative Approach this article explores the concepts and theory that underpin the approach, reflects on how these relate to recommended UK early-intervention family service practice, and constructs a model of family service provision based on the approach. The aim of this article is to consider whether adoption of Restorative Approach has the potential to improve early-intervention family service effectiveness and ultimately have a positive outcome on families.

AB  - Background: Donor retention is a key concern for blood collection agencies around the world. Despite a substantial body of research on facilitators of and barriers to donor return, few successful interventions to promote donor return have resulted. A new approach: We suggest that insufficient attention has been paid to donor emotional experience. To address this, we outline the <italic>Time‐course of Emotion in Donation</italic> (TED) approach. First, we detail how identifying and understanding donor emotional experience across different time‐points (i.e. in anticipation of donating, while donating, and in recollection of donating) may be key to developing effective strategies to boost donor retention. Second, we report initial results of a research project that assessed emotional experiences of first‐time and novice whole blood donors. Donors reported their experience of several positive and negative emotions at four time‐points: in the waiting area of the donation centre, in the phlebotomy chair before and after needle insertion, and in the refreshment area after donation. Results of preliminary analysis indicate that the experience of positive emotions was far more prevalent than of negative emotions. Third, we provide practical recommendations for researchers interested in adopting a TED approach. Our vision: We describe a vision of how insight provided by a TED approach to donor psychology research might be implemented practically by blood collection agencies and practitioners alike. This vision includes innovative interventions to promote donor return as well as carefully curated donor communication strategies.

AB  - Children presenting to the emergency department continue to experience suboptimal pain management. While evidence-based pain management interventions are available to clinicians, effective and sustainable practice change is yet to be achieved. This practice gap requires a collaborative approach to knowledge translation targeting systems of care. The purpose of this review was to explore systems level change in the emergency department for improved paediatric pain management. Integrative review. CINAHL, Embase, PubMed/Medline, Dynamed, Cochrane, Scopus, Prospero and Joanna Briggs Institute were systematically searched, and clinical guidelines and reference lists scanned. Studies were screened and selected according to the inclusion criteria, and independently appraised for risk of bias. Integrative review methodology informed data extraction and synthesis, focused on organisational context and engagement, facilitation and implementation of practice change, key components of the pain management interventions, and evaluation. Twenty studies met the inclusion criteria: 18 uncontrolled pretest-posttest and two pseudo-randomised design. Study populations ranged from children with a specific presentation, to all presenting children. All studies adopted a multifaceted approach to organisational change, bundling various interventions including pain assessment tools and management protocols, clinician education, nurse-initiated analgesia, feedback and family engagement. Four studies used local systems analysis to inform interventions and two studies applied an implementation framework. Time to analgesia was the most commonly improved primary outcome. Parent and child sensitive outcomes were assessed in five studies. Interventions that hold the most promise for optimised pain management if embedded in the workplace include nurse-initiated analgesia and family involvement at each stage of pain management in the emergency department. The way forward is to respectfully engage all stakeholders—children, parents and clinicians—to collaboratively develop evidence-based, sustainable solutions aligned with the emergency department context. Guided by an implementation framework, future research designed to creatively translate evidence into practice and facilitate change at a systems level is a priority. Key to this solution is the integration of family involvement in pain management, considering child and family sensitive outcome measures. Effectiveness of new interventions should be evaluated in the short and long term to embed sustainable practice change. Frontline nurses are well placed to lead this transformation in paediatric pain management in the emergency department. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Escalating mental health care needs coupled with a decreasing nurse labor force demand a fundamental paradigm shift in undergraduate education and service partnerships among psychiatric-mental health nursing students and practicing nurses. The purpose of this two-group comparative study was to identify factors that contribute to a successful learning partnership between nursing students and practicing nurses engaged in a clinical specialty partnership program within an acute psychiatric-mental health setting. The convenience sample consisted of 51 partners: 33 undergraduate students and 18 practicing nurses. The Learning Partnership Survey was administered to all partners allowing comparison of ranking among factors important to the partner relationship. Contrary to previous research, student and nurse partners were more similar in their factor ranking in the present study. Statistically significant differences were noted in the ranking of 2 of the 15 factors that fostered successful learning partnerships. Implications for professional learning partnerships between nursing academia and service institutions are discussed.

AB  - Demand for school reform continues to be characterized by a cry to adopt new leadership behaviors and change the preparation of school leaders. Once hired, new school leaders are confronted by the weight of tradition and history in their new jobs. This paper reports on an investigation of the impact of these socialization practices on new assistant principals, particularly women graduates of one leadership preparation program. The paper states that the investigation examined the way in which these women were inducted into school leadership. Each graduated from a newly designed preparation program built around state and national standards, focused on teaching and learning as the central role of schools, and committed to collaborative approaches as the best way to achieve shared goals. It explains that because the study subjects were women, the investigation also explored the impact that gender-associated leadership preferences had on their socialization. The paper notes that preliminary data were collected when the students graduated from the program, and two years following graduation. After each student had completed a second year as a school leader, they were resurveyed. It states that a grounded theory approach was used to analyze student responses. The study in the paper found that during preparation of these new school leaders, the centrality of teaching and learning, democratic leadership, attention to relationships, and decision-making (contextual and grounded in an ethic of care) were emphasized. The paper recounts many examples of the thought provoking, feminine leadership style these program graduates employed. (Contains 65 references.) (BT)

AB  - Objectives The aim of the current study is to quantify mental health-related emergency department (ED) presentations and hospitalisations, and associated child and family characteristics, in children recruited through four Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisations. Setting Four Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services that deliver primary care. All services were located in urban or large regional centres in New South Wales, Australia. Participants 1476 Aboriginal children aged 0-17 years at recruitment to the Study of Environment on Aboriginal Resilience and Child Health. Primary outcome measures ED presentations and hospital admissions with a primary mental health diagnosis obtained via linkage to population health datasets. Results Over a median of 6-year follow-up, there were 96 ED presentations affecting 62 children (10.7/1000 person-years) and 49 hospitalisations affecting 34 children (5.5/1000 person-years) for mental health conditions. Presentations/admissions increased with age. ED presentation was increased with: living in foster versus parental care (adjusted rate ratio (RR)=3.97, 95% CrI 1.26 to 11.80); high versus low baseline child emotional/behavioural problems (adjusted RR=2.93, 95% CrI 1.50 to 6.10); and caregiver chronic health conditions versus none (adjusted RR=2.81, 95% CrI 1.31 to 6.63). Hospitalisations were significantly increased with caregiver unemployment versus home duties (adjusted RR=4.48, 95% CrI 1.26 to 17.94) and caregiver chronic health problems versus none (adjusted RR=3.83, 95% CrI 1.33 to 12.12). Conclusions Tertiary care for mental health issues was relatively common among participating Aboriginal children, with risk elevated for those living in foster care, with prior mental health and behavioural problems and with carers with chronic illness and/or unemployment. While this study suggests high rates of serious mental health events among children from participating communities, the optimum means for reducing these rates, and the need for tertiary care, has not yet been determined. Such information is urgently required to inform policy and programmes to support Aboriginal child and adolescent mental health.

AB  - A growing number of studies have demonstrated a strong association between reproductive coercion and unintended pregnancy among adolescent and young adult females. However, few studies have examined how a pregnancy resulting from an experience of reproductive coercion affects parenting and the child's development. To address this gap in the current literature, the present study sought to examine the effect of reproductive coercion on parenting competence, caregiving involvement, and child development at 6- and 12-months postpartum using a dyadic perspective. The data were collected from a prospective cohort study of 296 pregnant adolescent females and their male partners (N = 592 participants), who were followed from pregnancy to 12-months postpartum. The Actor Partner Interdependence Model (APIM) was used to examine the effects of an individual's (actor) and their partner's (partner) experience of reproductive coercion on parenting competence, caregiving involvement, and child development. Generalized Estimating Equations were performed to test associations between reproductive coercion and parenting outcomes. An actor's experience of reproductive coercion was significantly associated with lower parenting sense of competence 12-months postpartum. Our findings suggest that reproductive coercion may interfere with adolescents' transition into parenthood. Programs should consider reproductive coercion as a possible form of trauma and adopt activities that aim to mitigate its effects on children of adolescent and young adult parents.

AB  - This book addresses the lack of research and scholarly discussion on multicultural literacies. A common theme across chapters is the ways in which elements of difference--race, ethnicity, gender, class, and language--create tensions that influence students' literacy experiences and achievements. Sections explore the relationships among culture, language, literacy, and identity; describe the development and implementation of curricula, assessments, and materials for diverse students (rural Appalachian children, Navajos, Asian Canadian immigrants, and Spanish-speaking students); and focus on teacher education issues. Following an introduction, "Giving Voice to Multicultural Literacy Research and Practice" (Georgia Earnest Garcia), the chapters are: (1) "Finding Esmerelda's Shoes: A Case Study of a Young Bilingual Child's Responses to Literature" (Eurydice Bouchereau Bauer); (2) "Examining Children's Biliteracy in the Classroom" (Joel Dworin); (3) "Headwoman's Blues: Small Group Reading and the Interactions of Culture, Gender, and Ability" (Shuaib J.

AB  - Homeless adolescents have been emancipated by child welfare systems without self-sufficiency needs. This study evaluated the effectiveness of Teen Advocate Group Youth Council (TAGyc) in self-efficacy and skills-building development in housing, education, and employment of youth ages 18 through 21 years. The objective was to identify transitional needs, address TAGyc service impact for participating youth and those with mental health diagnoses, and identify effective methodology to assist youth in preparatory skills for adulthood. Multiple regression analysis from secondary data provided accountability for TAGyc through program evaluation. The study determined TAGyc involvement increased self-sufficiency needs of youth. A relationship was identified between TAGyc engagement and emancipated youth being homeless, unemployed, and lacking education (F(6,164) = 5.36, p = .000). Regression analysis revealed a negative correlation with mental health (-.09), age (-.27), and gender (-.01). Youth engaged in services offered by TAGyc were found to be less likely to become homeless (11%), jobless (1%), and lack education (28%). However, youth with a mental health diagnosis struggled in the program. The research revealed that TAGyc increased the likelihood of self-sufficiency and success of emancipated youth. Youth social perspective, hindered by no support, distress, and negative maturity in life, supported the need for resources to encourage growth and success. TAGyc provided youth a supportive resource to learn independent skills; foster relationships with others who have had similar experiences; and facilitate lifelong connections to strengthen self-sufficiency needs of aging out youth in policy, practice, and outcomes.

AB  - This dissertation is focused on intentional intervention strategies adopted in a prior five-year period by Denver Area High School for the purpose of reducing suspensions, expulsions, referrals, other minor disciplinary infractions, and reduced failure rates. Those strategies included implementing a Culture of Care, which included (a) Restorative Practices, (b) Restorative Justice, (c) Relationships, and (d) Professional Learning Communities or Teams. Those interventions, which started in the Dean's office, have been pushed into the classroom. However, some teachers are still over referring students for disciplinary actions and failure rates are too high. Professional learning teams, which are meant to support teachers in the adoption of restorative and instructional practices that lead to higher expectations and improved outcomes for all students, may not be succeeding because teams are avoiding the hard questions about the Culture of Care that would improve academic achievement. As a result, this case study was designed to determine the effectiveness of the Denver Area High School training to further develop professional learning team (PLT) leaders. During the case study, PLT leaders were presented with referral and failure rates and received training to improve analysis and outcomes through restorative practices and PLT practices. With support, the PLT leaders engaged and collaborated with teachers to completely adopt professional learning team and restorative practices by expanding their leadership skills, increasing personal buy-in, and improving their understanding and empathy for urban students. Six PLT leadership training sessions and two PLT observations focused on grades 9 and 10 core content areas. PLT leadership training sessions were observed and exit tickets were analyzed for training outcomes. The exit ticket analysis indicated that the intended learning targets and outcomes were achieved. The PLT observations were conducted and determined that cultural shifts were evident in the observations which represented the level of implementation of the PLT leadership training. At the conclusion of the study, evidence collected through exit tickets and observations indicated an improvement in teacher and PLT practices. Additional evidence collected from failure rates and referral rates showed a significant decline in referral rates that were at least partially attributed to the leadership training and an alignment of students pass rates with attendance rates.

AB  - This dissertation is focused on intentional intervention strategies adopted in a prior five-year period by Denver Area High School for the purpose of reducing suspensions, expulsions, referrals, other minor disciplinary infractions, and reduced failure rates. Those strategies included implementing a Culture of Care, which included (a) Restorative Practices, (b) Restorative Justice, (c) Relationships, and (d) Professional Learning Communities or Teams. Those interventions, which started in the Dean's office, have been pushed into the classroom. However, some teachers are still over referring students for disciplinary actions and failure rates are too high. Professional learning teams, which are meant to support teachers in the adoption of restorative and instructional practices that lead to higher expectations and improved outcomes for all students, may not be succeeding because teams are avoiding the hard questions about the Culture of Care that would improve academic achievement. As a result, this case study was designed to determine the effectiveness of the Denver Area High School training to further develop professional learning team (PLT) leaders. During the case study, PLT leaders were presented with referral and failure rates and received training to improve analysis and outcomes through restorative practices and PLT practices. With support, the PLT leaders engaged and collaborated with teachers to completely adopt professional learning team and restorative practices by expanding their leadership skills, increasing personal buy-in, and improving their understanding and empathy for urban students. Six PLT leadership training sessions and two PLT observations focused on grades 9 and 10 core content areas. PLT leadership training sessions were observed and exit tickets were analyzed for training outcomes. The exit ticket analysis indicated that the intended learning targets and outcomes were achieved. The PLT observations were conducted and determined that cultural shifts were evident in the observations which represented the level of implementation of the PLT leadership training. At the conclusion of the study, evidence collected through exit tickets and observations indicated an improvement in teacher and PLT practices. Additional evidence collected from failure rates and referral rates showed a significant decline in referral rates that were at least partially attributed to the leadership training and an alignment of students pass rates with attendance rates.

AB  - Extensive histories of complex developmental trauma and insecure attachment are widespread among people given a diagnosis of personality disorder in forensic settings, and are likely to be important predisposing factors that contribute to their offending behavior. In working with this population, it is important to bear this in mind, and helpful to formulate clients' challenging behaviors as a set of learned responses to perceived threat, or as survival strategies. Such an approach not only makes the interviewing process more effective, it also helps to avoid perpetuating destructive patterns of behavior and relationship between forensic clients and people in authority. We present seven principles for effective interviewing with this population: (a) careful preparation; (b) a constant focus on the therapeutic relationship; (c) providing structure and containment; (d) adopting a flexible approach; (e) managing therapy-interfering behaviors; (f) obtaining supervision; and (g) adopting a whole-team approach.

AB  - Comments on an article by Bonovitz (see record [rid]2015-06718-003[/rid]) regarding treatment of a child patient struggling with affect regulation, loss, and his adoption through a detailed process account of the treatment with a focus on the therapist’s inner dialogue. In a wonderfully rich paper entitled 'A Child Therapist at Work: Playing, Talking, and the Therapist’s Inner Dialogue,' Dr. Christopher Bonovitz discusses his treatment of an 8-year-old boy who was adopted at birth. Born 6 weeks prematurely, Jason spent 2 weeks in intensive care and resided in an incubator for 2 months. In the spirit of Comparative-Integrative Psychoanalysis (Willock, 2007), Dr. Willock draws on concepts from diverse psychoanalytic perspectives to discuss this case. He emphasizes contributions of the British Object Relations school, especially those Ogden (1989) utilized to formulate his neo-Kleinian concept, the autistic-contiguous position. Dr. Willock underscores the significance of prenatal life for the autistic-contiguous position. He highlights challenges to the sensory foundations of the bounded/grounded self/world experience presented by birth, particularly when there is problematic prematurity.

AB  - Speech language programs aim to prevent and correct disorders of language, speech, voice and fluency. Speech problems in children can adversely affect emotional, educational and occupational development. In the past several years, a particular health region in Saskatchewan, Canada has experienced an increase in the number of preschool children referred for speech language therapy. Indeed, current wait times from referral to first appointment are well in excess of one year and one-tenth of patients do not receive any service before entering school. In an effort to demonstrate successful operational research (OR) practice through improving patient flow, we developed a discrete-event simulation model to test change ideas proposed by speech language therapists. These change ideas involved increasing the percentage of group treatments (rather than having a majority of patients treated individually), using a paraprofessional to complete many of the routine tasks currently covered by the therapists, standardizing appointment durations, hiring additional therapists and incorporating block treatment scheduling. We also tested combinations of the above strategies in order to determine the impact of simultaneously adopting different change ideas. Some strategies showed considerable promise for improving patient flow and are now being used in actual practice. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Psychiatric nursing practice is rooted in the healing power of the interpersonal nurse-patient relationship, as described by Hildegard Peplau, an early leader in the development of modern psychiatric nursing. Peplau's theoretical model of the nurse-patient relationship emphasized mutuality as an essential process for an effective nurse-patient working relationship to foster growth in constructive coping responses toward the goal of recovery. More recently, the concept of mutuality has been reframed and extended in the concept of shared decision making (SDM). SDM is a process for achieving high-level mutuality in health care interactions that involve decision making about therapeutic options. At a broader policy level, SDM represents a proposal for health care quality reform that envisions patients as consumers who take a more active role in their own care and carries an expectation that clinicians will support interactions and decision making characterized by a high level of mutuality. But SDM is not without controversy, especially in mental health care. Not all health care decision-making situations should necessarily rely on implementing all aspects of a fully shared decision-making process. People who experience serious mental health problems over a lengthy period of time may often need training in becoming more empowered participants in their own recovery. The key question is, Which aspects of SDM are most appropriate for different circumstances? While nurses largely agree that being patient centered is appropriate, nurses and other health care providers often differ in their assumptions about what should be the optimal model of the therapeutic relationship for work with their particular patients and patient populations.

AB  - Responds to the comments made by Brett R. Stacey and Jeffrey L. Moller (see record [rid]2013-35537-011[/rid]) on the current authors' original article (see record [rid]2012-33737-001[/rid]). In the original article, Wilsey et al. report a clinical significant outcome regarding the use of cannabis to treat neuropathic pain. In their commentary, Stacey & Moller assert this conclusion is not borne out by careful examination of the study and contrasting it with other available treatments. Stacey & Moller further maintain the burden on researchers to publish valid conclusions is high and was not met in this study. Here, Wilsey et al. address the concerns of Stacey & Moller, agreeing that it is important to move beyond emotional-based discussions and to foster careful and rigorous studies regarding the potential benefits, and costs, associated with cannabis/cannabinoids as a possible treatment for patients with pain that is not resolved using current treatments. Wilsey et al. note that they believe that their carefully designed and controlled study adds important new, and valid, data regarding the short-term effects of cannabis on treatment-resistant neuropathic pain, and that larger and longer-term studies are needed.

AB  - Background: Little is known about characteristics of organizations that predict early adoption of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for persons with HIV infection. Objectives: To describe characteristics of sites where HIV care is provided and to assess site characteristics that predict early adoption of HAART. Design: Cross-sectional analysis of survey data from patients, HIV physicians, and medical directors. Patients and Setting: Participants in the HIV Cost and Services Utilization Study, a national probability sample of persons with HIV who received outpatient care in the continental United States during 1996. Main Outcome Measure: Rates of exposure to HAART by December 1996. Results: Nationally, 79% of patients were treated at sites specializing in HIV care (HIV sites). Over 90% of patients were cared for by physicians who were experts in HIV care, either infectious disease specialists (46%) or general medicine experts (45%). Adjusted rates of exposure to HAART by December 1996 varied from 0.02 to 0.79 across sites (mean rate, 0.33). In multivariable models, HIV specialization (odds ratio {[}OR], 3.6; P < 0.001), total patient volume of more than 20,000 visits a year (OR, 2.1; P < 0.01), and educational level of the zip code in which the site was located (OR, 1.2 for each 10% increase in college education) were associated with higher rates of exposure to HAART. These effects persisted after adjustment physician HIV expertise. Site effects were more important than physician effects in explaining rates of exposure to HAART. Conclusion: In 1996 there were wide variations in rates of HAART use by site of care. Low-volume sites that do not specialize in HIV care should take measures to ensure that HIV expertise is available to their patients.

AB  - American Organizations bringing assistance to deaf people in developing countries unintentionally create relationships of dependency or oppression rather than relationships of support. Using qualitative methods, the author examined the effectiveness of development assistance provided to the Jamaican Deaf community by two American churches, one American nongovernmental organization, and one U.S. federal agency. Documents were reviewed and observations were made. Interviews were conducted with more than 60 deaf and hearing people involved with the American organizations, the Jamaican organizations, and deaf Jamaican beneficiaries. The author concludes that the Jamaican Deaf community was often excluded in planning, designing, or evaluating programs, and was unsatisfied with the American assistance it received. Results also indicate that the American organizations were poorly prepared to work with the Deaf community. Suggestions for American organizations wishing to strengthen and empower deaf people through development assistance in developing countries are proposed. (Contains 2 tables.)

AB  - Self-care is seen as a key element in managing resource demand in chronic disease and is also perceived as an empowering right for patients. The Chronic Disease Self-Management Programme developed in the USA has been adopted in a number of countries and in the UK has been as adapted as the Expert Patients Programme. However, despite its potential as a lay-led empowering initiative, the Expert Patients Programme has been criticised as perpetuating the medical model and failing to reach those in most need. This paper revisits a critique of the Expert Patients Programme, and drawing upon a qualitative study seeks to explore whether the Expert Patients Programme enables empowerment or replicates traditional patterns of the patient-professional relationship. A grounded-theory approach was adopted utilising focus groups, in-depth interviews and participant observation. Data were analysed through the constant comparative method and the development of codes and categories. Conducted in the relatively affluent area of the south-east of England, this paper draws on data from 66 individuals with a chronic illness who were knowledgeable, active and informed. The study revealed a number of characteristics common to expert patients that were linked to a systematic, proactive and organised approach to self-management, a clear communication style and the ability to compartmentalise emotion. The study included participant observation of an Expert Patients Programme and a professional-led self-management course. The paradoxical nature of the Expert Patients Programme was revealed, for whilst there was evidence that it reinforced the medical paradigm, there was a concurrent acknowledgement and support for the subjective experience of living with a long-term condition. Furthermore, whilst the policy emphasis has been on individual empowerment within the Expert Patients Programme, there is some evidence that it may be triggering a health consumer movement. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Chronic disease can be devastating to the patient, family, and nurses who care for them. Patients and family members struggle with the debilitating effects and uncertainties that abound in living with a chronic disease, such as heart failure. The nurse has a unique opportunity to foster a therapeutic relationship through the use of nursing presence. The phenomenon of nursing presence has been defined in the literature by six features: uniqueness, connecting with the patient's experience, sensing, going beyond the scientific data, knowing (what will work and when to act), and being with the patient. Nursing presence, when exhibited, may facilitate healing, promote comfort, and improve patient satisfaction. The story in the article depicts how one professional nurse in a heart failure clinic exemplified the nurse as a healing presence. Through his example, nurses may better understand the significance that their presence may have when caring for patients diagnosed with a chronic illness.

AB  - Three out of 10 women and 1 out of 10 men in the United States experience violence at the hands of an intimate partner-often with devastating costs. In response, hundreds of residential and community-based organizations have sprung up to support survivors. Over the last decade, many of these organizations have joined other human service systems in adopting trauma-informed care (TIC), an approach to working with survivors that responds directly to the effects of trauma. Although there have been various efforts to describe TIC in domestic violence (DV) programs, there is a need to further synthesize this discourse on trauma-informed approaches to better understand specific applications and practices for DV programs. This study aimed to address this gap. The authors of this study systematically identified key documents that describe trauma-informed approaches in DV services and then conducted a qualitative content analysis to identify core themes. Results yielded 6 principles (Establishing emotional safety, Restoring choice and control, Facilitating connection, Supporting coping, Responding to identity and context, and Building strengths), each of which comprised a set of concrete practices. Despite the common themes articulated across descriptions of DV-specific trauma-informed practices (TIP), we also found critical differences, with some publications focusing narrowly on individual healing and others emphasizing the broader community and social contexts of violence and oppression. Implications for future research and evaluation are discussed.

AB  - Successful collaboration among speech and language therapists (SLTs) and teachers fosters the creation of communication friendly classrooms that maximize children’s spoken and written language learning. However, these groups of professionals may have insufficient opportunity in their professional study to develop the shared knowledge, perceptions and attitudes required for effective collaboration. This study examined the knowledge and perceptions of student teachers and student SLTs in the areas of language concepts, junior school literacy curriculum, service delivery and professional collaboration. An online survey was completed by 58 student primary school teachers and 37 student SLTs in their final year of professional study. The results indicated that these groups possessed limited understanding of each other’s expertise in literacy curriculum and spoken language concepts. Both groups demonstrated minimal knowledge of spoken–written language relationships and how SLTs can assist to develop children’s orthographic knowledge. Participants demonstrated acceptance of indirect methods of classroom-based service delivery (e.g. SLT acting as a consultant) but were less accepting of direct methods of classroom-based service delivery (e.g. shared teaching). Both groups also reported minimal experience with SLT–teacher collaboration during their pre-service education. The data suggest pre-service inter-professional education (IPE) with a focus on children’s early literacy learning is warranted to prepare prospective SLTs and teachers for collaborative instruction that enhances children’s communication.

AB  - Background General practitioners (GPs) are uniquely placed to help adolescents take control of managing their chronic illness, and provide continuity of care during the transition to adulthood. This is dependent on a well-established therapeutic relationship with a young person and their family. Objectives The aim of this article is to address the preferences of young people with a chronic illness in dealing with doctors. It also covers ways in which GPs might frame chronic illness management to young patients and their families to optimise care. Discussion Young people want their doctors to be honest, trustworthy and friendly. Plain language explanations of confidentiality, the patient's illness, management and transition are likely to foster a good therapeutic relationship. Attention should be paid to the difficult balance between managing an illness and enjoying life.

AB  - Adolescent mothers deal with challenges that impact family dynamics as well as their mental and physical health. This pilot study is the first to investigate a connection between depressive symptoms, measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (Radloff, 1977), health issues, and relational ethics, the landmark of contextual therapy theory (Boszormenyi-Nagy, & Krasner, 1986), measured by the Relational Ethics Scale (Hargrave, Jennings & Anderson, 1991) among adolescent mothers in foster care. Forty-two adolescent mothers, living in kinship (n = 22) and non-kinship (n = 20) families and receiving services at Chicks in Crisis, the agency that provides young parents with immediate resources such as counseling, parenting classes, food, transportation, and diapers, participated in the study. An independent samples t-test confirmed the hypothesis that the adolescent mothers who reside in kinship care perceived significantly higher levels of relational ethics in their families than adolescent mothers who reside in non-kinship placement. The results of a hierarchical multiple regression analysis revealed that relational ethics was a significant predictor of depression and health problems among adolescent mothers. The family relational ethics scores accounted for 52% of the variance in depression scores and 7% of the variance in health problems scores. Foster care placement was also a significant predictor of depression but not a significant predictor of health problems. Foster care placement accounted for 27% of the variance in depression scores. The study findings support the contextual therapy theory postulations of the importance of kinship connections as a relational resource for children in foster care. The relational ethics that includes trustworthiness, fairness and loyalty in family, is found to be predictive of mental and physical wellbeing of adolescent mothers in the foster care system.

AB  - Abstract The overarching purpose of this study was to explore how summer camp may fit into the learning landscape of young people's lives. We identify areas distinctly learned at camp and transferable to other contexts, ways that learning may happen, and how summer camp may compare to other learning contexts. We conducted structured interviews with former camp attendees and coded transcripts for salient themes. Interviewees reported learning interpersonal skills (e.g., relationship skills), intrapersonal skills (e.g., confidence), identity development (e.g., self-identity), and technical skills (e.g., sport and leisure skills). The program elements that supported this learning fell into the areas of the programming (e.g., experiential learning), people (e.g., counselors), and setting (e.g., safe/supportive environment). Camp fit into the learning landscape for these interviewees by being complementary to school and a social respite from school. These data suggest that youths' social emotional learning may be accelerated at camp and camp may serve as a "north star" for young people to use as a reference point in their life.

AB  - Partnering With Parents, an infant mental health (IMH) intervention program at Starfish Family Services (SFS), is dedicated to improving social--emotional outcomes, supporting wellness, and strengthening relationships between infants and families. Families served by SFS experience a myriad of societal, community, and relational stressors that can impact the caregiver's capacity to meet a child's developmental needs and the IMH home visitor's capacity to support growth. The authors share vignettes* to elucidate the daily challenges that arise when implementing relationship-based work within systemic barriers, safety concerns, and interpersonal challenges. Their reflective supervisor also reflects on how to best support her team as they work together to consider and strengthen all relationships involved in IMH intervention.

AB  - <bold>Background: </bold>Clinicians often modify evidence-based psychotherapies (EBPs) when delivering them in routine care settings. There has been little study of factors associated with or implications of modifications to EBP protocols. This paper differentiates between fidelity-consistent and fidelity-inconsistent modifications and it examines the potential influence of two clinician characteristics, training outcomes, and attitudes toward EBPs on fidelity-consistent and fidelity-inconsistent modifications of cognitive behavioral therapy in a sample of clinicians who had been trained to deliver these treatments for children or adults.<bold>Methods: </bold>Survey and coded interview data collected 2 years after completion of training programs in cognitive behavioral therapy were used to examine associations between successful or unsuccessful completion of training, clinician attitudes, and modifications. Modifications endorsed by clinicians were categorized as fidelity-consistent or fidelity-inconsistent and entered as outcomes into separate regression models, with training success and attitudes entered as independent variables.<bold>Results: </bold>Successful completion of a training program was associated with subsequent fidelity-inconsistent modifications but not fidelity-consistent modifications. Therapists who reported greater openness to using EBPs prior to training reported more fidelity-consistent modifications at follow-up, and those who reported greater willingness to adopt EBPs if they found them appealing were more likely to make fidelity-inconsistent modifications.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Implications of these findings for training, implementation, EBP sustainment, and future studies are discussed. Research on contextual and protocol-related factors that may impact decisions to modify EBPs will be an important future direction of study to complement to this research.

AB  - The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore adoptive mothers’ perceptions of attachment therapy and its impact on family functioning. Sixteen mothers were interviewed 3 years after therapy. Analysis of the data revealed two sets of parental perceptions: first, attachment therapy was consistently supportive, emotionally painful, and physically safe; second, therapy preserved family structure, mothers remained committed to their children, and parenting was continuously stressful. This study highlights the need for further research on the treatment of children with attachment disorders and is not intended as a treatise on the efficacy of attachment therapy as a treatment modality.

AB  - Background/Objective: The present research investigated potential effects of mindfulness training on emotion regulation and mood of future schoolteachers in a nonrandomized pre–post design, and whether these are influenced by the yoga component of mindfulness‐based stress reduction (MBSR) and/or by homework practice. Method: N = 169 university students received either mindfulness training (experimental groups), awareness activities (active control group), or no training (passive control group), in the context of university seminars. Allocation to groups was bound by the seminar chosen by participants, and in that sense was self‐selected. Mindfulness was trained in two adapted MBSR courses, one of which including yoga, and the other excluding yoga. Results: Specific benefits of both mindfulness training groups were observed for emotion regulation in terms of an increase in cognitive reappraisal and a reduction in symptom‐focused rumination as well as depressive mood. No benefits of mindfulness training were observed for reductions in expressive suppression, self‐focused rumination, anxious, and negative mood or an increase in distraction and positive mood respectively. Mindfulness training with and without yoga was mostly equally effective. Outcomes were largely not moderated by practice quantity or quality, but reductions in depressive mood were mediated by gains in reappraisal and distraction. Conclusions: Mindfulness training can be implemented in the context of university seminars to foster advantageous emotion regulation strategies and lower depressive mood in future schoolteachers. Discontinuing yoga within mindfulness interventions does not seem to reduce training benefits.

AB  - This paper is a tribute to Dr. R.A. Ring upon his retirement. During the past 12 years (1993-2005), an emerging canopy research program has established a wealth of baseline information on the structure and functioning of temperate rain forest canopy arthropod communities. Studies from research sites on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, have shown that ancient temperate rain forest canopy ecosystems contain a largely undescribed fauna that is specific to habitat features found only in these canopies. In particular, diverse assemblages of free-living mites have been shown to dominate conifer species and canopy microhabitats. For example, oribatid mites are the dominant arthropod fauna on branches, branches with attached lichens, and suspended soil accumulations. Species composition differs significantly between the ground and the canopy at both the family and the species level. Arboreal specificity may be due to intrinsic variation in habitat quality, habitat architecture, patchiness, and (or) resource availability. The prevalent patterns of habitat specialization, low vagility, and restricted distribution displayed by a large percentage of the resident canopy microarthropods are features often associated with forest ecoregions that have enjoyed relatively stable conditions for long periods of time, as have the ancient forests on Vancouver Island. Investigators in the ``one-Ring lab{''} continue to document the diversity and abundance of canopy arthropods of temperate forests in British Columbia. In particular, studies are concerned with defining the organizing principles that elicit community patterns associated with the various levels of complexity in arboreal communities. Our long-term goal is to provide a greater degree of predictability when addressing temperate forest diversity issues. To meet the stated goals of sustainable forest management and retention of biodiversity, an extensive plan of ecological research that features arthropods is needed. This plan, fostered by Dr. Ring, should have as a priority the inventory and cataloguing of species assemblages and should address dynamic processes such as organismal dispersal and the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on arthropods in ancient forests.

AB  - The current article discusses, severe childhood obesity has become a serious health-care problem worldwide. When parental behaviors not only lead to obesity developing but subsequently interfere with its recognition and treatment, the label of 'psychosocial obesity of early childhood' has previously been adopted, with a recent commentary calling for increased levels of state intervention to help these children. Anecdotal reports indicate removal from the familial obesogenic environment can successfully reduce the body mass index (BMI) of an obese child, and because of the associated ethical dilemmas, it is unlikely that evidence will ever be gathered in any way other than via case reports. Despite an ethical and legal obligation to protect the child, most countries have no specific legal framework or professional intervention criteria for the growing problem of severe childhood obesity. Therefore, decisions need to be based on individualized multidisciplinary case-based discussions carefully weighing the health risks and emotional trauma of a neglectful situation against the psychological trauma of removing the child from their familial environment.

AB  - This article provides a gendered reading of recent strategic thinking on drug use and its control in England and Ireland with a particular focus on gendered representations of vulnerability and their effects. After providing a brief overview of the literature on women, drug use and vulnerability and outlining the analytical approach adopted, the English and Irish strategies are considered in turn. Both strategies, in different ways, construct women – or at least some groups of women – as vulnerable subjects. The English strategy considers women's vulnerability in relation to the presence of risk factors which increase the likelihood of involvement in drug use. The Irish strategy adopts a different understanding of women's vulnerability, highlighting the barriers women face engaging in or sustaining involvement with treatment and rehabilitation services, which are intensified when women have children or become pregnant. By comparing the English and Irish drug strategies, there are two distinct attempts to construct women, or at least some subgroups of women – as vulnerable subjects. In many respects, neither the English nor the Irish approach to addressing women's drug use is satisfactory. Both fail to connect women's dependency of ‘the addiction kind’ with women's dependency of ‘the subordinate kind’ and locate women's use of substances in their socio-political context.

AB  - Adolescence is a phase in the Lifespan characterized by numerous changes in biological, psychological, and social levels of organization, as well as the initiation and expression of behaviors related to substance use and sexual behavior. The intersection among age normative and non-normative events, developmental changes in biopsychosocial systems and substance use and sexual behavior is critical both to understanding adolescent development and to devising prevention programs and social policies that serve to promote positive health and deter immediate and long-term adverse outcomes. National survey data have clearly indicated that adolescents engage in high rates of both substance use and sexual behavior, and that the combination of these behaviors lead to deleterious short and long-term health outcomes. As such, the focus of this chapter is on the intersection of these discrete behaviors among teens, and on recent prevention and treatment efforts aimed at ameliorating their adverse health effects. In pursuing this objective, the chapter is divided into five components. First, descriptive epidemiologic findings are provided on national studies of the intersection between substance use and sexual behaviors during adolescence. Second, the interrelationships among substance use, violence, and sexual behaviors are presented, with specific reference to childhood physical and sexual abuse and subsequent substance use and sexual behavior, and substance use and dating violence/sexual assault. Third, some common theories and proposed mechanisms that account for the interrelations between substance use and sexual behavior are provided. These are not intended to be exhaustive, but rather representative of ways of viewing these relationships and possible explanatory mechanisms. Fourth, selective findings from prevention and intervention studies are presented to provide insight into the ways that substance use is being incorporated into prevention or intervention trials, and how it may be impacting outcomes. Fifth, conclusions and future directions are provided to further illuminate extant knowledge and new pathways to be pursued in future research to foster more impactful interventions and promote healthy adolescent behaviors and outcomes.

AB  - Abstract: Study Objective: This study aims to understand the associations of contraceptive service utilization (ie, accessing condoms or birth control), pregnancy attitudes, and lifetime pregnancy history among male and female homeless youth in relation to use of effective contraception and withdrawal. Design, Setting, and Participants: Between October 2011 and February 2012, homeless youth (14-27 years old) from 2 drop-in centers in Los Angeles (N = 380) were recruited and completed a questionnaire. The data in this paper are restricted to those who reported vaginal sex at last sex (N = 283). Main Outcome Measures: Analyses examined history of foster care, sexual abuse, exchange sex, pregnancy, lifetime homelessness duration, current living situation, contraceptive service utilization, and pregnancy attitudes in predicting use of effective contraception and withdrawal at last sex. Results: Over 62% of females and 43% of males report having ever been pregnant or impregnating someone. There are no gender-based differences in pregnancy attitudes; 21% agree they would like to become pregnant within the year. Additionally, there are no gender-based differences in reported contraceptive use at last vaginal sex. In the multivariable model, high school education, contraceptive service utilization (Relative Risk Ratio [RRR]: 4.0), and anti-pregnancy attitudes (RRR: 1.3) are significant positive predictors of using effective contraception; anti-pregnancy attitudes (RRR: 1.2) and gender (RRR: 0.3) are significantly associated with using withdrawal. Conclusions: Health professionals should acknowledge that some homeless youth desire pregnancy; for those that do not, access to effective contraception is important. Programs must continue to promote pregnancy prevention, and include discussions of healthy pregnancy habits for pregnancy-desiring youth. [Copyright &y& Elsevier]

AB  - Background: Female sex workers (FSWs) are often considered as the vector, if not reservoir, of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Building upon the existing evidence on the role of psychological health in sexual health, the aim of this protocol is to describe a trial investigating the effectiveness of the Personal Resilience and Enrichment Programme (PREP), a resilience-promoting intervention that targets at psychological well-being i.e. self-esteem, self-efficacy and coping, to facilitate adaptation and ultimately safe sexual practices among FSWs, which could be an innovative strategy in controlling the spread of these infections. Methods: A total of 132 FSWs will be recruited and randomly assigned to either the intervention or usual care (control) groups in a multi-centred randomised controlled trial. Based on the resilience framework, this intervention is comprised of six weekly sessions focused on the awareness, expression and management of emotions, identifying roles and personal strengths, and effective problem-solving skills. Complex intervention assessment on both intervention process and effectiveness will be adopted when the primary outcome reduction of sexual risk behaviour and other psychological outcomes include their perceived stress, self-esteem, self-efficacy, coping overall resilience, and psychological distress will be measured at baseline, post-treatment and 3-month post-intervention and differences assessed by ANOVA. The relationship of resilience factors, psychological health and HIV preventive behaviours will be evaluated using structural equation modelling. Discussion: It is anticipated that this study will increase our understanding of the relationships between individual resilience attributes, positive adaptation, psychological health and sexual health practices. If successful, this programme will provide an innovative direction for HIV prevention by applying the personal resilience factors to promote both psychological well-being and safe sex for this high risk population.

AB  - Three issues were highlighted in the 30(th) Presidential Address to the society: (1) A.S.P.E.N.'s unique interdisciplinary structure; (2) support of the A.S.P.E.N. Rhoads Research Foundation; and (3) the meaning of food from the perspective of the patient who is receiving life-sustaining home enteral or parenteral nutrition. A.S.P.E.N., founded as a multidisciplinary society in the 1970s has evolved into an interdisciplinary society with an expanded and diverse membership of health care professionals and scientists with overlapping interests in clinical nutrition and metabolism. A.S.P.E.N. envisions an environment in which every patient receives safe, efficacious, and high quality patient care. The society is committed to advancing the science and practice of nutrition support therapy. In support of this direction, the A.S.P.E.N. Rhoads Research Foundation exists to fund research grants, promote evidence-based practice, and foster training and mentorship in nutrition and metabolic research. The scientific advances and techno-logic innovations that have enabled our profession to provide enteral and parenteral nutrition to patients has caused practitioners to forget that the meaning of food extends beyond nutrient value. Some individuals receiving long term enteral nutrition or home parenteral nutrition have expressed feelings of anger, anxiety, and depression resulting from the inability to eat normally, from losses of independence, and control of body functions. The ritual of eating may be altered when the enteral or intravenous feedings provide nourishment and, for some, the loss of the eating function is a distressing experience, especially given the cultural focus on social gatherings and meals. The emotional meaning attributed to food, and changes in food preferences and eating behaviors, may become a source of conflict for individuals who have substantial dietary restrictions, or for those individuals dependent on enteral or parenteral nutrition therapy. The value of food intake on social patterns, self-esteem, pleasure, and enjoyment, may impact quality of life. While nutrition support can provide the basic need for nutrients, its impact on human needs associated with food requires further investigation.

AB  - Although an epidemic of opioid-related overdose deaths has continued to increase in the United States for 2 decades, the impact of opioid use disorders (OUDs) on children and families receives minimal attention. The purpose of this commentary was to provide an overview of the impact of the opioid epidemic on children and adolescents, as well as to summarize challenges to improving outcomes for children. Children and adolescents who grow up in households with opioid misuse and OUDs may experience a myriad of adverse consequences, including: increased risk of mental health problems and drug use; accidental opioid poisoning; increased risk of developing a substance use disorder; and family dissolution that results from parents' incarceration, foster care placement, or loss of parent to an opioid overdose. Parental drug use may result in child neglect or deficits in parent-child attachment, and parents with an OUD may be less likely to be reunified with their children. OUD treatment is effective at reducing parental opioid use and improving child outcomes; however, stigma and cross-system collaboration may limit access to treatment and timely reunification of families. Children are the most vulnerable witnesses of the opioid epidemic, and further research is urgently needed to expand prevention interventions. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Several recent policies offer parent involvement as a partial solution to narrowing the achievement gap. This particular policy solution is not poised to be effective because most preservice teachers receive little training on parent involvement. Also, preservice teachers typically draw on memories and observations of their parents' involvement habits to inform their views about parent involvement. This is problematic as most preservice teachers come from white, middle class backgrounds and their ideas about parent involvement don't match those of diverse parents. The following question guided this study: How influential are certain aspects of secondary preservice teachers' credential program and biography in shaping their beliefs, perceptions of preparedness and practices for parent involvement in regard to low income, non-English speaking and minority parents? This paper is based on data collected during an 18 month, mixed-methods, longitudinal study. Data was collected via surveys, interviews, and document review. Statistical analyses were used to examine the quantitative data while inductive coding was used for qualitative data. Several interesting results emerged from the study. While a preservice teacher's biography (race, class, their own parents' involvement habits) were influential at the beginning of the credential program, this influence faded over time. Course assignments that required preservice teachers to engage with parents, class texts about diverse parents, and course topics and themes on diverse populations were influential. Preservice teachers were more likely to engage in a parent-teacher partnership activity if their cooperating teachers did the activity. Student teaching at diverse site placements allowed preservice teachers to observe diverse parents' involvement practices. This study concludes that hands-on experiences with parent-teacher partnership activities are most influential in determining which parent-teacher partnership activities a preservice teacher will engage once full-time teaching. These experiences are relevant to diverse parents when they take place in a diverse student teaching site placement.

AB  - Objectives: A mandatory remedial programme for students who repeat their first semester at medical school has resulted in large gains in academic performance and greatly reduced attrition. Here, we explore the students’ views of this in order to clarify understanding of optimal remediation practice. Methods: Using a mixed-methods approach, quantitative and qualitative data were gathered from student surveys (n = 333) and three in-depth focus groups. Results were analysed for emergent themes. Results: Remedial programmes for at-risk medical students should be mandatory, but should respect students’ identity as repeaters. Attitude and motivation are key, and working in stable groups provides essential emotional and cognitive support. The learning environment needs to foster changes in students’ ways of thinking and their development as flexible, reflective learners. These endeavours require support from honest teachers with rigorous expectations and good facilitation skills. Conclusions: Successful remediation needs to challenge students’ conceptions of learning, works best in groups with skilled facilitators, and must take into account a blend of cognitive and affective factors and the complex interplay between learner and environment. Given a carefully designed programme, at-risk medical students can learn to make effective and lasting changes to their approach to study, and their views of learning can come to converge with influential ideas in the education literature.

AB  - Abstract. Complete pool fencing and effective bystander resuscitation are both believed to reduce the risk of childhood drowning. The relationship between support for, and prevalence of, a complete pool barrier and current cardiopulmonary resuscitation certification was investigated among an equal probability sample of 795 owners of residential swimming pools in Sacramento County, California. Only 50% (95% confidence interval [CI] 44%, 56%) of respondents who favored a cardiopulmonary resuscitation certification requirement for pool owners represented a household with any members so certified. Only 35% (95% CI 26%, 44%) of respondents who endorsed a complete barrier requirement for all pools had a fence surrounding their own pool. Support for a cardiopulmonary resuscitation requirement was associated with a modestly higher prevalence of current cardiopulmonary resuscitation certification (46% vs 33%, difference = 13%, 95% CI for difference 2%, 24%). Endorsement of a pool barrier requirement was associated with a substantially higher prevalence of complete pool fencing (35% vs 7%, difference = 28%, 95% CI for difference 19%, 37%). The proportion of the pool-owning population endorsing these risk reduction behaviors is much larger than the proportion actually adopting them. The results suggest that an effective pool drowning-prevention program will rely primarily on legislative approaches, with health education serving as a useful adjunct.

AB  - Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered, questioning, and queer youth (LGBTQ or sexual minority youth) experience elevated risks to their safely, wellbeing, and permanency compared lo heterosexual youth. Current evidence paints a picture of sexual minority youth as being disproportionately overrepresented in the child welfare system and as frequently receiving disparate, inappropriate, and unsafe treatment. In order to adequately provide services to LGBTQ youth in the child welfare system, policy makers, administrators, supervisors, and workers need lo understand not only the higher risks experienced by these youth but also their particular developmental needs and how to deliver and access culturally competent services and supports for them. LGBTQ youth require competent child welfare professionals who understand their particular concerns and can address their needs without either deliberately or inadvertently being discriminatory. Caseworkers need lo be able to make sure that the needs of LGBTQ youth are competently assessed and then find appropriate services and community supports. While child welfare services have not yet achieved cultural competence, model policies and training curricula are readily available to guide the provision of competent services for LGBTQ youth. A sustained commitment by state and local agency leaders is required to make the cultural and practice changes that are needed. The adaptation of existing promising child welfare practices, such as family finding and family group conferencing models, is one way to leverage existing resources to meet the permanency and stability needs of sexual minority youth. The most urgent need is for child welfare agencies to be equipped to recognize and address issues of physical and emotional safety among LGBTQ youth. The next priority is the competent management of issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity in the area of placement and placement stability. The third imperative is to support and facilitate the well-being of these highly vulnerable and often invisible children and youth. Although cultural change is challenging, the combination of growing interest and support for LGBTQ youth and the availability of the tools to help them can lead to improvements in service for sexual minority children and youth coming into contact with the child welfare system.

T1  - Human Dignity as Leading Principle in Public Health Ethics: A Multi-Case Analysis of 21st Century German Health Policy Decisions

AB  - Background: There is ample evidence that since the turn of the millennium German health policy made a considerable step towards prevention and health promotion, putting the strategies of `personal empowerment' and `settings based approach' high on the federal government's agenda. This phenomenon has challenged the role of ethics in health policy. Concurrently, increasing relevance of the Concept of Human Dignity for health and human rights has been discussed. However, a direct relationship between Human Dignity and Public Health Ethics (PHE) has surprisingly not yet been established. Methods: We here conduct a systematic ethical analysis of eminent German health prevention policy case-examples between the years 2000-2016. Specifically, our analysis seeks to adapt and apply the principalism (autonomy, beneficence, justice)-based Concept of Human Dignity of Italian philosopher Corrado Viafora, contextualizing it with the emerging field of PHE. To further inform this health policy analysis, index databases (PubMed, Google Scholar) were searched to include relevant published and grey literature. Results: We observe a systematic approach of post-millennial health policy decisions on prevention and on defined health targets in Germany, exemplified by (1) the fostering of the preparedness against pandemic infectious diseases, (2) the development and implementation of the first cancer vaccination, (3) major legal provisions on non-smokers protection in the public domain, (4) acts to strengthen long term care (LTC) as well as (5) the new German E-Health legislation. The ethical analysis of these health prevention decisions exhibits their profound ongoing impact on social justice, probing their ability to meet the underlying Concept of Human Dignity in order to fulfill the requirements of the principle of non-maleficence. Conclusion: The observed health policy focus on prevention and health promotion has sparked new public debates about the formation of/compliance with emerging standards of PHE in Germany. We believe that the overall impact of this novel policy orientation will gradually show over mid-and long-term periods, both in terms of improvements in health system performance and concurrently in diagnostics, therapies and health outcome on individual patient level. The Concept of Human Dignity may soon play an even greater role in European PHE debates to come.

AB  - This literature review examines the effects of hospitalization on the young child and suggests ways in which parents and hospital personnel can protect children from the potentially harmful emotional and intellectual effects of hospitalization. The history of attitudes toward the hospitalization of children is discussed. Children's emotional reactions to hospitalization (i.e., bewilderment, withdrawal, redefinition of body image) and their success in dealing with the anxieties of the hospital experience are examined in terms of long-term mental health. It is suggested that efforts should be made to provide "mothering-type" care to hospitalized children, but not to the extent that a feeling of dependency is fostered in these children. Hospitalized children's intellectual development is stressed. Methods in which the hospital environment can provide sources for stimulation and exploration are suggested. Hospital administrators, educators, parents, and medical professionals are called on to develop education programs to increase public awareness of the importance of the hospital stay for the young girl.

AB  - Historically, traditional cultures recognized the importance of belief and expectancy within the healing encounter and created complex rituals and ceremonies designed to elicit or foster the expectancy and participation of both the healer and patient, as well as the community as a whole. This holistic approach to health care was a fundamental component in the spiritual healing rituals of virtually all traditional native cultures. The focus of the current study was to assess the impact of healer and patient expectations on mental and physical health parameters following a spiritual healing session. A pre-post methodological design which incorporated extensive psychophysiological health outcome measures along with independent medical diagnoses was utilized. The study was conducted in a northern California suburb of Mann County utilizing an American-born spiritual healer trained in the Philippines. The results indicated that there was a statistically significant difference between the pre-treatment and post-treatment scores for all fourteen dependent variables examined. The data also demonstrated a significant difference between the high versus low expectancy subjects for both patient and healer groups, as well as a significant relationship between high expectancy in patients and healer and the effectiveness of the spiritual healing encounter. The results of the study therefore suggest that high healer and patient expectancy may be important elements which can serve as both predictors as well as facilitators of the healing process. The degree of bonding or communication between the healer and patient was postulated as an important factor in this regard. Due to the fact that a majority of the conditions reported (75%) were organic disorders that would not commonly disappear within the 3 week time frame of the study, the significant results obtained suggest that spiritual healing in combination with traditional allopathic medicine may have the potential to be an effective treatment protocol for severe or long-term disorders. An important contributing feature of this study was that an independent means of assessing the patients' self-reports, i.e. an allopathic medical examination, was included in the experiment. There was a significant correlation between the patient's expectation level and their assessment of improvement, as well as a significant relationship between the patient's assessment of their condition and the objective evaluations provided by independent medical examinations.

Methods: A review is given of studies concerning the influence of psychological factors on the development of infertility. Result: A prevalence of psychogenic infertility of 10-15 per cent must be discussed critically. A value of approximately 5 per cent is more realistic.

A definition of psychogenic infertility according to the German guidelines Psychosomatics in Reproductive Medicine is presented. Spontaneous pregnancies following adoption or the decision to remain childless are the absolute exception. The association of stress and infertility in humans is still unclear. For many women the effect of infertility and notably of medical therapy is a considerable emotional stress. This may make psychosocial counseling necessary in certain cases. Conclusions: An exclusive psychological/psychodynamical point of view on the complexity of infertility is as inadequate as a strictly somatic point of view.

AB  - Supervision and aftercare services should (1) assist in the reintegration of youth after intervention that has removed them from their home community, (2) encourage the development or redevelopment of relations between parents and youth, (3) provide or arrange for services to youth and their families, and (4) arrange for out-of-home placement for youth according to the least restrictive philosophy of the Children's Code. In collecting and transferring information about delinquent youth to ensure delivery of individualized services, the Department of Health and Social Services should recommend that all county agencies use the standardized format and content for all court reports recommended in this report as well as the recommended format and content for the form committing youth to Department custody. Other recommendations focus upon criteria that ensure effective and efficient supervision and aftercare services, options as to which agencies should provide supervision services and aftercare services, and the role of the Department when counties provide aftercare services. The addendum provides a list of the standards for the program or system components developed by the Supervision and Aftercare Services Committee.

AB  - This article describes one school's response to the inclusion and education of refugee and asylum seeker students within a mainstream educational setting. Australian government statistics released on 31 March 2016 stated that there were presently 50 children being held on Nauru, 17 children held in detention on the mainland and 317 children held in community detention on the mainland (ChilOut, 2016). Refugee and asylum seeking students are subject to the impact of war and conflict; the cumulative time spent in detention may severely limit a young person's access to formal education. Whilst it is understood that children will benefit from access to education, the reality is that "little appears to have been written on asylum seekers" in an educational context (Reakes, 2007, p. 94). This represents a concern when it is acknowledged that "sustaining teachers in culturally and linguistically diverse schools has been a prominent issue for years" (Williams, Edwards, Kuhel, & Lim, 2016, p. 17). This article responds to the limitations of current literature by articulating considerations that would likely assist other schools seeking to establish similar inclusive frameworks. Specifically, the thematic grouping of staff observations seek to articulate the cultural considerations that likely influence the sustainability of an inclusive and liberating approach to integrative school enrolment. This paper draws on the authors' observations and experiences in schools, the published literature and the observations of the two authors--specifically, drawing on their educational and therapeutic expertise. These observations are then grouped into themes outlined by Akinsulure-Smith and O'Hara (2012) as key reasons for therapeutic referral, namely: employment barriers, medical challenges, language barriers, social services and legal challenges.

AB  - Background: Low-dose CT scan screening greatly improves the likelihood of detecting small nodules and, thus, of detecting lung cancer at a potentially more curable stage. Methods: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a single baseline low-dose CT scan for lung cancer screening in high-risk individuals, data from the Early Lung Cancer Action Project (ELCAP) was incorporated into a decision analysis model comparing low-dose CT scan screening of high-risk individuals (ie, those 60 years with at least 10 pack-years of cigarette smoking and no other malignancies) to observation without screening. Cost-effectiveness was expressed as the incremental cost per year of life saved. The analysis adopted the perspectives of the health-care system. The probability of the different outcomes following the decision either to screen or not to screen an individual at risk was based on data from ELCAP and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Registry or published data, respectively. The cost of the screening and treatment of patients with lung cancer was established based on data from the New York Presbyterian Hospital's financial system. The base-case analysis was conducted under the assumption of similar aggressiveness of screen-detected and incidentally discovered lung cancers and then was followed by multiple sensitivity analyses to relax these assumptions. Results: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of a single baseline low-dose CT scan was $2,500 per year of life saved. The base-case analysis showed that screening would be expected to increase survival by 0.1 year at an incremental cost of approximately $230. Only when the likelihood of overdiagnosis was > 50% did the cost effectiveness ratio exceed $50,000 per year of life saved. The cost-effectiveness ratios were also relatively insensitive to estimates of the potential lead-time bias. Conclusions: A baseline low-dose CT scan for lung cancer screening is potentially highly cost-effective and compares favorably to the cost-effectiveness ratios of other screening programs.

AB  - BackgroundEvidence for the health benefits of a physically active lifestyle among older adults is strong, yet only a small proportion of older people meet physical activity recommendations. A synthesis of evidence identified “best bet” approaches, and this study sought guidance from end-user representatives and stakeholders to refine one of these, a peer-volunteering active aging intervention.MethodsFocus groups with 28 older adults and four professional volunteer managers were conducted. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 9 older volunteers. Framework analysis was used to gauge participants’ views on the ACE intervention.ResultsMotives for engaging in community groups and activities were almost entirely social. Barriers to participation were lack of someone to attend with, lack of confidence, fear of exclusion or “cliquiness” in established groups, bad weather, transport issues, inaccessibility of activities, ambivalence, and older adults being “set in their ways”. Motives for volunteering included “something to do,” avoiding loneliness, the need to feel needed, enjoyment, and altruism. Challenges included negative events between volunteer and recipient of volunteering support, childcare commitments, and high volunteering workload.ConclusionPeer-volunteering approaches have great potential for promotion of active aging. The systematic multistakeholder approach adopted in this study led to important refinements of the original ACE intervention. The findings provide guidance for active aging community initiatives highlighting the importance of effective recruitment strategies and of tackling major barriers including lack of motivation, confidence, and readiness to change; transport issues; security concerns and cost; activity availability; and lack of social support.

AB  - We discuss in this chapter the personal characteristics of mothers which contributed to their classification into IFD (interaction fostering differentiation) and IID (interaction inhibiting differentiation) groups. Some impressions obtained from a review of the interview records after this classification had been made also are considered. These characteristics were evaluated in the context of the family and social situations outside the family. Predominance of complaints about their husbands and children suggested a lack of self-realization. Inability to cope with problems of everyday living and failure to define their roles as mothers suggested a lack of self-assurance and self-realization. Mothers who felt deprived and neglected in social relations were judged to show a lack of self-realization. However, a review of the interview records after the child's mode of perception was known suggested that some mothers judged as IID obtained status and satisfaction from outside relations. The predominance of approving attitudes toward their children, relations with husbands which were not regarded as depriving, a capacity to define their own roles as mothers, and the absence of exaggerated self-blame when mistakes were made, contributed to judgments of mothers as self-assured and as having a sense of self-realization. Self-realization in social relationships outside the home which contributed to an evaluation of mothers as IFD included a variety of social interactions. Characteristics of mothers were also evaluated by using the interview as a social situation in which a mother's impact on the interviewer was considered. Interviewer reactions of pity, solicitude, constraint toward the mother, and the assumption of a role of 'professional therapist' or counselor contributed to judgments of IID. In contrast, reactions of being stimulated or refreshed or the assumption of a 'woman-to-woman role' contributed to judgments of IFD. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - There is a surprising lack of research into the experiences of unmarried fathers whose children were lost to adoption in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. Between the first adoption act in 1926 and the present day, 97,070 adoptions have taken place. Very little is known about the nearly a million fathers who have been involved. A greater understanding of the unmarried father would help agencies involved in adoption to provide better services, not only to the original parents in the adoption process, but would also add to the knowledge of the child's heritage. This study aims to uncover areas of this little known element in society. The information gained from this research is set in the context of the social conditions of the years between 1926, and the present. The study consists of self-selected contributors and as such does not claim to be representative of all fathers who lost their children to adoption at that time. The narratives of the respondents have been analysed with reference to the sociological and psychoanalytic literature on illegitimacy published in those years, as well as policy and legal documents and current publications. The data contained in this study report the experiences and reflect the emotions of the original fathers concerning the discovery of their partner's pregnancy, the process of the child's adoption, the reported effects of their experiences on the men's subsequent lives, their searching for their adult adopted children and in some cases their contact or reunion with them. The thesis discusses the stereotyping and stigmatisation that contributed to the treatment of the biological fathers, and resulted in their feelings of impotence and diminished self respect.

AB  - Reviews cognitive and behavioral methods in the psychotherapy for treating child molesters (CMs). Initially, motivation is enhanced by adopting variants of the stage model of readiness for personal change (J. O. Prochaska & C. C. DiClemente, 1982). Sexual reconditioning exercises moderate deviant sexual arousal using aversive conditioning methods in which CMs are taught to control future deviant urges. Intimacy deficits and fearful-avoidant attachment style in CMs are resolved through assertiveness, social skills, and conflict resolution training. Empathy exercises, anger management, self-esteem enhancement, and development of an external perspective reduce cognitive distortions of CMs. Relapse prevention increases the ability to cope with negative affect and live a productive, less deviant life. It is concluded that patient-treatment matching should help determine which treatment method works best with which offenders. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective. This study explores the decision-making process, including motivating factors, for small and midsized businesses in the Midwest to implement health promotion initiatives. Method. This a replication of a study conducted in the Pacific Northwest. Semistructured qualitative interviews were conducted with key informants from 12 Midwestern metropolitan employers with fewer than 1,000 employees. Informants were interviewed regarding their companies’ policies and practices around workplace health promotion programming adoption and valuation. Results. Workplace health promotion adoption at these small and midsized businesses was motivated by three goals: to lower health care costs, to address human relations objectives, and to improve productivity. Low upfront cost was the most frequently considered criterion in choosing which workplace health promotion program to offer. Barriers to implementation included lack of employee buy-in, prohibitive costs, and personnel or time constraints. Aids to implementation included employee buy-in and affordability. Conclusions. This study suggests that cost considerations predominate in the workplace health promotion decision-making process at small to midsized businesses. Furthermore, employee buy-in cannot be underestimated as a factor in successful program implementation or longevity. Employees, along with executives and human resources management, must be appropriately targeted by health promotion practitioners in workplace health promotion efforts.

AB  - Children with social-behavioral problems are at high risk for developing long-term, pervasive adjustment problems. Home-school relationships may be critical to alleviating the negative effects of behavior problems and to fostering student success. The environment or community in which homes and schools are situated represents an important influence on the home-school relationship. Despite the evidence supporting positive parent-teacher relationships and the association between community context and educational practices and student outcomes, little is known about the relation between community context and parent-teacher relationships. The manner in which cumulative risk factors and child behavior problems influence the link between community type and parent-teacher relationships also remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to examine whether there were differences between parent--teacher relationships across different community types (i.e., rural, town, city) for students who display disruptive behaviors. Furthermore, this study investigated whether differences in the association between parent-teacher relationships and community type were influenced by the presence of cumulative risk factors and severity of child behavior problems. Results indicated there was a significant overall effect of community type on teacher-reported parent-teacher relationships (p<.0003). Specifically, teacher--reported parent-teacher relationship scores were significantly higher for city teachers relative to those in towns and rural schools. However, town and rural teacher scores did not significantly differ from one another. There was no significant overall effect of community type on parent-reported parent--teacher relationships. The relationship between community type and parent--teacher relationships was not significantly influenced by cumulative risk or behavior severity for this sample. The results of this study advance the parent--teacher partnership research literature by specifically uncovering a significant link between community type and parent--teacher relationships, an area that has not been previously explored. Behavioral interventions that incorporate relevant contextual information may be most effective in addressing student behavioral concerns leading to improved outcomes for students.

AB  - Background: Medicare recently approved coverage of home telemonitoring for early detection of incident choroidal neovascularization (CNV) among patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), but no economic evaluation has yet assessed its cost-effectiveness and budgetary impact.Objectives: To evaluate a home-based daily visual-field monitoring system using simulation methods and to apply the findings of the Home Monitoring of the Eye study to the US population at high risk for wet-form AMD.Design, Setting, and Participants: In this economic analysis, an evaluation of the potential cost, cost-effectiveness, and government budgetary impact of adoption of a home-based daily visual-field monitoring system among eligible Medicare patients was performed. Effectiveness and visual outcomes data from the Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 Home Monitoring of the Eye study, treatment data from the Wills Eye Hospital Treat & Extend study, and AMD progression data from the Age-Related Eye Disease Study 1 were used to simulate the long-term effects of telemonitoring patients with CNV in one eye or large drusen and/or pigment abnormalities in both eyes. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analysis and an alternative scenario using the Treat & Extend study control group outcomes were used to examine uncertainty in these data and assumptions.Interventions: Home telemonitoring of patients with AMD for early detection of CNV vs usual care.Main Outcomes and Measures: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, net present value of lifetime societal costs, and 10-year nominal government expenditures.Result: Telemonitoring of patients with existing unilateral CNV or multiple bilateral risk factors for CNV (large drusen and retinal pigment abnormalities) incurs $907 (95% CI, -$6302 to $2809) in net lifetime societal costs, costs $1312 (95% CI, $222-$2848) per patient during 10 years from the federal government's perspective, and results in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $35 663 (95% CI, cost savings to $235 613) per quality-adjusted life-year gained.Conclusions and Relevance: Home telemonitoring of patients with AMD who are at risk for CNV was cost-effective compared with scheduled examinations alone. Monitoring patients with existing CNV in one eye is cost saving, but monitoring is generally not cost-effective among patients with low risk of CNV, including those with no or few risk factors. With Medicare coverage, monitoring incurs budgetary expenditures for the government but is cost-saving for patients at high risk of AMD. Monitoring could be cost saving to society if monitoring reduced the frequency of scheduled examinations or led to a reduction of one or more injections of ranibizumab.

AB  - Animal husbandry and management practices were surveyed in commercial feedlots to document compliance of select feedlots with Beef Quality Assurance (BQA) guidelines for cattle handling under the premise that this data warrants inclusion in the National Beef Quality Audit (NBQA). The BQA Feedyard Assessment for cattle handling has not yet been fully validated, and this work partially substantiates the current assessment categories. The inclusion of this handling data is essential in order to continue the track record of identifying target areas where improvement is needed, and to document growth and positive performance. Collecting and reporting of survey data is part of the verification and ongoing monitoring process that characterizes an effective HACCP plan, which was the system for management that was adopted during formation of the BQA program. BQA is a voluntary program that allows the use of self-assessment or third party audits to ensure compliance with the guidelines of the program. The BQA Feedyard Assessment (FA) provides guidelines for cattle handling in commercial feedlots, and is a useful tool for measuring cattle handling practices. Using these guidelines, select feedlots in 3 states (Colorado, Kansas, and Nebraska) were assessed for six current BQA categories (electric prod use, falls, stumbles, jump and run, and chute operation). These states rank 5th, 3rd, and 2nd, respectively, among all states for the number of cattle on feed each year. These three states were selected based on their ranking among the top five states for number of cattle on feed, and for the high density areas of large (1000+ head) feedyards in each state, accounting for approximately 50% of all US fed cattle each year. The feedyards included in this study were all large (1000+ head capacity) yards, with a mean capacity of 34,000 head. Across 28 sites surveyed, rate of electric prod use was 3.8% vs. the 10% current BQA critical limit (CL); only 2 sites surveyed exceeded the CL with 15% and 45% respective rates; and 12 did not use an electric prod. The rate of cattle falling when exiting the squeeze chute was 0.6% vs. BQA CL 2%, and no site surveyed exceeded the CL. The rate of cattle stumbling when exiting the squeeze chute was 5.7% vs. BQA CL 10%, with 4 sites exceeding the CL and 4 sites that had no stumbles. The rate of cattle vocalizing was 1.4% vs. BQA CL 5%; for cattle that jumped or ran when exiting the squeeze chute, 52% vs. BQA CL 25%; and mean score for cattle that were improperly captured in the squeeze chute and not readjusted was 1.2%, vs. BQA CL 0%. A second study was conducted at a commercial feedlot in Kansas. The objective of this study was to investigate if a relationship exists between handling, and behavior and ADG of feedlot cattle. Upon arrival, Hereford steers (n = 496; initial BW = 304 +/- 35.6 kg) of similar genetic background were sorted into four pens to determine the effects of handling on behavior and ADG. Two handling conditions prior to processing and two conditions of release from the squeeze chute were imposed. Prior to processing, handlers were required to quietly walk all steers from their home pen to the processing area (SLOW); or handlers were permitted to bring steers to the processing area in the normal fashion (FAST). Since this condition was applied to pens, pen was considered the experimental unit for the full model. Individual steers were randomly assigned to one of two conditions of release from the squeeze chute. The first was a delay no longer than 30 seconds following the completion of procedures to allow cattle to stop struggling (DELAY); the second was release immediately following the completion of procedures (NORM). Vocalization, chute temperament, exit speed and exit behavior scores were assigned to all steers during intake processing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The growing trend among married couples who decide not to have children has sparked the attention of researchers toward the childfree within a number of domains, such as demographics, perceptions, and psychological well-being of this population. Perceived factors involved in marital longevity and satisfaction, however, have often been conducted with couples who have children. Clinicians working with the childfree population cannot assume that the factors perceived to contribute to marital success in couples with children are the same for childfree couples, yet given the gaps in research, clinicians are forced to reference research that has primarily been conducted with parent participants as a benchmark for understanding marital success. The purpose of the current dissertation study is to gain a clear understanding of how childfree couples create long-term, satisfying marriages, to discern whether these couples nurture factors that are more unique due to different experiences and/or values, as well as to offer clinicians useful clinical interventions to incorporate in their work with this population if childfree couples present for marital counseling. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight childfree couples who chose not to have children and who self-identified as being in a satisfying, long-term marriage. During the interview, couples were asked to discuss the perceived factors that have contributed to the longevity and satisfaction of their marriage, as well as whether the chosen absence of children in their relationship has had any perceived effect on their marriage. The narratives of each couple were then organized into groups of similar meanings or themes and reported in the Results section. Results of this study indicated that some childfree couples perceive good communication as an aspect of their relationship that contributes to marital satisfaction, as well as striking a balance between time spent together and apart to nurture their own interests, careers, and friendships. Couples also reported intentionality around sharing meals together and quality time without electronic devices as a source of distraction, as well as consensus around their decision to remain childfree as important to their marital success. Perceived benefits of remaining childfree included the ability to nurture their own relationship and adult friendships, the perception of greater flexibility to incorporate fun and relaxation into their lives, and financial flexibility. Couples shared their unique and similar process of settling into a childfree identity, ways in which others respond to their decision with pressure, criticism, and varying degrees of support, as well as minor struggles related to their decision to remain childfree. Clinical implications are provided for clinicians who work with this population, and include assisting couples with fostering timely and honest communication, encouraging couples with different interests to nurture their individuality as well as the couple identity, and encouraging the couple to be intentional with scheduling quality time together without distractions. Interventions also focus on the importance of normalizing fleeting moments of doubt regarding their decision, and exploring ways to respond to others who exert pressure or criticize the couple for remaining childfree. The importance of self-reflection in terms of clinician bias toward this population is also emphasized as necessary in order to avoid pathologizing the couple's decision and to provide a corrective experience. Limitations of this study and suggestions for future research are briefly discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The Methylphenidate (MPH) prescription model was developed for use in broad practice. This procedure, based on a single subject, double placebo, and triple blinded design, relied on collaboration between the school psychologist and the primary care physician. Five elementary school children of average intelligence participated in this study. All presented significant attention/hyperactivity disorders in school and home settings. During six weeks of trials the response to MPH was examined across four different drug conditions: MPH 5-mg, 10-mg, 15-mg, and inert placebo. Each child's response to Ritalin therapy was rated by teachers and parents on the ADHD Rating Scale (ARS), the Goals for Improvement (GFI) scale, the Academic Efficiency Score (AES) scale, and the Behavioral Profile (BP) scale. These scales measured suppression of ADHD symptoms, individual targets for improvements, academic productivity, and Ritalin-related side effects, respectively. Rationale for determination of the minimal effective dose (MED) was based on clinically significant change, operationalized as the extent to which the MPH therapy moved a child outside the range of the dysfunctional population. Response to MPH was classified as normalized, improved but not normalized, and not changed using the C and RC statistics, mean percentage, and percentage scores for appropriate measures. Clinically significant and placebo independent MPH effect was found for all five subjects for ARS scores and for GFI scores by teacher and/or parent ratings. The AES scores indicated that behavioral improvements were not accomplished at the expense of academic productivity. Therapeutic effects of MPH therapy for individual children were dose-specific and rarely related to a pattern of improvement with increasing dose. The sensitivity of this protocol to stimulant treatment and to individual differences in responding to either positive or negative MPH effects encourage the adoption of this procedure for clinical us (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This report, framed by the region's foremost experts on poverty, is the first comprehensive and scientifically rigorous analysis of the implications of welfare reform for the people and communities of Los Angeles (California). Direct and indirect impacts are considered. It is concluded that the number of welfare recipients in Los Angeles likely to slide deeper into poverty as a result of welfare reform is large. Planned reforms will mean a loss of jobs for Los Angeles County, and those expected to change from welfare to work will have grave difficulty securing employment. As some find work, others will lose opportunities. The County will face rising demands on its general relief program, health care services, and children's services, and it will lose Medi-Cal revenues. The extent of social problems related to poverty, such as poor health, child abuse, hunger, and homelessness, may rise significantly. Many communities in the area will be affected, as the impact spreads beyond the immediate city. Neither the voluntary nonprofit sector nor the county of Los Angeles has the economic or political capacity to replace the social safety net or protect the health and welfare of the area's residents. One appendix presents detailed impact calculations, and the other contains the input-output analysis. (Contains 19 tables and 16 figures.) (SLD)

AB  - The passage of the baby-boom generation into old age raises the prospect of intense pressures on public programs benefiting the elderly, limiting any contemplated expansion of programs serving those needing sustained personal care. This necessitates consideration of comparative efficiency of alternative resources for elder care. I focus on two distinct aspects of such efficiency: productive-the relationship between inputs and outputs-and target-the coincidence of served and those viewed as needing services. I argue that for theoretical reasons family members, specifically children, may be more productive and efficient carers than paid helpers. Furthermore, even if no more efficient than formal providers, care provided by children reduces public expenditures on long-term care. In view of the value to society of children's caregiving activities, if a collective program of long-term care insurance were to be adopted, it should be configured to target its financing and benefits according to family composition.

AB  - This study examined the awareness of post-adoption depression syndrome (PADS) among adoption agency administrators in a large Midwestern city. Previous literature on PADS was reviewed and described PADS as a mood disorder that occurs after a mother adopts a child. The characteristics of this disorder are reportedly comparable to postpartum depression in a biological mother. Program directors and supervisors from local adoption agencies were interviewed to examine their awareness of PADS and their agency's post-adoption intervention services. Twelve participants responded to a series of six open-ended questions. Out of 12 program supervisors, 11 were familiar with PADS. Eight of these agencies provide post-adoption intervention services; however, these services are not directly related to the treatment of PADS. The discrepancy between the needs of the adoptive mothers compared to the intervention services provided by the agencies may signal a deficiency in effective education and intervention regarding mood disorders for adoptive mothers and difficulties in the psychosocial development of the adoptee. Further studies are needed to systematically inquire and quantify the prevalency, etiology, and protective and risk factors of PADS.

AB  - The way in which foster children grow up and develop is a subject dealt with by various disciplines with widely varying epistemological positions and research methods. In many countries, there are well-developed, well-established clinical research methods based on medical and psychiatric paradigms. In such cases, quantitative studies are generally carried out to examine how disorders occur and can be treated among children in care, and the results are published in corresponding international journals. The research results are also frequently used to make further enhancements in practice, thus affecting the programmes implemented in that field. Their aim is often to improve children's developmental opportunities by developing and applying effective forms of therapy. Following the medical paradigm, the focus is then on targeted treatment using programmes which have been clinically tested and evaluated in terms of their effectiveness.

AB  - Objectives: Today some studies of physicians' perceptions of hope are available, but not studies of how hope informs patient care. The objectives of this qualitative study were to describe the ways physicians conceptualize hope and how these may inform interactions with their patients. Methods: Ten physicians working in a large tertiary care teaching hospital were interviewed. They represented palliative care, oncology, and 7 other specialties. Minimal amount of background information was collected. In-depth interviews were conducted during spring of 2016. Open coding and the constant comparison method were used to identify emerging themes from the transcribed data. Validation method included member checking. Results: Hope was defined as an abstract, evolving concept characterized by future-oriented wishes; offering possibilities for reframing and shaping new meaning; an attitude of positivity or optimism; an attribute of the human condition with emotional and relational roots; and as a response to the existential inevitability of suffering and death. Three themes describing hope emerged: assessing hope, fostering and sustaining hope, and attributes and outcomes of hope. Conclusions: The findings show how physicians conceptualize hope and how these conceptions differ in the empirical light of the study. Physicians' perceptions of hope may evolve when entering into a therapeutic relationship exploring the needs and desires of patients. Physicians' perspectives about hope may at times not be solely their own but are those of their patients and thus resulting in an amalgamation, or a rebuilding/rekindling of hope amidst hopelessness, that suits a particular relationship.

AB  - The development and evaluation of procedures for imparting information to children regarding inappropriate treatment by adults is a challenging task that warrants increased methodological sophistication. The present study was conducted to evaluate proximal changes in fourth and fifth graders' knowledge and attitudes of physical and sexual abuse following brief skits and focal discussion in the classroom. The study used a control group of children that did not receive the intervention, which permitted a more accurate understanding of the program's effectiveness. Relative to controls, children who received the program showed an overall increase in knowledge of correct actions to take in the event of potential or actual abuse. Limitations of the study, as well as suggestions for broadening the scope and impact of child abuse prevention programs for children are discussed in relation to these findings. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] L'éducation des écoliers dans le domaine des actes indésirables que peuvent leur faire subir des adultes est une tâche difficile qui demande un raffinement méthodologique considérable. Ce genre d'enseignement doit être développé et évalué et la présente étude est une telle évaluation. Les élëves étaient en degré 4 et 5, on a essayé dans cette étude de voir les changements qui survenaient dans La connaissance et la comportement des enfants à l'égard de la violence physique et sexuelle à la suite de l'introduction de jeux de scène et discussions en classe. Les auteurs de l'étude ont compare des enfants qui n'avaient pas été mis au bénéfice de ce genre d'intervention avec le groupe des enfants auprés duquel on était intervenu. La comparaison entre les deux groupes a montré que les enfants qui ont été soumis au petit programme ëducatif concernant la violence physique ou sexuelle exercée par des adultes avaient une meilleure connaissance du probleme et une meilleure comprehension des attitudes qu'ils devaient adopter pour se proteger eux-mémes. Cette étude avait tout de même des limites qui sont discutées et les suggestions sont faites pour augmenter l'impact et la dimension de ces programmes préventifs pour les écoliers.

AB  - Evaluated the understanding of prognosis among parents of children who died of cancer and to assess the relationship between this understanding, their perceptions of the goals of treatment, and the adoption of palliative care stratagies. 103 parents of children who received care at the Children's Hospital and the Dana-Faber Cancer Institute were interviewed between September 1997 and August 1998. The children's primary oncologist were surveyed and their medical records reviewed. Results indicate that 56% of parents and 43% of physicians report that they believe a cure is likely at the time of the diagnosis. For parents, the 1st recognition that the child has no realistic chance occurred a mean of 150 days prior to death. The 1st physician documentation that the child entered the end-of-life period and the child's death is a mean of 260 days. 80% of parents report that at diagnosis, they believe that the primary goal of cancer-directed therapy is to cure the child. Where as 75% of parents report they believe that the primary goal in treating symptoms during the end-of-life care period is to lessen suffering.

AB  - The study examined whether or not federal regulatory design of the Reading First program, as supported by No Child Left Behind (No Child Left Behind Act, 2001), the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and adopted by an urban school district in southeastern Pennsylvania, represented effective federal educational strategy. The intradistrict analysis was a cross-sectional, quasi-experimental study by which a cohort sample population was examined for relationships between students as defined by federally proscriptive attributes, their participation in the federally supported Reading First program and subsequent reading proficiency by the end of third grade. The single sample population was drawn on shared student attributes with selection controlled by an independent variable of receipt or non-receipt of Reading First services over a four year period (kindergarten through third grade). Such methodology permitted review of federal regulatory design via the study of associations between Reading First program (non) recipients and attendant student attributes of poverty, ethnicity, English language learner and those identified as in need of special education services. Regression analysis determined the predictive value of the Reading First program upon student's reading achievement proficiency outcome as measured by their respective third grade Pennsylvania State System Assessment (PSSA) reading proficiency score. Discussion was guided by these analyses as to whether or not reading proficiency outcome was accredited to the regulatory promulgated attributes and conditions of federal design as supported by endorsement of the Reading First program. Findings were considerably limited. Provision of Reading First Services had little to no effect upon producing a proficient third grade PSSA reading score outcome for the majority of intended recipients as qualified by Reading First Program grant requirements and intent. Analysis of the associations among the independent variables and dependent variable of a proficient PSSA outcome concluded: a student identified by poverty via receipt of a free or reduced lunch, limited English language capacity, in receipt of special education services, and an ethnicity of Hispanic or Black was also indicated to have a significant probability of a non-proficient score on the third grade PSSA reading measure. Additional support of the conclusion was evidenced by analysis which determined students identified by poverty and an ethnicity of Hispanic, both of whom constituted a significant majority of the students, were the type of student more likely to have received the Reading First Program. An exception was noted for students ethnically identified as Asian whom received Reading First services were more likely to have demonstrated a third grade PSSA reading score of proficient.

AB  - Discussed in terms of instrumental and expressive functions are citizen advocacy programs for mentally or physically handicapped children and adults. Instrumental functions are defined as meeting the practical needs of everyday life while expressive functions are said to involve an exchange of affection which meets emotional needs. Major types of prevailing protective services (guardianship, adoptive parenthood, conservatorship, and trusts) are described and critiqued for impersonality of service, conflicts of interest, and impracticality. Citizen advocacy is defined as the provision of aid in the meeting of instrumental and expressive needs of a handicapped individual by a competent citizen volunteer. Advocacy functions required by handicapped children and adults are compared. Variations of advocacy such as group advocacy, generic advocacy, and crisis advocacy are proposed. A citizen advocacy office at community and state levels is suggested to implement the advocacy concept. Desirable advocate characteristics are said to include the potential for a sustained relationship with the protege and competence in the specific advocacy task. Examples of major advantages of the advocacy schema are a decreased need for professional services and less institutionalization. Current trends emphasizing consumer services, citizen volunteerism, and public disillusion with science and technology are said to make this a propitious time for advocacy programs. Noted are existing programs in Nebraska and Washington. (DB)

AB  - It is pointed out that the calculation of the number of births prevented for each item of contraceptive service provided entails the integration of a variety of factors relating to the potential fertility. Serious errors are noted in B. M. Lee & J. Isbister, 'The Impact of Birth Control Programs on Fertility,' & in B. Berelson, Ed, FAMILY PLANNING AND POPULATION PROGRAMS (Chicago, 111: 1965). A method is presented in which estimates of future potential fertility are based not on fertility rates but on age-specific means of inter-live birth intervals, modified by periods of use overlapping post-partum sterility, & by the probabilities attached to the development of permanent sterility & to the successful adoption of extra-program birth control. Data from D. Wolfers, see SA 1837/B9752, & from L. Henry, see SA A6881, are used. Tables are compounded which represent the births prevented per 100,000 acceptors of a given age-ethnic group, with or without previous contraceptive experience. Data here derive from a Singapore post-partum Intra Uterine Device project involving some 9,000 women of several ethnic origins. It is calculated that a total of about 4,800 births were prevented. Among the factors taken into consideration are: diff'ial fertility between races & ages; the diff fertility expectations of women accustomed to using contraception & those who have never used it; diff'ial continuation rates between races & ages; the probabilities of the development of permanent sterility both before & after the acceptance of contraception; & the factor of post-partum infecundity. It is concluded that this method of calculating the demographic effects of a program is designed to be sufficiently flexible for use in a wide variety of contraceptive field projects, with the proviso that information re intervals between births can be obtained. 20 Tables.

AB  - An analysis, based on the author's clinical experience, of the way children react under stress, in III Parts & 12 Chpt's, preceded by a Foreword by G. M. Carstairs, & an Author's Introduction. Part I-CHILD DEVELOPMENT AND SYMPTOM FORMATION-presents: (1) Personality Development-which outlines the stages of intellectual & emotional growth in the child under reference to the theories of J. Piaget, & discusses the contribution of early stages of development to later personality. (2) The Origin of Symptoms-sees anxiety at the base of behavior disturbances & delineates specific mechanisms involved in the 3 syndromes of unsoc'ized aggressive, well-adjusted aggressive, & over-inhibited behavior. (3) Disturbed Children in the Community-discusses 2 common measures of psychiatric disorder in childhood, symptom counts & global assessments of disturbance; the reactions of society to psychol'ly disturbed children, & the identification of emotionally disturbed children. Part II-STRESSFUL SITUATIONS AND VULNERABLE CHILDREN-contains: (4) Illness and Going to the Hospital-which concentrates on the emotional disturbances that may arise out of illness & hosp'ization particularly for children under 5 or 6. (5) Bereavement-is concerned with the impact of a parent's death on children, the child's view of death, grief reactions in children, & 'explaining death to children. ' (6) Illegitimacy and Family Disruption-examines the effects of being reared in a broken home, transmission of disturbed fam patterns from one generation to the next, the impact of illegitimacy & adoption on emotional adjustment, stepparents, & the need for professional crisis intervention. (7) The Neurotic Family-deals with neurosis as a marital bond & as a reaction to parenthood & its detrimental effect on the child. (8) Culturally Deprived Children-considers the influences of being colored & of coming from a low SC on emotional health. (9) Constitutional Disorders and Mental Illness in Childhood-discusses constitutional disorders (eg, physical handicaps, too low or too high intelligence, language defects) that act as environmental stresses, & such disorders as brain damage, schizoid personality, & autism, which affect behavior directly. Part III-TREATMENT APPROACHES-discusses(10) The Social Environment-which examines how society as a whole, its org's & instit's, can contribute to the prevention & relief of psychiatric disorders in childhood & explores the relationship between S-cul influences & psychiatric illness. (11) Psychological Treatment of Children-advocates the combined use of 4 methods: (a) completely non-critical acceptance; (b) empathic understanding of the patient's feelings; (c) helping the patient to express those parts of himself which his conscience & his ideal self have rejected; & (d) using COMM between patient & therapist as a treatment tool. (12) Helping the Adults Who Care for the Child-proposes a team approach focusing on the child plus his parents, fam therapy, discussion groups with staff members of foster agencies, & awareness of the psychiatric contribution to the functions of other professional child care workers. In general, it is found that emotional disturbance in a child is a symptom rather than an illness, that children have remarkable resilience, & that areas of stress must be recognized early, prevented where possible, or ameliorated through professional crisis intervention.

AB  - Adolescent suicide is thought by many experts to be the second leading cause of dath among adolescents. The present strategies being used, which attempt to prevent these suicides by treatment during adolescence, do not seem to be working. This study therefore examined the development of self-concept and coping strategies during childhood in an effort to discover methods of providing the support and guidance needed in order for children to adopt those strategies found to be effective during adolescence. Parents of 51 adolescents who committed suicide completed a questionnaire covering personality and behavioral aspects of their children's lives during preschool, elementary, junior high, high school and older ages. A control group of parents (n=23) who had at least one post-high school age child completed similar questionnaires. The adolescents who committed suicide were found to have utilized external locus of control beginning in elementary school, were more likely to have given up or argued when having difficulties, and at high school and older ages had been less likely to compromise as a way to solve problems, than control group adolescents. The number of stresses that the suicide sample had experienced was also significantly greater than stress experienced by the control group. Adolescents who committed suicide were more impulsive beginning at preschool, and developmental trends toward greater sensitivity were found at every age level. (Author/BHK)

AB  - During the year 2004, 20% of eighth-graders and 60.3% of twelfth-graders reported that they had gotten drunk at least once over the course of just one year, according to the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA). Of the 10.7 million underage youth who drink, 7.2 million or 31% of all high school students binge drink with a frequency of at least once a month. Complicating these figures with regard to just the area of teen drinking is the further finding that 21.5% of twelfth-graders had, at some point in their life, tried illicit drugs. Harder to capture in these survey results are the many related issues that misuse of alcohol and other drugs foster for teens: motor vehicle crashes, personal injury, sexual assault, teen pregnancy, vandalism, and impaired intellectual and social development. In this article, the author addresses underage drinking and drug use and discusses an integrated approach to prevent underage drinking and other drug use. He suggests that a set of coordinated, collaborative strategies and programs is required in each community for this problem to be dealt with effectively. Multiple component strategies that include two or more strategies together such as family and student programs or school prevention activities and community initiatives will have a greater impact than a single approach would have.

AB  - Refugee women have poor psychosocial health as a result of past trauma and difficulties associated with settlement. This study was a pilot to find out how to use mobile phone-based peer support to improve the psychosocial health of, and facilitate settlement in a group of nine Nuer refugee women in Melbourne, Australia. Nine participants recruited by a community leader received peer support training over two five-week periods. They were further provided with mobile phone recharge vouchers to call one another to practice peer support techniques. The fifth and final sessions were focus groups to evaluate the intervention. Notes from the focus groups were thematically analysed. The women reported greater confidence and empowerment as they received more support, had better connections within the group and better access to information. Relationships with friends, family and the community became richer as they adopted and experienced more functional communication patterns. Using mobile phones for peer support helped to re-create community by bridging the geographical distance that separates refugee women. It allowed the women, from similar backgrounds and with similar experiences, to provide mutual support and exchange information through a verbal channel, the form of communication they are most comfortable with. The program demonstrates the positive psychosocial effect of peer support in a refugee community, and provides a viable model for using mobile phones in health promotion interventions. The successful outcomes, as perceived by the participants, are indicative of the potential of using technology to bridge health inequities in a marginalised group.

AB  - Eliciting symptom and quality of life information from patients is an important component of medical and nursing care processes. Traditionally, this information has been collected with paper and pencil. However, this approach presents several barriers, including delays in receiving information, difficulty in integrating responses with electronic records, and the time required to manually score questionnaires for measurement purposes. One solution that addresses many of these barriers is the adoption of computerized screening for symptom and quality-of-life information. This research explored the acceptability of asking symptom and quality-of-life questions using the Electronic Self Report Assessment-Cancer program on wireless laptops equipped with touch-screen format. Acceptability data were explored with respect to whether any differences may be attributed to demographics and symptom and quality-of-life levels, such as depression and cognitive and emotional functioning. This evaluation used descriptive and univariate statistics to examine data from 342 participants from the ongoing ESRA-C randomized clinical trial. Research participants for the ESRA-C study were recruited from the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, a consortium among the University of Washington Medical Center, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, and Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center in Seattle, WA. The sample consisted of 342 adult participants who completed both baseline and follow-up survey sessions. Medical oncology represented the largest recruitment group (45.3%), followed by stem cell transplant (34.5%) and radiation oncology (20.2%). The primary finding was that patients were generally able to use ESRA-C quickly and without difficulty in a real-world clinical setting and that they were overall quite satisfied with the ESRA-C program. Significant differences were found in several acceptability areas with respect to demographics and quality of life measures such as age, sex, and severe distress. This analysis confirms that the ESRA-C application for collecting symptom and quality of life information is easy for patients to use and acceptable across a range of user characteristics. We intend to build on our work by using the survey platform in other modalities while ensuring that the patient's preferences are considered at all times.

AB  - Effective, "integrated" care across clinical, classroom, and home settings: that's what every student with ADHD needs to achieve academic and social success. Now professionals have one complete, highly accessible guide to delivering this kind of coordinated treatment for children in Grades 1-8. Aligned with the AAP's new guidelines for ADHD management, this essential resource is the key to developing a comprehensive treatment program--one that combines the expertise of school psychologists, educators, primary care providers, and the child's family. Professionals will get practical, research-based guidelines that help with every stage of ADHD management, including: (1) conducting universal and individual screening for ADHD and comorbid disorders; (2) accurately diagnosing ADHD using in-depth information from parents and the other professionals who work with the child; (3) using today's most effective interventions for ADHD, with detailed discussion of both psychotropic medications and behavioral strategies in home and school settings; (4) developing successful classroom-based strategies that combine the contributions of teachers, parents, peers, and the child himself; (5) managing the functional impairments associated with ADHD, including difficulties with academic performance and relationships with peers and authority figures; (6) adopting a family-centered approach, so parents are true partners in the diagnosis and management of ADHD; and (7) maintaining open, coordinated communication between the family, primary care provider, educators, mental health clinicians, and other professionals. It contains eleven chapters: (1) Introduction and History; (2) Prevalence, Etiology, and Long-Term Outcomes; (3) Screening Procedures; (4) Diagnosis; (5) Functional Impairments; (6) Treatment Strategies; (7) The Family's Role; (8) School Procedures and Interventions; (9) Communication; (10) Future Directions; and (11) Resources. About the Authors, Foreword (Steven W. Evans), Preface, Acknowledgments and Index are also included.

AB  - This study was designed to explore the possible connections between student peer relationships and individual students' roles in a network as it pertained to outcomes such as self-reported academic achievement and personal satisfaction with the first year of college. The research question directing this inquiry is: How does a student's role within a residential community of peers relate to success in college? Social network analysis was employed for examination of individual engagement within the context of a larger community. The vast learning community literature tells an interesting story: 1.) a history of co-curricular peer learning environments, 2) a tradition of research intended to assess the value of these programs, 3) a body of literature that provides theoretical explanations for why learning communities should work. The gap in the literature is found regarding what happens within the communities. To learn how individuals within community learn from one another, community of practice was utilized as a framework in this mixed-methods approach to examine the influence of relationships, and exchange, acquisition, & development of social capital within a living learning community. While this network study indicated that popularity, relational ties to staff, and being someone sought-after for advice were not statistically significant predictors of higher GPA, the network analyses confirmed strong network density, cohesion, and proper structure for ideal capital flow. The results of this study confirm that this community is effective in establishing familiarity and even more so, providing an environment that fosters friendships among participants and staff. Furthermore, students developed the ability to construct knowledge alongside their peers. Given the density and relation-rich nature of this community, this positive environment is able to foster more complex and self-authored levels of meaning-making for the students involved. Building this scaffolding facilitated student development, which effectively created a student transformation from dependence on external authority to self-authorship. This study confirmed that the primary goals of a learning community have been met: a group of strangers developed into a network of friends who reap social and academic benefits by virtue of being together in a shared and successful living learning community environment.

AB  - The phenomenon of poverty continues to be one of most important and serious one that demands priority of research and critical analysis. This is because the phenomenon of poverty is so evident and so complicated since it is anchored to other serious social problems and sufferings. Besides, it is ever increasing and expanding in its magnitudes and nature, despite national and international efforts to contain its implications. One important manifestation of poverty is what is known as (the female-face – of –poverty)., in the sense that women are mostly suffer from poverty. This study utilized the social survey method by which a random sample of 1028 women from poor families in villages and centers of sharqiya Province (Egypt) were selected randomly. The sample was designed and selected in cooperation with the Statistical Unit of the National Social and Criminal Research Center in Cairo . The study used the structured questionnaire tool for data collection. The study reveals that the most important circles of sufferings that women face in poor households are : caring for family members, disease, and education of children. The study noticed an increase in the number of poor women after the government adopted (structural adjustment policies, austerity programs and privatization). All these resulted in the withdrawal of the State from the field of social welfare, and specifically from the areas of health and education, and left poor women seeking various ways to fulfil these obligation.. One of the most important findings of the study showed that women bear all household burdens, the participation of the husband did not exceed 1.7%. The study demonstrated that poor women suffering from chronic diseases is 48.1 %. This in addition to the care of patients where the proportion of people who suffer from chronic diseases within the family and the poor countries 62.9 %, the disease is the other face of poverty. Also the study revealed that poor families suffer from the burden of supporting their sons and daughter to continue their education, almost 81.7% were not able to pay school fees to their children.

AB  - This report on the well-being of America's children focuses on the need for commitment to children by all sectors of society. The report's foreword describes the current situation for poor children in America, compares U.S. policies to those of other industrialized countries, presents the Action Agenda to Leave No Child Behind for 2000-2001, and urges citizens to work to improve the lives of American children. The six chapters of the report address the following: (1) family income, including strong economic growth, the extent of child poverty, the working poor, and legislative initiatives; (2) child health, focusing on the problem of uninsured children, the Child Health Insurance Program, and the major health issues for the future; (3) child care, including difficulties families have in locating affordable quality care, and policy developments; (4) education, including lagging poor/minority student performance, lagging international performance, school reform initiatives, and recent developments in school finance litigation and desegregation; (5) children and families in crisis, focusing on expected crises during the next millennium such as parental substance abuse, domestic violence, foster care and adoption, family homelessness, and serious child emotional disturbances, and on potential practices for finding effective solutions; and (6) juvenile justice and youth development, including juvenile victims and offenders, juveniles in confinement, minorities and girls in the juvenile justice system, children and guns, school violence, media violence, youth employment, and legislative developments. Each chapter concludes with a proposed action agenda for 2000. The report's two appendices provide tabulated data on children nationwide and by state, covering areas such as poverty, maternal and infant health, adolescent childbearing, youth unemployment, government aid participation, child support, Head Start enrollment, child abuse and neglect, and firearm deaths.

AB  - There has been much recent attention on psychological well-being and pastoral care for medical students. This study examines psychological morbidity (depression, anxiety and stress) in Hong Kong medical students, as well as their concerns, coping mechanisms and their help-seeking. Medical students in Hong Kong reported a higher level of psychological morbidity as compared with other tertiary education students. Their main concerns include examinations, stress, career, adjusting to the new medical curriculum and commitment to the course. The coping skills adopted were largely adaptive. Maladaptive coping skills like 'denial', 'self-blame' and 'behavioural disengagement' were highly correlated with depression, anxiety and stress scores. Most of the students concerned wanted support services that were specifically tailored to their needs and at least partly provided by people who had been through medical training themselves. The faculty at the University of Hong Kong is establishing a Programme for Effective Transition and Student Support (PETSS) to provide a multi-faceted support system for its medical students. The findings in this study help to ensure that the services provided will be relevant, accessible and acceptable to the students.

AB  - Background: In childhood and adolescence, fecal soiling represents a psychologically devastating problem. Physical and emotional distress associated with daily rectal enemas is minimized by the introduction of a cecostomy tube for colonic cleansing with antegrade colonic enemas (ACEs). Patients and Methods: Over a period of 10 years (1997-2007), we performed ``button{''} cecostomies ill 69 pediatric patients with fecal soiling secondary to a variety of disorders; laparoscopic procedures were performed in 40 and open procedures in 29. Mean postoperative follow-up was 4.03 SD +/- 1.76 years. Cleansing protocols differed between patients. Results: We adopted a standardized questionnaire concerning management of incontinence/intractable constipation before and after button cecostomy insertion to assess the long-term impact of ACE oil symptom severity and quality of life. Complications included tube dislodgement (n = 9), development of granulation tissue (n = 11), decubitus ulcer (n = 5), and infection (n = 3). Patient/parents satisfaction (appraisal scale 1-3) and improvement of quality of life achieved statistical significance for both (P < .001). Conclusions: Since button cecostomy and ACE were introduced in our institution as a management option, the treatment of fecal incontinence and intractable constipation significantly improved in terms of efficacy and patient compliance and also resulted ill greater patient and parent satisfaction.

AB  - Based on a resilience perspective, this study attempted to explore the risk and protective factors influencing the mental health of immigrant and local youths in Hong Kong. A structured questionnaire which consisted of The Chinese Adolescents Life Events Checklist, The Perceived Satisfaction of Social Support Scale and The Brief Symptoms Inventory was used. Two hundred and ten local and immigrant youths between the age of 15 and 20 were individually interviewed by the trained interviewers. Contrary to our hypotheses, the findings revealed that immigrant youth had better mental health and similar levels of stress than local youth. Moreover, peer support was found to exert a strong impact on the mental health of immigrant youth. While 'Interpersonal relationship difficulties' was identified as a common risk factor faced by local and immigrant youths, immigrant youth faced additional risk factors in relation to a change to a new school and parental conflicts. On the other hand, endurance of hardship, social competence and peer support were considered as the protective factors that might be associated with better mental health in immigrant youth. The implications of this study included: to adopt a resilience perspective to understand the protective mechanisms that enhance the mental health of immigrant youth; to develop a national strategy to build up the interpersonal relationship skills of youth in a society; and to organize specific programmes to strengthen the peer system and tackle parental conflicts in immigrant youths.

AB  - The concept and management of urinary tract infection in children has been evolving over the past decades. While previous guidelines advocated universal imaging and antibiotic prophylaxis for young children with first time Urinary tract infection (UTI), the recent guideline issued by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in the United Kingdom in August 2007 recommended a more selective strategy. This article presents a summary of the NICE Guideline with comments and recommendations by the authors. The Guideline was stringently developed and has Incorporated recent scientific findings. Compared to previous guidelines, the major changes include the following: Firstly, it presents a complex algorithm for the diagnosis of UTI by rapid bedside tests. Diagnosis does not require urine culture in children above 3 years old who show positive dipstix results. Secondly it adopts a selective imaging strategy after first UTI. Ultrasound was recommended for infants below 6 months. or children of any age with atypical or recurrent UTI. Dimercapto-succinic acid scan was recommended for infants below 3 years With atypical or recurrent UTI, and those above 3 years with recurrent UTI. Micturiting cystourethogram was recommended only for infants below 6 months with atypical or recurrent UTI or with abnormal ultrasound, and for infants above 6 months with atypical or recurrent UTI AND I family history of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), poor urine stream, non-E.coli infection, or dilated retial pelves. Thirdly, antibiotic prophylaxis or surgery was not recommended routinely for VUR treatment. The authors discuss several concerns and suggest the following modifications for local practice: that a pre-treatment Urine culture is useful in treatment by identifying the pathogen and its antibiotic sensitivity that all ultrasound scan is reasonable, if a patient has not had I reliable antenatal or postnatal ultrasound to exclude obstructive uropathies. For imaging strategy after 1 first UTI, the NICE Guideline is a reasonable approach if parents accept the small possibility of missing severe VUR for which the optimal treatment is still Undecided. Until further evidence is available, a prudent option is to continue full imaging for infants below 12 months old and recommend antibiotics prophylaxis for Grade IV-V VUR. Further research is needed to better define the best treatment for severe VUR and to devise an investigation strategy that can identify those patients who may benefit from early detection of VUR and its treatment, and at the same time avoid over-investigating and over-treating the remaining patients.

AB  - Appropriate training can only be developed if training needs for specific skills are carefully identified. This paper, further to an aggregate model developed previously, aims to forecast the occupational share of the aggregate manpower demand for the construction industry of Hong Kong. The forecast, based on existing manpower statistics, is divided into two levels: broad occupations and detailed occupations. The broad occupational demand forecasting model is formulated using a time-series regression analysis to derive the relationship between the occupational share and the construction output cycle, technology, and various work-mix variables; whereas exponential smoothing technique is used to forecast the share of detailed occupations. This occupational demand estimation can provide solid information to facilitate manpower planning. It enables the policymakers to foresee the trends of occupational manpower demand and formulate policies and training and retraining programs tailored to deal effectively with the industry's human resource requirements in this critical sector of the economy. Although the study focuses on developing models for the Hong Kong construction labor market, the adopted methodology can be applied in other labor markets to develop such models for manpower planning.

AB  - Globally, HIV/AIDS-related stigma and discriminatory attitudes deter the effectiveness of HIV prevention and care programs. This study investigated the general public's perceptions about HIV/AIDS-related stigma and discrimination towards people living with or affected by HIV/AIDS in order to understand the root of HIV/AIDS-related stigma and discriminatory attitudes. Study was carried out using qualitative focus group discussions (FGD). An interview guide with semi-structured questions was used. Participants were members of the public in Malaysia. Purposive sampling was adopted for recruitment of participants. A total 14 focus group discussions (n=74) was carried out between March and July 2008. HIV/AIDS-related stigma and discrimination towards people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) was profound. Key factors affecting discriminatory attitudes included high-risk taking behavior, individuals related to stigmatized identities, sources of HIV infection, stage of the disease, and relationship with an infected person. Other factors that influence attitudes toward PLWHA include ethnicity and urban-rural locality. Malay participants were less likely than other ethnic groups to perceive no stigmatization if their spouses were HIV positive. HIV/AIDS-related stigma and discrimination were stronger among participants in rural settings. The differences indicate attitudes toward PLWHA are influenced by cultural differences.

AB  - Care management processes (CMP) may be implemented in health systems to improve chronic disease quality of care. The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between the presence of hypertension-specific CMP and blood pressure (BP) control among hypertensive patients within selected physician organizations in the USA-modified version of the Physician Practice Connection Readiness Survey (PPC-RS), developed by The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA), was administered to chief medical officers at 28 US-based physician organizations in 2010. Hypertension-specific survey items were added to the PPC-RS and focused on medication fill compliance, chronic disease management, and patient self-management. Demographic and clinical cross-sectional data from a random sample of 300 hypertensive patients age 18 years or older were collected at each site. Physician site and patient characteristics were reported. Regression models were used to assess the relationship between hypertension-specific physician practices and patient BP control. Eligible patients had at least a 1-year history of care with the physician organization and had an encounter within the past year of data collection. Of the 28 participating sites, most had electronic medical records that handle total functionality (71.4%) and had more than 50 staff members (78.6%). Across all sites, approximately 61% of patients had controlled BP. Regression analyses found that practices that used physician education as an effort to improve medication fill compliance demonstrated improvement in BP control (changes in systolic BP: beta coefficient = -1.366, P =.034; changes in diastolic BP: beta coefficient = -0.859, P = .056). The use of a systematic process to screen or assess patients for hypertension as a risk factor was also found to be associated with improvements in BP control (changes in diastolic BP: beta coefficient = -0.860, P = .006). In addition, physician practices that maintained a list of hypertensive patients along with the patients' associated clinical data demonstrated better BP control (currently controlled BP: beta coefficient = 0.282, P =.034; currently uncontrolled BP: beta coefficient = -0.292, P = .023). However, use of the following practices had a negative correlation with BP control: case management (changes in systolic BP: beta coefficient 1.649, P = .022; changes in diastolic BP: beta coefficient = 0.910, P = .078), follow-up for missed appointments (changes in systolic BP: beta coefficient = 0.937, P = .041; changes in diastolic BP: beta coefficient = 0.165, P = .627), adopted written evidence-based standards of care to treat hypertension (changes in systolic BP: beta coefficient = 0.985, P = .032; changes in diastolic BP: beta coefficient = 0.346, P = .305), and checklists for tests and interventions (changes in systolic BP: beta coefficient = 1.586, P = .004; changes in diastolic BP: beta coefficient = 0.938, P = .019). Findings from this multisite study provide evidence that the presence of some hypertension-specific CMP in physician organizations may be associated with better BP outcomes among hypertensive patients. In particular, patients may benefit from physician efforts to improve medication fill compliance as well as organizational monitoring of hypertensive patients and their clinical data. Further research is warranted to better assess the relationship between CMP and treatment of chronic diseases such as hypertension over time. J Am Soc Hypertens 2011;5(6):505-512.

AB  - This article reports on research into the relationships that emerged between hospital-based and community-based interprofessional diabetes programs involved in inter-agency care. Using constructivist grounded theory methodology we interviewed a purposive theoretical sample of 21 clinicians and administrators from both types of programs. Emergent themes were identified through a process of constant comparative analysis. Initial boundaries were constructed based on contrasts in beliefs, practices and expertise. In response to bureaucratic and social pressures, boundaries were redefined in a way that created role uncertainty and disempowered community programs, ultimately preventing collaboration. We illustrate the dynamic and multi-dimensional nature of social and symbolic boundaries in inter-agency diabetes care and the tacit ways in which hospitals can maintain a power position at the expense of other actors in the field. As efforts continue in Canada and elsewhere to move knowledge and resources into community sectors, we highlight the importance of hospitals seeing beyond their own interests and adopting more altruistic models of inter-agency integration.

AB  - Aims and objectives To discuss families' experiences of their interactions when a relative is admitted unexpectedly to an Australian intensive care unit. Background The overwhelming emotions associated with the unexpected admission of a relative to an intensive care unit are often due to the uncertainty surrounding the condition of their critically ill relative. There is limited in-depth understanding of the nature of uncertainty experienced by families in intensive care, and interventions perceived by families to minimise their uncertainty are not well documented. Furthermore, the interrelationships between factors, such as staff-family interactions and the intensive care unit environment, and its influence on families' uncertainty particularly in the context of the Australian healthcare system, are not well delineated. Design A grounded theory methodology was adopted for the study. Methods Data were collected between 2009-2013, using in-depth interviews with 25 family members of 21 critically ill patients admitted to a metropolitan, tertiary-level intensive care unit in Australia. Results This paper describes the families experiences of heightened emotional vulnerability and uncertainty when a relative is admitted unexpectedly to the intensive care unit. Families uncertainty is directly influenced by their emotional state, the foreign environment and perceptions of being 'kept in the dark', as well as the interrelationships between these factors. Conclusion Staff are offered an improved understanding of the barriers to families' ability to regain control, guided by a grounded theory of family resilience in the intensive care unit. Relevance to clinical practice The findings reveal in-depth understanding of families' uncertainty in intensive care. It suggests that intensive care unit staff need to focus clinical interventions on reducing factors that heighten their uncertainty, while optimising strategies that help alleviate it. Families are facilitated to move beyond feelings of helplessness and loss of control, and cope better with their situation.

AB  - This pilot study attempted to examine the effectiveness of a brief cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) psychoeducational group for Chinese people with chronic illness in Hong Kong. It adopted a single group design, and 52 participants joined the group. A questionnaire with three outcome measures, measuring general mental health, quality of life and dysfunctional attitudes and beliefs, was administered to participants at pre-test, post-test and six month follow-up. Repeated measures ANOVAs were employed and revealed positive changes in most of the outcome measures across the three time points. Cohen's "d" showed a moderate to large effect size for most outcome measures. From a step care perspective, a culturally attuned brief CBT psychoeducational group may serve as an early intervention and a triage to attract suitable people with chronic illness to engage in the treatment process.

AB  - Background The nature of interactions between health care professionals and families may have a significant impact on families' experience and outcomes of critical illness. The value of encouraging positive relationships with families is well documented; however, it is argued that the lack of theoretical frameworks to guide practice in this area may be a barrier to improving patient‐ and family‐centred care. Aims The study on which this paper is based aimed to understand families' experiences of their interactions when a relative is admitted unexpectedly to an Australian intensive care unit and to generate a substantive theory that represents families' interactions that can be used to guide critical care nursing practice when caring for patients' families in this context. Design and Methods A grounded theory methodology was adopted for the study. Data were collected between 2009 and 2013 using in‐depth interviews with 25 family members of 21 critically ill patients admitted to a metropolitan, tertiary‐level intensive care unit (ICU) in Australia. Findings A core category of regaining control has been generated from our study. This paper focuses on Disconnectedness, which leads to increased emotional vulnerability and is also a barrier to families' regaining control. Families feel disconnected when staff emotionally and physically disengage from them, when staff interact insensitively and in a manner that offers families limited hope. Conclusion Our findings offer an in‐depth understanding of staff engagement with families and its impact on the families' ability to regain control. Although some themes have been previously identified in the literature in isolation, the interrelationships of the categories within a theoretical framework to represent family resilience in the context of an ICU situated in the Australian health care system are a novel finding. Relevance to Clinical Practice The findings can be used to support patient‐ and family‐centred care interventions in the ICU. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The majority of Chinese children placed in out-of-home care in Hong Kong come from economically disadvantaged families. These children have experienced poverty and multiple difficulties (e.g., parents' mental illness, substance abuse) in their families. The removal of children from their homes, with the social worker's intention of protecting the children's welfare, has inevitably interrupted the parent-child attachment, which may be a traumatic experience for both the children and their parents. Owing to limited family resources, the out-of-home children seldom have quality family time with their parents and siblings before and after placement. The children's family lives are seriously affected. Despite the evident needs of the children in these areas, out-of-home care services in Hong Kong emphasize behavioral management, discipline and control of the children under care, rather than helping to re-establishing parent-child relationships and fostering quality family life. In view of this service gap, the authors have launched a service initiative; that is, the use of multiple family group therapy (MFGT) in an out-of-home care service provided by a local non-government organization, with the aim of improving parent-child relationships, fostering quality family time and empowering families to provide mutual help and mutual support. In so doing, hopefully we can bridge the service gap and promote the knowledge of family-centered care practice for out-of-home services in Hong Kong. In this article we shall (a) critically examine the impact of poverty on looked-after children and their families and identify unmet service needs; (b) describe the model of the MFGT we have adapted to suit our purpose; (c) highlight the intervention strategies used to foster quality family time, re-establish parent-child relationships and build a network of supporting families; and (d) report the children's experiences and feedback from the groups. At the end of the paper, we shall discuss the implications for the services in a local context. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Aim: To explore families' experiences of their interactions in an Australian adult intensive care unit (ICU) to develop a grounded theory that can be used by critical care nurses to improve patient‐ and family‐centred care (PFCC). Background: Families in ICU play an important role in the patient's recovery and outcomes. However, families are at risk of significant psychological morbidity due to their experiences in ICU. Although many ICU patients can make their own decisions, a large proportion are unconscious or chemically sedated and unable to contribute to decisions about their care, leaving the decision‐making role to the family. Therefore, the families' psychosocial and emotional well‐being must be supported by implementing evidence‐based interventions that align with a PFCC approach. This study describes the findings of a grounded theory of family resilience in ICU, of which the core category is Regaining control. The focus of this paper is on the major category: Searching for meaning. Methods: We adopted a constructivist grounded theory method. Twenty‐five adult family members (n = 25) of 21 patients admitted unexpectedly to an ICU in metropolitan Australia were recruited. In‐depth interviews were used to collect the data, and the analytical processes of constructivist grounded theory underpinned the development of a core category and related subcategories. Results: When adult family members experience the unexpected admission of a relative to ICU, they move towards a state of being beyond emotional adversity and regaining control when facilitated to search for meaning in their situation. When families were able to make sense of their situation and find a purpose by contributing to their relative's recovery, it encouraged them to cope and be resilient. Conclusions: Our findings can be used to promote PFCC in ICU, which considers a collaborative approach to meet the patient's needs while providing emotional and psychosocial support to their families.

AB  - • Future orientation was examined within the social-emotional climate of the school. • Student-teacher relationships predicted higher educational expectations. • Sense of school belonging predicted higher educational and career expectations. • Sense of school belonging and educational expectations were significant mediators. The present study examined whether and the extent to which student-teacher relationships (STRs) and sense of school belonging (SSB) fostered students' educational and career expectations. Data were obtained from 15-year-old Hong Kong students (N = 3, 238) who participated in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) project in 2003. Findings from regression analyses indicated that although STRs and SSB both promoted educational expectations, only the latter predicted higher career expectations. Analyses of a multiple mediator model revealed mediating effects of SSB and educational expectations on the association between STRs and career expectations.

AB  - Project Da Da Kidogo is an innovative and culturally specific program based on the African proverb "It takes an entire village to raise a child." The program provides a wide range of services to meet the academic, social, cultural, and recreational needs of the young African American women in the community. The program focuses on peer group, individual, and family domains, and uses a holistic case-managed approach to services. This paper presents the evaluation of Project Da Da Kidogo in its fourth year, identifying the counseling needs of the African American female adolescents in the community, the use of the counseling services provides by the project, and identifying emerging issues in the area of minority counseling. The target population was African American adolescent females in the north and northeast quadrant of urban Multnomah County (Oregon), the area that includes Portland and Gresham. Services were offered at a middle school, a high school, and a drop-in center. The proposed sample was set at 40 participants, and the actual sample was 38 in the evaluation year. Participants completed a survey of behavior, a sense of self survey, and the Child Assessment Checklist. Evaluation results indicate that the program's main accomplishment has been the development and orientation of the program in the two schools. Survey responses show that the program has been well received by participants, and that it has been helpful in educating students about substance use issues and communication skills. The program enhanced protective factors and reduced risk factors for the participants, who received enrichment experiences and emotional support. There is a strong consensus that the program helps provide a strong and effective prevention program for dropout and pregnancy. (Contains 5 figures and 12 tables.) (SLD)

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to review the evidence estimating an impact of occupational factors on mood disorders and suicide, and the efficacy of interventions. This review is based on literature searches using Medline and Psych INFO from 1966 to 2007 (keywords: work stress, job insecurity, job strain, shift work, violence, occupational health, mood disorders, depression, and suicide). To establish the relationship between occupational variables and mood disorders, we focused on clinically significant disorders rather than depressive symptoms. During the last decade, prospective epidemiological studies have suggested a predictive association between the work environment and mood disorders. Recently, increasing numbers of clinical trials have shown favorable effect size of intervention and suggested preferable return-on-investment results. However, low awareness and social stigma still decrease workers access to treatment. Mental health professionals in conjunction with employers have to devise a creative system to make the quality care being offered more accessible to employees. In addition, further outcome data is needed to evaluate the benefit of managing mood disorders in the workplace, and to foster awareness of positive implications for employees, employers, their families, and the society at large. In addition, the work environment, with its chemical (e.g. chemosensory factors, pollutants), physical (e.g. lighting, noise, temperature, outdoor views and activities), biological (e.g., chronobiological factors, allergens, infectious agents), psychological (e.g. demand-control, effort-reward balance), social (e.g. cohesiveness, support), and organizational (e.g. leadership styles) component should meet minimal standards, and may improve with striving towards the optimum.

AB  - Although minimal brain dysfunction (MBD) has long been considered a disorder limited to childhood, a number of longitudinal and adoption studies suggest that MBD may persist into adult life where it is concealed by a variety of diagnostic labels. To test the hypothesis that MBD does persist into adulthood, 15 putative MBD adults were identified on the basis of current MBD-like complaints, self-description of MBD characteristics in childhood, and a parental rating (on a standardized form) of 'hyperactivity' in childhood. 11 of the 15 Ss were given a double-blind trial of methylphenidate hydrochloride, and all 15 were given an open trial of pemoline, imipramine hydrochloride, or amitriptyline hydrochloride. Assessments included the MMPI, 2 WAIS subtests, and clinicians' and patients' ratings of medication effects. Eight of the 11 showed a significant response to the double-blind trial of methylphenidate. Of the 15, 8 showed a good response to stimulants or tricyclic antidepressants, 2 showed a moderately favorable response, and 5 were unresponsive to drug therapy. It is concluded that MBD does sometimes persist into adult life, with a lessening and/or disappearing of signs and symptoms in the 20s and 30s rather than in the late teens. Relationships between MBD and adult impulse disorders are noted, and 3 brief case histories are presented. (44 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The FamiliesFirst project in Davis, California is a child abuse prevention project designed to keep abused children safely at home. During the first year of operation, FamiliesFirst provided in-home prevention services to 59 children in 26 families referred by county Child Protective Services as an alternative to out-of-home placement. Therapists, carrying a caseload of two families each, provided intensive treatment in the families' homes for a 4- to 6-week period. A comparison group of 24 Child Protective Service-referred families with 49 children received usual county services. Families were interviewed at intake and again one year later. The two groups were evaluated on cost, on whether of not the children stayed at home, and on psychological measures of family functioning. The results revealed that abusive and neglectful families who received in-home services were able to keep their children home more often than were families who received traditional services alone. The in-home intervention did not put experimental group children at more risk for further abuse or neglect, as measured by a need for later placement, than children in the comparison group. The one-year follow-up data indicated that the goals of reducing out-of-home placement and lowering placement costs were being met. (Author/NB)

AB  - This final report discusses the outcomes of an outreach project based on the validated Developmental Therapy-Teaching model that emphasizes teaching skills which foster a child's social-emotional-behavioral competence. The project assisted early childhood and local child care programs in replicating components of the model in inclusive or pull-out settings for children (birth through 8) with social-emotional-behavioral disabilities and their families. Project evaluation data indicate that 731 participants at 13 program locations received inservice assistance in implementing the model in inclusive early childhood settings. Of these, 7 sites with 281 participants requested in-depth assistance to become replication sites. Post-training focus groups revealed that these participants acquired an expanded understanding of using a developmental framework for planning activities to meet individual needs of children. Their responses also indicated increased awareness of children's unique social-emotional-behavioral needs. In post-training observations of 65 participants working directly with children at 8 sites, 81 percent demonstrated "effective" or better performance skills. Data also show that a sample of 28 children at 3 sites made statistically significant improvement in social-emotional-behavioral development during a 6-month period while their teachers participated in inservice training. Summaries of the follow-up questionnaire and of focus group responses are attached. (Author/CR)

AB  - Zimbabwe is one of the countries most affected by HIV/AIDS, and as elsewhere in southern Africa, the impact on children and young people living in affected households is significant. Loss is highly complex and dependent on developmental stage, resilience, quality of care, and social support networks, and often includes a progression of experiences from the onset of a parent's or caregiver's illness, through to the aftermath of death. For several reasons, AIDS-related bereavement is likely to be especially complicated and difficult to accommodate. Understandings of bereavement and grief among African children, and adults' responses to orphans' psychological difficulties, remain under-developed. This paper focuses on the narratives of older children in their teens, who have experienced parental AIDS-related illness and death in six sites in Zimbabwe. A key finding is that, while many orphaned teenagers desire direct communication with adults about parental illness and death, adults themselves-whether the sick parent, other relatives in the household or a caregiver following parental loss-are often ill-equipped to identify and manage children's distress positively. While most existing psychosocial interventions focus on bereaved children, this paper suggests that, in order to create an enabling environment for orphans, building the capacity of key adults in orphans' lives, particularly surviving relatives, caregivers, and teachers to address emotional issues relating to parental loss constructively is an essential, but neglected, area of programming.

AB  - Recent British government legislation, applying to England, has emphasized the importance of capacity building, quality and infrastructure development in partnership working between local authorities and voluntary agencies. Much can be learnt from effective existing partnership models currently being forged by the Children's Fund. Educational psychologists have been cited as being well placed to contribute to the partnership agenda with their adoption of community psychology approaches, training in research methods and ability to account for contextual factors. This paper describes the contribution of an educational psychologist seconded to the Children's Fund to support self-referring community groups delivering interventions. The psychologist's focus was to facilitate empowerment evaluation using a process consultation model. This work demonstrates an adherence to the philosophy of community psychology. Post-consultation questionnaires were administered to gather feedback from voluntary agencies and the Children's Fund regarding the perceived outcomes and the value of the process. Staff in voluntary groups and the Children's Fund report that working with the educational psychologist gave weight and clarity to the aims and objectives of all participating projects. The value of the psychologist's sensitivity to contextual factors was also noted. Individual outcomes for each project were also reported. It may be inferred therefore that educational psychologists could have a significant role in supporting the development of the infrastructure of community projects.

AB  - My three paper dissertation evaluates the economic welfare effects of food price increases and agricultural commercialization on households in Malawi and Mexico. Issues of poverty measurement and poverty alleviation are examined in the context of recent increases in commodity prices. By analyzing these concepts together, my research helps to more accurately address poverty in this volatile time in food price history, with a specific eye toward future policy interventions. My first paper focuses on the impact of food price increases on welfare in the Mexico. My second paper expands the theme of food price increases to incorporate agricultural commercialization during this time period. Due to somewhat surprising results concerning the negative relationship between agricultural commercialization and children's nutrition, my final paper explores this topic in more detail by examining some of the correlations between commercialized households and nutritional outcomes. Taken as a whole, the findings support continued research into the influence of food price variability and agricultural risk management on children in the developing world. The incorporation of geographic diversity, with research in both Mexico and Malawi, provides some acknowledgment of the global nature of recent food price increases. Examining the two very different kinds of poverty present in these countries broadens the scope of my work. Food price spikes have occurred around the globe, and policymakers have responded through different means. These two countries have approached poverty alleviation from different directions, with Mexico focusing on conditional cash transfer programs and Malawi spending more on agricultural encouragement through fertilizer subsidies. My research examines the affects of food price increases on welfare, and provides insights into future policy decision for the next price spike. In addition to their geographic diversity, these two countries are in different stages of the development process. The income diversity of these countries further strengthens the poverty-related findings, as results will incorporate large variations in the relative wealth of the populations being studied. As countries proceed through the structural transformation process, they may respond differently to food price shocks. The Mexico paper looks at how Mexican households responded to significant food price shocks. Recent food price increases reportedly caused significant numbers of households to fall into poverty, particularly in the developing world. Most research into the welfare effects of these food price changes assumes constant demand or approximates second order substitution effects. Poverty forecasts with these assumptions may overestimate or underestimate the effect of food price increases in a nation where most households consume diverse food baskets. I account for full substitution by calculating a theoretically consistent food demand system, accounting for household responses to food price changes by decreasing some food purchases and increasing other food purchases. I use Mexican data to confirm the mitigation of adverse welfare effects from food price increases after accounting for country-specific dietary preferences in modeling demand. In comparison to previous literature, my welfare measures predict theoretically consistent numbers of Mexican households entering poverty due to recent food price changes. My Malawian paper refines the food price increase discussion to look specifically at agriculturally commercialized households. Agricultural commercialization, or the transition from food to cash crops, has gained increasing attention over the past few decades. Plans for developing world farmers to focus on labor-intensive cash crops, to exploit their natural comparative advantage, typically depend on stable food markets to supply these formerly subsistence households. The trade-off between cash and food crop production requires reevaluation in the context of numerous food price spikes and general food price increases experienced globally over the last decade. Discovery of a correlation between Malawian cash crop production and low nutritional health outcomes creates questions of the traditional development path. This paper clarifies the causal effect behind that negative relationship. A nationally representative data set and the 2002-2003 Malawian domestic food crisis allow for time-specific comparisons between the health of children in utero during stable and increasing food price markets. Identifying children exposed to in utero food shocks is the first step to explaining the recent changes in the nutritional outcomes of cash crop producers. Estimates of the effects of Malawian crop adoption on children's health are obtained using robust inference techniques. The causal effects of cash crop production are identified by instrumenting endogenous adoption decisions with predetermined variables. The findings show children of cash crop farmers experienced disproportionately negative effects if they were in utero during the food price shock. The results support the argument that food price shocks negatively influence those more reliant on the market for food purchases, suggesting the need for targeting small scale commercial farmers during times of staple food price spikes. My second Malawi paper examines the somewhat surprising negative relationship agricultural commercialization and children's nutritional outcomes. Building on previous research that identified a causal negative relationship between nutritional health and agricultural commercialization in Malawi, this paper explores differences in the tobacco-producing households. By analyzing the characteristics of agriculturally commercialized households in Malawi, I identify some of the factors that influence the negative correlation between tobacco crop adoption and nutritional deficiencies in the children of smallholders. Nationally representative 2010-2011 data allow for a more preliminary assessment of programs designed to promote better childhood nutritional outcomes. In that context, Malawi's push toward formal market integration and road infrastructure projects is contextualized in terms of its benefits to children's nutritional health. In the end, the non-random observational nature of the data make causality claims difficult to support. I contend that the characteristics of households and communities associated with formal market participation tend to also positively influence the health of children. Future research may allow for a causality argument to be developed, with current positive correlation results from this research supporting general development contentions that higher education, improved family planning and reductions in transportation costs tend to benefit children's nutritional health. Increases in commodity prices have influenced each of these countries differently. I use nationally representation household surveys to determine more wide-scale effects of food price increases. The Mexican paper calculates a food demand system in an attempt to more accurately measure the number of impoverished households due to increasing food prices. The first Malawian paper analyzes smallholder cash crop adoption in the face of recent staple food price spikes. The second Malawian paper examines some of the correlations behind the negative nutritional outcomes discovered in the first paper and individual, household and community level variables. Both of Malawi papers are specifically focused on smallholder agricultural households, with commercialization defined as being a producer of tobacco, Malawi largest export. Each of these situations presents a unique set of circumstances that, when taken together, should provide a greater appreciation for the effect of recent food price volatility on the poor and vulnerable.

AB  - This article argues that incorporating theoretical conceptions of care into Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) programmes creates a foundation for achieving the effective inclusion of children with disabilities. Critical examinations of the origins of care theory and current conceptions of care are used to consider the differing valuation of autonomy and interdependence, the notion of care as a right, and understandings of care in the context of disability and education. The complexity of care, as well as the ways in which conceptions of care inform understandings of disability and influence practices of inclusion are taken up using some examples from Ontario's ECEC contexts through a social justice and disability studies lens. This article presents an ethic of care as a viable tool for social justice in ECEC because it allows for a more comprehensive way of thinking about care. This reframing fosters the inclusion of children with disabilities in a way that recognises difference, values interdependence and reconceptualises what it means to be cared for and to care.

AB  - Early Words Together is a National Literacy Trust programme that develops young children's communication, language and literacy through the support of families by peer volunteers. Over six weeks, the programme brings practitioners and volunteers together to enable target families to improve their home learning environment for children aged two to five. The programme is delivered through small group sessions of one and a half hours, and includes an important peer support factor that helps parents: (1) Understand why they are important to their child's reading and language development; (2) Adopt effective activities to enrich their play, engagement and attachment with their child; and (3) Benefit and increase their child's literacy, communication and language development. The two-year pilot programme, funded by the Department of Education, was rolled out in 120 children's centres and early years settings from April 2013 to March 2015, involving nearly 1,000 volunteers and 1,850 parents. A school readiness checklist is appended. This report highlights the findings of the evaluation and provides key recommendations.

AB  - Perceived insufficient milk (PIM) is the primary reason for breastfeeding discontinuation globally. This study evaluated the short-term impact of mother–infant interactions through home interventions designed to overcome PIM as a result of the infant’s behavior, delivered to 14 dyads of breastfeeding mothers and their full-term singleton infants. A single group, three-occasion prepost design was used. Mother–infant interactions were measured by the Nursing Child Assessment Feeding Scale (NCAFS) at 6, 13, and 27 days postpartum. There were significantly increased mother–infant interactions during intervention. Specifically, significant growth over the intervention occurred for mother’s sensitivity to cues, cognitive growth fostering, infant’s clarity of cues, and responsiveness to caregiver. The NCAFS total score was also significantly improved. Although modifications are required, the three home intervention sessions showed promise in improving mother–infant interactions during breastfeeding. Further investigation using a randomized experimental design is warranted.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to argue that resilience - and its underlying socio-ecological perspective - is a critical concept that could serve to integrate different views on, and approaches to, social marketing. The aim is to inspire social marketers to move away from narrow, issue-based interventions targeting individual behaviours and to consider the impact of social ecologies, particularly the contribution resilience research can make to behaviour change. Design/methodology/approach This is a conceptual paper; socio-ecological models and the resilience concept are discussed and applied to a current ``wicked problem{''} - obesity. Findings From a socio-ecological perspective, research findings highlight the impact macro, meso and micro forces have on behaviour and the importance of a child's micro-system and the influence it has on development and life outcomes. Building resilience requires a relationship-building, person-centred, holistic and long-term developmental approach to behaviour change. Research limitations/implications - This is a conceptual paper that introduces new concepts to the social marketing field. Future research should focus on understanding how to implement a resilience- building approach in practice - including the interrelationships and interactions between individual, family and community resilience - and how resilience can be integrated within systematic, socio- ecological thinking when addressing `` wicked problems{''}. Practical implications - Rather than blaming and targeting individuals, the goal should be to create an environment that supports parents, families and communities to build resilience at the micro, meso and macro levels. The findings support the argument that social marketers should adopt an upstream approach to develop interventions that make the environment the primary focus. Social marketers should collaborate with, and learn from, social workers, psychologists and educationalist to further their understanding of resilience. This would have a positive, sustainable impact on a whole range of social and health issues, ultimately helping to address the overarching issue of social inequality. Social implications - Building resilience amongst individuals, families and communities offer a means to achieve fundamental positive social change and to reduce social, economic and health inequality. Originality/value - The paper offers a unique perspective on how and why resilience - and its underlying socio- ecological framework - should be applied within the social marketing field.

AB  - BackgroundPeople from refugee backgrounds face various challenges after moving to a new country. Successfully securing employment has been linked to positive health outcomes in refugee populations; there is less research into the impact of volunteering on health outcomes in refugees, or the role of employment and volunteering in regional or rural communities. This study aims to explore how employment and volunteering influences the health and wellbeing of refugees settled in regional Australia, and identify areas for appropriate service provision.MethodsNine adults of refugee background in regional Australia were purposively sampled through community organisations using word-of-mouth referrals for semi-structured interviews. Interviews were transcribed. Thematic analysis was used to uncover emergent themes and identify relationships between themes. A strengths-based theoretical framework was adopted to inform further analysis.ResultsPaid work and volunteering engenders a sense of self-fulfillment and sense of belonging, facilitating successful integration into a new community. Employment further allows maintenance of an adequate standard of living, thus improving healthcare access and promoting healthy lifestyle behaviours. Adverse effects from employment include difficulties managing work-life balance, disconnect with family and loss of traditional heritage, but these were significantly outweighed by the positive effects. Volunteering provides no financial incentive, but similarly promotes community connections and positive self-worth, preparing refugees for the workforce. Both employment and volunteering held direct positive benefits for their physical and mental health, improved healthcare access and promoted cultural and social integration. These factors enabled successful settlement and subsequently improved overall wellbeing of participants. A strengths-based approach demonstrated how participants used employment as a tool for seeking purpose and ongoing self-development.ConclusionUnique experiences with employment and volunteering in a regional area amongst a refugee community were explored. Our results describe various ways in which meaningful employment and volunteering can facilitate positive health and wellbeing outcomes of refugees, and thus reinforces the importance of providing such opportunities to ensure successful settlement. The benefits of volunteering in this community have not been previously explored. Additionally, concerns expressed and recommendations suggested by participants could be used to inform future research, policy, interventions and health and employment service provision for refugee populations.

AB  - Across the education, public health, and human and social services areas, there is renewed interest in bringing agency representatives together to work on the promotion of student mental health and wellness. One of the aims of California's Prevention and Early Intervention (PEI) K-12 Student Mental Health (SMH) initiative funded under Proposition 63 is to build collaboration among K-12 school districts, counties, and regions to increase the effectiveness of SMH programs across the state. The Student Mental Health Policy Workgroup (SMHPW) was established to develop statewide policies that would impact K-12 programs, with a focus on enhancing linkages to services provided at schools or through the foster care system, county departments of mental health, special education programs, and community-based organizations. As part of its evaluation of activities funded under Proposition 63, SRI International and RAND researchers are evaluating the development, quality, and effectiveness of collaboration among K-12 SMH program partners. Through multiple methods, including document reviews, key informant interviews, and participant surveys, the SRI research staff is collecting data about the development, function, and goals of collaborative activities; the ongoing challenges and facilitators to successful collaboration; and the degree to which collaboration activities contributed to short- and long-term outcomes relevant to SMH PEI services and supports. Reported here are preliminary findings from 12 interviews conducted with these SMH key informants in the fall of 2013 separately for each K-12 CalMHFSA-funded program. Next steps are explored.

AB  - Binge eating disorder (BED) is a complex condition that is characterized by compulsive overeating with the absence of compensatory behaviors. Due to the high caloric consumption associated with the disorder, there is a high prevalence of obesity within a BED population. Current treatment options have been found effective in reducing binging behavior but have not provided significant weight loss. The lack of effective weight loss options for individuals with BED makes bariatric surgery an important option; however, there has been little emphasis on how individuals with BED respond to the surgical intervention. This dissertation explored the experience of ten individuals who met criteria for BED prior to having a bariatric procedure and had the procedure 1--10 years prior to participation in the study. The researcher conducted semi- structured interviews with each of the participants and analyzed the interviews for emergent themes. The most salient themes endorsed by participants fell into the categories of preconditions to binge eating, pain, support, experience after the procedure, and advice for others. The preconditions of low self-esteem and self-criticism, sexual abuse, and focus on weight in family of origin, all emerged as significant. Participants described a lack of consistent nurturance and empathy within their families of origin, an environment which fosters insecure attachment styles that are often carried into adulthood. Insecure attachment styles can be seen as an underpinning of many of the themes which emerged. Pain emerged as an important role in the results of the study with the themes of chronic pain, pain pills, and the minimization of psychological and emotional pain. Although participants' experience with the surgical procedure varied, participants discussed support as an important theme; support was discussed in the context of familial support as well as support groups and therapy. Participants reported that therapy and/ or support groups either were beneficial to their treatment or would have been beneficial. Regardless of personal feelings of whether or not the surgery was a success participants offered similar advice to others to carefully assess whether or not to have the surgery.

T1  - Synergies between veterinarians and para-professionals in the public and private sectors: organisational and institutional relationships that facilitate the process of privatising animal health services in developing countries
JF  - REVUE SCIENTIFIQUE ET TECHNIQUE DE L OFFICE INTERNATIONAL DES EPIZOOTIES

AB  - The delivery of veterinary services in most developing countries was, until recently, considered to be the responsibility of the public sector. However, over the past four decades, economic constraints and the imposition of structural adjustment policies (SAPs) have led to a gradual decline in public sector investment in real terms and thus a reduction in the quality and quantity of services available to livestock keepers. Many governments acknowledged that they were no longer able to provide services that were essentially of a `private good' nature and introduced radical policy changes which sought to introduce the concepts of a market orientated approach towards agriculture and livestock production in particular. The role of government, in the future, would be to provide a reduced range of essential `public good' services and to create a favourable environment in which the private sector could become established as a provider of `private good' services and at the same time act as a partner in carrying out certain public functions under contract or `sanitary mandates'. In almost all developing countries, however, these policy changes were not accompanied by appropriate development strategies. The reasons for this are complex. Firstly, SAPs may be considered to have been foisted upon governments by donors and are thus perceived by many policy-makers as the cause of financial problems, rather than a solution to them. Secondly, most animal health senior policy-makers in the public sector have been trained as veterinarians and lack the required management skills to plan change effectively. Furthermore, as regards clinical veterinary service delivery, especially in rural or more remote areas, the solution fostered by donor investment, which involves deregulation and the deployment of privately operating para-professionals, is often perceived as a threat to the veterinary profession and might result in limiting access to international markets for the trade of livestock and livestock products. An informal delivery system has gained a foothold in many developing countries in the absence of a well-planned strategy for the privatisation of animal health services. Most governments would now acknowledge that this presents a greater risk than the deployment of well-regulated and effectively supervised para-professionals. This paper explores some of the principal challenges facing policy-makers in their efforts to bridge the transition from full state provision of animal health services to the formation of a partnership with the private sector. Governments and donors need to take active steps to facilitate the process of privatisation of animal health services, especially those targeting the poorer rural subsistence and pastoralist farming systems. This would entail an initial investment in developing the necessary management skills at all levels in the delivery system. Thereafter, further investment would be required to allow the changes to be managed using tools such as the strategic planning cycle. Should sufficient resources be made available to allow the full participation of all stakeholders in the delivery of animal health services, appropriate institutions and effective organisational relationships addressing all the more important issues will have to be identified. The paper then proceeds to describe how different livestock production systems determine the level of demand for animal health services. If these services are to be provided on a financially sustainable basis, they must be tailored to meet actual rather than perceived demand. Identifying an appropriate model for animal health service delivery thus requires careful analysis of the production system to be targeted. Governments and donors can play a useful role in providing resources for this type of study as well as for appropriate market studies, business planning, training and access to soft loans. Finally, as regards regulation, as the law stands today, many activities currently practised by para-professionals are classified as `acts of veterinary medicine or surgery' and may only legally be performed by qualified and registered veterinarians. The concept of `principal' and `subsidiary' legislation provides the necessary flexibility in the regulation of the delivery of animal health services to accommodate the rapid changes taking place in this environment today. Deregulation involves the delegation of responsibility for the performance of a defined range of veterinary interventions to para-professionals under the `supervision' or `direction' of a registered veterinarian. The author illustrates how the experiences of a number of projects in Tanzania were used to propose a definition of `supervision' in law. The definition offers an opportunity to overcome the fear of compromising standards of delivery of animal health services through the deployment of para-professionals. In addition, such functioning provides employment opportunities for private veterinarians in rural areas where access to formal primary animal health services would otherwise be denied and may contribute to the process of quality assurance of national veterinary services in developing countries.

AB  - Objective To share innovative practice with enough detail to be useful for paediatricians involved in planning services. Design A review of practice, adopting a realist approach. Setting We collected detailed information about five initiatives which were presented at two meetings in July and October 2014 and telephone interviews between July and November 2014 with key informants, updating information again in February 2015. Results The five case studies involved three clinical commissioning groups (CCGs): Islington CCG and Southwark and Lambeth CCG in London and Taunton CCG in the Southwest. All five initiatives involved acute paediatric units. We heard about four distinct types of services designed to bring paediatric expertise into primary care and/or improve joint working between paediatricians and primary care professionals: telephone multidisciplinary team, hospital at home, general practitioner (GP) outreach clinics, and advice and guidance. We defined four common ways that initiatives might work: promoting shared responsibility; upskilling GPs; establishing relationships between paediatricians and primary healthcare professionals; and by taking specialist care to the patient. Conclusions We derived common aims and mechanisms and generated programme (mid-level) theory for each integrated care initiative about how they might work. These descriptions of what is being done can inform debate about which interventions should be prioritised for wider implementation. There is an urgent need for evaluation of these interventions and more indepth research into how mechanisms and their effectiveness could be assessed.

AB  - With that history of deprivation, and such worrying signs of disturbance, this child is clearly in need of the sort of long term extensive help that can only be provided by psychoanalytic psychotherapy. It is striking how things have changed in the 30 years since, when training, I was informed that only children from 'intact', well functioning, two-parent families were suitably helped by psychotherapy. Resilience is a quality that seems to come through in some of these children, such as Finn, who is seen as likeable, bright, imaginative, and functioning well enough cognitively to read and write well for his age. The therapist's observations from the waiting room interaction illustrate an important beneficial side-effect of a psychotherapy, which is the strengthening of the child's relationship to parental figures. Also, the child's request for copies of the waiting room books seemed to be a way for him to integrate his home life with an attachment to the therapy. What is undoubtedly true is that Finn is using his therapy to express elements in his internal world, which would otherwise cause him great difficulty in life. Just as much as the feelings of being split apart, this is a child who brings hope that he will feel put back together again, and finally leave, 'joined up', as his therapist says. Finn's delighted words to his foster mother show how much he feels the therapy is not only doing him good, but does not come into conflict with his loyalty to her.

AB  - Comparative studies of congeneric native and exotic species have proved fruitful in understanding plant traits that foster invasion. Using this approach, we investigate the complex reproductive system of the invasive Lespedeza cuneata (Dum.-Cours.) G. Don in relation to three native congeners in the variable environment of the North American tallgrass prairie. Lespedeza species produce both chasmogamous (CH) and cleistogamous (CL) flowers, and propagate clonally via vegetative buds. Utilizing multiple natural populations over 2 years, we investigated reproductive modes of individuals from bagged and unbagged treatments of each species. We found that L. cuneata produced a mean of five times as many seeds and a significantly greater number of vegetative buds than any native studied, and over twenty times as many CH flowers. Insect visitation significantly affected seed set in CH flowers, though some autonomous CH selfing occurred in all species. The invasive relied relatively less on selfing than the natives and exhibited less variation in reproductive output from both modes of reproduction. We conclude that the diverse reproductive biology and wide regeneration niche of L. cuneata in relation to its native congeners confer a fitness homeostasis that facilitates the successful spread of this invasive under a wide range of conditions.

AB  - Background: Cost-effectiveness analysis can guide policymakers in resource allocation decisions. It assesses whether the health gains offered by an intervention are large enough relative to any additional costs to warrant adoption. When there are constraints on the health care system's budget or ability to increase expenditures, additional costs imposed by interventions have an ``opportunity cost{''} in terms of the health foregone because other interventions cannot be provided. Cost-effectiveness thresholds (CETs) are typically used to assess whether an intervention is worthwhile and should reflect health opportunity cost. Nevertheless, CETs used by some decision makers such as the World Health Organization that suggested CETs of 1 to 3 times the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita do not. Objectives: To estimate CETs based on opportunity cost for a wide range of countries. Methods: We estimated CETs based on recent empirical estimates of opportunity cost (from the English National Health Service), estimates of the relationship between country GDP per capita and the value of a statistical life, and a series of explicit assumptions. Results: CETs for Malawi (the country with the lowest income in the world), Cambodia (with borderline low/low-middle income), El Salvador (with borderline low-middle/upper-middle income), and Kazakhstan (with borderline high-middle/high income) were estimated to be $3 to $116 (1%-51% GDP per capita), $44 to $518 (4%51%), $422 to $1967 (11%-51%), and $4485 to $8018 (32%-59%), respectively. Conclusions: To date, opportunity-cost-based CETs for low-/middle-income countries have not been available. Although uncertainty exists in the underlying assumptions, these estimates can provide a useful input to inform resource allocation decisions and suggest that routinely used CETs have been too high.

AB  - UK policy has increasingly promoted early intervention and permanence planning for children who experience, or are at risk of experiencing, abuse or neglect, raising the question of whether these practices have actually increased ‘on the ground.’ There is already evidence of growing early intervention in the form of out of home care, in England as well as Australia and Canada. However, we do not yet know whether this trend also exists in Scotland. Furthermore, there is no research investigating whether rates of permanence planning have changed anywhere in the UK or globally. The current study addressed these gaps through a comparison of two samples of children in Scotland: 110 children born in 2003 and 117 born in 2013, all of whom were placed under compulsory measures of supervision prior to three years of age. The 2013 cohort was significantly more likely than the 2003 cohort to be removed from their parents at birth, to reside away from parents throughout the first three years of life and to live apart from parents at three years of age. Significantly more of the 2013 cohort than the 2003 cohort had a plan for permanence by three years. These findings are consistent with the view that policy changes in the UK are affecting practice (although practice changes may have resulted from other sources as well/instead). The fall in parental care was largely compensated by an increase in the use of foster care, which has resource implications. Children removed from their parents at birth were usually not returned in the first three years of life, not raised by extended family members, and were separated from one or more siblings. This typically reduced instability for young children, but also entailed substantial birth family fragmentation. The impact on children and families of early removal into foster care must therefore be carefully assessed in light of the increasing prevalence of this practice in Scotland and elsewhere.

AB  - Treatment of same-sex couples using infertility therapies has become more acceptable over the years, but remains controversial. In December 2005, two law changes came into force in the UK that impact same-sex couples. Firstly, the Civil Partnership Act 2004 acknowledged legal relationships between same-sex couples; and secondly, the Adoption and Children Act 2002 allowed same-sex couples to adopt. In view of these law changes, it is timely to consider procreation in same-sex couples and, particularly, the possibility of intra-partner oocyte donation within a lesbian relationship. Such treatment would require one female partner to provide the oocyte and the other female partner to act as embryo recipient. The embryo(s) could be created using IVF with registered anonymous donor sperm. The novelty of allowing a lesbian couple to cause a pregnancy in this way could allow the recipient to give birth to a baby that was genetically related to her partner. If society finds this acceptable, intra-partner oocyte donation using donor sperm for IVF could successfully provide a family for lesbian couples, offering an alternative to individual donor insemination. The ethical aspects of the treatment are discussed.

AB  - The appropriateness of adopting a new screening policy depends on the burden of suffering from the disease, and on the effectiveness, potential harms and costs of screening. Prostate cancer clearly satisfies the first requirement but the relationship among its benefits, harms and costs is uncertain due to lack of data. Available screening tests (for example prostate specific antigen) can detect early stage disease but there is no evidence that clinical outcomes are improved by early detection. The potential harms of screening 28 million men older than 50 years include unnecessary interventions for thousands of men without disease or with clinically insignificant cancer. The billions of dollars required for this effort could displace resources away from health care services of proved benefit. Ongoing clinical trials are expected to provide needed data. In the meantime, public policy should emphasize preventive services of proved effectiveness. Patients should be informed of what is known and not known about the potential benefits and harms of prostate cancer detection before undergoing screening.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to present a longitudinal, qualitative study exploring changes in the attributional constructions of sense-making in the perceptions and lived experiences of the glass-ceiling among a cohort of female mental health nurses in the National Health Service who participated in a 12-month multi-faceted career and leadership development pilot programme compared to a matched control group. Design/methodology/approach The authors interviewed 27 female mental health nurses in the UK who participated in a multi-faceted development programme specifically designed to support female nurses secure career advancement and 27 members of a matched control group who did not experience the programme. Participants engaged in semi-structured telephone interviews at three separate time points (six months apart) over a 12-month period. Findings Programme participants differed in their attributional constructions of sense-making in relation to the glass-ceiling over time compared to the matched control group, e.g., triggering understandings and awakenings and re-evaluating the glass-ceiling above when promoted. Findings are used to theorise about the glass-ceiling as a concept that shifts and changes over time as a function of experience. Practical implications - Practical implications include important organisational outcomes in relation to fostering the career advancement and retention of talented female leaders at all career stages. Originality/value The authors present the first known longitudinal, qualitative study to explore changes in attributional constructions of sense-making in perceptions and experiences of the glass-ceiling among female nurses over time compared to a matched control group.

AB  - Undernutrition during pregnancy is more prevalent in Thailand than in developed countries. Theory-based nutrition interventions have been successful in promoting improved dietary behavior but have not been tested in Thai pregnant women. Based on self-determination theory (SDT), interventions that support individuals' autonomy could enhance their autonomous motivation and perceived competence for behavior change, promote actual behavior change, and improve health outcomes. Study aims were to: (a) assess the feasibility of a nutrition intervention focused on goals and based upon SDT; and (b) explore changes in and relationships among dietary behaviors, theoretical variables, and health outcomes. A one group, pre- post-test design was used. Participants were 45 Thai women with healthy pregnancies of less than 26 weeks. The intervention was delivered weekly for six weeks through two face-to-face and four follow-up telephone contacts. The intervention involved providing information about healthy diet, eliciting motivation and facilitating autonomy through offering choices of dietary goals and practical plans and fostering competence about dietary change. Feasibility of recruitment, retention, and acceptability of intervention were assessed. Outcomes of dietary behaviors, maternal weight gain, and infant birth weight were measured.Recruitment and retention rates were high. Among 55 invited participants, 45 (82%) consented. Among consenting participants, 40 (89%) were retained. The nurse intervener's ratings on the ability to execute protocols were high as were participants' acceptability ratings of the intervention. Participants offered helpful feedback, including their preferences for a combination of face-to-face and telephone follow-up contacts and suggestions for extending the intervention until delivery. As expected, the SDT variables of perceived autonomy support, autonomous motivation, and perceived competence increased from pre- to two-week post-intervention (ps < .01). Participants' meat and milk intake which met Thai recommendations increased from pre- to two-week post-intervention (ps < .01). Participants' protein and calcium intake which met Thai Dietary Reference Intake increased from pre- to two-week post-intervention (Ps < .01). Findings indicate that the intervention was feasible and promising in promoting diet and maternal-child outcomes. Nurse researchers can further design a two-group experiment with a larger sample to improve dietary behaviors and health outcomes in Thai pregnant women.

AB  - The frequency of divorce in America has resulted in an estimated 11,000,000 minor children living in single-parent homes, usually with mothers as heads of households. Psychological disruption observed in children of recently divorced parents may be, in part, related to the quality of the custodial mother's adjustment to her changed life circumstances. Loss of attachment bonds, changes in daily living patterns, excessive role strain, and the amount of continuing interpersonal conflict all contribute to the degree of post-divorce stress. These factors are compounded for the custodial mother with a traditional sex-role orientation; traditional female role structures contribute to post-divorce stress. Economic dependence on a male results in financial insufficiency following divorce. Subordination to male power results in post-divorce powerlessness and feelings of external control. Reliance on the husband for social identity and support systems results in social isolation and over-investment in the super-wife/super-mom role results in post-divorce role strain. Maternal stress may foster negative and coercive childrearing practices which are reflected in the disrupted behavioral and developmental progress of the children. Intervention approaches to mediate the negative image of single parents must include resocialization, remediation, and research. (NRB)

AB  - It is imperative to maximize our limited resources conducting nursing research through targeting studies in priority areas and structuring projects to foster comprehensiveness and generalizability. This paper reviews priorities for nursing research and presents a model for research, detailing its component domains and the relationships among these domains. It further applies the model to a specific research project concerned with comparing the outcomes of two intensive community-based service programs for children with serious emotional disturbances and discusses the implications of applying this model.

AB  - Participation in occupations is central to the maintenance of well-being and personhood for people with dementia and fosters vital relationships with care partners (Vikström et al. 2014). As dementia progresses, participation in occupation becomes increasingly mediated by those partners, often within shared occupations. Understanding how occupations are shared and co-constructed by more than one participant has only begun to be explored in research and theory (Van Nes et al. 2012; Vikström et al. 2014; Hydén, 2014). How people with dementia and partners work together to co-construct shared occupations as meaningful enacted processes is the subject of this study, which analyses collaborative occupations involving persons with dementia and family partners. It aims to observe and analyse everyday occupations in rich detail within naturalistic settings (Dahlbäck et al. 2013). Video journals of occupations recorded by the participants themselves are analysed using grounded theory methodology and microanalysis (Griffiths, 2013) is utilised to identify subtle actions and interactions. This seminar discusses findings and analysis from just the first occupation analysed within an ongoing research programme involving staff and students as co-researchers. Initial themes identified include 'valuing relationships', 'co-construction of a shared action world' and 'you play your part and I'll play mine'. An overarching theme was of 'working as one'. The enfolded nature of the occupation and its dramaturgical structure as performance were also significant. The study has implications for occupational therapy practice with people with dementia and carers, but also occupational science and theories of enablement from a complexity and ecological perspective. Research ethics went through the York St John research ethics process and was approved by the Health Modules Ethics Panel at York St John University on 3rd November 2016 (Research ID: 03112016_Wey_000002216). The study adopted a process ethics model (Dewing, 2007), which meant that gaining consent from participants (particularly with dementia) was a continuous process. We decided the best way to make that a reality was for the participants to have control over the video camera themselves so they could be consenting in action at all points and could turn off the camera at any point.

AB  - An example of working with juvenile sex offenders in foster care is the Ohio Teaching-Family Association, which consists of 7 teaching families and a support staff person. The approach incorporates emotional, cognitive, and behavioral elements and can safely care for these youths in a foster family setting. This treatment is effective and it protects the community from further victimization. Therapeutic effectiveness is enhanced because it takes place in a more normal environment than an institutional setting. But, care must be given at assessment to minimize risk to the community. Effective treatment components include reliance on the court to establish low tolerance for sex offending, thorough assessment, individualized treatment plans, a comprehensive treatment curriculum, and fair limits with consistent consequences.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Physician turnover threatens continuity of care for patients and is a huge expense for health care organizations. Health care organizations have been advised to help physicians build positive relations with colleagues, staff, and patients as a strategy to socially integrate physicians in the workplace and to increase physician retention. Although these recommendations are touted as 'evidence-based' practices, the importance of workplace relationships for physician retention has not been established empirically. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to examine two questions: Are physicians who report better relationships with colleagues, staff, and patients less likely to intend to withdraw from practice? Do the effects of these relational factors differ for large-group and solo/small-group practice physicians? METHODOLOGY: Using data from the Physician Worklife Survey, we analyzed the associations between physicians' reported relationships with colleagues, staff, and patients and intention to withdraw from practice within 2 years using logistic regression. FINDINGS:: Relationships with colleagues had a significant and negative association with intended withdrawal from practice for large-group practice physicians. The joint effect of relationships with colleagues, staff, and patients was significant for large-group practice physicians, but it only approached significance for solo/small-group practice physicians. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: This study suggests that workplace relationships may influence physicians' intention to withdraw from practice, but the mechanisms by which they do so are unclear. Possible interventions to improve physician retention include promotion of informal mentoring and efforts to support community involvement of physicians and their families. Further research examining the role of these and other programs in promoting physician retention can help employers to foster positive workplace relationships and improve retention.

AB  - Many construction professionals experience high levels of stress. Workplace stress leads to psychological, physiological, and sociological strain effects. Sufferers adopt different coping mechanisms in attempts to mitigate their condition. Using an online survey, opinions were sought from architects, civil engineers, quantity surveyors, and project and construction managers in South Africa. The contribution of the research reported in this paper lies in its examination of the work stress experienced by construction professionals in a developing country characterized by economic hardship and social problems, such as inequality and crime. Most respondents experience high levels of stress at work. Architects (more than engineers, quantity surveyors, and project and construction managers) and female (more than male) professionals feel stressed. Psychological effects of workplace stress include the feeling of not being appreciated by others for a job well-done, feeling dissatisfied with one's own performance at work, and feeling tense at work. Physiological effects include disturbances to usual sleep patterns, difficulty in relaxing after hours, and difficulty in concentrating. Sociological effects include a strain on family life, social activities, and social relationships. A wide range of positive coping mechanisms (or countermeasures) is reported, including physical exercise in addition to intellectual and cultural activities. From a negative-coping perspective, consumption of alcohol is widespread, with more than one-third of respondents consuming 3-9 units/week. One in six respondents report smoking of up to 40 cigarettes/day, whereas use of narcotics (such as marijuana, cocaine, mandrax, ecstasy, heroin, and methamphetamine) at least once in the previous 12 months is reported by 1 in 20. A duty-of-care ethos suggests that appropriate and carefully targeted stress-management strategies should be implemented by organizations within the construction industry. Further research is recommended to explore the effectiveness of organizational and personal stress-management interventions.

AB  - Facts on the impact of alcohol consumption on health in Europe indicate that alcohol is a dependence-producing drug associated with an increased risk of illness and death. Alcohol is also an intoxicant, and drunkenness is associated with a high risk of injury and death, both to the drinker and to others. A number of papers discuss alcohol policy in Europe as well as alcohol consumption in relation to cultural influences and market forces. Ten strategies for alcohol action are outlined. One strategy is to inform people of the consequences of alcohol consumption on health, family, and society, as well as the effective measures that can be taken to prevent or minimize harm, building broad educational program that begin in early childhood. A second strategy is to promote public, private, and working environments that are protected from accidents and violence and other negative consequences of alcohol consumption. A third strategy is to establish and enforce laws that effectively discourage drunk driving. A fourth strategy is to promote health by controlling the availability of alcoholic beverages. Other recommended strategies are to implement strict controls, ensure the accessibility of effective treatment and rehabilitation services, foster awareness of ethical and legal responsibility among those involved in the marketing or serving of alcoholic beverages, enhancing the capacity of society to deal with alcohol through the training of professionals in different sectors, supporting nongovernmental organizations and self-help movements, and the formulation of broad-based programs in member states of the European Union. Extensive graphic data on alcohol consumption and health issues in Europe are provided.

AB  - Relevant research analyzing the psychosocial characteristics of foster children was reviewed in order to provide a context to explore the empirical literature on the treatment of attachment disorders with this population. The literature related to the psychosocial characteristics of foster children suggested that children entering foster care are more psychologically disturbed than in previous years and are at a greater risk for psychopathology than their home-reared counterparts. There was sparse literature on the treatment of attachment disorders and few actual outcome studies on the effectiveness of a specific treatment approach on a population of children identified as having attachment disorders. Various studies of a more empirical nature were reviewed and included in this review on the basis of their author's conceptions of their subjects as having either attachment disorder or some disruption in the subject's attachment relationships. The treatment approaches found in these studies were discussed in terms of their possible contributions to clinicians working specifically with foster children in the context of the foster care system.

AB  - We use DNA‐fingerprinting to estimate the poverty reduction effect of adoption of improved cassava varieties in Nigeria. We estimate the counterfactual household income distribution of cassava producers by combining farm‐level treatment effects with a market‐level model. Our results suggest that adoption of improved cassava varieties has led to a 4.6 percentage point reduction in poverty, though this is sensitive to the measurement of adoption status. Therefore, accurate measurement of adoption is crucial for a more credible estimate of the poverty reduction effect of adoption. Our analysis also suggests that farmers who are more likely to be adopters are also likely to face higher structural costs. Addressing structural barriers that make improved technologies less profitable for the poor would therefore be important to increase the poverty reduction effect of improved cassava varieties.

AB  - This article describes a model for supporting parents and their infants during separations due to temporary foster care. Using a case example, the authors describe a model for visit coaching, including their process for assessment and strategies used for intervention. The lessons learned are: (a) that individual parents can present very differently when contextual risk factors are properly addressed; (b) that interventions need to target specific risk factors such as untreated mental health problems, unemployment, or housing problems before attachment-based interventions can be effective; and (c) attachment theory and practice has significant utility in supporting mothers and their infants in foster care.

AB  - Objectives. To understand obstacles to and opportunities for improving prostate cancer communication to and within African American communities. Design. Researchers conducted interviews with 19 community leaders and five focus groups with healthy men and survivors. The team also conducted process evaluations of two outreach projects in which survivors spoke to African American men about prostate cancer and screening. Results. Three levels of obstacles to prostate cancer screening and treatment were identified. Individual-level obstacles included limited knowledge about the condition, about prevention and treatment, and fear of cancer. Socio-cultural barriers included distrust of the medical system, lack of a provider for routine and preventive care, reluctance to talk about cancer, and aversion to aspects of screening. Institutional deficits included the scarcity of educational efforts targeting prostate cancer. Outreach project evaluations suggested that survivors can be effective in building prostate cancer knowledge, promoting positive attitudes toward screening, and fostering conversations about prostate cancer. Educational efforts included little information about screening risks and decision-making however. Conclusions. The findings suggest that most potent interventions may combine survivor-led education with mass media and institution-based outreach. Such comprehensive programs could shift social norms that inhibit conversation and foster fear, leading in turn to more informed decisions and better treatment outcomes.

AB  - Student perceptions of competency in Hospitality Management, (HM) and the level of engagement in the college experience were compared between two programs to verify engagement as a construct consisting of three domains; classroom, campus, and off-campus. Administrator and student descriptions of engagement in the college experience described the pedagogy, activities, and experiences that were unique between a four-year public and private college. A multi-case study design was employed to triangulate quantitative and qualitative data including student surveys, college catalog descriptions, and interviews. The three domains were verified using statistical reliability. A survey of HM competency based upon the top 11 competencies presented by Christou (2002) was designed to measure student reported competency and the level of contribution from the three domains. Results explained the level of student competency and the amount of contribution of the three domains. The construct validity of the college experience was best explained by three domains; classroom, campus, and off-campus and was not improved by additional factors. Student competency did not differ between programs, however the classroom domain was significantly higher in competency at a four-year private college where classes where described as fostering engagement with peers and faculty. Students described effective pedagogy as involving group interactions, case studies, and discussions. Engagement in the college experience was a predictor of student competency in both programs with classroom and off-campus domains predicting the most competencies. Results were consistent with previous student engagement literature that identified engagement in college as related to student outcomes. The most effective domain in contribution to competency was off-campus, where students were supported by family, spiritual activities, and work experience. HM-students tended to work in their field that had a direct relationship to concepts and theories discussed in the classroom. A model was developed that described the thee domains and may be of value to future researchers, administrators, students, and hospitality managers as they choose to investigate, design, and support the types of pedagogy, activity, and experiences that relate to competency.

AB  - HIV self-test (HST) kits have been available for purchase directly by consumers since 2012. However, public health and prevention programs have been slow to adopt self-testing as a strategy for improving testing rates and regularity, in part due to concerns about its effects on the well-being of users and lack of follow-up. This study explored whether there were differences in several constructs related to well-being, including health-related quality of life, social support, health empowerment, and emotional distress, across those who used HSTs versus tested at a clinic over time. Data were drawn from a longitudinal randomized controlled trial exploring methods of encouraging HIV testing (clinic-based, regular home delivery of HSTs) and providing follow-up afterward. Results showed that using HST in a given month was not associated with changes in either distress or well-being that same month. Although social support was lower in months when HST was used (versus clinic-based testing), participants reported that engaging in other health behaviors (e.g., Healthy diet, exercise) were more important in months they used HST compared to testing in a clinic, suggesting that HST may empower MSM to begin making other lifestyle changes that could improve their health.

AB  - This is an exploratory, descriptive study of the experience of participants who have been adopted as children. The study is qualitative and data was gathered by interviewing participants. The study reflects the uniqueness of circumstances of the participants' adoptions and ages at which adoption took place. Themes identified in literature were evident in the findings of the research. The purpose of the study is to address the paucity of post-adoption support which exists, and assist professionals and family members involved in adoption. Findings indicate that adoption does indeed affect adoptees. The effects of adoption on adoptees are under-estimated by many professionals. As a result, insufficient attention is paid to the experience of adoption in the life of an individual. Professionals tend to be uninformed concerning the effects of adoption, and therefore are ill-prepared to assist clients in this area. Perspectives of participants change with age. Concerns and anxieties relating to adoption can be resolved by re-establishing contact with birth families, particularly if they accept the adoptee as a family member. Recommendations include a collaborative team of supportive family, friends and professionals who provide a strong support system to adoptees. Keywords.

AB  - Purpose: A growing subpopulation of intimate partner violence (IPV) victims comprises mothers who have been mandated to services by either the court system or child protective services (CPS). Two human service agencies in the United States developed a 13-week novel intervention to address these women. All participants were assigned to the intervention, which featured group psychoeducation sessions, social events, and childcare. Method: This quasi-experimental study gathered preliminary evidence regarding whether the intervention promoted participants' (N = 70) parenting practices. Specifically, growth curve analyses using hierarchical linear modeling examined outcomes at completion (3 months) and follow-up (6 months). Results: Participants reported statistically significant improvements on key parenting practices at both postintervention time points. Conclusions: This study provides preliminary support for engaging court- and CPS-involved female IPV survivors in specialized, group-based interventions such as that investigated herein. Future research should investigate similar programs using larger samples and more robust designs.

AB  - The objective of this research project was to examine the effectiveness of sexual health promotion interventions in homeless drug using populations. The following databases were searched: Medline (1966 to 2003), EMBASE (1980 to 2003), PsycInfo (1985 to 2003), CINAHL (1982 to 2003), web of Science (1981 to 2003) & the Cochrane Library (Evidence Based health). Two independent researchers selected studies for inclusion. Inclusion criteria covered longitudinal studies using comparative statistics examining interventions to promote sexual health amongst homeless drug users. Studies excluding drug users from the study sample or where no mention was made of housing status were excluded. A narrative analysis of the papers was adopted to elicit common themes emerging from the studies. Of 99 papers identified, only 6 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Interventions which seek to effect attitudinal & behavioural change through interactive methods such as role-play, video games & group work led to a self-reported reduction in both risk from drugs & sexual activity. The evidence for maintenance of risk reduction over one year remains unclear. Interventions do not appear to promote risky sexual activity in previously sexually inactive participants.

AB  - Using both quantitative and qualitative approaches, I examined how women raising young children in poverty construct their understandings of well-being in this study. 60 low-income women with young children involved in daycare completed quantitative measures. 17 women were purposefully selected to participate in qualitative interviews. Participants varied in terms of age, race, educational level, income, employment, marital status, and number of children. Findings suggest that well-being among low-income women is differentiated into two components: the capacity to provide for one's self and children, 'making it,' and 'satisfaction,' the extent to which one's current life measures up to individually and socially-constructed notions of success. Participant responses suggest these differentiated understandings of well-being may have cultural as well as individual antecedents. Contrary to conventional wisdom and much social science research, one's debt-to-income ratio does not quantitatively predict well-being or satisfaction in this sample, suggesting that factors other than or in addition to economic interventions are necessary to foster the positive development and functioning of low-income mothers. Participants suggest that interventions aimed at improving their economic functioning often negatively impact their overall parenting efficacy, social functioning, and life satisfaction. Lower levels of life-satisfaction among more economically-stable participants in this study suggest a 'middle class effect.' These findings suggest that the process of developing one's sense of well-being is an interpretive one, with one's expectations for her life being most central to how she assesses her overall functioning and satisfaction. Expectations are shaped by the social and relational contexts in which they develop. Race, class, gender, perceptions of one's community, childhood experiences, and close relationships contribute to both risk and resilience in these women's lives. Negotiating these various components of their social ecologies require women to develop discrete skills, knowledge, and understanding for each domain. Participant responses suggest that feeling 'satisfied' requires complex coordination and integration of various self, relational, and contextual understandings. However, the capacity to integrate these understandings is often at odds with the skills and self-understandings required for women living in poverty to 'make it.' Negotiating these divergent standards of well-being place women at risk of psychological and social strain. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This article describes the impact of participating in a unique approach to positive youth development on a group of youths in out-of-home placements. The program provided young people with the opportunity to inform service providers and other adults about their experiences within the youth services system. Analyses of qualitative data identified seven arenas in which participating youths appeared to be influenced—initiation and growth, safety, connection, expression, personal impact, conflict and misbehavior, and opportunity to make a difference. Findings indicate that participants gained resiliency in the face of the adversities they had and continue to experience. Their life skills and competencies were enhanced. They developed a more positive outlook on life and a greater sense of self-efficacy and self-determination. Participation lessened their feelings of isolation, powerlessness, and apathy.

AB  - Purpose. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has been unevenly adopted into practice in Canada. In this qualitative study, the authors explored individual, institutional, and policy factors that may have influenced SLNB adoption. This information will guide interventions to improve SLNB implementation. Methods. Qualitative methodology was used to examine factors influencing SLNB adoption. Grounded theory guided data collection and analysis. Semistructured interviews were based on Roger's diffusion of innovation theory. Purposive and snowball sampling was used to identify participants. Semistructured telephone interviews were conducted with urban, rural, academic, and community health care providers and administrators to ensure all perspectives and motivations were explored. Two individuals independently analyzed data and achieved consensus on emerging themes and their relationship. Results. A total of 43 interviews were completed with 21 surgeons, 5 pathologists, 7 nuclear medicine physicians, and 10 administrators. Generated themes included awareness of SLNB with the exception of some administrators, acknowledged advantage of SLNB, SLNB compatibility with beliefs regarding axillary staging, acknowledgment that SLNB was a complex innovation to adopt, extensive trialing of SLNB prior to adoption, observable benefits with SLNB, acknowledgment that hospital-level administrative support enabled adoption, desire for a provincial policy supporting SLNB to assist in hospital-level adoption, requirement of a local high-volume breast surgery champion who communicated extensively with team to facilitate local adoption, and need for credentialing of SLNB to ensure quality. Conclusions. SLNB is a complex innovation to adopt. Successful adoption was assisted by a high-volume breast cancer surgical champion, interprofessional communication, and administrative support.

AB  - Aim: To explore the lived experience of the relationship between women with anorexia and their care workers in the context of a specialist eating disorder unit. .Method/ Methodology: This interpretive phenomenological study focuses on women with anorexia and their care workers in both day care and in-patient specialist eating disorder services in the UK. Van Manen's methodological and analytical approach was adopted for this study. Twelve women with anorexia and thirteen of their care workers (nurses, doctors, dieticians and therapists) participated in the study. Phase one was conducted in a day care service (October - November 2009). Phase two was conducted within an inpatient care unit (May June, 2011). Semi-structured interviews were conducted with all participants to explore their experience of the therapeutic relationship. Phase one data were thematically analysed, following which the full data set (phases one and two) was analysed as a whole, using MAXQDA as a tool for the organisation of the emerging themes. The initial themes were subsequently re-organised into themes and sub-themes through the lens of Merleau-Ponty's existential themes and Heideggers concept of authenticity. .Findings: The experience of the therapeutic relationship for women with anorexia and their workers cannot be viewed without fully acknowledging the impact of the anorexia, the anorexic identity, the context (the therapeutic landscape) in which this exists and the effect of time. Hence Merleau Ponty's existential lens provided a very suitable framework for the findings..Corporeality, the bodily experience, is integral to the lifeworld of both women and workers and reflects the primary goal of eating disorder services. Its associated sub-themes of 'identity', 'externalisation' and 'recovery measured in kilos' highlight how anorexia is integrated within the womens perception of their identity , as well as the care workers focus on weight restoration. Spatiality reflects the significance of space in the creation and experience of a TR; the sub-themes of 'lived space', 'the therapeutic landscape' and 'rules and regulations consider the contextual basis of care. The theme relationality focusses on the person-to-person encounters and included the sub-themes 'conflicting perspectives' and 'maternalism'. Finally, the time spent together was considered to be fundamental to the connection made between the women and the workers and so, within temporality, 'the gift of time' and 'availability' emerged as sub themes within the data. The fifth theme, 'authenticity' is pivotal to both the therapeutic relationship and also phenomenology and reflects Heideggers perception that authenticity is 'being one's self', for which honesty and truthfulness are essential components. Hence this last theme includes the sub-themes of 'the power and uniqueness of the individual', 'empathy for the worker' and 'trust'. Both the women and the care workers valued the relationship but the externalisation of the disorder created difficulties in the authenticity of the relationship. A temporary, maternalistic, nurturing approach was highly valued and recognised as only transitory..

AB  - Adoption is arguably the most powerful intervention available for children in foster care who are unable to be restored to their birth families. Adoption promises stability and a family for life, in contrast to foster care or guardianship, which are expected to end when the child reaches adulthood. In comparison to foster care, adoption is associated with better educational, financial, and social outcomes. However, because children adopted out of foster care have had adverse experiences, they may have additional support needs in later years. These unknown costs can be off-putting to potential adoptive parents, who may not be in the financial position to pay for costly services which may be needed to address trauma and support psychosocial functioning. To address this issue, countries such as the U.S., U.K., and the state of New South Wales in Australia have introduced adoption subsidies and allowances for adoptive families. This article suggests that financial supports for adoption could be extended by introducing Child Development Accounts for children adopted from foster care. Child Development Accounts have been used to encourage savings among youth in foster care and other target populations. These programs function by providing matched funds for purposes enabling positive development. The paper argues that Child Development Accounts for children adopted from care could potentially benefit a highly-vulnerable group of children and support them to access services and achieve more positive life outcomes.

AB  - Background: Callous‐unemotional (CU) traits are characterized by a lack of responsiveness to the emotions of others, particularly negative emotions. A parenting environment where the child's own distress emotions are sensitively responded to may help foster the child's ability to respond to the emotions of others. We tested whether maternal sensitivity to distress, and other parenting characteristics, were associated with CU traits over the preschool period, and examined whether this was mediated via infant attachment status. Method: In an epidemiological cohort, CU traits were assessed at age 2.5, 3.5, and 5.0 years by mother report. Dimensions of parenting were assessed in free play at age 29 weeks in a stratified subsample of 272, and attachment status at 14 months (n = 265). Structural equation modelling with maximum likelihood estimation was used to examine predictions from parenting dimensions and attachment status. Results: A parenting factor comprised of sensitivity to distress (n = 207), sensitivity to non‐distress, positive regard toward the infant (or warmth), and intrusiveness, predicted child CU traits (p = .023). This effect was accounted for mainly by sensitivity to distress (p = .008) and positive regard (p = .023) which showed a synergistic effect as evidenced by a significant interaction (p = .01). This arose because the combination of low sensitivity to distress and low positive regard created the risk for elevated CU traits. Although sensitivity and positive regard predicted attachment security and disorganization, there were no associations between attachment status and CU traits. Conclusions: The finding of contributions from both sensitivity to distress and positive regard to reduced CU traits suggests that children's responsiveness to others’ emotions may be increased by their own mothers’ responsiveness to them and their mothers’ warmth. There was no evidence that this was mediated via attachment status. Implications for intervention and future directions are discussed.

AB  - Student homelessness is unfortunately a prevalent and growing issue nation-wide. Current estimates suggest that over one million youth are homeless in the U.S. at any given time and the prevalence of student homelessness continues to increase each year. Research indicates that homeless youth are at a greater risk for high stress and experiencing adverse life events. In turn, they are even more at risk for related psychological and academic impairments. Many homeless youth are impacted by mental health issues, including high levels of anxiety, stress, and depression. Additionally, youth affected by anxiety and stress often experience significant impairments in their academic and psychological functioning. The current study examined the relationship between anxiety and related psychological and academic functioning was positively or negatively impacted by a youth's coping style. In the current study, psychological functioning was defined as the presence of depressive symptoms while academic functioning includes both a sense of school connectedness and current grade point average. Results showed that coping skills do not impact the relationship between anxious homeless youth and their psychosocial and academic outcomes. However, findings suggest that a greater sense of school connectedness is associated with more positive academic and psychosocial outcomes. The study provides better insight for school personnel, psychologists, and mental health workers when providing services and interventions for homeless youth. Specifically, suggestions for further research and recommendations for fostering and implementing a greater sense of school connectedness within the school system are given.

AB  - One in 30 American children experience homelessness, and yet educators are often unaware of the challenges these students face. Drawing on a qualitative study of 21 pre-service teachers (PSTs) interviewed at the completion of their early childhood/ESL teacher education program, the overall purpose of this study was to ascertain PSTs' reported attitudes, beliefs, knowledge, and self-identified skills for working with young homeless children in schools with the goal of identifying opportunities for teacher education programs to better prepare PSTs for work with children experiencing homelessness. Findings suggest that PSTs enter teacher preparation with many misconceptions about children and families experiencing homelessness. Incorporating specific information about homelessness into coursework and supervision, nurturing PSTs' capacity for critical self-reflection, and creating opportunities for PSTs to develop positive teacher–student relationships with children experiencing homelessness were identified as essential in fostering PST self-efficacy, and, by extension, the resilience of homeless children. By illuminating the processes through which PSTs make sense of children's experiences of homelessness and its impacts on schooling, these findings have important implications for the education of young children and the design of professional development opportunities and structured learning for preservice teachers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Definitive surgery with total mesorectal excision is the mainstay of treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer. Multimodality therapy improves long-term survival. Current standards advise neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by radical surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. Nationally, compliance with adjuvant chemotherapy is only 32%. New research evaluates the effectiveness of total neoadjuvant therapy: complete chemotherapy and chemoradiation before surgery. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine the favored treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer by comparing the cost-effectiveness of total neoadjuvant therapy and the current standard of care. DESIGN: Decision analytical modeling using long-term costs and 5-year disease-free survival was performed to determine the cost-effectiveness after total neoadjuvant therapy and the current standard of care. Sensitivity analysis was used to investigate the effect of uncertainty in model parameters. SETTINGS: Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services billing data perspective was adopted and outcomes modeled according to local and national databases and literature consensus. PATIENTS: Adult patients with stage II or III rectal cancer were selected. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost-effectiveness in disease-free life-years, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, and net monetary benefit were determined over a 5-year posttreatment period. The favored strategy was determined based on cost-effectiveness and sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Cost-effectiveness for total neoadjuvant therapy was 40,708 $/life-year, and, for conventional therapy, cost-effectiveness was 44,248 $/life-year. Sensitivity analysis showed that, for an estimated total neoadjuvant therapy completion rate of 90%, total neoadjuvant therapy would remain the dominant strategy for any adjuvant chemotherapy completion rate of less than 93%. LIMITATIONS: The samples used to calculate completion rates are small, and survival probabilities are based on existing literature, local database values, and consensus estimates. The model encompasses a 5-year time period from diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Cost-effectiveness analysis shows that a strategy of total neoadjuvant therapy followed by radical surgery is favored over the current standard of care for locally advanced rectal cancer. Sensitivity analysis shows that a low rate of adjuvant chemotherapy administration plays a key role in decreasing the cost-effectiveness of the current standard of care.

AB  - Lymphodepletion before adoptive cell transfer (ACT)-based immunotherapies call enhance anti-tumor responses by augmenting innate immunity, by increasing access to homeostatic cytokines, and by depressing the numbers of regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Although it is clear that high-dose total body irradiation given together with, hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation effectively enhances ACT, the relationship between the intensity of lymphodepletion and tumor treatment efficacy has not been systematically studied. Using the pmel-1 Mouse model of self/tumor-reactive CD8(+) T cells, we observed a strong correlation between the intensity of the conditioning regimen and the efficacy of ACT-based treatments using linear regression analysis. This was the case for preparative total body irradiation administered either as a single dose (R-2 = 0.97, P<0.001) or in fractionated doses (R-2=0.94, P<0.001). Increased amounts of preparative total body irradiation were directly correlated with progressively more favorable ratios of transferred tumor-reactive CD8(+) T cells toward endogenous cells with the potential for inhibitory activity including: CD4(+) cells (potentially T regulatory cells); Grl(+) cells (which are capable of functioning as myeloid-derived suppressor cells); and endogenous CD8(+) and natural killer 1.1(+) cells (that can act as ``sinks{''} for homeostatic cytokines in the postablative setting). With increasing ablation, we also observed elevated lipopolysaccharide levels in the sera and heightened levels of systemic inflammatory cytokines. Thus, increased intensity lymphodepletion triggers enhanced tumor treatment efficacy and the benefits of high-dose total body irradiation must be titrated against its risks.

AB  - The major purpose of this paper was to develop a model for the use of complementary and alternative health care options. Chinese-American families were selected due to their large proportion among all ethnic populations in the United States. Andersen's (1973 and 1995) perception of predisposing and enabling was adopted to test study variables singly and interactively on their health care use. The dependent variable was defined as health behavior preference towards Chinese treatment (also known as complementary and alternative medicine treatment) or Western treatment, and a combination of Chinese and Western treatment (also known as integrative medicine treatment). Data were randomly collected from 240 adult Chinese-American respondents out of 1080 members of the Chinese American Association in the greater Cleveland area. Findings both in the full and partial research models reveal that the factors contributing the most to their medical preferences were their acculturation level and health beliefs. Inter-generational differences in health care use were also discussed.

AB  - The history of vocationalism constitutes a struggle over the aims of education. Should compulsory public education offer students preparation for the labor market or should it offer the liberal education suited to the preparation of informed and ethical citizens? John Dewey attempted to transcend this either-or dichotomy and argued for practice-based education. However, social efficiency advocates such as David Snedden, who argued for separating vocational training from academic education, created the differentiated curriculum of the modern comprehensive high school. In the 1990's, new vocationalism began the revival of the Deweyan ideal of occupations as a vehicle for mental training beyond specific job skills. Does the integrated new vocational curricular model offer the dual benefits of both college and career as advocates claim? Reviewing the history of American vocationalism in the last 150 years, this thesis demonstrates both the commonalities of and the differences between the new vocationalism and the earlier Deweyan ideal. Then in order to assess the claim that the new vocationalism fosters liberal learning, I evaluate an instance of new vocationalism, career academies, using complementary methods. With the growth and success of career academies, the need arises for quality control through effective program implementation evaluation. For the first time, I developed two-level hierarchical linear models to examine program implementation metrics and their relation to outcome measures. These results indicate implementation matters and were presented by David Stern and myself in May 2004 at the Russell Sage conference on school-to-work research and practice (currently under review for publication). As another original contribution, I developed the conception of a problem image, a mental model of the students' reconstruction of the task, to understand the problem solving strategies of career academy students and their non-academy counterparts. The study finds that career academy students have equal or superior performance in a variety of outcome measures, including attendance, cumulative GPA, and problem image characterization. In particular, career academy students' problem images have greater instances of specificity and analogical reasoning than non-academy students. In conclusion, this thesis demonstrates the theoretical and practical potential of the Deweyan vision of education that combines work and learning.

AB  - Objectives: Successful psychiatric rehabilitation entails fostering overall quality of life of individuals recovering from severe mental illnesses. Understanding how service-related perceptions may be related to quality of life can be useful in improving the effectiveness of community-based care. This study investigated the quality of life of mental health consumers using a service-oriented paradigm. Methods: 162 mental health consumers from community-based psychiatric rehabilitation centers were interviewed. Analyses were conducted to investigate the relationships between service perceptions (perceived treatment coercion, rehabilitation needs, and continuity of care) and quality of life. Results: Physical health quality was negatively related to rehabilitation needs. Mental health quality was negatively related to both rehabilitation needs and poorer continuity of service. Life satisfaction was negatively related to poorer continuity of service and higher perceived treatment coercion. Conclusions: This study highlighted the significance of service perceptions in the well-being of individuals with severe mental illness. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Introduction The prevalence of comorbid diabetes and depression is high, especially in low-income Hispanic or Latino patients. The complex mix of factors in safety-net care systems impedes the adoption of evidence-based collaborative depression care and results in persistent disparities in depression outcomes. The Diabetes-Depression Care-Management Adoption Trial examined whether the collaborative depression care model is an effective approach in safety-net clinics to improve clinical care outcomes of depression and diabetes. Methods A sample of 964 patients with diabetes from 5 safety-net clinics were enrolled in a quasi-experimental study that included 2 arms: usual care, in which primary medical providers and staff translated and adopted evidence-based depression care; and supportive care, in which providers of a disease management program delivered protocol-driven depression care. Because the study design established individual treatment centers as separate arms, we calculated propensity scores that interpreted the probability of treatment assignment conditional on observed baseline characteristics. Primary outcomes were 5 depression care outcomes and 7 diabetes care measures. Regression models with propensity score covariate adjustment were applied to analyze 6-month outcomes. Results Compared with usual care, supportive care significantly decreased Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores, reduced the number of patients with moderate or severe depression, improved depression remission, increased satisfaction in care for patients with emotional problems, and significantly reduced functional impairment. Conclusion Implementing collaborative depression care in a diabetes disease management program is a scalable approach to improve depression outcomes and patient care satisfaction among patients with diabetes in a safety-net care system.

AB  - Background: Past and repeated self-harm are long-term risks to completed suicide. A brief rating scale to assess repetition risk of self-harm is important for high-risk identification and early interventions in suicide prevention. The study aimed to examine the validity of the Chinese SAD PERSONS Scale (CSPS) and to evaluate its feasibility in clinical settings. Methods: One hundred and forty-seven patients with self-harm were recruited from the Emergency Department and assessed at baseline and the sixth month. The controls, 284 people without self-harm from the Family Medicine Department in the same hospital were recruited and assessed concurrently. The psychometric properties of the CSPS were examined using baseline and follow-up measurements that assessed a variety of suicide risk factors. Clinical feasibility and applicability of the CSPS were further evaluated by a group of general nurses who used case vignette approach in CSPS risk assessment in clinical settings. An open-ended question inquiring their opinions of scale adaptation to hospital inpatient assessment for suicide risks were also analyzed using content analysis. Results: The CSPS was significantly correlated with other scales measuring depression, hopelessness and suicide ideation. A cut-off point of the scale was at 4/5 in predicting 6-month self-harm repetition with the sensitivity and specificity being 65.4% and 58.1%, respectively. Based on the areas under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curves, the predictive validity of the scale showed a better performance than the other scales. Fifty-four nurses, evaluating the scale using case vignette found it a useful tool to raise the awareness of suicide risk and a considerable tool to be adopted into nursing care. Conclusions: The Chinese SAD PERSONS Scale is a brief instrument with acceptable psychometric properties for self-harm prediction. However, cautions should be paid to level of therapeutic relationships during assessment, staff workload and adequate training for wider clinical applications.

AB  - Introduction: The prevalence of comorbid diabetes and depression is high, especially in low-income Hispanic or Latino patients. The complex mix of factors in safety-net care systems impedes the adoption of evidence-based collaborative depression care and results in persistent disparities in depression outcomes. The Diabetes-Depression Care-Management Adoption Trial examined whether the collaborative depression care model is an effective approach in safety-net clinics to improve clinical care outcomes of depression and diabetes.Methods: A sample of 964 patients with diabetes from 5 safety-net clinics were enrolled in a quasi-experimental study that included 2 arms: usual care, in which primary medical providers and staff translated and adopted evidence-based depression care; and supportive care, in which providers of a disease management program delivered protocol-driven depression care. Because the study design established individual treatment centers as separate arms, we calculated propensity scores that interpreted the probability of treatment assignment conditional on observed baseline characteristics. Primary outcomes were 5 depression care outcomes and 7 diabetes care measures. Regression models with propensity score covariate adjustment were applied to analyze 6-month outcomes.Results: Compared with usual care, supportive care significantly decreased Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores, reduced the number of patients with moderate or severe depression, improved depression remission, increased satisfaction in care for patients with emotional problems, and significantly reduced functional impairment.Conclusion: Implementing collaborative depression care in a diabetes disease management program is a scalable approach to improve depression outcomes and patient care satisfaction among patients with diabetes in a safety-net care system.

AB  - Aim To identify the optimal strategy for gastric cancer (GC) prevention by evaluating the cost-effectiveness of esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)-based preventive strategies. Methods We conducted a model-based cost-effectiveness analysis. Adopting a healthcare payer's perspective, Markov models simulated the clinical experience of the target population (Singaporean Chinese 50-69 years old) undergoing endoscopic screening, endoscopic surveillance and usual care of do-nothing. The screening strategy examined the cohort every alternate year whereas the surveillance strategy provided annual EGD only to people with precancerous lesions. For each strategy, discounted lifetime costs ($) and quality adjusted life years (QALY) were estimated and compared to generate incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify influential parameters and quantify the impact of model uncertainties. Results Annual EGD surveillance with an ICER of $34 200/QALY was deemed cost-effective for GC prevention within the Singapore healthcare system. To inform implementation, the models identified six influential factors and their respective thresholds, namely discount rate (<4.20%), age of starting surveillance (>51.6 years), proportion of program cost in delivering endoscopy (<65%), cost of follow-up EGD (<$484), utility of stage 1 GC patients (>0.72) and odds ratio of GC for high-risk subjects (>3.93). The likelihood that surveillance is the most cost-effective strategy is 69.5% accounting for model uncertainties. Conclusion Endoscopic surveillance of gastric premalignancies can be a cost-effective strategy for GC prevention. Its implementation requires careful assessment on factors influencing the actual cost-effectiveness.

AB  - We explored the relationships among patients’ and family members’ (FMs) health literacy, heart failure (HF) knowledge, and self-care behaviors using baseline data from HF patients and their FMs (N = 113 pairs) in a trial of a self-care intervention. Measures included Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine, Atlanta HF Knowledge Test, a heart failure Medication Adherence Scale, and sodium intake (24-hr urine and 3-day food record). Patients with low health literacy (LHL) were more likely to have lower HF knowledge (p < .001) and trended to poorer medication adherence (p = .077) and higher sodium intake (p = .072). When FMs had LHL, FMs were more likely to have lower HF knowledge (p = .001) and patients trended toward higher sodium intake (p = .067). When both patients and FMs had LHL, lowest HF knowledge and poorest medication adherence were observed (p < .027). The health literacy of both patient and FM needs to be considered when designing interventions to foster self-care. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Comorbid depression is a significant challenge for safety-net primary care systems. Team-based collaborative depression care is effective, but complex system factors in safety-net organizations impede adoption and result in persistent disparities in outcomes. Diabetes-Depression Care-management Adoption Trial (DCAT) evaluated whether depression care could be significantly improved by harnessing information and communication technologies to automate routine screening and monitoring of patient symptoms and treatment adherence and allow timely communication with providers. Objective: The aim of this study was to compare 6-month outcomes of a technology-facilitated care model with a usual care model and a supported care model that involved team-based collaborative depression care for safety-net primary care adult patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods: DCAT is a translational study in collaboration with Los Angeles County Department of Health Services, the second largest safety-net care system in the United States. A comparative effectiveness study with quasi-experimental design was conducted in three groups of adult patients with type 2 diabetes to compare three delivery models: usual care, supported care, and technology-facilitated care. Six-month outcomes included depression and diabetes care measures and patient-reported outcomes. Comparative treatment effects were estimated by linear or logistic regression models that used generalized propensity scores to adjust for sampling bias inherent in the nonrandomized design. Results: DCAT enrolled 1406 patients (484 in usual care, 480 in supported care, and 442 in technology-facilitated care), most of whom were Hispanic or Latino and female. Compared with usual care, both the supported care and technology-facilitated care groups were associated with significant reduction in depressive symptoms measured by scores on the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (least squares estimate, LSE: usual care=6.35, supported care=5.05, technology-facilitated care=5.16; P value: supported care vs usual care=.02, technology-facilitated care vs usual care=.02); decreased prevalence of major depression (odds ratio, OR: supported care vs usual care=0.45, technology-facilitated care vs usual care=0.33; P value: supported care vs usual care=.02, technology-facilitated care vs usual care=.007); and reduced functional disability as measured by Sheehan Disability Scale scores (LSE: usual care=3.21, supported care=2.61, technology-facilitated care=2.59; P value: supported care vs usual care=.04, technology-facilitated care vs usual care=. 03). Technology-facilitated care was significantly associated with depression remission (technology-facilitated care vs usual care: OR=2.98, P=.04); increased satisfaction with care for emotional problems among depressed patients (LSE: usual care=3.20, technology-facilitated care=3.70; P=.05); reduced total cholesterol level (LSE: usual care=176.40, technology-facilitated care=160.46; P=.01); improved satisfaction with diabetes care (LSE: usual care=4.01, technology-facilitated care=4.20; P=.05); and increased odds of taking an glycated hemoglobin test (technology-facilitated care vs usual care: OR=3.40, P<.001). Conclusions: Both the technology-facilitated care and supported care delivery models showed potential to improve 6-month depression and functional disability outcomes. The technology-facilitated care model has a greater likelihood to improve depression remission, patient satisfaction, and diabetes care quality.

AB  - The recent years witnessed a sharp drop in China’s demographic dividend; therefore, some reform measures about China’s fertility policy have been adopted to optimize population structures and to maintain demographic dividend. However, our simulation results reveal that the new two-child fertility policy cannot effectively deal with population ageing, and that China’s fertility policy needs further adjustment. Specifically, we find that the new two-child fertility policy will deteriorate demographic dividend before 2050, through combination of simulation results and formula derivation. Aiming to stabilize demographic dividend at ideal range all the time, we build nonlinear integer programming model to propose an appropriate reforming path for China’s fertility policy. Then, we simulate and compare demographic developments under the proposed reforming path with those under three possible fertility policies: one-child, two-child and no fertility restriction, verifying that the proposed reforming path has better performance on stabilizing demographic dividend than these three fertility policies have. Finally, sensitivity analysis of upper bound of research interval is conducted to evaluate the effect of the upper bound on proposed reforming path. Based on these results, we suggest that China should continue to execute current strict fertility policy before 2032, then begin to relax it gradually especially during 2036-2041, and completely cancel fertility policy after 2065.

AB  - This study presents findings on the physics identity development of female students in the German Physics Olympiad who participated in an intervention designed to support their engagement in physics. Enrichment programs such as the Physics Olympiad have been found to positively impact students' engagement and intent to pursue a career in science. However, many enrichment programs, including the Physics Olympiad, suffer from an underrepresentation of young women. The intervention investigated in this study capitalizes on gender-related research in physics education in order to explore ways in which gender equity can be raised in enrichment programs. To this end, we designed an identity-safe learning environment that facilitates participating young women's physics identity development. For example, same-sex groupings and considerately adopted physics contents that particularly acknowledge young women's interests (e.g., relation to medical issues and the human body) were utilized. Overall, 30 Olympians took part in a one-day intervention (13 females, 17 males). Positive effects in two important physics identity constructs, namely, interest and competence, for young women were found, while at the same time no effects were found for young men. Furthermore, the young women were more likely to participate in next year's Physics Olympiad, compared to the overall female Physics Olympiad population. These results indicate that the careful design of an intervention based on gender research and science identity theory can support young women's physics identity development.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Most studies showed that patients would first go to their primary care physicians (PCPs) when depressed. This choice is probably due to PCP being the entry point into the health care system. We studied the general population's initial choice of mental care in Hong Kong, where patients were unclear about family medicine and free to choose doctors of any specialty. METHODS: A combined qualitative and quantitative approach was adopted. We held focus groups with participants recruited from community centers and a telephone survey with adults ages 18 or above randomly selected from the domestic telephone directory. RESULTS: Of 1,647 adults successfully interviewed, 49.0% would seek help from their regular PCP, 19.3% from psychiatrists, 4.8% from any doctors, 16.5% from non-medical resources; 6.9% would not seek any help, and 3.5% were uncertain of what to do. Those who did not seek any help were more likely to be male or without regular doctors. The focus group participants highlighted the stigmatizing effect of consulting psychiatrists and expressed strong expectation of empathic relationship, time, and communication skills from their care providers. Some participants were not aware that PCP could manage mental illness. CONCLUSIONS: Given free choice of health care service, most people would first consult their regular doctors for treatment of depression specifically because of better relationship and no stigmatization. To draw depressed patients to seek help, especially from primary care, public education of the PCPs role in mental health should be promoted, and the PCPs could demonstrate their empathy and listening skills to patients.

AB  - Based on the magnitude of the problem and its association with a range of health outcomes, childhood sexual abuse (CSA) has been identified as a significant public health challenge by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and its prevention has been listed as a priority concern (Hammond, 2003). Several experts have recommended using a public health approach to CSA prevention (e.g., Anderson, Mangels, & Langsam, 2004; Kaufman, Barber, Mosher, & Carter, 2002; Krugman, 1998; McMahon & Puett, 1999; Mercy, 1999). A public health model portrays sexual abuse as a disease and attempts to alter the interaction between agent (perpetrator), host (victim), and environment (community, society). With this approach, the problem is defined, risk and protective factors are identified, prevention strategies are developed and evaluated, and effective strategies are then adopted. The public health approach also advocates a focus on primary prevention strategies. An ecological approach is highly compatible with a public health framework. In the public health field, consensus has emerged that the etiology of many health problems arise from multiple levels, and, therefore, interventions focused on a single level of influence are limited (Wandersman & Florin, 2003). Applying this heuristic to CSA, preventing the occurrence of child sexual victimization can be done by educating parents, children, schools, and the community at large about CSA. Previous efforts to prevent CSA have primarily focused on educating children, less frequently on informing parents/caretakers, and infrequently on modifying environments in which CSA occurs. This chapter reviews primary prevention efforts directed at these three targets (i.e., youth, parents, and community). The need for prevention efforts is demonstrated, and empirical findings about effectiveness are presented. Challenges to comprehensive prevention efforts are described, and suggestions for expansion of interventions are offered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Integrated pest management (IPM) has been widely promoted in the developing world, but in many regions its adoption rates have been variable. Experience has shown that to ensure IPM adoption, the complexities of local agro-production systems and context-specific folk knowledge need to be appreciated. Our research explored the linkages between farmer knowledge, pest management decision making, and ecological attributes of subsistence maize agriculture. We report a case study from four rural communities in the highlands of southeast Honduras. Communities were typified by their agro-environments, IPM training history, and levels of infestation by a key maize pest, the fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda Smith). Although variable, infestation levels generally did not justify pest management intervention. Consequently, crop losses from this pest were considered of low importance and most farmers proceeded in a rational fashion by refraining from action in their fields. Farmers attributed the low degree of pest infestation predominantly to abiotic causal factors (rainfall, temperature). The role of natural enemies in controlling this pest (i.e., biological control) was deemed of low importance by farmers; nevertheless, a broad array of such organisms was mentioned by farmers as operating in their maize crop. Farmers' knowledge of natural enemies only partially matched scientific knowledge and was associated with the ecological features of their respective field settings. Local knowledge about natural enemies was mainly restricted to abundant and easily observable predatory species. Farmers who were knowledgeable about biological control were also familiar with a larger variety of pest management alternatives than uninformed farmers. Management options covered a wide range of curative techniques, including conservation biological control. Farmers who relied on insecticides to manage pest outbreaks knew less about biological control and pesticide alternatives. In contrast, farmers who received IPM training mentioned more types of natural enemies and were familiar with a broader range of alternative pest management tactics. Our research suggests that IPM training modifies local knowledge to better fit its environmental context. This paper provides insights in the environmental context of local agro-ecological knowledge and its linkage with pest management decision making. It also constitutes a basis for modifying IPM extension programs to deliver locality-specific technologies while strengthening the local knowledge base.

AB  - Background: Constructs such as personal recovery, patient engagement and consumer involvement are central in mental health care delivery. These approaches emphasise the importance of empowerment and choice. Aims: Under some circumstances Involuntary Treatment Orders (ITO) allow a person to be treated for a mental illness without their consent. This study explores the tensions between the principles of empowerment and control and involuntary treatment. Methods: Twenty-five involuntary inpatients of a major teaching hospital were interviewed about their experiences of being placed under an ITO. The interviews were analysed thematically. Results: Being able to have some sense of agency and re-asserting personal control are critical components of an involuntary mental health admission. Participants wanted information about their treatment, the ITO process and their environment. They also spoke about the importance of a space where they felt safe from themselves and others to make sense of the experience. Conclusions: This study suggests that for coercive treatment to aid, rather than disrupt recovery, treatment services need to focus on: the provision of rights; the creation of a sense of safety; establishing supportive relationships; carrying hope and finding ways to foster a strong sense of agency and empowerment.

AB  - Background: Provision of complementary therapy services within the NHS is scarce and contested. However, their adoption may be more likely in a service model that is designed to the specifications of clinicians and Primary Care Trust (PCT) managers. Our objective was to identify the features of a `NHS friendly' service to inform service designers who wish to develop NHS complementary therapy services. Methods: Using a case study approach, two sites offering complementary therapies on NHS premises were studied using interview and documentary data. We conducted interviews with 20 NHS professionals, including PCT managers and clinicians. We used descriptive content analysis to analyse interview data. We collected and analysed documentation, such as referral data, funding bids and evaluations, to compare reported and documented behaviour. Results: Ideally, a `NHS friendly' complementary therapy service should offer a limited number of therapies for a specific condition for high priority patient populations (e.g. acupuncture for addictions). In this service model, the therapies should be perceived to have `good' evidence for conditions where there are `effectiveness gaps' (i.e. current treatments are limited). The service should be evaluated and regularly promoted. Inter-professional relationships would flourish through opportunities for informal contact and formal interactions, such as observations of consultations. However, the service should include gatekeeper mechanisms to control demand and avoid picking up `unmet need' (i.e. individuals currently not accessing NHS services). The complementary therapy service should pay for itself and reduce NHS costs elsewhere, such as hospital admissions. Conclusion: The service design model identified in this study is problematic. For example, it is contradictory to provide specific interventions for specific conditions within a holistic healthcare framework. It is difficult to avoid providing for `unmet need' while concurrently filling `effectiveness gaps'. In addition, demonstrating the impact of a community service on reducing hospital admissions is challenging. Those seeking to establish a NHS complementary therapy service might be well-advised to meet as many of the criteria of a `NHS friendly' model as possible, recognising that its full realisation may be impossible. However, during periods of innovation and financial security, some relaxation of expectations may occur.

AB  - Background Opioid prescription management is challenging for orthopaedic surgeons, and we lack evidence-based guidelines for responsible opioid prescribing. Our institution recently developed opioid prescription guidelines for patients undergoing several common orthopaedic procedures including TKA and THA in an effort to reduce and standardize prescribing patterns. Questions/purposes (1) How do opioid prescriptions at discharge and 30-day refill rates change in opioid-naive patients undergoing primary TKA and THA before and after implementation of a novel prescribing guideline strategy? (2) What patient, surgical, and in-hospital factors influence opioid prescription quantity and refill rate? Methods New institutional guidelines for patients undergoing TKA and THA recommend a maximum postoperative prescription of 400 oral morphine equivalents (OME), comparable to 50 tablets of 5 mg oxycodone or 80 tablets of 50 mg tramadol. All opioid-naive patients, defined as those who did not take any opioids within 90 days preceding surgery, undergoing primary TKA and THA at a single tertiary care institution were evaluated from program initiation on August 1, 2017, through December 31, 2017, as the postguideline era cohort. This group (n = 751 patients) was compared with all opioid-naive patients undergoing TKA and THA from 2016 at the same institution (n = 1822 patients). Some providers were early adopters of the guidelines as they were being developed, which is why January to July 2017 was not evaluated. Patients in the preguideline and postguideline eras were not different in terms of age, sex, race, body mass index, education level, employment status, psychiatric illness, marital status, smoking history, outpatient use of benzodiazepines or gabapentinoids, or diagnoses of diabetes mellitus, peripheral neuropathy, or cancer. The primary outcome assessed was adherence to the new guidelines with a secondary outcome of opioid medication refills ordered within 30 days from any provider. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performedwith outcomes of guideline compliance and refills and adjusted for demographic, surgical, and patient care factors. Patients were followed for 30 days after surgery and no patients were lost to followup. Results Median opioid prescription and range of prescriptions decreased in the postguideline era compared with the preguideline era (750 OME, interquartile range {[}IQR] 575-900OME versus 388OME, IQR350-389; difference of medians = 362 OME; p < 0.001). There was no difference among patients undergoing TKA before and after guideline implementation in terms of the 30-day refill rate (35% {[}349 of 1011] versus 35% {[}141 of 399]; p = 0.77); this relationship was similar among patient undergoing THA (16% {[}129 of 811] versus 17% {[}61 of 352]; p = 0.55). After controlling for relevant patient-level factors, we found that implementation of an institutional guideline was the strongest factor associated with a prescription of # 400 OME (adjusted odds ratio, 36; 95% confidence interval, 25-52; p < 0.001); although a number of patient-level factors also were associated with prescription quantity, the effect sizes were much smaller. Conclusions This study provides a proof of concept that institutional guidelines to reduce postoperative opioid prescribing can improve aftercare in patients undergoing arthroplasty in a short period of time. The current report evaluates our experience with the first 5 months of this program; therefore, longer term data will be mandatory to determine longitudinal guideline adherence and whether the cutoffs established by this pilot initiative require further refinement for individual procedures.

AB  - Though behavioral parent training (BPT) is a successful psychosocial intervention for children's attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; Pelham & Fabiano, 2008), poor uptake and participation by parents are formidable barriers that impact its effectiveness. Three service delivery questions that have received attention are (1) whether group versus individual BPT options are preferred by parents; (2) whether different media-based programs are predicted to be preferable; and (3) whether educational or skill-based programs are predicted to be preferable. To understand how these factors might influence treatment utilization for families of ADHD, a series of three studies examining parents' preferences for the following types of parent programs were conducted: a group behavioral parenting program versus an individual behavioral parenting program versus an 'Opt Out' alternative (Study 1); a self-directed/internet program versus a bibliotherapy program versus a video-group program (Study 2); and an educational program versus a skills-enhancing program versus an 'Opt Out' alternative (Study 3). Conjoint analysis was used to study preferences for varieties and elements of BPT among parents of children at risk for ADHD. Preferences of 445 parents who sought Children's Mental Health services in Ontario, Canada were examined using a discrete choice experiment composed of 30, partial-profile, conjoint-choice tasks. Each conjoint task described 20, 4-level attributes (i.e., elements) of BPT content, process/delivery, and outcome. Participants made choices between three options composed of experimentally varied combinations of study attribute levels. Sawtooth's Hierarchical Bayes (CBC/HB) program was used to estimate the response of each parent to all possible attribute combinations (Orme, 2006; Sawtooth Software, 2004b). In each study, three varieties of behavioral parenting programs were modeled, standardized (zero-centered) utility values for each attribute level were computed, and importance scores were calculated. Utility values measured the relative influence of each attribute level on choices of parents; importance scores measured the priority assigned to each attribute relative to others in parents' choices. Results from Study 1 suggested that most parents (59%) were predicted to prefer an individual behavioral parent program; these parents were interested in understanding—not solving—their child's behavior problems and wanted services that would foster confidence. Results from Study 2 revealed that half of the parents (50%) were predicted to prefer a bibliotherapy option making it the most popular program; these parents were interested in understanding their child's emotional and behavior problems as long as meetings occurred individually. Results from Study 3 suggested that most parents (68%) were predicted to prefer a skills-enhancing program over alternatives. Findings are considered with respect to the transtheoretical model of change (Prochaska & DiClemente, 1983) and the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1991). Implications regarding possible redesign of behavioral parenting programs for different subgroups of parents with ADHD children are considered.

AB  - The study examined the differences in parenting styles between substance abusing parents and non-substance abusing parents. This quantitative study determined if there was a significant difference in styles of parenting between both groups. The study was comprised of (151) female participants, 76 (substance abusers) and 75 (non-substance abusers). All of the participants were the primary caregivers of their child or children. Each participant completed a questionnaire consisting of 4 scales, PARQ/Control (Parental Acceptance and Rejection Questionnaire which consisted of a built in control scale; DAST (Drug Abuse Screening Test); LDI (Life Distress Index), and the S-MAST (Short Version of the Michigan Alcohol Screening Test). Also each participant completed the personal information data sheet that included 4 questions pertaining to mental health issues. Each participant signed a consent form indicating a willingness to participate in the study. The two groups were selected from different settings. The substance abuse group consisted of participants from outpatient substance abuse treatment programs and the comparison group consisted of participants from various venues such as daycare centers and a church. All of the participants were selected from the same geographic areas in the Bronx, Manhattan, Queens and Westchester Counties. The findings of the study indicated there was no significant difference in parenting styles between the substance abusing and non-substance abusing groups. There were two significant findings. First, substance abusing mothers scored higher than the non-substance abusing mothers on the Life Distress Index. Second, mothers who reported having depression were more likely to reject their children compared to mothers who reported suffering from anxiety. The rationale and purpose of the study was to provide empirical data and more insight regarding the association between parenting styles and substance abuse. This study hoped to help identify potential at risk families and provide the appropriate interventions, to help minimize the risk of harm to a child, while reducing the substantial number of children being placed in the foster care system.

AB  - Study Question: How can the decision process for fertility preservation (FP) in adolescents and prepubertal boys be improved based on patient and parent feelings about FP counseling? Summary Answer: The content of information given to patients and parents and hope for future parenthood appeared to positively impact on the decision to preserve fertility in the pediatric population and, therefore, deserves special attention to improve FP care. What Is Known Already: A vast body of literature on adult cancer patients shows that reproductive capacity is a major quality-of-life issue. Patients also have a strong desire to be informed of available FP options with a view to future parenthood of their own genetic child, considering that <10% chose to adopt or used donated gametes. Furthermore, the quality of fertility counseling provided at the time of cancer diagnosis has been identified as a crucial factor in the decision-making process. By contrast, in the pediatric population, while it was shown that parents were able to make an informed and voluntary decision for their prepubertal sons despite the heavy emotional burden at the time of diagnosis, there is so far very limited information on patient expectations regarding FP. A lack of awareness often equates to suboptimal care by oncologists and FP specialists, and poor access to FP, therefore improving knowledge and identifying the expectations of pediatric patients and their parents are crucial for optimizing multidisciplinary collaborative care pathways (MCCPs), including counseling and access to FP methods, in the youngest population. Study Design, Size, Duration: A questionnaire survey was posted to an eligible population between May 2005 and May 2013. Participants/materials, Setting, Methods: A total of 348 prepubertal boys and adolescents aged 0-18 years, diagnosed with cancer in a university hospital setting, were eligible. Three different questionnaires for two age groups of children (<12 and 12-18 years) and parents were established based on information from focus groups. Questions were subsequently reviewed by the institutional ethics board before being sent. Main Results and the Role Of Chance: Of the 348 eligible patients, 44 died and 14 were lost to follow-up. Thus, 290 patients (77 aged 12-18 years and 213 aged <12 years) were sent a questionnaire. In total, 120 questionnaires were recovered, 45.5% (n = 35/77) from adolescents and 39.9% (n = 85/213) from children. FP acceptance rates were, respectively, 74 and 78.6% for boys aged <12 and 12-18 years. The content of information provided to patients and parents appeared to positively impact on the decision to preserve fertility (P = 0.04). While the majority of boys aged >12 years considered the information to be clear (72%), complete (80%) and understandable (90.9%), only 33.3% of boys aged <12 years were able to comprehend the information. Pressure from doctors to reduce the delay between diagnosis and cancer treatment increased the number of refusals (P<0.01), while hope for future parenthood favored acceptance (P < 0.01). Family support was considered important for 75% of adolescents and 58% of children, and medical support for 50% of adolescents and 42% of children. Limitations, Reason For Caution: This single-center survey does not allow extrapolation of the information to other settings. Recall bias and lack of full external validation of the questionnaires are further limitations. Modification of the current MCCP should be further evaluated according to our results. Wider Implications Of the Findings: Acknowledging the issues faced and familiarizing oneself with the care of patients undergoing fertility-threatening therapies supply primary care providers with the appropriate quality management tools in the field of FP in centers for reproductive medicine. Expectations reported in the survey allow appropriate support to be included within the MCCP design.

AB  - <bold>Study Question: </bold>How can the decision process for fertility preservation (FP) in adolescents and prepubertal boys be improved based on patient and parent feelings about FP counseling? <bold>Summary Answer: </bold>The content of information given to patients and parents and hope for future parenthood appeared to positively impact on the decision to preserve fertility in the pediatric population and, therefore, deserves special attention to improve FP care. <bold>What Is Known Already: </bold>A vast body of literature on adult cancer patients shows that reproductive capacity is a major quality-of-life issue. Patients also have a strong desire to be informed of available FP options with a view to future parenthood of their own genetic child, considering that <10% chose to adopt or used donated gametes. Furthermore, the quality of fertility counseling provided at the time of cancer diagnosis has been identified as a crucial factor in the decision-making process. By contrast, in the pediatric population, while it was shown that parents were able to make an informed and voluntary decision for their prepubertal sons despite the heavy emotional burden at the time of diagnosis, there is so far very limited information on patient expectations regarding FP. A lack of awareness often equates to suboptimal care by oncologists and FP specialists, and poor access to FP, therefore improving knowledge and identifying the expectations of pediatric patients and their parents are crucial for optimizing multidisciplinary collaborative care pathways (MCCPs), including counseling and access to FP methods, in the youngest population. <bold>Study Design, Size, Duration: </bold>A questionnaire survey was posted to an eligible population between May 2005 and May 2013. <bold>Participants/materials, Setting, Methods: </bold>A total of 348 prepubertal boys and adolescents aged 0-18 years, diagnosed with cancer in a university hospital setting, were eligible. Three different questionnaires for two age groups of children (<12 and 12-18 years) and parents were established based on information from focus groups. Questions were subsequently reviewed by the institutional ethics board before being sent. <bold>Main Results and the Role Of Chance: </bold>Of the 348 eligible patients, 44 died and 14 were lost to follow-up. Thus, 290 patients (77 aged 12-18 years and 213 aged <12 years) were sent a questionnaire. In total, 120 questionnaires were recovered, 45.5% (n = 35/77) from adolescents and 39.9% (n = 85/213) from children. FP acceptance rates were, respectively, 74 and 78.6% for boys aged <12 and 12-18 years. The content of information provided to patients and parents appeared to positively impact on the decision to preserve fertility (P = 0.04). While the majority of boys aged >12 years considered the information to be clear (72%), complete (80%) and understandable (90.9%), only 33.3% of boys aged <12 years were able to comprehend the information. Pressure from doctors to reduce the delay between diagnosis and cancer treatment increased the number of refusals (P<0.01), while hope for future parenthood favored acceptance (P < 0.01). Family support was considered important for 75% of adolescents and 58% of children, and medical support for 50% of adolescents and 42% of children. <bold>Limitations, Reason For Caution: </bold>This single-center survey does not allow extrapolation of the information to other settings. Recall bias and lack of full external validation of the questionnaires are further limitations. Modification of the current MCCP should be further evaluated according to our results. <bold>Wider Implications Of the Findings: </bold>Acknowledging the issues faced and familiarizing oneself with the care of patients undergoing fertility-threatening therapies supply primary care providers with the appropriate quality management tools in the field of FP in centers for reproductive medicine. Expectations reported in the survey allow appropriate support to be included within the MCCP design. <bold>Study Funding/competing Interests: </bold>Funding by hospital/clinic(s); Cliniques Universitaires Saint Luc, Brussels, Belgium.

AB  - Many social science researchers agree that overconsumption of resources and consumer goods is a major problem in Western culture today, particularly in the US. Thus, promoting sustainable behavior among the public in rural and urban areas alike is important. Although existing research offers suggestions for promoting sustainable behaviors among environmentally-motivated audiences, a void remains with respect to encouraging non-environmentally-motivated individuals to adopt more sustainable behaviors. In response, the author conducted a formative experiment aimed specifically at: fostering participation among non-environmentally-motivated individuals in sustainable living educational programming events, and promoting subsequent behavior change among those participants in the direction of more sustainable lifestyles. This article focuses on the first goal, and specifically on the role of key informant involvement in achieving increasing levels of participation for each of the four iterations comprising this project. This strategy has the potential to improve participation in similar programming among various target audiences, including those in the rural areas familiar to JRSS readership.

AB  - Background: This article introduces a comprehensive health and wellness program that serves young women, ages 14 to 21, with physical disabilities. The program is a component of the Initiative for Women with Disabilities (IWD), a hospital-based center serving women with physical disabilities/conditions that offers accessible gynecology, primary care, physical therapy, nutrition consultations, exercise and fitness classes, and wellness and social work services. Recent literature has shown that young women with physical disabilities often face physical and emotional barriers to their own health and wellness. This group of adolescents often has difficulty developing a healthy image of their bodies, especially compared with their able-bodied peers. Unhealthy attitudes regarding the body image and sexuality of those with physical differences are often perpetuated by the media, peers, and parents. People with disabilities have become increasingly able to live fulfilling lives in recent decades. This is due largely to studies that have confirmed that once barriers are addressed and minimized, young women with physical disabilities lead active and productive lives and have much to contribute to society. Methods: The goal of the Young Women's Program (YWP), established in 2006, is to help young women adopt healthy lifestyles by exposing them to a carefully planned curriculum. The program provides a variety of classes and workshops, expert instruction, and access to resources and a network of peers and mentors. The ultimate goal is for the participants to apply the concepts learned in the group sessions to identify and evaluate their personal goals and develop health and wellness plans for achieving these goals. Results: Data were obtained from several sources: a self-administered program evaluation, program recruitment and retention statistics, and an assessment of whether individual health and wellness goals were achieved. All of these measures indicate a favorable response to the program structure and content. Participants are able to integrate and apply the learned concepts to alter aspects of their daily lifestyles and improve their self-confidence, self-worth, and self-competence. Conclusions: The results to date suggest that the YWP addresses the transitional challenges cited in the literature that young women with physical disabilities face from adolescence to adulthood. The structure of the program, which combines individual and group sessions, and the focused content appear to have a positive impact on the participants' lives by exposing them to experiences that promote self-determination and self-competence. By providing opportunities for socialization with peers and mentors and exposure to community resources, and by helping participants to develop self-care skills and to set goals for a healthy lifestyle, the program facilitates leading an independent life. The efficacy of the YWP will be determined by annual follow-up studies as participants enter adulthood. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - This research evaluated an innovative and uniquely structured nursing student exchange programme which was designed with the aim of contributing to the accomplishment of Strategic Objective One of a University in Hong Kong.The six week programme was conducted between the School of Nursing of a University in Hong Kong and the School of Nursing of a University in Shanghai. Students from both Schools constituted two classes, one of which was held in Hong Kong and the other in Shanghai. Each class contained a mix of students from both Hong Kong and Shanghai, i.e. exchange and non-exchange students. The learning experiences arranged in the programme included theory taught in classroom lectures and in tutorials, clinical visits and social activities. The lectures were given by teachers from both Schools. The teacher from the School of Nursing in Hong Kong gave the lectures on 'Health Counselling', using English as the teaching language medium. Two teachers from the School of Nursing in Shanghai gave the lectures on 'Interpretation of Clinical Data', using Putonghua as the teaching language medium. With the use of videoconferencing, students in the classes in both sites received the lectures simultaneously. The tutorials were conducted in each of the Schools separately without the use of videoconferencing. Following initial access negotiations by the teachers, the non-exchange students organised the clinical visits to different health care settings which they attended together with their exchange student classmates. They also organised and, together with their exchange student classmates, shared in various social and cultural activities.The objectives of the research were firstly to determine whether the objectives of the student exchange programme had been met. These programme objectives addressed the enhancement of participating students' all-round development in seven elements which were stated in the Strategic Objective One of the University in Hong Kong. The second objective was to explore the students' learning experiences gained through participating in activities organised in the programme. The third objective was to identify other benefits for the participating students gained as a result of participating in the programme; and the fourth was to explore the possibility of establishing an innovative teaching model in nursing education.A summative programme evaluation design was adopted and triangulation was the research method. Both quantitative and qualitative approaches were implemented. The data sources derived from the Course Experience Questionnaire (CEQ), the Videoconference Participant Questionnaire (VPQ), students' assessment scores, semistructured interviews with students and teachers and students' reflective journals. The quantitative data was managed by statistical analysis using SPSS software including descriptive and inferential statistics. The qualitative data was managed by means of content analysis. The combination of the quantitative and qualitative data approaches enabled a broader and deeper exploration and understanding of the students' learning experiences.The results of the research showed the participating students, no matter whether they were exchange or non-exchange, or where they attended the programme, gained many positive experiences in relation to the seven elements of the University's Strategic Objective One which addressed the students' all-round development, including enhancement of their global outlook, critical and creative thinking, social and national responsibility, cultural appreciation, life-long learning, biliteracy and trilingualism and leadership skills. The students and teachers had positive views of the effect of videoconferencing in education but also recognised the limitations of the technology in relation to its implementation in the programme. During the programme the students explored different styles of teaching and learning, observed similarities and differences in the health care services and nursing practice and in the cultures of the two cities. These experiences stimulated them to compare, critique, appreciate and learn from each other. Many students felt these experiences would be unforgettable and of value to them throughout their lives and in their future careers.It is concluded that the innovative and uniquely designed and structured programme has established a model for teaching and learning in nursing education.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) oncogene is an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of HER2-addicted tumors. Although lapatinib, an FDA-approved small-molecule HER2 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), represents a significant therapeutic advancement in the treatment of HER2+ breast cancers, responses to lapatinib have not been durable. Consequently, elucidation of mechanisms of acquired therapeutic resistance to HER-directed therapies is of critical importance. METHODS: Using a functional protein-pathway activation mapping strategy, along with targeted genomic knockdowns applied to a series of isogenic-matched pairs of lapatinib-sensitive and resistant cell lines, we now report an unexpected mechanism of acquired resistance to lapatinib and similar TKIs. RESULTS: The signaling analysis revealed that whereas HER2 was appropriately inhibited in lapatinib-resistant cells, EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation was incompletely inhibited. Using a targeted molecular knockdown approach to interrogate the causal molecular underpinnings of EGFR-persistent activation, we found that lapatinib-resistant cells were no longer oncogene addicted to HER2-HER3-PI3K signaling, as seen in the parental lapatinib-sensitive cell lines, but instead were dependent on a heregulin (HRG)-driven HER3-EGFR-PI3K-PDK1 signaling axis. Two FDA-approved EGFR TKIs could not overcome HRG-HER3-mediated activation of EGFR, or reverse lapatinib resistance. The ability to overcome EGFR-mediated acquired therapeutic resistance to lapatinib was demonstrated through molecular knockdown of EGFR and treatment with the irreversible pan-HER TKI neratinib, which blocked HRG-dependent phosphorylation of HER3 and EGFR, resulting in apoptosis of resistant cells. In addition, whereas HRG reversed lapatinib-mediated antitumor effects in parental HER2+ breast cancer cells, neratinib was comparatively resistant to the effects of HRG in parental cells. Finally, we showed that HRG expression is an independent negative predictor of clinical outcome in HER2+ breast cancers, providing potential clinical relevance to our findings. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular analysis of acquired therapeutic resistance to lapatinib identified a new resistance mechanism based on incomplete and 'leaky' inhibition of EGFR by lapatinib. The selective pressure applied by incomplete inhibition of the EGFR drug target resulted in selection of ligand-driven feedback that sustained EGFR activation in the face of constant exposure to the drug. Inadequate target inhibition driven by a ligand-mediated autocrine feedback loop may represent a broader mechanism of therapeutic resistance to HER TKIs and suggests adopting a different strategy for selecting more effective TKIs to advance into the clinic.

AB  - The US government has initiated incentive programs to encourage the adoption of Electronic Medical Records (EMR). To qualify for the incentive payment, healthcare providers need to demonstrate ``meaningful use{''} of EMR systems, which requires the use of certified EMRs and the implementation of a set of standard functionalities. In this paper, we examine how the meaningful use of EMRs would affect health care outcomes in outpatient settings. Our results show that the use of core functionalities required by ``meaningful use{''} criteria and the use of certified EMRs have a positive impact on the quality and efficiency of health care. In addition, we find the relationship between the meaningful use and quality of care is moderated by the length of use. The implications of this study are also discussed.

AB  - Information technology has been transforming health care industry. This dissertation investigates the use of health information technology by health care providers and patients as well as its outcomes. This dissertation consists of three essays studying workflow optimization in hospital emergency departments, people's search for online health information, and the relationships between EMR (Electronic Medical Records) usage and health care outcomes, respectively. Hospital emergency departments' capacities to deal with a patient surge play an important role in preparedness for natural or man-made disasters. The first essay examines how emergency departments could optimize workflows during extreme events when there is a patient surge. This essay proposes a framework to reconfigure workflows while maintaining treatment quality. Our results show that reorganizing lower-priority processes and relocating the resources associated with those processes can shorten total waiting time in emergency departments, allowing better management of patient flows. People are increasingly using the Internet to access health information and the information obtained has an impact on their health care outcomes. The second essay examines the impacts of IT enablers and health motivators on people's online health information search behaviors. We characterize users' online health information search behaviors along three dimensions: the frequency of online health information search, the diversity of online health information usage, and the preference of the Internet for initial search. Using the 2003 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) data on cancers, we find that ease of access to Internet and trust in online health information could affect all three dimensions of search behaviors. While perceived quality of communication with doctors has an impact on diversity of search and preference of search, we surprisingly do not find an impact on the frequency of search for online health information. In addition, our results find that perceived health status could affect both frequency and diversity of search for online health information. But we do not find evidence that perceived health status could lead to a preference for using the Internet as a source for health information. The US government has initiated incentive programs to encourage the adoption of Electronic Medical Records (EMR). To qualify for the incentive payment, health care providers need to demonstrate 'meaningful use' of EMR systems, which requires the use of certified EMRs and the implementation of a set of standard functionalities. In the third essay, we examine how the meaningful use of EMRs would affect health care outcomes in outpatient settings. Our results show that the use of core functionalities required by 'meaningful use' criteria and the use of certified EMRs have a positive impact on the quality and efficiency of care. In addition, we find the relationship between the 'meaningful use' and quality of care is moderated by the length of EMR use. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Appropriate diagnostics to monitor disease trends and assess the effectiveness and impact of interventions are essential for guiding treatment strategies at different thresholds of schistosomiasis transmission and for certifying elimination. Field validation of these assays is urgently needed before they can be adopted to support policy decisions of the national programme for control and elimination of schistosomiasis in P.R. China. We compared the efficacy and utility of different immunoassays in guiding control strategies and monitoring the endemic status of S. japonicum infections towards elimination. Methodology/Principal Findings: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in seven villages with different transmission intensities settings to assess the performance and utility of three immunoassays, e.g., an indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA_JX), an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA_SZ), and a dot immunogold filtration assay (DIGFA_SH). 6,248 individuals aged 6-65 years old who gave consent and supplied their stool and blood samples were included for data analysis. Results showed that ELISA_SZ performed significantly higher sensitivity (95.45%, 95%CI: 92.94-97.97%) than IHA_JX (87.59%, 95%CI: 83.51-91.49%) and DIGFA_SH (79.55%, 95%CI: 74.68-84.41%), especially in subgroups with very low infection intensity. The specificity of ELISA_SZ, IHA_JX, DIGFA_SH in 6-9 year olds with occasional exposure was nearly 90%. DIGFA_SH performed the highest screening efficacy for patients among three assays with overall positive predicative value of 13.07% (95%CI: 11.42-14.72%). We found a positive correlation of antibody positive rate of IHA_JX with results of stool examination in age strata (r = 0.70, P<0.001). Seropositivity of IHA_JX in children aged 6-9 years old showed an excellent correlation with prevalence of schistosome infection in the seven communities (r = 0.77, P<0.05). Conclusions/Significance: Studies suggest that ELISA_SZ could be used to guide selective chemotherapy in moderate or low endemic regions. IHA_JX could be used to as a surveillance tool and for certifying elimination of schistosomiasis through monitoring children as a sentinel population.

AB  - This paper compares the historical trajectories, objectives, and practices of engineering ethics education in China and the United States. A comparative study like this contributes in several ways to the education of ethical and culturally-sensitive engineers in both countries. First, as engineers increasingly work in international teams and deploy projects outside their home countries, knowledge about ethical values emphasized in other cultures will help educators prepare students to practice engineering in ways that respect local values and ethical standards. Second, as engineering programs--especially those in the US--attract a great number of students from abroad, understanding international students' ethics training in their home countries will help engineering educators anticipate and accommodate their learning needs. Third, a comparison of the theories, practices, and challenges of ethics teaching in two of the world's leading countries in engineering education will serve as a starting point for a cross-national conversation about the opportunities, strategies, and best practices for educating ethically committed global engineers. We start our analysis by reviewing the history of engineering ethics education in the US and China. Following that, we examine major theoretical debates that illustrate the core questions, concepts, and approaches that attract American and Chinese engineering ethicists' attention. Next we compare some exemplar curricular and instructional strategies adopted by educators in each country to facilitate engineering students' ethics learning. Findings of this comparative study suggest that engineering ethics education in China and the US reflect distinct characters that result from different political, intellectual, and professional influences on engineering education. In particular, engineering ethics education in China has demonstrated a stronger emphasis on theoretical knowledge, whereas ethics teaching in the US focuses more on ethical decision-making in engineering practice. We suggest that the differing emphases result partly from Chinese scholars' attempt to establish engineering ethics as an academic discipline, and, compared with its counterpart in the US, a weaker professional identity for engineers in China. We conclude this paper by summarizing lessons engineering ethics educators in both countries might learn from each other. We also suggest a few questions for future research that will help elucidate the respective intellectual and professional impacts on engineers' ethics learning in China and the US.

AB  - In order to deal with uncertainties in evacuation time associated with the uncertainty in input parameters at a reasonable computational cost, a probabilistic method based on polynomial chaos expansion is proposed that combines evacuation models with Latin hypercube sampling. Evacuation models enable the prediction of evacuation time; polynomial chaos expansion is used to construct a surrogate model of evacuation time; Latin hypercube sampling is adopted as post-processing of the surrogate model to predict numerically the distribution of evacuation times. Additionally, an Uncertainty Factor is defined to quantify the total effect of the uncertainty of input parameters on evacuation time. To illustrate the proposed probabilistic method, evacuation of a simplified fire compartment typical of large commercial buildings is analyzed while considering uncertain input parameters including occupant density, child-occupant load ratio and exit width. This case study indicates that when exit width is small, the Uncertainty Factor is almost constant with respect to exit width but increases with an increase in specified (acceptable) reliability level. Furthermore, if exit width exceeds a certain critical value, the Uncertainty Factor will decrease with an increase in exit width and its sensitivity to reliability level will become smaller. Finally, the case study shows that compared with the conventional Monte Carlo simulation, the proposed method can give similar estimations of evacuation time uncertainty at a significantly reduced computational cost.

AB  - Aims: To investigate the online activities, prevalence of Internet Addiction in relation to demographic characteristics and risk factors related to family and school among adolescents. Methods: A total of 6468 10–18 year old adolescents recruited from local schools in Guangzhou, China were selected by adopting multi-stage stratified random sampling (female/male: 2886/3582; mean age:13.78 ± 2.43). Participants completed a structured questionnaire. Results: The overall prevalence of Internet Addiction was 26.50%, with severe addiction being 0.96%. Internet Addiction was higher among males than females (30.6% versus 21.2%). Older grade students reported more Internet addiction rate (χ² = 431.25, P < 0.001). The five highest-ranked online activities were social networking (94.73%), school work (86.53%), entertainment (82.44%), Internet gaming (73.42%) and shopping online (33.67%). A negative relationship with teachers (OR: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.20–1.53), a negative relationship between two parents (OR: 1.23, 95% CI: 1.18–1.37), and poor academic performance (OR: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.17–1.35), showed the highest relative risks for Internet addiction. Conclusions: Severe Internet Addiction is not common, but mild Internet addiction was reported by more than one fourth of all participants. The rates of Internet Addiction varied by gender, grade, the quality of family relationships and school situation, suggesting these factors should be considered when designing and implementing interventions.

AB  - Glucocorticoids are widely used in the treatment of human glomerular diseases, but their mode of action is poorly understood particularly in steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome, which is most common in childhood and is characterized by a lack of inflammation in the kidney. The podocyte is a key cell in the glomerulus in health and disease: until recently, human podocytes have been difficult to study in vitro. We have developed a conditionally immortalized human podocyte cell line transfected with a temperature-sensitive simian virus 40 transgene: when the transgene is inactivated in vitro, these cells adopt the phenotype of differentiated podocytes. We have used these cells to evaluate, using immunocytochemistry, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and Western blotting, direct effects of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone at concentrations designed to mimic in vivo therapeutic corticosteroid levels. Dexamethasone upregulated expression of nephrin and tubulin-alpha, and downregulated vascular endothelial growth factor. Effects on cell cycle were complex with downregulation of cyclin kinase inhibitor p21 and augmentation of podocyte survival, without any effect on apoptosis. We report cytokine production by human podocytes, especially interleukin (IL)-6 and -8; IL-6 expression was suppressed by dexamethasone. These potent direct effects on podocytes illustrate a novel mode of action of glucocorticoids and suggest potential new therapeutic strategies for glomerular disease.

AB  - Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) pathways are multimodal, evidence-based approaches to optimize patient outcome after surgery. However, the use of ERAS protocols to improve morbidity and recovery time without compromising safety following pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) remains to be elucidated. We conducted a systemic review and meta-analysis to assess the safety and efficacy of ERAS protocols compared with conventional perioperative care (CPC) in patients following PD. PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Science Citation Index Expanded and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library were searched between January 2000 and June 2015. The patients who underwent PD with ERAS protocols or CPC were eligible. The studies that compared postoperative length of hospital stay (PLOS), postoperative complications, or in-hospital costs in the 2 groups were included. A meta-analysis, meta-regression, sensitivity analysis, and subgroup analysis were performed to estimate the postoperative outcomes between the 2 groups and identified the potential confounders. We used the methodological index for nonrandomized studies checklist to assess methodological qualities. Weighted mean differences (WMD) or odds ratios (OR) were calculated with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). The publication bias tests were also performed through the funnel plots. In total, 14 nonrandomized comparative studies with 1409 ERAS cases and 1310 controls were analyzed. Implementation of an ERAS protocol significantly reduced PLOS (WMD: -4.17 days; 95% CI: -5.72 to -2.61), delayed gastric emptying (OR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.44-0.71), overall morbidity (OR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.54-0.74), and inhospital costs compared to CPC (all P<0.001). There were no statistically significant differences in other postoperative outcomes. Age, gender, and ERAS component implementation did not significantly contribute to heterogeneity for PLOS as shown by metaregression analysis. Our study suggested that ERAS was as safe as CPC and improved recovery of patients undergoing PD, thus reducing in-hospital costs. General adoption of ERAS protocols during PD should be recommended.

AB  - Background: China has the highest absolute disease burden of diabetes worldwide. For diabetic patients, diabetes-related vascular complications are major causes of morbidity and mortality. The roles of lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) and secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) as inflammatory markers have been recently evaluated in the pathogenesis of both diabetes and atherosclerosis. We aimed to determine the mechanism through which patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes gain long-term vascular benefit from intensive insulin therapy by evaluating the change in Lp-PLA2 and sPLA2 levels after early intensive insulin treatment and its relevance with insulin resistance and pancreatic β-cell function. Methods: In total, 90 patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus were enrolled. All patients received continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) for approximately 2 weeks. Intravenous glucose-tolerance test (IVGTT) and oral glucose-tolerance test (OGTT) were performed, and plasma concentrations of Lp-PLA2 and sPLA2 were measured before and after CSII. Results: Levels of Lp-PLA2 and sPLA2 were significantly higher in diabetic patients with macroangiopathy than in those without (P < 0.05). After CSII, the sPLA2 level decreased significantly in all diabetic patients (P < 0.05), while the Lp-PLA2 level changed only in those with macroangiopathy (P < 0.05). The area under the curve of insulin in IVGTT and OGTT, the acute insulin response (AIR3-5), early phase of insulin secretion (ΔIns30/ΔG30), modified β-cell function index, and homeostatic model assessment for β-cell function (HOMA-β) increased after treatment even when adjusted for the influence of insulin resistance (IR; P < 0.001). The HOMA-IR was lower after treatment, and the three other indicators adopted to estimate insulin sensitivity (ISIced, IAI, and QUICKI) were higher after treatment (P < 0.05). Correlation analysis showed that the decrease in the Lp-PLA2 and sPLA2 levels was positively correlated with a reduction in HOMA-IR after CSII (P < 0.05). Additionally, multiple linear regression analysis showed that Lp-PLA2 and sPLA2 independently correlated with HOMA-IR (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Lp-PLA2 and sPLA2 are closely related to insulin resistance and macroangiopathy in diabetic patients. Intensive insulin therapy might help improve IR and protect against diabetic macroangiopathy by influencing the Lp-PLA2 and sPLA2 levels.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to revisit Parten's study on social play from cultural, environmental, social and economic aspects. Young children's social play is viewed as a critical means to foster and enhance language, cognitive, social and emotional development. Social play theory has been predominately viewed from developmental perspectives. The classic study of Parten's social play has been considered as a guideline for early childhood education programmes for decades. However, some recent research indicates that many young children may not necessarily follow the hierarchical sequence of social play as defined by Parten. Cultural, environmental and social changes since Parten's time may have an impact on children's social play behavior and on the interpretations of play behavior in addition to developmental factors. Because of the diversity and complexity of American children and their families, there is a pressing need to re-examine Parten's developmental sequence of young children's social play that was conducted over 70 years ago in order to prepare developmentally and culturally appropriate practice for today's children.

AB  - Background: The aim of this study was to explore prevalence and predictors of posttraumatic growth, including its relationship with PTSD symptoms among adult survivors of a severe earthquake. Methods: A stratification random sampling strategy was adopted and 2080 adult survivors of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake were surveyed. Posttraumatic Growth Inventory and Impact of Event Scale - Revised were used in the assessment of posttraumatic growth (PIG) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, respectively. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were used to explore the best predictors. Results: At one year following the earthquake, prevalence rates for posttraumatic growth and PTSD symptoms were 51.1% and 56.8%, respectively. Best predictors of posttraumatic growth were being female, younger age, higher level of education, higher degree of earthquake-related exposure and PTSD symptoms, including intrusion and hyperarousal symptoms. Limitations: The limitations of this study lie in that no comparison was made due to the lack of pre-disaster data, so it is very hard to conclude to what extent did this earthquake affect the people there. Our participants were mainly workers from different fields. Survey of affected population in rural and remote areas was unavailable. More representative samples are needed to examine the generalizability of these findings. Conclusions: Psychological interventions and care for survivors of Sichuan earthquake disaster should focus on females and older people who can be more affected by disasters. Besides, in order to produce positive outcomes after disasters, programs on adjustment and management of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms should be implemented. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background:On May 12th 2008, an earthquake with a magnitude of 8.0 on the Richter scale struck China, causing a large number of casualties and significant economic losses. By interviewing 2080 survivors of Wenchuan earthquake, the objective of this study is to estimate the role of different types of social support as possible moderating factors between anxiety and depression. Methods:A stratified random sampling strategy about the cross-sectional study was adopted. The self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) and Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS) were used. A total of 2080 adult survivors of the Wenchuan earthquake from 19 damaged countries participated in the survey. Correlation analysis and regression analysis were performed to evaluate the moderating role of social support on the relationship between anxiety and depression. Results:One year after the Wenchuan earthquake, anxiety and depression were found to be 37.6% and 40.7%, respectively. Demographic characteristics were seen as significant in the cases of depression, except for age (p=0.599), while age and education level were not found to be significant for anxiety. The results showed that social support, especially subjective support could moderate the association between anxiety and depression. Conclusions:Social support should be particularly focused on female survivors, those of the Han ethnic group, and those with a lower level of education and a lower income. Psychological intervention and care for survivors should focus on those most disoriented by the disaster.

AB  - For patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), the likelihood of progression to probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) is important not only for individual patient care, but also for the identification of participants in clinical trial, so as to provide early interventions. Biomarkers based on various neuroimaging modalities could offer complementary information regarding different aspects of disease progression. The current study adopted a weighted multi-modality sparse representation-based classification method to combine data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, from three imaging modalities: Volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET), and florbetapir PET. We included 117 normal controls (NC) and 110 MCI patients, 27 of whom progressed to AD within 36 months (pMCI), while the remaining 83 remained stable (sMCI) over the same time period. Modality-specific biomarkers were identified to distinguish MCI from NC and to predict pMCI among MCI. These included the hippocampus, amygdala, middle temporal and inferior temporal regions for MRI, the posterior cingulum, precentral, and postcentral regions for FDG-PET, and the hippocampus, amygdala, and putamen for florbetapir PET. Results indicated that FDG-PET may be a more effective modality in discriminating MCI from NC and in predicting pMCI than florbetapir PET and MRI. Combining modality-specific sensitive biomarkers from the three modalities boosted the discrimination accuracy of MCI from NC (76.7%) and the prediction accuracy of pMCI (82.5%) when compared with the best single-modality results (73.6% for MCI and 75.6% for pMCI with FDG-PET).

AB  - To explore the effects of exchange transfusion on auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD) in neonates with severe hyperbilirubinemia (SH). The clinical data of 2216 SH neonates who met the standard of exchange transfusion and 732 non severe-hyperbilirubinemia (NSH) neonates in the same period who did not require exchange transfusion in the neonatology department of Childrens' Hospital of Chongqing Medical University between January 2010 and December 2015 were retrospectively analyzed. In addition, the SH neonates were further divided into the exchange transfusion group and photography group. Hearing screening was conducted on all neonates using transiently evoked otoacoustic emission (TEOAE) and auto auditory brainstem response (AABR), and neonates who failed the above screening were performed diagnostic hearing test. And then neonates diagnosed with hearing disorder were followed up for 2–5 years. The pass rates of hearing screening were 80.58%, 79.71% and 87.84% in the phototherapy group, exchange transfusion group and NSH group respectively, with a significant difference(P < 0.05). Hearing loss was diagnosed in 10.15%, 12.39% and 8.54% of neonates in the phototherapy group, exchange transfusion group and NSH group. After follow-up, ultimate incidence rates of ANSD were 11.96%, 11.57% and 2.4% respectively in the 3 groups, with a significant difference (P < 0.05). SH is one of risk factors for ANSD. SH neonates have a lower incidence of ANSD in the exchange transfusion group than in the phototherapy group. Neonates who meet the standards of exchange transfusion adopt this therapy in early stage, which can quickly decrease bilirubin level and ultimately reduce incidence of ANSD.

AB  - This study investigated whether pervasiveness of problems across settings predicted successful reduction of impairment in school, home, and interactions with others after controlling for other variables that may be stronger predictors. The data of 4,434 youths between the ages of 7 and 17 years in public mental health services in Michigan were examined employing logistic regressions, with 4 sets of predictors, as follows: demographic characteristics, risk factors, therapist's perception of impairment in the youth's caregiving environment, and pervasiveness of the youth's problems. The results indicated that pervasiveness of problems was the strongest predictor of poor outcomes for each domain. In addition, impaired caregiving environment, previous hospitalization for psychiatric or substance use problems, and placement out-of-home were also negatively associated with successful outcome. The implications of the findings for practice and research are discussed.

AB  - Background: There has been an identified need for greater patient and family member involvement in healthcare. This is particularly relevant in an intensive care unit (ICU), as the family provides a key communicative and practical link between patient and clinician. Family members have been deemed a positive beneficial influence on ICU care and recovery processes, yet they themselves are often emotionally affected after discharge. There has been no standardised evidenced-based approach which explores research on family member involvement and the range and quality of contributions remain unclear. This project will undertake a systematic review to assess the evidence base for interventions designed to promote patient and family member involvement in adult intensive care settings and develop a comprehensive typology of interventions for use by clinicians, patients and carers. Methods: The following databases will be searched without date restriction: MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL, as well as the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Joanna Briggs and Cochrane Libraries. Manual searches of recent back issues of leading ICU and patient experience journals will also be undertaken, as will the reference lists of included studies. Unpublished literature will be sought through grey literature databases, including GreyLit and OpenGrey. All evaluation studies that consider intervention activities to promote patient and family member involvement in adult ICUs will be included; all research designs will be eligible. We will seek to include studies that report on a mixture of relevant outcomes for patients and family members. Abstracts and papers will be independently screened by at least two members of the team to determine their inclusion. Included papers will be assessed for methodological rigour using a standard rating approach, which assesses 'quality of study' and 'quality of information'. Quality assessment will be completed by at least two members of the team. Data on interventions, evaluation methods and outcomes will be collated using a predetermined extraction table. These are likely to be heterogeneous in nature, which will mean that the review will follow a narrative approach to synthesis. Discussion: The review will provide valuable and rigorous insight into the range and quality of interventions available to promote patient and family member involvement in ICU. This is the first step towards addressing the absence of a synthesis of research for this context, and will, in addition, develop a typology of available interventions that will help service users and clinicians make informed decisions about the approaches to patient and family member involvement which they might want to adopt.

AB  - This report describes our experience providing nursing care between 7th October and 7th November 2016 to a homosexual male who repeatedly engaged in stress-related suicide attempts and self-harm. Information was collected using comprehensive nursing assessment, observation, and interviews and the health problems of ineffective coping and disabled family coping were identified. Because of affection-related distress and the lack of recognition of his gender orientation by his family, the client engaged repeatedly in self-harm and attempted suicide on several occasions in order to cope with the self-perceived unbearable stress and stressful situations. The authors provided nursing care based on Watson's theory of human caring. We fulfilled the nature of caring, prompted respect and acceptance, and established a therapeutic, interpersonal relationship. We also adopted the concept of suicide intervention, and used the protective factors as the main coping strategies. These approaches allowed the client to acknowledge the events and reactions that may trigger his suicidal ideas, to develop better self-reflection and impulse control, and to mitigate the ideas and behaviors related to suicide and self-harm. Because constant conflicts between the client and his parents hampered a harmonious family relationship, we adopted family-centered care in order to enhance family resilience, which created room for mutual learning and development and reconstructed a healthy family relationship. Our successful results with this case encouraged our writing this paper in order to share this nursing experience with caregivers facing similar client situations and needs.

AB  - Purpose/Objectives: To consolidate the literature and provide a model to explain the links among uncertainty, post-traumatic stress syndrome, and health behaviors in adolescent and young adult childhood cancer survivors.Data Sources: A systemic review of related literature and theory was used for the proposed model. The literature pertaining to the Uncertainty in Illness Theory, childhood cancer late effects, post-traumatic stress, and health behaviors was reviewed and critiqued from three data sets from 1979-2007: MEDLINE®, Psyc Info, and CINAHL®. Key words used for the search were uncertainty and post-traumatic stress as well as health behaviors, including smoking, alcohol use, unsafe sex, sunscreen use, and physical inactivity.Data Synthesis: Childhood cancer survivors living with chronic uncertainty may develop a new view of life and, as a result, adopt more health-promotion behaviors and engage in less health-risk behaviors. However, survivors living with chronic uncertainty may generate symptoms similar to post-traumatic stress disorder and, therefore, adopt fewer health-promotion behaviors and engage in more health-risk behaviors.Conclusions: The uncertainty that pervades the childhood cancer experience can lead to the development of symptoms that resemble those of post-traumatic stress. The symptoms can interfere with the adoption of healthy lifestyle behaviors and avoidance of health-risk behaviors.Implications for Nursing: The theoretically derived model outlined in this article can be used to guide clinical interventions and additional research into the health behaviors of childhood cancer survivors.

AB  - A random sample of 150 farmers (75 participants and 75 non-participants in radio forums) from Lahore and Gujrat districts in West Pakistan were surveyed via personal interview in 1971 to determine whether there was a relationship between: certain socioeconomic variables and farmer forum participation; radio forums and agricultural change, including acceptance of new farm practices; the most effective information sources and such changes. Chi-squares and corrected contingency coefficients were computed in order to determine any possible association between selected personal factors and farmer participation and the impact of participation upon change. Data revealed: farmers with higher levels of education, larger families, larger farms, higher incomes, organizational membership, city exposure, and favorable attitudes toward the forums tended to participate more in the radio forums than those without such characteristics; forum members had better knowledge of new agricultural practices, better attitudes toward such practices, and higher adoption rates than non-members; the radio forum program was one of the most effective information sources affecting change. Since it appeared that extension agents tended to concentrate on wealthier farmers, it was suggested that concentration on low income farmers would help mitigate the socioeconomic gap in this developing nation.

AB  - Purpose -- The purpose of this paper is to examine the linkages of employment, chronic disease prevalence and medical care of the older population in India. Design/methodology/approach -- This study used the India Human Development Survey data for the analysis. Bivariate, multinomial logit regression and multiple classification analysis are used as methods for the study Findings -- The findings suggest a bi-directional relationship between employment and chronic diseases: the older population who are engaged in regular paid work has lower likelihood to the risk of chronic diseases compared to those who are not working. Conversely, the older population with chronic diseases may be unable to work in regular paid jobs. The greater proportions of not-working older population with savings and retirement pensions are more likely to seek modern treatment for the chronic diseases. Overall, the results foster that employment determines and is determined by chronic disease prevalence among the older population in India. Originality/value -- This paper tor the first time presents evidence on the linkages of employment, chronic disease prevalence and medical care of the older population in India by using a unique and comprehensive data source.

AB  - It was the purpose of this study to examine the relationships among American Indian Vietnam combat veterans’ childhood experiences: extra-cultural placement and having a veteran primary care giver, and features and symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Participants were 150 American Indian Vietnam combat veterans from the Midwest. This study examined scores from two dependent measures: Traumatic Attachment Belief Scale (TABS) and the Mississippi Combat PTSD Scale-Short Form (M-PTSD Short Form). The two independent measures were: veterans who experienced extra-cultural placement or those who did not experience extra-cultural placement, and veterans who had a veteran primary care giver as a child or who did not have a veteran primary care giver as a child. Research findings indicated that veterans who experienced extra-cultural placement were significantly more likely to have experienced incarceration and homelessness. There were no significant differences in alcohol and drug treatment between those who had experienced extra-cultural placement and those who had not. There were no significant differences found if participants had a veteran primary care giver or not in homelessness or treatment for alcohol or drug abuse. Those who had a veteran primary care giver were found to be significantly more likely to experience incarceration than those who did not. Research findings also showed that participants who experienced actual or threatened homelessness were also more likely to experience incarceration and alcohol or drug treatment. The impact of trauma on beliefs about others’ safety was significantly greater than the impact of trauma on beliefs about self-safety, trust of others or of self-esteem toward others or toward self, and of intimacy with self or others. Other differences in these constructs were found. Significant differences were not found in the impact of trauma on features and symptoms of PTSD as a function of the absence of extra-cultural placement or extra-cultural placement or having a non-veteran or veteran primary care giver. Finally, there were significant associations between the impact of trauma on beliefs about self and others, features and symptoms of PTSD, no extra-cultural placement/extra-cultural placement, and having a non veteran or veteran primary care giver.

AB  - Objective Previous research on diagnosis of distress among patients with physical ailments has focused on physicians who specialize in the treatment of chronic illness. This study explores family physicians’ accuracy in diagnosing patients’ emotional distress. Methods Questionnaires were administered to family physicians ( N = 61) and their patients ( N = 496) immediately after a medical encounter. Patients reported their distress levels. Physicians evaluated patients’ distress levels and filled out a questionnaire measuring perspective-taking, i.e., the tendency to perceive the point of view of others. Results Mixed model analyses of nested data showed a moderate positive relationship between physicians’ evaluations of patients’ distress and patients’ self-reported distress. Diagnosis of distress was more accurate among family physicians with a better ability to take the patient’s perspective. Conclusion Family physicians’ capacity to accurately diagnose patient distress is positively related to their ability to adopt patients’ viewpoint. Practice implications Family physicians’ training should include enhancement of physicians’ ability to take the patient’s perspective. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study follows the example of early research in other taboo health topics such as family planning, leprosy, and HIV/AIDS, by first examining baseline Knowledge-Attitude-Practice (KAP) variables to build an initial research base for a menstruation- related health communication study. The primary objective of this study is to explore the relationship among important psychosocial variables pertaining to menstruation and menstrual hygiene; hence, the variables selected include: knowledge of menstruation and menstrual practices, attitude towards menstruation and menstrual practices, cognitive involvement in menstruation and menstrual practices, behavioral involvement in menstruation and menstrual practices, and adoption of menstrual practices. Another objective is to determine which of the above-mentioned factors are predictors of correct and safe hygienic practices in the context of menstruation. A quantitative methodological approach was adopted to conduct the study. A structured questionnaire was used to survey respondents and collect data. Sample size of the study was 475. A probability random sample consisting of both women and men, from Ahmedabad city, India, was selected using multi-stage clustered sampling technique. Descriptive and analytical statistical techniques were employed to analyze the data and prepare the findings. SPSS software was used to conduct appropriate analyses. It was found that knowledge, attitude, and cognitive involvement in menstruation and menstrual practices were high whereas, behavioral involvement in menstruation and menstrual practices were low. Hypothesized relationships between knowledge and attitude towards menstruation among men; knowledge, attitude towards menstrual practices and adoption among women; cognitive involvement and knowledge of menstrual practices in men and women; and behavioral involvement and knowledge of menstrual practices for men and women were statistically significant. Descriptive statistical analyses, correlation, and regression were statistical techniques used in this study. The outcomes of this study will assist in creating specific menstruation-related intervention strategies for public health communication campaigns. This study facilitates interactions between practitioners and researchers, and sharing and creating strategies to increase the relevance and uptake of research findings. Importantly, the results of this study empower girls and women by providing research-based data on crucial aspects of menstruation, which will lead to greater information of and lower stigma attached to menstruation and menstruating females.

AB  - The curriculum guide is designed to be used by teachers working with three-to-five year old Yakima children who attend early childhood programs and who will subsequently enter a public school system where most of their teachers, administrators, and classmates will be non-Indian. To lessen the negative effects of possible culture conflict, to help the children acquire the skills needed to participate in the dominant culture, and to promote retention of the value system of the Indian culture are the goals addressed by the curriculum design. The curriculum has been produced by projecting estimates about the world the children will enter, defining the components of the learning process, and determining the criteria for evaluating a successful multiethnic/multicultural program. The guide includes: a philosophy of cultural/ethnic pluralism and essentials of multiethnic/multicultural education; an analysis of the social, physical, emotional, intellectual, and cultural needs of Yakima preschoolers; identification of four competency areas relevant to teachers and students (establishing and maintaining a safe and healthy learning environment, developing physical and intellectual competence, building a positive self-concept, and fostering positive functioning in groups); lists of curriculum print resources for teacher reference; and three curriculum modules which are lessons concerning rocks, children's fears, and a healthy concept of death.

AB  - Since the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, was adopted in 2000, global efforts by UN organs, member states and NGOs have been made to integrate the Protocol into their policies, projects and practices. In the Greater Mekong Sub-Region, countries have been developing bilateral cooperation, which has been leveraged by COMMIT, their regional framework. In order to prevent, suppress and punish human trafficking, bilateral agreements between victims' countries of origin and their destination countries are crucial, because their cooperation involves cross-border activities such as the repatriation of the victims, the extradition of criminals, and information-sharing. This article analyzes three bilateral legal instruments between the Government of the Kingdom of Thailand and her three neighboring countries, namely the Royal Government of Cambodia, the Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic and the Government of the Union of Myanmar. The analysis examines the legal status of the victims, the victims as witnesses in criminal proceedings, victim protection programs, the recovery and restitution of damages, the process of repatriating the victims, and the prosecution of the criminals. Finally, the article assesses the effectiveness and limitations of the provisions and considers the implications for future agreements. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Development of generic skills including social and emotional competence has become a major objective in today’s higher education. Somatic psychoeducation may contribute to this new endeavor by fostering somatic awareness and trust in the organism to promote the holistic development of students. In this study, somatic awareness was defined as 'the moment-to-moment close intimacy with one’s experience,' which connects to the innate propensity of an organism to self-regulate and helps it become fully responsive to the immediate task in whatever situation. Drawing on a literature review on effective mindfulness-based interventions, the current study addressed the question of whether an 8-week somatic psychoeducation in college could indeed develop somatic awareness and trust in the organism, and enhance integral functioning that included general mindfulness, stress resilience, interpersonal empathy, responsibility for self-care, and generic skills. The educational program was mostly experiential, uniquely combining Western and Japanese somatic psychology as well as mindfulness practice. Assessment was conducted by self-report questionnaires except for trust in the organism and interpersonal empathy, which employed both self-report and performance measures. The research design was a randomized controlled trial with a convenience sample of 59 sophomore students at a Japanese university. Group 1 attended the 8-week course first while Group 2 served as a wait-list control, and then Group 2 attended the identical course for the next 8 weeks. Both groups responded to the self-report questionnaires three times: at Week 1 (a pretest for both groups), at Week 8 or 9 (a posttest for Group 1 and a second pretest for Group 2), and at Week 16 (an 8-week follow-up for Group 1 and a posttest for Group 2). Performance tests were taken only once at Week 8 or 9. Results suggested that the experimental course was successful in cultivating somatic awareness and the observing component of mindfulness, but not in other dependent variables (empathy, resilience, responsibility for self-care, trust in the organism, attitudinal components of mindfulness, and the self-evaluation of generic skills). The favorable effects in the enhancement of attention regulation and metacognitive awareness were consistent with the findings in mindfulness research that mindfulness training improves attention regulation and related cognitive abilities, including working memory capacity and insight in problem solving. Lack of course effects in other socioemotional competence was considered to be due to the absence of explicit activities in the program that should effectively promote each competence. From multivariate correlational analyses, it was found that general mindfulness, resilience, and empathy formed one group, whereas somatic awareness, trust in the organism, and responsibility for self-care formed another, the two groups being moderately correlated. In addition, each of the key variables in this study (somatic awareness, trust in the organism, and general mindfulness) was found to make a unique contribution to the self-evaluation of generic skills, demonstrating the incremental validity of the somatic constructs over mindfulness in predicting generic skills. It was also found that there was a unidirectional influence from somatic awareness upon the observing component of mindfulness, indicating a foundational feature of somatic awareness in the cultivation of mindfulness. Limitations and future directions of the study are discussed, including a need for more direct measurements that do not solely rely on self-report as well as for more qualitative analyses that explore the learning process in the mindful somatic psychoeducation toward generic skills development.

AB  - We examined the predictors for successful discharge from out-of-home care of children with complex needs placed in a novel comprehensive service intervention (Manatee Model) and compared their discharge experiences to their out-of-home counterparts from the same county. The study design consisted of a longitudinal two-year comparison of these two groups. A total of 147 cases were included in the analysis, and the propensity scoring technique was used to equate the groups. Among children admitted to the Manatee Model, boys, White children, younger children, those who came from a single-parent family, those who were abused, and those who had a disability (physical or emotional disability or medical condition) were found less likely to successfully exit within the two years when these predictors were examined separately. Multivariate analyses indicated that only age at the time of removal and health status were significantly associated with successful discharge. Implications of the findings are discussed.

AB  - Background: Maltreated children experience a variety of adverse outcomes including substance use problems. Although previous research indicated that there may be distinct trajectories of substance use among these youth, studies have examined them as if they were a single homogeneous group. Objectives: The goals of this study were to explore substance use trajectories among child welfare-involved youth and to identify characteristics that distinguish substance use trajectories. Methods: Data from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW II) were used. Multilevel latent growth mixture modeling (MLGMM) was performed using a subsample of 625 youth from ages 11–17 years investigated for maltreatment in 2008–2009. Measures included self-reported use of substance use during the previous 30 days, demographic characteristics, maltreatment history, placement in out-of-home care, and behavioral health problems. Results: MLGMM identified two distinct substance use trajectory classes including High Stable Substance Use and Rapid Progression Use. Findings suggest that the experience of physical abuse is the key factor that distinguishes the two groups. When the effects of class-specific covariates were examined, results suggest that involvement in substance use behavior and its escalation vary between groups and are affected by youth’s different previous experiences. Conclusions/Importance: The results have important implications for understanding individual differences in substance use behavior over time and how these differences were shaped by youth’s experiences of family adversity.

AB  - Background: Maltreated children experience a variety of adverse outcomes including substance use problems. Although previous research indicated that there may be distinct trajectories of substance use among these youth, studies have examined them as if they were a single homogeneous group. Objectives: The goals of this study were to explore substance use trajectories among child welfare-involved youth and to identify characteristics that distinguish substance use trajectories. Methods: Data from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW II) were used. Multilevel latent growth mixture modeling (MLGMM) was performed using a subsample of 625 youth from ages 11-17 years investigated for maltreatment in 2008-2009. Measures included self-reported use of substance use during the previous 30 days, demographic characteristics, maltreatment history, placement in out-of-home care, and behavioral health problems. Results: MLGMM identified two distinct substance use trajectory classes including High Stable Substance Use and Rapid Progression Use. Findings suggest that the experience of physical abuse is the key factor that distinguishes the two groups. When the effects of class-specific covariates were examined, results suggest that involvement in substance use behavior and its escalation vary between groups and are affected by youth's different previous experiences. Conclusions/Importance: The results have important implications for understanding individual differences in substance use behavior over time and how these differences were shaped by youth's experiences of family adversity. Study findings may be helpful for developing and enhancing the effectiveness of interventions targeted at decreasing substance use behaviors in child welfare-involved youth.

AB  - When a child's temperament and other characteristics (i.e. cognitive abilities) are adequate to master the expectations and opportunities of a specific environment, then there is a goodness of fit (Chess & Thomas, 1991). Having a child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) presents a mother with a plethora of challenges, making it difficult to foster a 'fit' environment. The challenges of raising a child with ASD present mothers with a great deal of stress. Some of the inherent behavioral, cognitive, and relational challenges of autism interfere with a mother's ability to create and maintain the kind of environment that promotes effective communication, emotion regulation, and behavioral regulation. Mothers of children with disabilities reach clinical levels of stress in a larger proportion than mothers of typically developing children (Guralnick et al., 2008). This relationship between a mother and a child is bidirectional, as research shows that behavior problems and stress exacerbate each other over time (Lecavalier et. al 2006). As prevalence rates for ASD are on the rise (Burrell & Borrego, 2012), there is a greater need for research informed and comprehensive treatment plans that, in addition to treating a child's behaviors, incorporate mothers in treatment so as to maximize the goodness of fit between mother and child. The guidelines suggested in this paper utilize research on therapeutic techniques to reduce parental stress in mothers of children with ASD in order to suggest how to systematically assimilate mothers into their child's treatment.

AB  - Child welfare systems (CWS) across America have struggled to serve families with substance abuse problems. Previous studies present that 14% to 79% of families involved in foster care system are affected by parental substance abuse, depending on the method for estimation and the focus of the study. Though parental substance abuse and family functioning have been highly intertwined, the mechanisms through which substance abuse impacts family functioning are less well understood. This study incorporates relational-cultural theory and social cognitive theory to examine how parental substance abuse and family functioning operate interactively as interlocking determinants of each other in the context of children placed in foster care. This study selected a sample of 352 families from the Kansas Serving Substance Affected Families (KSSAF) program and conducted a panel study over two waves of KSSAF data to examine whether there exists contemporaneous and/or longitudinal causal effects of parental substance use, family functioning and parental self-efficacy on one another. Results of this study suggest significant and negative associations between parental substance use and family functioning are found at both retro-pre- and post-tests, even after controlling for both time-varying and time-invariant covariates. On the other hand, neither of the cross-lagged effects of one construct at retro-pre-test on the other at post-test was significant, indicating the initial level of family functioning does not predict parental substance use at post-test, and the initial level of substance use does not predict family functioning at post-test either. This study also found a significant and highly negative association of parental self-efficacy with substance use at retro-pre-test but not at post-test. The initial level of parental self-efficacy also negatively predicted the subsequent substance use. Finally, the association between family functioning and self-efficacy is significant at retro-pre-test but not at post-test. The positive association at retro-pre-test indicates that families with a higher parental self-efficacy are more likely to function well. The cross-lagged effect of family functioning at retro-pre-test on self-efficacy at post-test is significant and positive, suggesting that the prior level of family functioning strongly predicts parental self-efficacy at the next time point. This study has further addressed implications for social work theory, practice, policy and research. Limitations and future studies are also discussed.

AB  - Background and Purpose: Mothers who are separated from their infants due to the necessity of surgical treatment for congenital heart disease (CHD) may develop lack of confidence in their ability to care for their infant. This research developed a systematic discharge nursing plan (SDNP) for mothers to care for their infants with CHD and evaluated the effects of this plan on maternal knowledge and confidence in caring for their infant with CHD at home. Methods: A quasi-experimental design was adopted for the study. Subjects were recruited by purposive sampling from mothers who had a hospitalized infant with CHD aged from 0 to 6 months. There were 20 mothers in the control group and 15 mothers in the intervention group. Control group subjects received current nursing instruction and were followed at the outpatient department after discharge of the infant from the hospital whereas the intervention group completed the SDNP in addition to current nursing instruction. Evaluations of these 2 groups based on the mother's knowledge of infant care and confidence to provide adequate care were conducted twice, at I week and I month after the infant's discharge from the hospital. Results: The intervention group had better confidence than the control group at I week and I month after the infants' discharge (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference of improvement in knowledge of infant care score between the 2 groups. No significant relation was found between knowledge of infant care and maternal confidence. Conclusions: This research showed that an SDNP improved maternal confidence in caring for an infant with CHD. Thus, an SDNP may be a valuable part of standard clinical practice in caring for infants with CHD.

AB  - The nuclear hormone receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) plays central roles in adipogenesis and glucose homeostasis and is the molecular target for the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class of antidiabetic drugs. Activation of PPARγ by TZDs improves insulin sensitivity; however, this is accompanied by the induction of several undesirable side effects. We have identified a novel synthetic PPARγ ligand, T2384, to explore the biological activities associated with occupying different regions of the receptor ligand-binding pocket. X-ray crystallography studies revealed that T2384 can adopt two distinct binding modes, which we have termed "U" and "S", interacting with the ligand-binding pocket of PPARγ primarily via hydrophobic contacts that are distinct from full agonists. The different binding modes occupied by T2384 induced distinct patterns of coregulatory protein interaction with PPARγ in vitro and displayed unique receptor function in cell-based activity assays. We speculate that these unique biochemical and cellular activities may be responsible for the novel in vivo profile observed in animals treated systemically with T2384. When administered to diabetic KKAγ mice, T2384 rapidly improved insulin sensitivity in the absence of weight gain, hemodilution, and anemia characteristics of treatment with rosiglitazone (a TZD). Moreover, upon coadministration with rosiglitazone, T2384 was able to antagonize the side effects induced by rosiglitazone treatment alone while retaining robust effects on glucose disposal. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that interactions between ligands and specific regions of the receptor ligand-binding pocket might selectively trigger a subset of receptor-mediated biological responses leading to the improvement of insulin sensitivity, without eliciting less desirable responses associated with full activation of the receptor. We suggest that T2384 may represent a prototype for a novel class of PPARγ ligand and, furthermore, that molecules sharing some of these properties would be useful for treatment of type 2 diabetes.

AB  - In this article, the volume resistivity of polypropylene (PP)/chlorinated polypropylene (CPP)/polyaniline (PANI) composites was detected. The results show that the volume resistivity of PP/CPP/PANI composites decreases with increasing CPP content, and there exists a minimum volume resistivity. The relationship between volume resistivity of the PP/CPP/PANI composites and CPP content can be explained by Fourier-transform infrared spectra (FTIR). Effects of CPP on the formation of the intermolecular and innermolecular hydrogen-bond in the PP/CPP/PANI composites were carefully investigated by FTIR. An iterative least-squares computer program was adopted to obtain the best FTIR fit curves of the PP/CPP/PANI composites by varying the wavenumber (nu), width at half-height (w(1/2)), and area (S) of several bands. The obtained semiquantitative results illuminate that the intermolecular and innermolecular H-bonded interaction of the PANI-DBSA is weakened by the introduction of CPP; the interactional strength between PANI-DBSA and CPP increases with increasing CIPP content, and there exists a maximum, which is favorable to disperse well PANI-DBSA in PP/CPP/PANI composites and improve the conductive property of the PP/CPP/PANI composites.

AB  - While the "clinical high-risk state" for psychosis has demonstrated good reliability and fair predictive validity for psychotic disorders, over 50% of identified subjects do not progress to psychosis. Despite the benefits that early detection and treatment might offer, debate concerning the official inclusion of a "psychosis risk syndrome" in the upcoming DSM-V frequently involves concerns about the impact of stigma on patients, families and institutions. We add to this debate by providing an analysis of the theoretical and empirical stigma literature to evaluate the potential effects of stigma associated with the psychosis risk syndrome. Theorists' conceptualizations of how stigma exerts its negative effects emphasize internalization of pejorative societal stereotypes ('self-stigma'), negative emotional reactions, harmful behavioral coping strategies, and structural discrimination as key mechanisms. Studies assessing the comparative effects of symptomatic behavior when compared with a psychiatric diagnosis label in predicting rejecting social attitudes indicate that treating symptomatic behaviors is likely to diminish overall stigma. However, any publically held 'preexisting conceptions' about what a psychosis risk syndrome means are still likely to exert negative effects. Additionally, particular features of this syndrome--that it occurs during adolescence when identity formation may be in flux--may also shape manifestations of stigma. Utilizing other well-established 'at-risk' conditions (e.g., genetic susceptibility) to model potential discrimination for this syndrome, we suggest that future discrimination is likely to occur in insurance and family domains. We conclude by proposing stigma measurement strategies, including recommending that field trials prior to DSM-V adopt systematic measures to assess any stigma that this psychosis risk syndrome might confer via future community use.

AB  - In recent years China has experienced a substantial increase in rural schooling levels and contemporaneous reforms in rural educational policies, including the nationwide adoption of free nine-year compulsory education, the two exempt and one compensation program, and the school consolidation policy. These developments point to the possibility that the determinants of rural education have changed. In this paper we examine empirically the determinants of rural high school attainment between 2002 and 2007. Using data from a nationwide household survey and a multilevel regression model with and without instrumental variables, we estimate the relationship between rural high school attainment and individual, family, and community level variables. We find that the size and significance of household income and other individual and household variables declined, while community characteristics and local public expenditures on schools continued to have a significant impact in both years. When we carry out the estimation using instrumental variables, the coefficients on parental education are no longer significant. We conclude that policy changes plus rapid income growth in rural China has brought about substantial change in the determinants of high school attainment, and that the widely observed correlation between parental and child education may be due to unobserved characteristics.

AB  - A core goal of inclusive education worldwide is to maximize the learning potential of students with special educational needs (SEN) in mainstream educational settings. However, little research attention has been paid to SEN children's social and emotional gains from inclusive education compared to their academic performance. This study included social, emotional, and academic variables in a single research design, not only to test their relationships but also to explore the predictive roles of social and emotional factors in academic performance for SEN students. Participants were 515 SEN students in grades 1-6 in mainstream primary schools in Hong Kong. The results showed that the social and emotional competences of children with SEN were significant predictors of their academic performance (p < .001), with emotional competence having the larger impact. Although SEN students' relationships with peers and teachers were not found to be direct significant predictors of academic performance as reported in previous studies; they positively and significantly predicted emotional and social competences of SEN students (p < .001). Implications for establishing a caring campus, as well as developing educational interventions which will increase SEN students' positive emotional experiences and foster and maintain their adaptive social and emotional competences are discussed.

AB  - Background: Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (HSP) is the most common necrotizing vasculitis affecting children. Traditional Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) was widely used. We aim to explore the evidence of effectiveness and safety of CHM for HSP in children without renal damage.Methods: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing CHM with conventional medications were searched from five databases. Eligible data were pooled using random-effects model using RevMan 5.2 Subgroup analysis for different co-interventions and sensitivity analysis for reducing heterogeneity were implemented. GRADE approach was adopted.Results: We included 15 trials with 1112HSP children (age 1-16 years old), disease duration one day to three months. The overall methodological quality of included trials is relatively low. Adjunctive oral CHM treatments reduced renal damage (6 trials, RR 0.47, 95%CI 0.31-0.72, I(2)=0%), and subsiding time (days) of purpura (5 trials, mean difference (MD) -3.60, 95%CI -4.21 to -2.99, I(2)=23%), joint pain (5 trials, MD -1.04, 95%CI -1.33 to -0.74, I(2)=1%) and abdomen pain (5 trials, MD -1.69, 95%CI -2.51 to -0.86, I(2)=74%). Subgroup and sensitivity analysis did not change the direction of results. No severe adverse events reported.Conclusions: Orally taken adjunctive CHM treatments are effective for children suffering HSP in terms of reducing renal damage and subsiding time of purpura, and could possibly reduce subsiding pain of joint and abdomen. No reliable conclusion regarding safety is possible based on the safety data retrieved. Further rigorous trials are warranted.

AB  - Domestic energy-efficient and renewable energy (EERE) equipment shows a great energy-saving potential in household energy consumption. Two rounds of large-scale financial subsidy programs have been developed in China since 2010 to promote the adoption of green equipment. However, how these subsidies attract Chinese families of different income levels is not fully explored. Given this knowledge gap, we conducted a self-completion questionnaire survey in 2012 to ask 526 respondents about their purchase of domestic EERE equipment We explored the effects of subsidy incentives and family incomes on the purchase attitudes and intentions of individuals toward the seven categories of EERE equipment We find that family income positively moderates the relationship between EERE equipment purchase attitude and behavioral intention, and subsidy incentives positively affect the moderating effect of family income. In other words, a higher family income and better familiarization with subsidy incentives can promote the transformation of green attitudes into EERE equipment purchasing intention. The results may indicate that the subsidized prices are still high in the view of the low-income families. This study contributes to the understanding of the effects of Chinese subsidy incentives and of the economic concerns of people about the purchase of domestic EERE equipment (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Arcto-Tertiary relict genera, Camptotheca, Davidia, and Nyssa represent deep lineages in the asterid order Cornales. Recent phylogenetic studies suggested that these genera should be placed in a newly circumscribed family, Nyssaceae. However, because these analyses were based upon a few genes, it is prudent and necessary to examine further evidence before adopting this taxonomic treatment. In this study, we determined the complete chloroplast (cp) genomes of Camptotheca acuminata, Davidia involucrata, and Nyssa sinensis. Their cp genomes ranged from 156,672 to 158,409 bp, which included 115 genes, and their genome features were highly similar to those of other species within the order Cornales. The phylogenetic relationships among the genera Camptotheca, Davidia, Nyssa, and 23 related taxa in the asterids were analyzed based on 73 protein-coding genes from the cp genomes. All of the previously recognized major clades (namely Cornales, Ericales, Campanulids, and Lamiids) in the asterids, as well as their relationships, were recovered with robust support. A clade including the genera Davidia, Nyssa, Camptotheca, and Diplopanax, was resolved as a well-supported monophyletic group, which was fully separated from the family Cornaceae by the family Hydrangeaceae. Our results provide novel evidence to support the acceptance of the family Nyssaceae outlined by the updated Angiosperm Phylogeny Group.

AB  - Although weak social bonds are found to be associated with addictive behaviors in cross-sectional studies, few studies have explored the longitudinal impacts of social bonds on nonmedical prescription drug use (NPDU). This study adopted a developmental perspective on social bonds and tested how their different trajectories are associated with NPDU among adults. With panel surveys from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health from 1994 to 2008, this study employed group-based latent trajectory modeling to obtain the different trajectories of social bonds including religious, civic, familial, educational, and marital, and then used them as predictors of NPDU while controlling for potential confounders and the baseline NPDU. The findings show that constant and high-level social bonds significantly reduce the risk of NPDU, except for educational bond. However, for religious, civic, and educational bonds, the low initial trajectories are not significantly different from the high-decrease trajectories, implying that strong early-life social bonds do not prevent NPDU if such bonds register a recent decline. Weak social bonds constitute significant risk of NPDU for adults in their late twenties, and recent social bonds override the contribution of early-life bonds in most cases. Policy makers may consider strategies to sustain the active and meaningful participation in conventional institutions, and not solely rely on programs that facilitate early-life social integration.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The prescriber's directions to the patient (Sig) are one of the most quality-sensitive components of a prescription order. Owing to their free-text format, the Sig data that are transmitted in electronic prescriptions (e-prescriptions) have the potential to produce interpretation challenges at receiving pharmacies that may threaten patient safety and also negatively affect medication labeling and patient counseling. Ensuring that all data transmitted in the e-prescription are complete and unambiguous is essential for minimizing disruptions in workflow at prescribers' offices and receiving pharmacies and optimizing the safety and effectiveness of patient care. OBJECTIVES: To (a) assess the quality and variability of free-text Sig strings in ambulatory e-prescriptions and (b) propose best-practice recommendations to improve the use of this quality-sensitive field. METHODS: A retrospective qualitative analysis was performed on a nationally representative sample of 25,000 e-prescriptions issued by 22,152 community-based prescribers across the United States using 501 electronic health records (EHRs) or e-prescribing software applications. The content of Sig text strings in e-prescriptions was classified according to a Sig classification scheme developed with guidance from an expert advisory panel. The Sig text strings were also analyzed for quality-related events (QREs). For purposes of this analysis, QREs were defined as Sig text content that could impair accurate and unambiguous interpretation by staff at receiving pharmacies. RESULTS: A total of 3,797 unique Sig concepts were identified in the 25,000 Sig text strings analyzed; more than 50% of all Sigs could be categorized into 25 unique Sig concepts. Even Sig strings that expressed apparently simple and straightforward concepts displayed substantial variability; for example, the sample contained 832 permutations of words and phrases used to convey the Sig concept of ``Take 1 tablet by mouth once daily.{''} Approximately 10% of Sigs contained QREs that could pose patient safety risks or workflow disruptions that could necessitate pharmacist callbacks to prescribers for clarification or other manual interventions. CONCLUSIONS: The quality of free-text patient directions in e-prescriptions can vary dramatically. However, more than half of all patient directions sent in the ambulatory setting can be categorized into only 25 Sig concepts. This suggests an immediate, practical opportunity to improve patient safety and workflow efficiency for both prescribers and pharmacies. Recommendations include implementing enhancements to Sig creation tools in e-prescribing and EHR software applications, adoption of the Structured and Codified Sig format supported by the current national e-prescribing standard, and improved usability testing and end-user training for generating complete and unambiguous patient directions. Such quality improvements are essential for optimizing the safety and effectiveness of patient care as well as for minimizing workflow disruptions to both prescribers and pharmacies.

AB  - The 21st century is witnessing an escalating epidemic of type 2 diabetes around the world. This highly prevalent public health issue poses a great challenge to the health care system. Older adults are identified as an especially vulnerable group with the highest prevalence than any other age group. To empower patients with effective self-care to manage the lifelong missions brought by type 2 diabetes has been suggested as the key to eliminate the heavy burden of this disease. As the core concept of salutogenic model, sense of coherence is an important inner strength to influence people's ability to advance towards health when facing stressful situation. Recent studies have consistently demonstrated its significant relationships with better health-related outcomes. Initial findings also suggested a positive association between sense of coherence and self-care in type 2 diabetes patients. However, no interventional studies have adopted the salutogenic model to strengthen self-care of older adults with type 2 diabetes so far. The overall aim of this study was to examine the effect of a strengths-based intervention program based on salutogenic model [Be the Expert of Your Own (BEYO program)] in promoting self-care and sense of coherence of older adults with type 2 diabetes. This study included two phases. Phase One explored the relationship between sense of coherence and self-care of type 2 diabetes patients, thereby supporting the significance of employing salutogenic model to promote self-care in Phase Two. Phase Two developed the BEYO program for community-dwelling older adults with type 2 diabetes, and evaluated the effectiveness of such a program on self-care, sense of coherence, diabetes-related distress and quality of life. Phase One adopted a descriptive, correlational research design. Consecutive sampling method was used to recruit 195 patients with type 2 diabetes from outpatient diabetic clinics of three university-affiliated hospitals in central south China. Results generated from Pearson product-moment correlation analysis demonstrated that patients with stronger sense of coherence reported higher levels of self-care (r = 0.302, p < 0.01). After adjusting for the confounding effect from demographic and clinical variables, depressive symptoms, social support and knowledge in multiple linear regression model, stronger sense of coherence was found to be associated with better self-care (B = 0.255, p < 0.01). The BEYO program was then developed based on theoretical framework, integrative review and up-to-date guideline. The program contained five structured sessions weekly delivered in group-based format to cover six core areas in diabetes management: healthy dietary, exercise, taking medication, blood glucose self-monitoring, reducing risks of complication, and coping with mental stress. Each session was around 60 minutes with six steps: health education, discuss self-care experience and identify challenge, describe exceptions, explore the strengths, miracle question and scaling, and establish the action plan. Every group contained one facilitator, one research assistant and four participants Phase Two was a two-arm randomized controlled trial. A total of 154 community-dwelling older adults with type 2 diabetes were randomly allocated to either the experimental (n = 77) or the control group (n = 77). The experimental group attended the BEYO program while the control group received the diabetic education program. Self-care, sense of coherence, diabetes-related distress and quality of life were measured at baseline (T0), one-week post-test endpoint (T1), and three-month post-test endpoint (T2). The effects of the BEYO program were analyzed using generalized estimating equation models. Results demonstrated that participants in the experimental group had significant improvement in general diet (T1: B: 1.053; p < 0.001), specific diet (T1: B: 0.593; p < 0.01), self-monitoring of blood glucose (T1: B: 0.835; p < 0.001), and sense of coherence (T1: B: 6.339; p < 0.001) at the first post-test study endpoint. Significant improvement was reported at both of the two post-test study endpoints in exercise (T1: B: 1.466; p < 0.001; T2: B: 1.134; p = 0.001) and foot care (T1: B: 2.629; p < 0.001; T2: B: 1.237; p < 0.001). The experimental group also reported significant reduction in diabetes-related distress across the study endpoints (T1: B: -0.695; p < 0.001; T2: B: -0.515; p < 0.001). No significant change was found in life domain-specific quality of life in the experimental group. This study is the first to demonstrate the effectiveness of a self-care program using strengths-based techniques based on salutogenic model for older adults with type 2 diabetes in community settings. The findings highlight the importance to identify the patients' strengths in managing diabetes and facilitate them to use such internal and external resources systematically in disease management. This study generates knowledge about a new working paradigm based on salutogenic model, which can be adopted by the health care professionals to optimize self-care behaviors of older adults with type 2 diabetes.

AB  - Background: Circ-ITCH is a circRNA generated from several exons of itchy E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (ITCH) and tumor suppressor served as a sponge for certain miRNAs targeting their parental transcripts of ITCH. However, the role of circ- ITCH in bladder cancer (BCa) was not reported. In the present study, we investigated the role of circ-ITCH in BCa. Methods: Quantitative real-time PCR was used to detect the expression of circ-ITCH and survival analysis was adopted to explore the association between circ-ITCH expression and the prognosis of BCa. BCa cells were stably transfected with lentivirus approach and cell proliferation, migration, invasion, cell cycle and cell apoptosis, as well as tumorigenesis in nude mice were performed to assess the effect of circ-ITCH in BCa. Biotin-coupled probe pull down assay, Biotin-coupled miRNA capture, Fluorescence in situ hybridization and Luciferase reporter assay were conducted to confirm the relationship between the circ-ITCH and the microRNA. Results: In the present study, we found that circ-ITCH, is down-regulated in BCa tissues and cell lines. BCa patients with low circ-ITCH expression had shortened survival. Enforced- expression of circ-ITCH inhibited cells proliferation, migration, invasion and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that circ-ITCH up-regulates the expression of miR-17 and miR-224 target gene p21 and PTEN through 'sponging' miR-17 and miR-224, which suppressed the aggressive biological behaviors of BCa. Conclusions: circ-ITCH acts as a tumor suppressor by a novel circ-ITCH/miR-17, miR-224/p21, PTEN axis, which may provide a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for the management of BCa.

AB  - In the era of big data, healthcare practitioners are increasingly generating and analyzing data. The huge volume of data provides opportunities for evidence based medicine to answer research and practical questions, and for individuals to make better informed, smarter decision. Yet, making sense of massive healthcare datasets remains a fundamental challenge. In order to make inferences on the data, an effective visual representations of the data is needed. We propose visualization as a means to derive inferences on healthcare data. Design of visual analytics tools, therefore, becomes important in the healthcare domain. Healthcare is a broad area involving users with high variation in roles, expertise, and background. The diverse characteristics of users and their shifting contexts makes it a challenge to process and to present healthcare data in appropriate visual representations that is directly relevant to the analytics tasks. We advocate using the User-Centered Design (UCD) approach in designing and developing visual analytics tools in healthcare. The core research question is how a user centered approach should be adopted in designing visual analytics tools. We address the question by bringing the user centered design process and visual analytics process together, and by applying interdisciplinary methods, such as data mining, information visualization and network analytics. In particular, the dissertation looks to three studies in the healthcare domain where practitioners follow UCD to design visual analytics in healthcare domain. We emphasis the role of user involvement in the entire iterative design lifecycle. The users spanning these studies include patients, physicians, nanomaterial scientists, biomedical professionals, and healthcare policy makers. The three studies are: 1. Developing a visual web-based tool called VisOSA to interpret and explore medical records of patients with sleep apnea. For physicians, the ClinicView provides an interactive tool to have an overview of the entire medical record of patients including anomalies, and therefore help with generating research hypothesis. For patients, the PatientView allows the lay individual without any medical background to understand their health conditions under treatment at a glance. We also defined medical dashboard in this study. We conducted a supporting quantitative behavioral research to examine the effect of multiple monitors on people's performance. Results suggested that the medical dashboard needs to be arranged as that the most important information is in a single screen. 2. Studying the nanomaterial environmental impact (NEI) is a critical task in nano-health and safety. The information visualization module for NEIMiner is a visual analytic tool that can efficiently query and present large-scale bibliography meta-data, NEI characterizations and nanomaterial toxicity. It supports nanomaterial scientists and analysts to explore the concepts and relationships in studying nanomaterial toxicity and its impact on health. 3. Translating research findings into effective clinical care is another overwhelming task. VATS is a scalable multi-scale visual analytical tool for advancing translational sciences. The system integrates the data of National Center for Advancing Translational Science (NCATS) funded projects and publications from NIH Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools (RePORTER) and PubMed, and helps healthcare policy makers to understand the big picture of translational science and to evaluate the impact of NCATS funded projects through publicly available data sources. Through these studies, we discuss how innovative visual analytics techniques and capabilities with help users understand and act on various type of data.

AB  - ObjectiveHealth care workers performing rescue tasks in large-scale disaster areas are usually challenged in terms of physical and mental endurance, which can affect their lifestyles. Nevertheless, data on whether health care workers tend to adopt healthy lifestyles after disasters are limited. This paper compares the adoption of healthy lifestyle behaviors among health care workers with that among non-health care workers in a postdisaster area.MethodsThis cross-sectional observational study was conducted in August 2016. The Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile II questionnaire was used to interview 261 health care workers and 848 non-health care workers.ResultsResults of the multivariable linear models showed that health care workers had lower physical activity levels (beta=-1.363, P<.0001), worse stress management (beta=-1.282, P<.0001), slower spiritual growth (beta=-1.228, P=.002), and poorer interpersonal relationships (beta=-0.814, P=.019) than non-health care workers. However, no significant differences were found in either nutrition (beta=-0.362, P=.319) or health responsibility (beta=-0.421, P=.283).ConclusionsHealth care workers had less healthy lifestyle behaviors, including physical activity, stress management, spiritual growth, and interpersonal relationships. Further studies are needed to develop health-improving interventions for health care workers in postdisaster areas. (Disaster Med Public Health Preparedness. 2019;13:230-235)

AB  - The article focuses on the development of the Special Supplement Food Program for Women, Infants and Children in the U.S. The program aims to determine the relationship of nutrition to infant health. The author claims that the program has been drafted by advocacy groups and promoted to the Congress for them to adopt the program that would provide effective health services. However, he emphasizes the need for the program's significance to be justified by the government before introducing and implementing it.

AB  - Background: In response to concerns about the availability and quality of women’s health services in Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers in the early 1990s, Congress approved landmark legislation earmarking funds to enhance women’s health services. A portion of the appropriation was used to launch Comprehensive Women’s Health Centers as exemplars for the development of VA women’s health care throughout the system. We report on the diffusion and characteristics of VA women’s health clinics (WHCs) 10 years later. Methods: In 2001, we surveyed the senior women’s health clinician at each VA medical center serving ≥400 women veterans (83% response rate) regarding their internal organizational characteristics in relation to factors associated with organizational innovation (centralization, complexity, formalization, interconnectedness, organizational slack, size). We evaluated the comparability of WHCs (n = 66) with characteristics of the original comprehensive women’s health centers (CWHCs; n = 8). Results: Gender-specific service availability in WHCs was comparable to that of CWHCs with important exceptions in mental health, mammography and osteoporosis management. WHCs were less likely to have same-gender providers (p < .05), women’s health training programs (p < .01), separate women’s mental health clinics (p < .001), separate space (p < .05), or adequate privacy (p < .05); however, they were less likely to have experienced educational program closures (p < .001) and staffing losses (p < .05) compared to CWHCs. Conclusions: Diffusion of comprehensive women’s health care is as yet incomplete. More research is needed to examine the quality of care associated with these models and to establish the business case for managers faced with small female patient caseloads.

AB  - The purpose of this qualitative study is to examine principals' perceptions of their responsibilities for English language learners (ELLs) and their beliefs about what contributes to these students' academic success. The growing population of ELLs in the US face increased risk for underachievement, as recorded by traditional measures, yet little research investigates the critical role of the principal in the education of ELLs. This study focuses on 7 principals (nominated by other educators as exemplary) in public schools with high enrollments of ELLs found in rural, suburban, and urban districts in a northeastern state. Data came from individual open-ended initial interviews and member-checking interviews. Thematic analysis of the data revealed 5 themes: (a) Student Progress, (b) Fostering Relationships, (c) Parents and Community, (d) Having 'The Right People,' and (e) Language Development. These themes describe the research participants' self-reported responsibilities for ELLs and their perceptions of what contributes to ELLs' academic success. Twenty-two subthemes were identified, called Key Administrative Practices (KAPs). These KAPs are the ways in which the participants reported carrying out their responsibilities, i.e., their practices. The responsibility Fostering Relationships, with the following KAPs: (a) building comfort, respect, trust, and a sense of belonging; (b) motivating students and demonstrating care and compassion; (c) understanding and accepting differences; and (d) dealing with the closed-mindedness and lack of understanding of staff members, appears to be a contribution to the literature. The study contains a review of the literature in second language acquisition (SLA); in English language development (ELD) programs; in educational leadership in general; in inclusive educational leadership for culturally and linguistically diverse (CLD) students; and in educational leadership for ELLs. This project compares the research findings with leadership frameworks from Waters, Marzano, and McNulty (2003), Riehl (2000), and Hamayan and Freeman (2006). It also discusses implications for principal preparation and practice and provides suggestions for further research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: Premature dropout is a significant concern in trauma-focused psychotherapy for youth. Previous studies have primarily examined pre-treatment demographic and symptom-related predictors of dropout, but few consistent findings have been reported. The current study examined demographic, symptom, and in-session process variables as predictors of dropout from Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) for youth. Method: Participants were a diverse sample of Medicaid-eligible youth (ages 7–17; n = 108) and their non-offending caregivers (n = 86), who received TF-CBT through an effectiveness study in a community setting. In-session process variables were coded from audio-recorded sessions, and these and pre-treatment demographic variables and symptom levels were examined as predictors of dropout prior to receiving an adequate dose of TF-CBT (< 7 sessions). Twenty-nine children were classified as dropouts and 79 as completers. Results: Binary logistic regression analyses revealed that higher levels of child and caregiver avoidance expressed during early sessions, as well as greater relationship difficulties between the child and therapist, predicted dropout. Those children who were in foster care during treatment were less likely to drop out than children living with parents or relatives. No other demographic or symptom-related factors predicted dropout. Conclusions: These findings highlight the importance of addressing avoidance and therapeutic relationship difficulties in early sessions of TF-CBT to help reduce dropout, and they have implications for improving efforts to disseminate evidence-based trauma-focused treatments.

AB  - Background: Nowadays artificially assisted reproductive techniques are used to cure infertility. These methods are highly expensive, time-consuming and have low success rates which are usually around 20-40%. One of the best alternate methods for infertility treatment that can be considered is adoption that often decreases the treatment costs and the psychological impact within an infertile couple. Objective: This study has been done with the aim of determining adoption acceptance rates and the effective factors of adoption in infertile couples. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed between October 2009-2010 on 200 infertile couples who had been referred to Infertility Center of Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences. Information gathered through face-to-face interview and questionnaires. The data analyzed through a SPSS software program using ANOVA test. Results: There was a significant statistical relationship between adoption acceptance value scores and marriage duration of a couple (p=0.002 in men, p=0.004 in women) and presence of adoption backgrounds in male relatives (p=0.004). There was no statistically significant relationship between age, gender, education level, and onus of infertility, the number of previous referrals for an infertility solution and presence of adoption backgrounds in female relatives. Conclusion: Adoption as an alternative option to infertility treatment need to be more considered as a medical, social and cultural issue.

AB  - While cultural competence has been promoted as a way to reduce mental health disparities among ethnic minority populations, there remains a gap between theory and practice. This study examined the use of the Culturally Enhanced Videofeedback Engagement (CEVE) intervention as a clinical tool to facilitate culturally anchored shared understanding to foster treatment engagement among ethnic minority families with children with disruptive behavior disorders (DBDs) participating in a family clinic. In-depth qualitative analysis of individual interviews compared parents’ experiences of the therapy process among 9 intervention families and 10 families participating in treatment as usual. Thematic analysis of semistructured interviews with parents revealed that for families in the intervention group, clinician cultural and clinical competence and the therapeutic relationship were important characteristics of the intervention condition that enhanced parents’ experience of treatment.

AB  - Over the past 40 years, child maltreatment research has become a demanding, distinct and distinguished field of empirical inquiry. A relative latecomer to this area, child emotional maltreatment has lagged behind other forms of maltreatment in research funding, publishing, and practice. This special section represents an extension and expansion of these early conversations. While the focus is on youth outcomes, we also consider issues central to definition, identification, and intervention. Adopting a developmental psychopathology perspective, this section addresses the impact of childhood emotional maltreatment on adolescent and young adult adjustment with respect to both psychopathology and competence. The studies herein employ process-level analyses to identify specific mechanisms by which emotional maltreatment influences later adjustment above and beyond its comorbidity with other forms of malevolent caregiving. To the end of this journal elucidate the multidimensional nature of emotional maltreatment in an effort to identify unique effects of child emotional maltreatment experiences on adolescent and young adult adaptation.

AB  - Religious fundamentalism is an influential phenomenon in the United States. In an increasingly pluralistic society, school social workers and mental health counselors practice with, diverse religious populations, which include those who embrace fundamentalist belief systems. Moreover, school social workers, psychologists, and counselors often serve as the principal resource for educating, building, and sustaining relationships, and helping to foster ongoing communication among school personnel, students, and their families. The goal is to formulate and support interventions needed for ameliorating problems in living that impact students and families in the school environment and beyond. Practitioners thus need to be familiar with a growing and increasingly diverse number of religious traditions and spiritualities that students may embrace, including the qualities and distinctions of the religious fundamentalist worldview. Likewise, practitioners must be sensitive to particular challenges, both interpersonal and systemic, that may arise in schools with these populations. Furthermore, it is important for practitioners to identify and adopt resources for effective practice that respect and draw on what clients believe, value, and determine they need, on the one hand, and what practice standards, values, and ethics require, on the other. Given the prominence of Response to Intervention (RTI) as a framework for service delivery, it is critical that school-based practitioners be able to attend to these matters in a culturally competent manner within an RTI framework. What is important to our discussion here is to understand prevalent characteristics within fundamentalist and religiously conservative communities so that we can work successfully with adhering students and families. Before beginning that discussion, however, it is important to point out that just like issues of immigrant or ethnic-minority status, there are within-group differences, and holding to a religious belief system of any sort involves matters of degree. The school mental health practitioner should always inquire about how important religion is to a client, and not assume any particular religious background or qualities thereof.

AB  - Background: Chronic low back pain induces disability and chronicity, and has long been identified as a major medical and social problem. The pain management program, which is delivered in the early stage of back pain, has been demonstrated to be effective in reducing disability and chronicity of low back pain. The use of the biopsychosocial model has added merit to it in recent decades. In Hong Kong, people suffering from acute back pain normally attend the Accident and Emergency Department and seek medical treatment. Physiotherapy, medication and bed rest in Emergency Medicine Ward (EMW) is the usual care, but physiotherapy has limited quotas and service hours. If the quota is exceeded or patients attend after 5pm, they need to stay in the EMW and physiotherapy is provided the next day. Pain management would be delayed. Biopsychosocial aspects are seldom addressed in usual care. A study was proposed and built on the prevention-as-intervention concept of Neuman Systems Model (NSM) focusing on the prevention of disability and relieving pain.Aims and Objectives: The aim of this study was to examine the effect of a nurse-initiated early pain management program (NIEPMP) on acute back pain patients in the Emergency Medicine Ward (EMW). NIEPMP consists of physiological and psychosocial therapeutic components designed to manage LBP. The four objectives were as follows: to examine the effects of NIEPMP on (1) preventing disability, (2) relieving pain, (3) reducing anxiety, and (4) promoting patient satisfaction among acute LBP patients in EMW.Design: This study adopted repeated measures, randomized controlled trial in a pragmatic approach.Participants and Randomization: An Accident and Emergency Department of a regional hospital in the Kowloon Central Cluster was the main site of the study. Patients who suffered from back pain with less than 4-week duration before presenting to the AED were recruited after the service hours of physiotherapy. Random assignment of eligible participants was performed. They were assigned to an intervention group and a control group using SNOSE (sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes) method.Methods: NIEPMP combined the interventions of a physiological therapeutic component (fifteen minutes of heat therapy) and thirty minutes of psychosocial therapeutic component (reassurance and health education booklet). The intervention group received NIEPMP soon after randomization and preliminary data collection. The usual care of using pain medications and 'next-day' physiotherapy was delivered to the control group. During their stay in EMW, all participants received conventional medical treatments as prescribed. Caregivers were blinded.Outcome Measures: Data collection was performed at baseline (T0), end of treatment (T1), and at 1-week (T2), 1-month (T3) and 3-month (T4) follow-up. Disability was the primary outcome for this study. Outcome measures included the Hong Kong version of the Roland and Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) for pain intensity and patient satisfaction, and the short form Chinese version of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (SF-CSTAI). Patients' perceptions about the education booklet (the intervention group only), exercise and self-management strategies of pain were collected using open-ended questions.Results: 130 participants were randomized into two groups. Repeated measures ANOVA was employed to compare the intervention and control group. Results showed that there was significant improvement at all time points, from baseline to 3-month between the intervention group and the control group on disability scores (p=0.000), pain intensity (p=0.000), anxiety level (p=0.000) and satisfaction level (p=0.000). Participants from the intervention group expressed a more positive attitude towards early mobilization (improvement of beliefs), less reluctance to exercise (less fear-avoidance), and appreciated the usefulness of the education booklet.Conclusion: NIEPMP was effective for acute back pain patients in the emergency setting in terms of developing less disability, relieving pain, reducing anxiety and promoting satisfaction without any adverse/side effects noted. Self-management of acute back pain is promoted by NIEPMP through a combined biopsychosocial therapeutic approach. It is suggested NIEPMP may reduce pain through the interplay of a positive cognition, and modulation of emotional, sensory and behavioral components of pain. Results of the study imply that early activation of the pain management program, as early as in the emergency setting, seems promising in preventing acute back pain patients from developing disability.

AB  - Background: Resilience is commonly used to refer to the capacity to resist negative psychological reactions when encountering aversive circumstances. However, clinicians generally define resilience as a lack of psychological distress or an adoption of positive attitude in response to a potentially traumatic event. Although resilience was initially considered to be a psychological variable, it has gradually become seen as a psychosocial indictor now used in clinical settings in the Western world but is still a relatively new topic in most Eastern countries. In this study, we aimed to extend our understandings of the psychological responses of a group of mainland Chinese parents upon being informed that their children were diagnosed with cancer, using resilience as a major indicator. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the level of resilience among mainland Chinese parents in response to knowing that their children were diagnosed with cancer and to examine the relationships between resilience and other psychosocial outcomes. Methods: A descriptive and a cross-sectional survey design was used and involved a sample of 125 parents who visited a specialist cancer hospital in southeast China between September 2013 and February 2014. Results: The participants reported lower level of resilience as compared with a control population in the Chinese community (P < .01). Resilience was negatively correlated with uncertainty in illness (P < .01) and depression (P < .01) and was positively correlated with social support (P < .01) and all other positive coping strategies subscales (P < .01). Parents from the high- resilience group reported better psychosocial functions than did those from the low-resilience group (P < .01). In addition, 6 influencing factors were identified and entered into the multiple linear regression equation of psychological resilience, which predicts 38.3% (adjusted R-2) of total variation in psychological resilience. Conclusion: A high level of resilience in parents of children diagnosed with cancer is associated with better psychosocial function in response to the traumatic event. Implications for Clinical Practice: Additional attention should be given to those Mainland Chinese parents who demonstrated a low level of resilience in response to their child's diagnosis. This is particularly important because of the long and stressful process for cancer treatment. Clinicians should also provide targeted interventions to those parents to promote their psychological resilience.

AB  - Background: Due to lack of companionship of parents, compared with non left behind children, left behind children (LBC) suffer from more psychological problems compared with children live with their parents. The aim of this study was to explore the mental health status and the relationship among psychological problems and the related factors of LBC. Method: Adopting delaminating-random-group sampling and using region, county, village (town) as sampling framework, we utilized Demographic Data Recording Form, Adolescent Self-Rating Life Events Check List, Scale of APGAR, Perceived Social Support Scale, Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire, Eysenck Personality Questionnaire, Self-Esteem Scale and Scale of Mental Health for Chinese Middle-school Student to assess 1309 left behind child in junior middle school students' mental health in Hunan. Statistic description, Structural equation model was adopted to analyze the data. Result: There was a significant difference in score of psychological problems between LBC and non-LBC(F = 18.224, P<0.000). Life event was the major factor(r = .487) that affected psychological problems (path coefficient, PC = 0.08) directly and affect psychological problems indirectly through affecting passive coping (PC = 0.01)and family functioning(PC = 0.02); family functioning impacted psychological problems indirectly through affecting social support (PC = 4.89) and self-esteem (PC = 0.10); social support (PC = -0.02), passive coping (PC =0.07) and active coping PC = -0.04) affected psychological problems directly. Psychoticism (P) (PC = 0.11), Neuroticism (N) influenced psychological problems of LBC both directly (PC = 0.04) and indirectly through affecting self-esteem (PC: P:-1.87; N: -0.83), while Extraversion/Introversion (E) (PC = 0.21) only impact psychological problems indirectly through self-esteem. Altogether, these variables accounted for 50.2% of total variance of psychological problems (F = 130.470, P = 0.000) for LBC. Conclusion: In this research we proved that LBC have more sever psychological problems than non-LBC. We also identified the direct and indirect influential factors of psychological problems of LBC. The findings had important implications for prevention policies and interventions to promote mental health of LBC.

AB  - Objective To identify social and environmental barriers to nutrition therapy for diabetes management during pregnancy among a population of low-income, minority pregnant women. Design Prospective, in-depth, semi-structured interviews performed serially during pregnancy and continued until thematic saturation was reached. Setting Urban academic medical center. Participants Ten pregnant low-income, minority women with gestational diabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Phenomenon of Interest Social and environmental barriers to nutrition therapy for diabetes management during pregnancy. Analysis Qualitative analysis of interview data using electronic coding software was performed using theme analysis. Results Participants perceived limited ability and self-efficacy to adopt nutrition recommendations. Specific themes identified as barriers included (1) feeling overwhelmed by the unfamiliar; (2) using and decoding nutrition labels; (3) managing nutrition choices and seeking control in the setting of food insecurity; (4) experiencing lack of control and motivation, and limited self-efficacy; (5) balancing recommendations with taste preferences and cultural food norms; (6) maintaining a healthy eating schedule; and (7) accommodating diabetes in family and social life. Conclusions and Implications Pregnant women with diabetes encounter a number of knowledge-based, attitudinal, and resource-related barriers that reduce capacity for nutrition therapy adherence. Provision of culturally informed, practical nutrition support that addresses the needs of women in low-resource communities is an important component of comprehensive diabetes care during pregnancy.

AB  - The boom of in-home monitoring technology offers unprecedented information about an individual's interaction with the environment. A variety of low cost sensors can continuously and unobtrusively collect information about activities in the living space. Capturing early changes in the daily routines of vulnerable older adults residing in these 'smart homes' may allow clinicians to predict and prevent negative health consequences through timely intervention. However, the current state of science is hampered by the lack of theoretically driven approaches to analyze sensor data in relation to clinically meaningful health outcomes. The aims of the study are 1) to characterize an older adult's daily routine, as captured with smart home sensors, 2) to assess if deviations from it are indicative of changes in their health trajectory, such as falls, ER visits or unplanned hospitalizations, and 3) identify between person factors that affect the characteristics of the daily routine. It used previously collected data from 10 residents of TigerPlace, a unique retirement facility that evaluates health technology affiliated with University of Missouri, Columbia. Older adults live in apartments equipped with network of motion, depth and bed sensors that unobtrusively collect information about daily activity of its resident. Thirty months of continuous sensor data were analyzed in the context of bi-annual clinical assessments and nursing notes extracted from the electronic health record. A retrospective multiple case study approach is guided by the conceptual model developed for this study that is grounded in nursing and gerontological literature. Changes in the temporality and frequency of daily activity were found for common geriatric symptoms, such as urinary symptoms and confusion. Seasonal and weekly effect was evident across participants in the duration of time spent in various areas of the apartment. Participants varied in their baseline daily routines, but for the majority of symptoms there were prodromal changes in at home activity that was detected with sensors. As the cost of technology adoption decreases, nurses can use these innovative tools to coordinate care and intervene early to prevent or mitigate the functional decline associated with vulnerable older adults.

AB  - Some teachers adopt a blended learning model that combines traditional classroom teaching and an e-learning system. In this model, a teacher may teach the first few sessions in a classroom. After the students have established a general idea of the course. they can then proceed to on-line learning and interaction. This study aimed to discover the relationship between learning records and the learning effect in a blended e-learning environment through multiple regression analysis. The learning records considered included the grades for online assignments, reading time. the total number of login times, and the total number of online discussions. The learning, effect was defined as the total grade for two monthly exams and one final exam. To collect learning record data, an e-learning system was designed that integrates the data collection functionality of learning activities with a teaching material managing module so that the learning records of all the learners are recorded automatically. With this system, an experiment was conducted on a program design course in a local high school. The results differed from those obtained in a `pure' e-learning setting, and the online homework performance was the only item that significantly accounted for the learning effect, which is a natural result of learning procedural knowledge.

AB  - Abstract: Cerebrovascular disease has been ranked the second or third of top 10 death causes in Taiwan and has caused about 13,000 people death every year since 1986. Once cerebrovascular disease occurs, it not only leads to huge cost of medical care, but even death. All developed countries in the world put cerebrovascular disease prevention and treatment in high priority, and invested considerable budget and human resource in long-term studies, in order to reduce the heavy burden. As the pathogenesis of cerebrovascular disease is complex and variable, it is hard to make accurate diagnosis in advance. However, in perspective of preventive medicine, it is necessary to build a predictive model to enhance the accurate diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease. Therefore, coupled with the 2007 cerebrovascular disease prevention and treatment program of a regional teaching hospital in Taiwan, this study aimed to apply the classification technology to construct an optimum cerebrovascular disease predictive model. From this predictive model, cerebrovascular disease classification rules were extracted and used to improve the diagnosis and prediction of cerebrovascular disease. This study acquired 493 valid samples from this cerebrovascular disease prevention and treatment program, and adopted three classification algorithms, decision tree, Bayesian classifier and back propagation neural network, to construct classification models, respectively. After analyzing and comparing classification efficiencies – sensitivity and accuracy, the decision tree constructed model was chosen as the optimum predictive model for cerebrovascular disease. In this model, the sensitivity and accuracy were 99.48% and 99.59%, respectively, and eight important influence factors of predicting cerebrovascular disease and 16 diagnosis classification rules were extracted. Five experienced cerebrovascular doctors assessed these rules, and confirmed them to be useful to the current clinical medical condition.

AB  - Objectives: In Taiwan, the classification of real problems of children with appropriate occupational therapy is a difficult job for the therapist. The complexities of 127 attribute values to be evaluated in the assessment, the misleading diagnosis which may be made by the pediatrician and the shortage of manpower cause of high workload for the therapist. The design of an easy to use and effective classification model is therefore an important issue in children's occupational therapy treatment. This study accordingly applies an artificial neural network (ANN) and classification and regression tree (CART) techniques to skeleton an intelligent classification model in order to provide a comprehensive framework to assist the therapist to raise the accuracy when categorizing children's problems for occupational therapy. These categories with critical attributes under the guidelines of the American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA) are discussed, in order to assist the therapist for precise assessment and appropriate treatment. To the best of our knowledge, no research has yet been conducted on the problems' characteristics in children's occupational therapy. Methods: Based on the advice and assistance of the therapists and occupational therapy treatment needed, 127 outpatients from a regional hospital in Taiwan between 2007 and 2010 were selected as the data sets for problems in children occupation classification. This study accordingly suggests an intelligent model for the classification which integrates ANN and CART. The major steps in applying the model include: (1) building an ANN higher performance trained model; and (2) adopting CART to the trained model and building in previous steps, to extract the critical attributes of children occupational problems. Results: The results showed that artificial neural network had a higher accuracy, up to 84%, with evenly distributed datasets. Then high performance of the trained neural network had been extracted for the rules by using the classification tree approach in the classification and regression trees application. Most important of all, this study indicated that some of the rules can correctly identify up to 67% of the problems of the children with 100% confidence, which is much better than the current evaluations being used. Moreover, the tree with a binary variable of age and 8 predicators were found and listed afterward, such as, gross coordination, upper left muscle tone, interpersonal skill, proprioceptive and vestibular, visual, visual stimulus input for influence of emotional and movement, swallowing, and dressing. Actual implementation showed that the intelligent classification model is capable of integrating ANN and CART techniques to clarify children's occupational therapy problems with considerable accuracy. Conclusions: The model could be employed as a supporting system in making decisions regarding children problems with occupational therapy classifications and treatment. The rules extracted from CART were helpful to therapists in classifying what category the real problems of the children belonged to. This study expected that more machine learning techniques will certainly play an essential role in future children occupational therapy applications. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Hypnosis is a brief intervention ready for wider dissemination in medical contexts. Overall, hypnosis remains underused, despite evidence supporting its beneficial clinical impact. This review will evaluate the evidence supporting hypnosis for dissemination using guidelines formulated by Glasgow, Vogt, and Boles (1999). Five dissemination dimensions will be considered: reach, efficacy, adoption, implementation, and maintenance (RE-AIM). Hypnosis is capable of a wide reach in medical settings because the intervention can help a diverse range of individuals with a variety of problems. Efficacy studies support the use of hypnosis for chronic pain, acute pain, and emotional distress arising from medical procedures and conditions, cancer-treatment-related side-effects, and irritable bowel syndrome. Although adoption of hypnosis is currently limited, evidence suggests that patients and healthcare providers are open to trying hypnosis and may become more so when educated about what hypnosis can do. Implementation of hypnosis into medical settings can occur with ease because hypnosis is a brief intervention capable of being administered effectively by a range of health care providers. Maintenance will likewise be attainable given the low resource needs of hypnosis, opportunities for reimbursement, and the ability of the intervention to potentially help medical settings reduce costs. In sum, hypnosis has the qualities necessary to be integrated into routine care in medical settings in a self-sustaining way and is a promising candidate for further dissemination.

AB  - This exploratory study assessed and evaluated psychological responses and parenting skills among substance-abusing mothers receiving methadone maintenance treatment. Our findings show that mothers using alcohol, cannabis, and LSD have more stress about their role as a parent. Present findings are consistent with those from prior studies showing that mothers heavily involved in drugs experience more difficulties with their children, especially regarding control of the child. In the current study, substance-abusing mothers with high levels of suicidal behavior had high levels of anxiety. Furthermore, these mothers reported increased stress about their parental role, disappointment of their children, rejection or alienation by the child, and/or perceived parent-child interactions as not satisfying. In sum, substance-abusing women in treatment tend to be at high risk of poverty, mental health problems, and having their child placed in out-of-home care. Children who do live in homes where a parent abuses substances are at high risk for developing emotional, social, and behavioral problems. The present study is typical of many studies of drug using women in terms of the difficulty to access a large enough study cohort to justify generalization of findings. This factor limited the nature and scope of the study analysis. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This document contains two papers on connections between work and health and policy options for improving the health of working families. "Foreword" (James A. Auerbach) places the two papers in the context of recent research on the connections between work, family, and health. Chapter 1's overview addresses the changing nature of work, the new economy, and recent demographic trends. Chapter 2: The Impact of Work on Employees and Family Health examines the health effects of job security, income, work organization, health and pension benefits, work schedules, workplace stress, occupational health, socioeconomic status across the life course, and family and sick leave. Chapter 3: Policy Options outlines these three strategies: (1) focus on the individual and the job; (2) encourage the business sector to adopt supportive policies; and (3) develop and expand government policy. "Further Implications for Policy" (James A. Auerbach) weighs the effectiveness of work-life programs, family medical leave and paid leave, unemployment insurance, and childcare and elder care in improving the balance between work, family, and health. He concludes by urging policymakers to adopt policies based on the following principles: work redesign; paid leave and family care; reduced hours and flexibility; women in leadership positions, worker voice, community empowerment; and work-family councils.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of parent-child discussion skills on kindergartners’ emotional understanding and emotion regulation. Fifty-nine children, 5 to 6 years of age, and their parents participated. A quasi-experimental method was adopted in this study. Three classrooms of participants were divided into 3 groups: experimental group 1, who received training in dialogical reading skills for emotion-laden books and engaged in shared reading of emotion-laden books; experimental group 2, who engaged in shared reading of emotion-laden books without discussion training, and a control group who engaged in shared reading of books about animals without discussion training. Parents and children engaged in shared reading of two books each week, reading a total of 16 books. The 3 groups were administrated pre- and post-tests, which included the Chinese version of Test of Emotion Comprehension (TEC)and the teacher and parent versions of Children Emotional Development Scale (CEDS). The results of the study are listed as follows: (1) there were significant differences between five measurements; (2) experimental group 1 was significantly better than the control group in three measurements of emotional understanding, experiment group 1 was significantly better than experiment 2 only on TEC and teacher version of CEDS, and experiment group 2 was significantly better than the control group only on the teacher version of CEDS; (3)on two measurements of emotion regulation,experiment group 1 was significantly better than experiment group 2 and control group, experiment group 2 was significantly better than the control group as well. Suggestions for parent emotional talk skills training program were provided for future studies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Introduction: Nosocomial infections are one of the important mortality and morbidity reasons among newborns. For this reason recognition of infection factors and the resistance to antimicrobials in intensive care unit is very important in terms of rational antibiotic use. Materials and Methods: Nosocomial infections seen in our neonatal intensive care unit between 2009 and 2011 were retrospectively analyzed. Isolated strains, antibiotic sensitivities, the use of invasive tool, infectious species and infection rates were determined according to the data provided by National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance Control Unit. Results: A total of 4258 patients were observed for 34625 patient days, 6536 ventilator days, 98 urinary catheter days, 601 central venous catheter days and 590 umbilical catheter days. The infection rate was 3.26% (139/4258) and the incident density was 4.01%o. Pneumonia was on the first rank (61; 43%) and it was in ventilator association form. 36 strains were isolated as the infectious agents. The rates of gram negative factors was 23 (63.88%), gram positive factors was 8 (22.22%) and Candida spp. was 5 (13.88 %). The most frequently isolated gram negative strains were Klebsiella spp. (7; 19.4%) and Pseudomonas spp. (7; 19.4 %). The most effective antibiotics in Enterobactericeae spp. were meropenem and imipenem. In enteric gram-negative rods, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase positivity was 63.64%. In the neonatal intensive care unit, ventilator-associated pneumonia rate was 6.73% and the ventilator use ratio was 19%. Conclusions: In conclusion, each intensive care unit should determine the factors and follow antimicrobial resistant patterns. Empiric antibiotic treatment strategy should be established. Decreasing or totally preventing hospital infections would be possible by active surveillance system, adoption infection control guidelines, limitation of instrument use and rational antibiotic use rules. Giriş: Hastane enfeksiyonları, yenidoğanlarda önemli morbidite ve mortalite nedenidir. Bu nedenle yenidoğan yoğun bakım ünitesinin enfeksiyon etkenleri ve antimikrobiyal direnç durumunun bilinmesi rasyonel antibiyotik kullanımı açısından çok önemlidir. Gereç ve Yöntem: Yenidoğan yoğun bakım ünitesinde 2009-2011 yılları arasında saptanan hastane enfeksiyonları retrospektif olarak değerlendirildi. Ulusal Hastane Enfeksiyonları Sürveyans Kontrol Birimi verileri doğrultusunda, izole edilen suşlar, antibiyotik duyarlılıkları, invaziv araç kullanımı, enfeksiyon hızları ve enfeksiyon çeşitleri hesaplandı. Bulgular: Toplam 4258 hasta, 34625 hasta günü, 6536 ventilatör günü, 98 üriner kateter günü, 601 santral venöz kateter günü ve 590 umblikal kateter günü izlendi. Hastane enfeksiyon hızı %3,26 (139/4258), hastane enfeksiyon insidans dansitesi %4,01 bulundu. Pnömoni 61'le (%43,88) ilk sıradaydı. Enfeksiyon etkeni olarak izole edilen suş sayısı 36 idi. Gram-negatif etkenler 23 (%63,88), gram -pozitifler 8 (%22,22) ve Kandida spp. 5 (%13,88) oranındaydı. En sık izole edilen gram- negatif izolat Klebsiella spp. 7 (%19,4) ve Pseudomonas spp. 7 (%19,4) idi. Enterobacteriaceae'lerde en etkili antibiyotikler meropenem ve imipenem olarak belirlendi. Gram-negatif enterik basillerde, genişlemiş spektrumlu beta laktamaz pozitifliği %63,64 olarak bulundu. Yenidoğan yoğun bakım ünitemizde ventilatör ilişkili pnömoni hızı 6,73, ventilatör kullanım oranı %19 bulundu. Sonuç: Her yoğun bakım ünitesi etkenlerini belirlemeli ve antimikrobiyal direnç paternlerini izlemelidir. Ampirik antibiyotik tedavi stratejilerini oluşturmalıdır. Hastane enfeksiyonlarının azaltılması veya tamamen önlenmesi aktif sürveyans sisteminin yürütülmesi, enfeksiyon kontrol kurallarına uyulması, alet kullanımının sınırlandırılması ve rasyonel antibiyotik kullanım kurallarına uyulması ile mümkün olabilir.

AB  - Significant growth in the size of the immigrant population in the United States has called attention to immigration policy and public assistance programs for this group. Subjective indicators (e.g., a sense of well-being, life satisfaction, or happiness) are often used as an important index in evaluations of immigrants' quality of life. Economic resources and social resources appear critical components of well-being. Different measures of those economic and social resources have provided mixed results in previous studies. The purpose of this dissertation is to examine the roles of economic and social resources in immigrants' well-being in the United States. To capture a person's overall economic resources, both objective and subjective measures are used. Objective measures include total household income and total net worth. Subjective income is measured to indicate the degree to which a person is satisfied with her/his current financial condition. Social resources are seen as consisting of three dimensions of social relationships; the size of a social network, the level of social support and the engagement in social activities. Using the 2006 HRS and RAND HRS datasets, these questions are investigated. The sample used includes 626 respondents, aged 50 and older. Multivariate regression models are adopted to examine the effects of various economic resources and social resources on immigrants' well-being. The results show that subjective income is positively associated with immigrants' well-being. When subjective income is excluded from the models, however, total net worth becomes a significant predictor of immigrant well-being. Also, of the three different types of social resource variables, those representing social support from a spouse or children are associated with greater levels of well-being, while the size of social networks and participation in social activities are not significant predictors of well-being among immigrants. Particularly, the exchange of social support in family-based relationships -- rather than friendship-based relationships -- plays a critical role in enhancing immigrant well-being.

AB  - Background: With children today being tested at younger ages, test anxiety has an earlier onset age. There is relatively limited research on test anxiety management programs with elementary school children. The theoretical basis for this nonrandomized pre-post intervention study is grounded in cognitive and behavioral interventions for test anxiety found to be efficacious with children. Objective: The purpose is to examine the impact of a school-based test anxiety prevention program on a sample of Singaporean fourth grade students relative to their levels of academic achievement and to identify active treatment components. Methods: 115 children aged 9-12 were assigned to group-based cognitive-behavioral treatment ( n = 58) or control condition ( n = 57). They completed the Children's Test Anxiety Scale and Cognitive-Behavioral Skills Checklist at pre-, post-treatment, and 2 months' follow-up. Anxiety ratings were hypothesized to be lower for the intervention than the control group at post-treatment. Skills that contributed to treatment outcomes were identified. Results: A mixed-design analysis of variance revealed significant test anxiety reduction with medium treatment effect that was maintained for the intervention group across time. There was no change in the control group. Behavioral skills (e.g., relaxation exercises, study skills) contributed to treatment outcomes. Cognitive skills such as calming self-talk did not. Conclusions: The study provided preliminary evidence on the utility of brief, school-based anxiety interventions in test anxiety prevention for children. It added credence to adopting behavioral over cognitive strategies in treating test anxious children. Children with severe test anxiety at baseline benefited particularly from treatment.

AB  - Purpose: Late stage at presentation and poor adherence to treatment remain major contributors to poor survival in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Patient navigation (PN) programs in the United States have led to improvement in diagnostic or treatment timeliness, particularly for women in lower socioeconomic classes or minority groups. To date, studies of PN in Asia have been limited. We aimed to assess the feasibility of PN in a state-run hospital in an LMIC and to report the impact on diagnostic and treatment timeliness for patients in its first year of implementation. Methods: We established PN in a dedicated breast clinic of a Malaysian state-run hospital. We compared diagnostic and treatment timeliness between navigated patients (n = 135) and patients diagnosed in the prior year (n = 148), and described factors associated with timeliness. Results: Women with PN received timely mammography compared with patients in the prior year (96.4% v 74.4%; P <.001), biopsy (92.5% v 76.1%; P =.003), and communication of news (80.0% v 58.5%; P <.001). PN reduced treatment default rates (4.4% v 11.5%; P =.048). Among navigated patients, late stage at presentation was independently associated with having emotional and language barriers (P =.01). Finally, the main reason reported for delay, default, or refusal of treatment was the preference for alternative therapy. Conclusion: PN is feasible for addressing barriers to cancer care when integrated with a state-run breast clinic of an LMIC. Its implementation resulted in improved diagnostic timeliness and reduced treatment default. Wider adoption of PN could be a key element of cancer control in LMICs.

AB  - Childhood immunization is one of the most cost-effective public health interventions, yet its population coverage in low- and middle-income countries is severely limited by the fiscal constraints that health services face. A recent proposal suggested that commitments to purchase vaccines and make them available to developing countries for modest co-payments could solve the problem. However, this is dependent on communities being willing and able to share the cost in this way, which is difficult to assess. One possible method to assess this demand is contingent valuation (CV). This article evaluates the usefulness of using CV in this way, by reviewing applications of CV in developing countries against current "standards" for CV of immunization in the literature. A structured review was adopted with reference to the standard frameworks for methodological evaluation. A set of five criteria were developed for evaluating an "acceptable" CV study: (i) response rate; (ii) association between willingness to pay (WTP) and socioeconomic status (SES); (iii) sensitivity of WTP to benefit scale/scope; (iv) predictive validity; and (v) reliability in elicitation formats. Two strands of literature search were conducted using electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, HEALTHSTAR and EconLit) from 1966 to 2003, one for CV studies of immunization and one for CV studies in developing countries. Twelve CV studies of vaccination and 13 CV studies undertaken within developing countries were identified and reviewed. The quality of existing CV studies conducted in developing countries exceeded the benchmark standard set by studies of immunization in the developed world in four of the five criteria. WTP estimates appeared both internally valid (i.e., associations with SES) and externally valid (i.e., predictive validity), reliability in developing countries was no less than that of the benchmark level in the existing literature, and the high response rates suggested that CV can be administered to a rural, and perhaps less literate, population. Only sensitivity to scale/scope was not well demonstrated. Our assessment indicated that the CV technique offers a promising tool to estimate the demand for childhood immunization in low- and middle-income countries. International agencies are therefore encouraged to devote resources to such an application when designing their support to the immunization programmes.

AB  - Background: Chinese American patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) tend to underutilize mental health services and are more likely to seek help in primary care settings than from mental health specialists. Our team has reported that Culturally Sensitive Collaborative Treatment (CSCT) is effective in improving recognition and treatment engagement of depressed Chinese Americans in primary care. The current study builds on this prior research by incorporating telemedicine technology into the CSCT model. Methods/Design: We propose a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the acceptability and effectiveness of a telepsychiatry-based culturally sensitive collaborative treatment (T-CSCT) intervention targeted toward Chinese Americans. Patients meeting the study's eligibility criteria will receive either treatment as usual or the intervention under investigation. The six-month intervention involves: 1) an initial psychiatric interview using a culturally sensitive protocol via videoconference; 2) eight scheduled phone visits with a care manager assigned to the patient, who will monitor the patient's progress, as well as medication side effects and dosage if applicable; and 3) collaboration between the patient's PCP, psychiatrist, and care manager. Outcome measures include depressive symptom severity as well as patient and PCP satisfaction with the telepsychiatry-based care management service. Discussion: The study investigates the T-CSCT model, which we believe will increase the feasibility and practicality of the CSCT model by adopting telemedicine technology. We anticipate that this model will expand access to culturally competent psychiatrists fluent in patients' native languages to improve treatment of depressed minority patients in primary care settings.

AB  - Background: The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act required the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to establish the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) by January 1, 2012. The MSSP is intended to encourage physicians, hospitals, and other providers and suppliers to form accountable care organizations (ACOs) to provide cost-effective, coordinated care to Medicare beneficiaries. Under the MSSP, ACOs can qualify for additional payments by meeting specific savings benchmarks and quality measures. Objectives: To review the anticipated changes in the role and responsibilities of ACOs and to evaluate the challenges and opportunities that various healthcare stakeholders, including patients, providers, and payers, will encounter with the launching of the new MSSP. Discussion: ACOs assume responsibility for overall care, cost, and quality of patient care. The MSSP will provide ACOs additional payments for meeting cost-savings and quality benchmarks. The extra savings will be shared with participating providers based on different risk-sharing options. As the MSSP and new ACOs launch, stakeholders will be impacted differently. This article is based, in part, on responses of approximately 100 payers to a survey conducted in June 2011 by Xcenda. Each stakeholder group, including providers, payers, patients, and manufacturers, must monitor the reactions and relationships between all players in the care continuum. Providers will have to achieve a greater level of coordination and collaboration than typically exists today. Government and commercial payers will have a role in determining how quickly they will adopt accountable care models. Patients are expected to become more engaged and participatory in their care to achieve optimal outcomes, and manufacturers will be required to prove the value of their products given the clinical value proposition embedded in accountable care models. Conclusion: Whether ACOs are the answer to providing higher-quality healthcare at lower costs remains unclear. All signs, however, point toward a systemic change in an effort to improve patient care and contain healthcare costs. It will be important for all healthcare stakeholders to understand the roles that ACOs will play in ensuring access to care and quality of care.

AB  - Background: Pregnant women can misinform or withhold their reproductive and medical information from providers when they interact with them during care decision-making interactions, although, the information clients reveal or withhold while seeking care plays a critical role in the quality of care provided. This study explored 'how' and 'why' pregnant women in Ghana control their past obstetric and reproductive information as they interact with providers at their first antenatal visit, and how this influences providers' decision-making at the time and in subsequent care encounters.Methods: This research was a case-study of two public hospitals in southern Ghana, using participant observation, conversations, interviews and focus group discussions with antenatal, delivery, and post-natal clients and providers over a 22-month period. The Ghana Health Service Ethical Review Committee gave ethical approval for the study (Ethical approval number: GHS-ERC: 03/01/12). Data analysis was conducted according to grounded theory.Results: Many of the women in this study selectively controlled the reproductive, obstetric and social history information they shared with their provider at their first visit. They believed that telling a complete history might cause providers to verbally abuse them and they would be regarded in a negative light. Examples of the information controlled included concealing the actual number of children or self-induced abortions. The women adopted this behaviour as a resistance strategy to mitigate providers' disrespectful treatment through verbal abuses and questioning women's practices that contradicted providers' biomedical ideologies. Secondly, they utilised this strategy to evade public humiliation because of inadequate privacy in the hospitals. The withheld information affected quality of care decision-making and care provision processes and outcomes, since misinformed providers were unaware of particular women's risk profile.Conclusion: Many mothers in this study withhold or misinform providers about their obstetric, reproductive and social information as a way to avoid receiving disrespectful maternal care and protect their privacy. Improving provider client relationship skills, empowering clients and providing adequate infrastructure to ensure privacy and confidentiality in hospitals, are critical to the provision of respectful maternal care.

AB  - Art is part of our natural human behavior. For four years, college students go through several developmental stages. Art in higher education can become a fundamental part of students' behavior. Like language and laughter, art is a basic part of the self-concept and development. Experimental learning is one outline of the many comprehensive theories of college student development that can be used as measuring tools for administrators, professors, institutional policies, improvements, and practices. The college environment is a place that fosters outcomes of growth and challenges, and as a result, support is needed because a student lives different levels of maturity within social contexts. College can be an 'advisory circle' as the environment provides education, support, realization, awareness, and knowledge that develop strength for the future and the world ahead. The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between art and non-art majors and the development of the self-concept in higher education. The data is derived from senior students at four-year institutions who completed the college senior survey from the Cooperative Institutional Research Program (CIRP) of the Higher Education Research Institute (HERI) of UCLA. Descriptive statistics, cross-tabulations, and chi-square testing were performed to examine the relationship between art and development of the self-concept in higher education. The major themes of the college senior survey are academic and social adjustment, sources of satisfaction and dissatisfaction, academic, residential and employment experiences, plans for the next academic year, patterns of behavior, life goals and self-concepts, and feelings of personal success. The findings of this study suggest that art majors and art careers have a good self-concept when studying the controlled variables of gender, race/ethnicity, GPA, art majors/non-art majors, career occupation, institution type, and control. The independent variables that are the HERI standards of student/faculty interactions, educational environment/climate, campus environment satisfaction, academic achievement/change, and learning styles/self-rating were also examined alongside the dependent variables of character and development of art and non-art majors' self-concept, self-esteem, ideal self, and self-image.

AB  - Due to shortage of nurses, more nurses from other countries are employed in health care settings in the United States of America (USA). Little attention has been paid to understanding how culturally different international nurses adjust to USA hospitals. The purpose of this study was to investigate how Korean nurses adjust to USA hospital settings. Grounded theory method was used for sampling procedure, data collection and analysis in order to describe Korean nurses' experiences from their perspective and to develop a substantive theory that explains their process of adjustment. Data were collected using semi-structured formal interviews with a purposive sample of 12 Korean nurses. The interviews were audio-taped and transcribed. Analysis of data, using the constant comparative method, revealed 'adjustment to USA hospitals' as the basic social psychological process. Five categories composed the process: (1) relieving psychological stress; (2) overcoming the language barrier; (3) accepting USA nursing practice; (4) adopting the styles of USA problem-solving strategies; and (5) adopting the styles of USA interpersonal relationships. These five categories capture the essential aspects of the adjustment process and each category contains a set of sub-categories that describe Korean nurses' day-to-day experiences that are critical and also problematic to their adjustment. The process evolves in two stages. In the initial stage, the first three of the five categories greatly influenced the nurses' adjustment. From the perspective of the nurses in the study, the initial stage lasts about 2 to 3 years. The remaining two categories are principal components of the later stage. It takes an additional 5 to 10 years to complete this stage. This model highlights both distress and accomplishments of Korean nurses during their adjustment to USA hospitals. The results of the study may help USA nurses gain insight in designing and implementing orientation programmes to facilitate and support Korean nurses' adjustment to USA hospitals.

AB  - A great deal of existing literature has addressed the various effects of maltreatment on children's development. However, limited research has explored how young children in foster care and adoptive families experience and understand separation and loss, and attach to new caregivers. Clinicians have very little guidance when working with maltreated children who are adopted. On the other hand, the literature has documented the critical role of attachment relationships in a child's life. This case involved a four year-old maltreated child who received 11 months of non-directive client centered play therapy while placed in a foster home. Johnny began his treatment due to severe behavioral problems, poor social skills, and insecure attachment relationships. Through non-directive play therapy, he was able to process the loss of his biological family and find a sense of self and belonging with his adoptive family. Johnny used the therapeutic relationship to help him express the many feelings and thoughts related to his losses and new discoveries. Johnny's progress was fostered by working with his foster parents periodically throughout the treatment. Johnny clearly benefited from treatment. Controlled studies of this type of treatment with children in foster care are more needed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Chronic inflammation is a driving force for the development of metabolic disease including diabetes and obesity. However, the functional characteristics of T-cell senescence in the abnormal glucose homeostasis are not fully understood. We studied the patients visiting a hospital for routine health check-ups, who were divided into two groups: normal controls and people with prediabetes. Gene expression profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from normal controls and patients with type 2 diabetes was undertaken using microarray analysis. We also investigated the immunometabolic characteristics of peripheral and hepatic senescent T cells in the normal subjects and patients with prediabetes. Moreover, murine senescent T cells were tested functionally in the liver of normal or mice with metabolic deterioration caused by diet-induced obesity. Human senescent (CD28(-)CD57(+)) CD8(+) T cells are increased in the development of diabetes and proinflammatory cytokines and cytotoxic molecules are highly expressed in senescent T cells from patients with prediabetes. Moreover, we demonstrate that patients with prediabetes have higher concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in their senescent CD8(+) T cells via enhancing capacity to use glycolysis. These functional properties of senescent CD8(+) T cells contribute to the impairment of hepatic insulin sensitivity in humans. Furthermore, we found an increase of hepatic senescent T cells in mouse models of aging and diet-induced obesity. Adoptive transfer of senescent CD8(+) T cells also led to a significant deterioration in systemic abnormal glucose homeostasis, which is improved by ROS scavengers in mice. This study defines a new clinically relevant concept of T-cell senescence-mediated inflammatory responses in the pathophysiology of abnormal glucose homeostasis. We also found that T-cell senescence is associated with systemic inflammation and alters hepatic glucose homeostasis. The rational modulation of T-cell senescence would be a promising avenue for the treatment or prevention of diabetes.

AB  - Motivation: Large-scale gene expression profiling has been widely used to characterize cellular states in response to various disease conditions, genetic perturbations, etc. Although the cost of whole-genome expression profiles has been dropping steadily, generating a compendium of expression profiling over thousands of samples is still very expensive. Recognizing that gene expressions are often highly correlated, researchers from the NIH LINCS program have developed a cost-effective strategy of profiling only ~1000 carefully selected landmark genes and relying on computational methods to infer the expression of remaining target genes. However, the computational approach adopted by the LINCS program is currently based on linear regression (LR), limiting its accuracy since it does not capture complex nonlinear relationship between expressions of genes. Results: We present a deep learning method (abbreviated as D-GEX) to infer the expression of target genes from the expression of landmark genes. We used the microarray-based Gene Expression Omnibus dataset, consisting of 111K expression profiles, to train our model and compare its performance to those from other methods. In terms of mean absolute error averaged across all genes, deep learning significantly outperforms LR with 15.33% relative improvement. A gene-wise comparative analysis shows that deep learning achieves lower error than LR in 99.97% of the target genes. We also tested the performance of our learned model on an independent RNA-Seq-based GTEx dataset, which consists of 2921 expression profiles. Deep learning still outperforms LR with 6.57% relative improvement, and achieves lower error in 81.31% of the target genes.

AB  - Objective: To examine the relationship between parent health literacy and "obesogenic" infant care behaviors.Study Design: Cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from a cluster randomized controlled trial of a primary care-based early childhood obesity prevention program (Greenlight). English- and Spanish-speaking parents of 2-month-old children were enrolled (n = 844). The primary predictor variable was parent health literacy (Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults; adequate ≥ 23; low <23). Primary outcome variables involving self-reported obesogenic behaviors were: (1) feeding content (more formula than breast milk, sweet drinks, early solid food introduction), and feeding style-related behaviors (pressuring to finish, laissez-faire bottle propping/television [TV] watching while feeding, nonresponsiveness in letting child decide amount to eat); and (2) physical activity (tummy time, TV). Multivariate logistic regression analyses (binary, proportional odds models) performed adjusting for child sex, out-of-home care, Women, Infants, and Children program status, parent age, race/ethnicity, language, number of adults/children in home, income, and site.Results: Eleven percent of parents were categorized as having low health literacy. Low health literacy significantly increased the odds of a parent reporting that they feed more formula than breast milk, (aOR = 2.0 [95% CI: 1.2-3.5]), immediately feed when their child cries (aOR = 1.8 [1.1-2.8]), bottle prop (aOR = 1.8 [1.002-3.1]), any infant TV watching (aOR = 1.8 [1.1-3.0]), and inadequate tummy time (<30 min/d), (aOR = 3.0 [1.5-5.8]).Conclusions: Low parent health literacy is associated with certain obesogenic infant care behaviors. These behaviors may be modifiable targets for low health literacy-focused interventions to help reduce childhood obesity.

AB  - Although there are significant developments in the healthcare field and various diseases have been eradicated nowadays, the treatment of social and emotional components of chronic diseases has not been able to be fully realized yet. Social work practices carried out in hospitals and healthcare institutions to prevent and solve the psychosocial problems of the patient and his/her family occurring with the disease make other healthcare providers sensitive about the psychosocial aspects of the disease. Hospital social workers assess the patient and his/her family via individual, family, and group counseling in terms of strengthening the cognitive, emotional, interpersonal communication and social functioning. On the other hand, the fact that their child has a serious health condition leads to the occurrence of disease management in the family. Especially asthma awareness starts necessitating asthma management, and the issue of how to manage asthma constitutes the most significant agenda of caregiver parents in particular. Since the chronic disease is long-term, asthmatic children may exhibit fluctuation in terms of health between the acute and chronic periods; therefore, patients and caregivers should adopt a careful understanding of asthma management. In effective pediatric asthma management, the family emotional climate plays an important role and shapes the direction of intervention of a social worker. Thus, this review study aims to review the responsibilities of social workers in the medical treatment team in fighting childhood asthma, the conditions laying the groundwork for the hospital social work and pediatric asthma management to serve effectively, and the function and roles of social work peculiar to asthma management in the eyes of caregiver parents. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Günümüzde sağlık alanında önemli gelişmeler olmasına ve çoğu hastalığın kökünün kazınmasına rağmen kronik hastalıkların sosyal ve duygusal bileşenlerinin tedavisi henüz tam anlamıyla gerçekleştirilememektedir. Hasta ve ailesinin hastalıkla birlikte ortaya çıkan psikososyal sorunlarının önlenmesi ve çözümlenmesi amacıyla hastanelerde ve sağlık kurumlarında yürütülen sosyal hizmet uygulamaları hastalığın psikososyal yönleri hakkında diğer sağlık hizmeti sağlayıcılarını duyarlı hale getirir. Hastane sosyal hizmet uzmanları bireysel, aile ve grup danışmanlığı aracılığıyla hasta ve ailesini; bilişsel, duygusal, kişiler arası iletişimin güçlenmesi ve sosyal işlevsellik açılarından değerlendirir. Diğer taraftan çocuklarının ciddi bir sağlık durumuna sahip olduğu gerçekliği ailede hastalık yönetimi anlayışının ortaya çıkmasına neden olur. Özel olarak astım farkındalığı astım yönetimini zorunlu kılmaya başlar ve astımın nasıl yönetileceği konusu bilhassa bakım veren ebeveynlerin en önemli gündemini oluşturur. Kronik hastalığın uzun vadeli olmasından dolayı astımlı çocuk akut ve kronik dönemler arasında sağlık açısından dalgalanmalar gösterebilir, bu nedenle hastalar ve bakım verenler özenli bir astım yönetimi anlayışı benimsemelidir. Etkin pediatrik astım yönetiminde aile duygusal iklimi önemli rol oynamakta ve sosyal hizmet uzmanının müdahalesinin yönünü şekillendirmektedir. Dolayısıyla bu derleme çalışması çocukluk çağı astımı ile mücadelede tıbbi tedavi ekibi içinde yer alan sosyal hizmet uzmanlarının sorumluluklarını, hastane sosyal hizmeti ve pediatrik astım yönetiminin etkin biçimde hizmet vermesine zemin hazırlayan koşulları, sosyal hizmetin pediatrik astım yönetimine özgü işlev ve rollerini bakım veren ebeveynler odağında gözden geçirme amacı taşımaktadır (Turkish) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Journal of Society & Social Work is the property of Journal of Society and Social Work and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

AB  - Social marketing is an intervention development strategy that pays considerable attention to barriers to and motivators for behavioral change or adoption of recommended behaviors. Barriers are obstacles that prevent individuals from changing or adopting behaviors and are often referred to as the ``cons{''} or ``costs{''} of doing something. Motivators, on the other hand, are factors that encourage individuals to change or adopt behaviors and are often referred to as the ``pros,{''} ``benefits,{''} or `` influencing factors{''} of doing something. Importantly, social marketing does not target education or knowledge change as an end point; rather, it targets behavior change. Studies across several types of desired behaviors (e.g., smoking cessation, weight control, more exercise, sunscreen use, radon testing) using the Stages of Change model have found systematic relationships between stages of change and pros and cons of changing behavior. A review of literature identifies numerous research and intervention studies that directly reference social marketing in agricultural safety and health, studies that identify reasons why parents allow their children to be exposed to hazardous situations on the farm, and reasons why youth engage in risky behaviors, but only two studies were found that show evidence of systematically researching specific behavioral change motivating factors. The authors offer several suggestions to help address issues relating to social marketing and agricultural safety and health.

AB  - This chapter describes the treatment of youth referred for sexually abusive behavior along with other types of abuse that warrant treatment with Social Responsibility Therapy in Forensic Foster Care. Forensic Foster Care is a family-based treatment setting for multiple abuser youth whose extemalizing behavior can result or has resulted in legal problems. Forensic Foster Care employs Social Responsibility Therapy to help youth control multiple forms of abuse by developing social-emotional maturity as a competing response; developing an understanding of how abusive behavior was acquired, maintained, and generalized; and demonstrating the social responsibility to make restitution. Forensic Foster Care provides another level in the continuum of care between residential and outpatient treatment for multiple abuser youth whose behavior management needs require gradual reentry into the community under supervised conditions when no appropriate family placement exists.

AB  - Background: This study assessed the effects of the parent training (PT) technique, in which child specialists (CS) such as preschool and school teachers promote secure attachment in children with aberrant social behavior following maltreatment, using a team approach. Methods: Child specialists confirmed the presence of child abuse, according to Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare criteria. CS such as homeroom, special education‐related, student guidance‐related, nursing teachers and co‐workers received a PT course conducted by the authors. A homeroom teacher provided classroom management to model good examples of social life for the target child. A nursing teacher and assistant offered individualized instruction to foster the formation of secure attachments by the target child. Result: Behavioral abnormalities in both school and home resolved in seven out of 12 cases. These subjects received the intervention for 2–4 years. In the other cases, behavioral abnormalities disappeared or decreased at school, but continued at home. Almost all children met the alternative criteria of attachment disorder proposed by Boris and Zeanah. One child met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM‐IV‐TR) criteria for reactive attachment disorder. This intervention is significantly more effective for children who have yet to begin elementary school than those in elementary school. Conclusions: The PT technique as applied by CS using a team approach may be a useful intervention for fostering secure attachment in children with maltreatment who exhibit behavioral abnormalities. Early detection and intervention are necessary to successfully address the behavioral abnormalities of children with maltreatment.

AB  - The purpose of the present study was to examine a set of indicators and factors to predict future out-of-home placements for children and adolescents with serious emotional disturbances (SED). Using characteristics of children and families at intake, this study predicted future out-of-home placements after participation in the Children's Partnership, a systems of care program funded by the Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS) that serves children and adolescents with SED and their families in Travis County, Texas. A series of hierarchical logistic regression analyses were conducted to evaluate both individual predictors and conceptual models. Contrary to expectation, descriptive indicators (diagnostic information and risk factors) and protective indicators (the BERS and the FAD) were not statistically significant predictors of future out-of-home placements. Only two pathological indicators, as a set, showed a significant contribution to predicting future out-of-home placements. The CAFAS, which is measuring functional impairment of children with SED, demonstrated a strong individual relationship with the dependent variable even after controlling all the other indicators in the model. In addition to examining a set of indicators to predict out-of-home placements for children with SED, this study also explored profile scores of each predictor at intake for children and adolescents with high risk of future out-of-home placements. Results of independent t-tests were quite consistent with the findings observed in the multivariate logistic regression analysis. The children who had out-of-home placement at follow-up period showed much severer functional impairment at intake measured by the CAFAS, compared those did not have any out-of-home placement. Overall children in placement group enrolled into the Children's Partnership with worse symptoms and lower levels of protective factors, compared to children without any out-of-home placement. The findings of the study help clinicians identify children with high risk of out-of-home placement from the beginning and it assists them utilize profile information for their service planning and the early intervention. With several limitations, the study also suggests combining both multivariate and univariate analysis technique is preferable to get a better understanding of each relationship observed in both methods.

AB  - This study examines the role of organizational context in predicting service effectiveness, It highlights methods for studying this phenomenon for expanding knowledge of intervention effects in social work and other disciplines in the human services. A total of 3,883 children and 13 networks of organizations comprised the study sample. To determine whether the organizational context explains intervention effects, a multilevel model of a hypothesized relationship between organizational variables, child characteristics, and child outcomes was tested. The results indicate that child outcome (measured as out-of-home placement) varies across networks, and this variance is largely explained by workplace conditions. Specifically, organizations that are characterized by their respective workers as having greater routineness of work, strong leadership qualities, and supervisor and coworker support are related to fewer occurrences of out-of-home placement for children who participated in a family preservation program. This study suggests that organizational characteristics are potentially strong determinants of service effectiveness.

AB  - The purpose of the study is to find the intercorrelation among exogenous latent variables (parental support of ethnic background and positive parent-child relationship) and endogenous latent variables (collective self-esteem, and psychological adjustment) for Korean-born adolescent adoptees through structural equation modeling (PROC-CALIS: SAS). Data analysis was based on 241 respondents who were drawn from 28 states of the US. The mean age of the subjects was 14 with males and females comprising approximately 43 per cent and 57 per cent, respectively. Especially, for this study, the measurement scales for parental support of ethnic identity and shame about ethnic origin were developed. The analyses represent an initial attempt to examine the relationship among constructs that potentially influence the transracially adopted child's psychological adjustment. With the success of finding evidence for collective self-esteem on successful psychological adjustment, all hypothesized effects among parent's support of ethnic background and child's collective self-esteem variables were supported by the data. As was the case with results concerning the relationships among the adolescents' psychological adjustment variables, one expected effect of family context factors was also supported. The significant effect of the level of the positive parent-child relationship was positive. In addition to the results associated with the hypothesized model effects, there were statistically significant relationships between parent's support of ethnic background and positive parent-child relationship. The findings of the study stress the transaction between adoptive parents and children in terms of sharing experiences of children's ethnic socialization and establishes that positive relationship is the fundamental factor for children to develop a unique process of identity development. The outcomes of the study suggest that social workers have to continue to study the diverse needs of adoptive parents and develop appropriate intervention strategies in order to improve family functioning.

AB  - This study investigated patterns of the developmental trajectories of externalizing behavior problems among 449 young maltreated children (ages 4–5) over a period of approximately eight years and examined the roles of maltreatment and protective factors in shaping various trajectory patterns. Secondary research was conducted using data from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW-I). Latent class growth analysis identified three distinctive externalizing trajectory groups: high–decreasing (10%); moderate–increasing (13%); low–stable (77%). Physically or sexually abused children were more likely to be in the high–decreasing group whereas male and Black children were more likely to be in the moderate–increasing group. Child prosocial skills and caregiver well-being decreased the probability of membership in the high–decreasing group compared to the low–stable group. The findings suggest that, despite early exposure to trauma, many maltreated children display a low or normal level of externalizing behavior problems over time, providing empirical evidence of resilience in maltreated children. Interventions focusing on enhancing child prosocial skills and caregiver well-being may be helpful in lowering the risk of clinically significant externalizing behavior problems over the course of childhood among maltreated children.

AB  - Although children who have been maltreated receive either in-home or out-of-home services in the United States every year, the role of these services in offending behavior remains unclear. Additionally, although maltreated children placed in out-of-home care have different placement experiences (e.g., different types of placements, different numbers of placements), research that summarizes the findings of previous studies and investigates patterns of offending behavior by different placement characteristics is sparse. The present systematic review addressed this gap in existing knowledge by examining the current literature on the association between out-of-home placement and offending behavior among youth with Child Protection Services maltreatment reports. The first research question was: Do maltreated youth placed in out-of-home care demonstrate higher rates of offending behavior as compared to those who received in-home service? The second research question was: For maltreated youth placed in out-of-home care, does offending behavior differ by placement characteristics (i.e., type of placement, number of placements, age at first placement, and neighborhood associated with placement)? Five electronic databases, PsycINFO, PubMed, Criminal Justice Abstracts, Social Work Abstracts, and Social Sciences Citation Index, were searched and a total of 15 articles were included in the current review. The first research question was addressed by eleven studies that compared offending behavior for maltreated youth placed in out-of-home care with those who received in-home care. These studies revealed mixed findings: many studies showed higher rates of offending behavior for maltreated youth placed in foster care compared to those who remained at home, but some studies found no difference between the two groups. The second research question was addressed by ten studies that explored the impact of different placement characteristics on offending behavior of maltreated youth placed in out-of-home care. These studies showed consistent findings; studies showed that more restricted types of care, a higher number of placements, those placed at a later age, and placement with greater ethnic heterogeneity in the neighborhood are each associated with higher rates of offending behavior. Our results suggest that efforts need to be made to place maltreated youth in less restricted care and to reduce the number of placements. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Compared with the general population, adolescents in out-of-home care are at greater risk of having higher rates of mental health problems including depressive symptomatology. Although child maltreatment is the main reason for entering the out-of-home care system, only a few studies explored the association between child maltreatment and depressive symptomatology among youth in out-of-home care. In addition, although self-esteem may be a potential mediator linking child maltreatment and depressive symptomatology, this has not yet been evaluated with adolescents in out-of-home care. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of self-esteem as a mediator in the association between different types of child maltreatment (i.e., physical abuse, physical neglect, emotional abuse) and depressive symptomatology among a sample of adolescents in out-of-home care. The sample consisted of 404 (226 males, 178 females) adolescents derived from the Mental Health Service Use of Youth Leaving Foster Care study. Depressive symptomatology was assessed at age 18 using the Depression-Arkansas Scale. Three types of child maltreatment (physical abuse, physical neglect, emotional abuse) were assessed at age 17 using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. Self-esteem was assessed at age 18 using the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. A path analysis was conducted to test the mediating role of self-esteem in the association between child maltreatment types and depressive symptomatology. Physical neglect was directly associated with depressive symptomatology. Emotional abuse was indirectly related to depressive symptomatology via self-esteem. The findings suggest that self-esteem may be a powerful mediator linking emotional abuse and depressive symptomatology for adolescents in out-of-home care. For emotionally abused adolescents in out-of-home care, interventions that help them promote self-esteem could reduce depressive symptomatology.

AB  - 236 Background: Cancer affects 1.6 million parents with dependent children in the United States, many of whom experience heightened distress related to the impact of their illness on children. Palliative medicine and oncology providers frequently recommend open communication with children. However, there is little empirical research on the relationship between illness-related communication with children and parental psychological distress. The objective of this study was to explore the association between parental psychological distress and communication with children about a parent's advanced cancer.Methods: This was a cross-sectional, mixed-methods observational study of patients with stage IV solid tumor malignancies who had at least one dependent biologic or adopted child. Participants completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and a semi-structured interview. Reports of illness-related communication with children were categorized as "minimal," "partial," or "full." We conducted linear regression models to evaluate the association between extent of communication and HADS scores.Results: Of the 42 parents, 7 participants (17%) had minimal illness-related communication with their children, 13 (31%) had partial communication, and 22 (52%) had full communication including discussion of their prognosis. HADS Anxiety scores, but not HADS Depression scores, were higher with greater extent of communication (4.1 vs. 7.6 vs. 10.4, p = 0.003), even when controlling for performance status and children's age.Conclusions: In this pilot study, parents who had more extensive communication with children about their advanced cancer and prognosis also reported more symptoms of general anxiety. Palliative and supportive care interventions should address psychological distress relevant to parenting and should provide guidance for communicating with children.

AB  - The Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) program is an organization that utilizes lay volunteers as advocates for children in foster care to improve outcomes for those children. The effectiveness of CASAs in achieving permanency outcomes for children in foster care has been established; however, the literature has significant methodological flaws and is outdated. The purpose of this study, guided by the theory of change and social cognitive theory, was to explore whether CASA self-efficacy, through a proxy measure of education level, is related to permanency outcomes such as reunification with parents and rate of reentry to the foster care system for children in foster care. Archived data from a CASA database in Southern Idaho were examined using non-parametric statistics. The data included 138 cases, who were served by 78 CASA volunteers. The education of the CASA volunteers was used as the independent variable: 10 had a high school diploma, 23 had some college, and 45 were college graduates. Chi-square analyses indicated that there was no significant relation between the education level of CASA volunteers and permanency outcomes in the individual cases, and also that there was no significant relation between the education level of CASA volunteers and reentry rates of child protection cases on which they have served. The research contributed to social change by increasing awareness of the role the CASA program plays in the lives of children and their families involved in the child welfare system and highlighting the need for current research, as well as establishing that educational level may not be an important factor in the outcomes of CASA cases. Suggested areas for future research include a direct examination of the relation of self-efficacy of CASA volunteers about permanency outcomes and reentry rates with a larger, more generalizable population.

AB  - The phenomenon of grandparents raising grandchildren has increased significantly over the past two decades. The literature documents that health, financial, and legal worries top the list of concerns for grandparents who raise grandchildren. The authors describe the results of a multi-disciplinary study that provides home visitation with social, nursing, legal, and educational support to grandparents raising grandchildren in parent absent households. This article examines the custodial relationships of one hundred and sixty-three children being raised in sixty-eight families headed by grandparents in an urban population in the South. The data showed that of the 163 children, 70 were in the guardianship of their grandparents, 40 of the children had no legal relationship with their grandparents, 28 were in the custody of the State Department of Family and Children's Services, 21 were in the temporary custody of their grandparents, and four were adopted by their grandparents. Recommendations from this study include educating service providers and grandparents raising grandchildren regarding the potential financial benefits under Title IVE adoption assistance and supporting legislative reform to increase the stability of intergenerational kinship care. This project demonstrates an innovative approach of combining university-based research with multidisciplinary education while providing cost-effective support services through a partnership with the community.

AB  - Relationally aggressive behavior, which involves both direct and indirect behaviors that inflict social harm on others, is used by individuals who intend to damage and manipulate others' peer relationships (e.g., spreading rumors, excluding from group activities, giving the silent treatment, manipulating social relationships). Both victims and perpetrators of this relational form of aggressive behavior have been shown to suffer social and psychological costs such as depression, loneliness, and peer rejection, both concurrently and in the long-term. Although great strides have been made recently in research on the deleterious consequences of relational forms of aggression, far less attention has been paid to the etiology of relational aggression. Accordingly, the primary goal of the study is to investigate the linkage between parenting behaviors and adolescents' development of relationally aggressive behavior and the mechanisms underlying the linkage. The current study illustrates that parental psychological control is associated with relational aggression directly and indirectly through intrapersonal factors. Identifying both familial (i.e., parental psychological control) and intrapersonal risk factors (i.e., adolescents' adoption of anger rumination) of the use of relational aggression, the present research provides new insight into the complex mechanisms underlying adolescents' engagement in relationally aggressive behaviors toward their peers. Keywords: parental psychological control, anger rumination, anger suppression, attachment security, relational aggression. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background People diagnosed with serious mental illnesses (SMIs) such as schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder are frequently treated with antipsychotics. National guidance advises the use of shared decision-making (SDM) in antipsychotic prescribing. There is currently little data on the opinions of health professionals on the role of SDM. Objective To explore the views and experiences of UK mental health pharmacists regarding the use of SDM in antipsychotic prescribing in people diagnosed with SMI. Setting The study was conducted by interviewing secondary care mental health pharmacists in the UK to obtain qualitative data. Methods Semi-structured interviews were recorded. An inductive thematic analysis was conducted using the method of constant comparison. Main outcome measure Themes evolving from mental health pharmacists on SDM in relation to antipsychotic prescribing in people with SMI. Results Thirteen mental health pharmacists were interviewed. SDM was perceived to be linked to positive clinical outcomes including adherence, service user satisfaction and improved therapeutic relations. Despite more prescribers and service users supporting SDM, it was not seen as being practised as widely as it could be; this was attributed to a number of barriers, most predominantly issues surrounding service user's lacking capacity to engage in SDM and time pressures on clinical staff. The need for greater effort to work around the issues, engage service users and adopt a more inter-professional approach was conveyed. Conclusion The mental health pharmacists support SDM for antipsychotic prescribing, believing that it improves outcomes. However, barriers are seen to limit implementation. More research is needed into overcoming the barriers and measuring the benefits of SDM, along with exploring a more inter-professional approach to SDM.

AB  - Intended to assist in the evaluation of community education programs, this guide is for program decision makers, primarily at the local level, including staff of school districts, park and recreation departments, other local and state agencies, and private citizens serving on community education boards and councils. Part 1, Evaluation and Community Education Programs, describes an eight-step process for developing and conducting an evaluation that can be applied to two frequent situations: need for a rigorous and complex evaluation design and answers to a few questions. Topics include purposes of program evaluation, when and how to evaluate a program, and use of program/performance reports in evaluation. Part 2, Community Education Concerns and Evaluation Questions, covers materials on twelve topics of concern in relation to a community education program: program objectives; advisory council; interagency cooperation/coordination; courses/classes; health/social services; recreational, social, and cultural activities; community development; organization and staffing; resource utilization; impacts on school system; impacts upon community; and impacts on individuals. Each topic is presented in a format that covers what is meant, why evaluate, possible evaluation questions, and sources and approaches (including sample evaluation questions with possible sources of information and possible indicators of performance). Part 3 presents a sample performance report. (YLB)

AB  - Current estimates indicate that 76% of Iowa children whose parents' rights have been terminated and who are listed on the adoption exchange are older children with emotional/behavioral disabilities. Residential treatment can play a significant role in preparing difficult-to-place children (e.g., seven- to 14-year-olds with moderate to severe emotional or behavioral problems) for adoptive placement [Powers and Powell 1982]. The SATT model offers the opportunity to effectively manage the risks in adoptive placement for these children.

AB  - Almost no research has been done on the impact of physical handicaps on family relationships in the Arab world. Fieldwork carried out in the north Jordanian town of Kufrinja sheds light on coping strategies adopted by parents of handicapped children. It shows that the task of care-giving falls on the child's mother to the exclusion of other family members, and that the care-giving role is so closely linked to the mother that when she dies the handicapped child often can find no substitute. Cross-cultural comparison suggests that this is not a culture-specific pattern: on the contrary, the Arab family seems in this regard quite similar to American and English families. Another finding is that the presence of a handicap in a child disrupts the marriage strategies of the child's family. Fear that the handicap is hereditary makes it much more difficult for the child's sisters to find suitors. In Arab tradition, only the father of a handicapped child - not the mother or mother's family - must bear the costs of therapy and medical treatment. Consequently, women who are thought likely to transmit a handicap to their chidren are viewed as a potential source of unusual expenses and difficulties by suitors and their families.

AB  - Objective: To describe the benefits perceived by parents and professionals from their participation in parent advisory groups (PAGs). Design: Retrospective telephone survey. Setting: Parent advisory groups were established in 4 community-based pediatric practices. Each group included parents of children with chronic health conditions, health care providers, and a Department of Public Health staff member. Participants: The mothers and fathers of children with chronic health conditions completed a telephone survey. These parents also were enrolled in a broader intervention aimed at providing primary care for children with chronic conditions. Intervention: Groups met regularly in the pediatric office setting. Logistical arrangements and activities varied among the 4 groups. Main Outcome Measures: Parents and profession- als rated their perceptions of the PAGs based on a structured list of potential benefits. Results: Mothers viewed the PAGs as most beneficial in diminishing their isolation, helping them to understand family concerns, increasing their influence on the pediatric care provided to their children, and improving their knowledge of community resources. Professionals believed that the PAGs enhanced their awareness of common family needs, increased their skills at collaborating with families, and helped them to feel more effective. All professionals and most parents were interested in continuing their involvement in a FAG. Conclusions: Parent advisory groups may benefit families and professionals who care for them by (1) fostering collaborative relationships and communication, (2) increasing a sense of social support among families, (3) increasing families' knowledge of community-based resources, and (4) increasing the families' sense of efficacy and involvement in the care of their own and others' children.

AB  - This study seeks to extend knowledge of the relation between aspects of maternal parenting in early childhood to the later school social competence of children with disabilities. Children with developmental disabilities (DD) have more difficulty with social competence and exhibit more behavior problems than typically developing children. The question of which aspects of maternal parenting promote social competence is approached through a developmental-contextual systems model. Two key aspects of maternal parenting are posited to relate to the social competence and behavior problems of children with disabilities: (1) mother-child interaction and (2) maternal parenting-stress. The sample consisted of 146 families participating in the Early Intervention Collaborative Study, a longitudinal investigation of children with developmental disabilities (Down syndrome, motor impairment, or developmental delay) and their families. When the children were ages 2 and 3 mothers reported their levels of parenting-stress and mother-child dyads were observed during a teaching interaction. At age 5 children were observed in their classroom during peer-interaction. Teachers also reported on the children's classroom social competence. The findings reveal that mother-child dyads are at risk for less positive interactive styles as compared to typically developing dyads, as mothers of children with DD were found to interact with their children on average less positively and less contingently than mothers of children without disabilities. Despite this, mother-child interaction was important to the social competence of children with DD. The main findings indicate that at age 3 the quality of mother-child interaction was a key determinant of classroom social competence and behavior problems at age 5 predicting unique variance beyond the child's cognitive performance, type of disability, family socio-economic status, and parenting-stress. In contrast, no aspect of maternal parenting related to children's peer-related social competence. Collectively the findings suggest that interventions aimed at fostering positive mother-child interaction will target a relative weakness in parent-child interactions and simultaneously promote later classroom social competence and decrease behavior problems for children with developmental disabilities.

AB  - Early psychosocial deprivation has profound adverse effects on children's brain and behavioural development, including abnormalities in physical growth, intellectual function, social cognition, and emotional development. Nevertheless, the domain of emotional face processing has appeared in previous research to be relatively spared; here, we test for possible sleeper effects emerging in early adolescence. This study employed event-related potentials ( ERPs) to examine the neural correlates of facial emotion processing in 12-year-old children who took part in a randomized controlled trial of foster care as an intervention for early institutionalization. Results revealed no significant group differences in two face and emotion-sensitive ERP components (P1 and N170), nor any association with age at placement or per cent of lifetime spent in an institution. These results converged with previous evidence from this population supporting relative sparing of facial emotion processing. We hypothesize that this sparing is due to an experience-dependent mechanism in which the amount of exposure to faces and facial expressions of emotion children received was sufficient to meet the low threshold required for cortical specialization of structures critical to emotion processing.

AB  - Objective: To describe Aboriginal community members' perspectives on the outcomes and origins of resilience among Aboriginal children. Methods: Face-to-face interviews were conducted with 36 Aboriginal adults (15 health service professionals, 8 youth workers and 13 community members) at two urban and one regional Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Service in New South Wales. Interviews were transcribed and analysed thematically. Results: We identified six themes: withstanding risk (displaying normative development, possessing inner fortitude); adapting to adversity (necessary endurance, masking inner vulnerabilities); positive social influences (secure family environments, role modelling healthy behaviours and relationships); instilling cultural identity (investing in Aboriginal knowledge, building a strong cultural self-concept); community safeguards (offering strategic sustainable services, holistic support, shared responsibility, providing enriching opportunities); and personal empowerment (awareness of positive pathways, developing self-respect, fostering positive decision making). Conclusions: Community members believed that resilient Aboriginal children possessed knowledge and self-belief that encouraged positive decision making despite challenging circumstances. A strong sense of cultural identity and safe, stable and supportive family environments were thought to promote resilient behaviours. Implications for public health: Many Aboriginal children continue to face significant adversity. More sustainable, Aboriginal-led programs are needed to augment positive family dynamics, identify at-risk children and provide safeguards during periods of familial adversity.

AB  - <bold>Background: </bold>HIV, syphilis, malaria and anaemia are leading preventable causes of adverse pregnancy outcomes in sub-Saharan Africa yet testing coverage for conditions other than HIV is low. Availing point-of-care tests (POCTs) at rural antenatal health facilities (dispensaries) has the potential to improve access and timely treatment. Fundamental to the adoption of and adherence to new diagnostic approaches are healthcare workers' and pregnant women's (end-users) buy-in. A qualitative approach was used to capture end-users' experiences of using POCTs for HIV, syphilis, malaria and anaemia to assess the appropriateness, acceptability and feasibility of integrated testing for ANC.<bold>Methods: </bold>Seven dispensaries were purposively selected to implement integrated point-of-care testing for eight months in western Kenya. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 healthcare workers (14 nurses, one clinical officer, two HIV testing counsellors, and one laboratory technician) who were trained, had experience doing integrated point-of-care testing, and were still working at the facilities 8-12 months after the intervention began. The interviews explored acceptability and relevance of POCTs to ANC, challenges with testing, training and supervision, and healthcare workers' perspectives of client experiences. Twelve focus group discussions with 118 pregnant women who had attended a first ANC visit at the study facilities during the intervention were conducted to explore their knowledge of HIV, syphilis, malaria, and anaemia, experience of ANC point-of-care testing services, treatments received, relationships with healthcare workers, and experience of talking to partners about HIV and syphilis results.<bold>Results: </bold>Healthcare workers reported that they enjoyed gaining new skills, were enthusiastic about using POCTs, and found them easy to use and appropriate to their practice. Initial concerns that performing additional testing would increase their workload in an already strained environment were resolved with experience and proficiency with the testing procedures. However, despite having the diagnostic tools, general health system challenges such as high client to healthcare worker volume ratio, stock-outs and poor working conditions challenged the delivery of adequate counselling and management of the four conditions. Pregnant women appreciated POCTs, but reported poor healthcare worker attitudes, drug stock-outs, and fear of HIV disclosure to their partners as shortcomings to their ANC experience in general.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>This study provides insights on the acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of integrating POCTs into ANC services among end-users. While the innovation was desired and perceived as beneficial, future scale-up efforts would need to address health system weaknesses if integrated testing and subsequent effective management of the four conditions are to be achieved.

AB  - One hundred and seventy 16- to 35-year-old offspring of parents with drinking problems were recruited from a variety of clinical and community sources and each was interviewed at length using a semi-structured interview. The present paper focuses upon carefully reconstructed recollections of childhood, and presents quantitative information from the whole sample and three briefly described individual examples. Large variances on quantitative measures and very varied qualitative accounts of childhood were evident. The large majority described parental drinking problems which spanned their childhood and adolescent years without interruption and without treatment. Amongst the most frequently recalled effects on life at home were parental moodiness, unreliability, and a tendency to upset or fail to join in with family activities. Amongst negative childhood experiences recalled most frequently were worry and uncertainty, a feeling of family instability, the experience of being caught between the interests of two parents, and the adoption of certain adult roles. Those with mothers with drinking problems scored significantly higher on a scale of negative childhood experiences and mothers with drinking problems were more likely to have drunk regularly at home. Those offspring from families of higher social status estimated their parental problems to have started slightly later in childhood. Qualitative analysis suggested that whether excessive parental drinking is perceived as alien to or integral with family life may have been a neglected variable.

AB  - Young children who have been removed from their biological families and placed in foster care are at significant risk for poor developmental outcomes. Their vulnerability is often the result of adverse biological and psychosocial influences: prenatal exposure to alcohol and other drugs, premature birth, abuse and neglect leading to foster placement, and failure to form adequate attachments to their primary caregivers. Children younger than 6 years form the largest group entering foster care, and remain longest in care. Meeting the complex needs of this vulnerable group of young children and their families presents extensive challenges for early intervention service systems. The purpose of the following discussion is to describe the foster care population and the kinds of medical conditions, mental health problems, and developmental disabilities experienced by young children in foster care, and to explore implications for intervention. By increasing their understanding of risk factors, vulnerabilities, and complex service needs, early childhood professionals can become effective advocates and provide services that ameliorate risk and optimize outcomes for these children and their families.

AB  - Young women are confronted with the same consequences of cancer as older women are. In addition, they face problems specifically related to their age, such as their children’s education and their family responsibilities, marital relationships, and career issues.The objective was to identify the functioning profiles of young couples confronted with hormone therapy.This study was both qualitative and dyadic. Interviews with 11 couples revealed 5 themes.Initially, the partners reported increased intimacy and mutual support; however, during hormone therapy, a divergence developed between the patients and their partners. The partners wished for the couple to resume a normal life. The patients’ loved ones, also helpful in the beginning, were tempted to promote this resumption of normalcy, with the risk that the patients’ suffering would no longer be acknowledged. The risk of cancer recurrence appeared to immobilize the patients, who were unable to adopt a long-term perspective. Finally, the experience of the disease led the participants to reorganize their priorities and promoted self-centering.Breast cancer affects both the patient and her loved ones. Future research should focus on qualitative extensions to other stages of cancer treatment and quantitative studies to measure the phenomena revealed in the current work.Cancer and its treatment have impacts on the patient and her marriage; therefore, the focus for the clinical care should be on the couple rather than just the patient. Additionally, our findings suggest new areas of psychological dyadic counseling for cancer patients and their partners.

AB  - CRIME VICTIMS ARE ATTRACTING NEW ATTENTION AND INTEREST. HOWEVER, ALTHOUGH NEARLY HALF THE STATES IN THE U.S. HAVE PASSED COMPENSATION LAWS FOR CRIME VICTIMS, MOST PROGRAMS HAVE FUNDING DIFFICULTIES OR REQUIRE APPLICANTS TO BE POOR. FEDERAL COMPENSATION FUNDS ARE LIMITED TO 25 PERCENT OF ALL AWARDS. CARE AND SUCCOR OF CRIME VICTIMS IS LIMITED BY THE CURRENT PROTECTIVE ATTITUDE TOWARD CRIMINAL DEFENDANTS, AND CRIME VICTIMS ARE IGNORED AND INCONVENIENCED IN MANY WAYS BY COURTS, PROSECUTORS, AND POLICE. VICTIMS SUFFICIENTLY BRAVE TO TESTIFY ARE NOT USUALLY OFFERED PROTECTION, AND CANNOT USUALLY GET INFORMATION ABOUT A CASE ONCE IT IS IN THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM. ALTHOUGH VIOLENT STREET CRIME IS THE MOST FEARED, MOST VIOLENT CRIMES OCCUR BETWEEN FRIENDS OR RELATIONS. BUT SOCIETY IS AMBIVALENT IN DEALING WITH DOMESTIC CRIME, ALTHOUGH THE WOMEN'S MOVEMENT HAS BEEN EFFECTING MORE WIFE-BEATING ARRESTS AND TRIALS. NEVERTHELESS, HOW MUCH THE CRIMINAL PROCESS SHOULD INTRUDE IN DOMESTIC RELATIONS HAS YET TO BE DECIDED. FINALLY, WITNESS INTIMIDATION BY THE DEFENSE AT TRIAL IS WIDESPREAD BUT POORLY ADDRESSED IN LAW. ALTHOUGH INVESTIGATION OR PROSECUTION OF INTIMIDATION ARE DIFFICULT, THEY MUST BE FOSTERED. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT CITIZEN GROUPS BE SET UP TO ASSIST VICTIMS. NOTES AND AN APPENDED COMMENTARY ARE INCLUDED. (PAP)

AB  - Background: Early child nutritional deficiencies are prevalent in low- and middle-countries with consequences linked not only to poor survival and growth, but also to poor development outcomes. Children in disadvantaged communities face multiple risks for nutritional deficiencies, yet some children may be less susceptible or may recover more quickly from malnutrition. A greater understanding is needed about factors which moderate the effects of nutrition-related risks and foster resilience to protect against or ameliorate poor development outcomes. Methods: A literature review was undertaken from August to December 2011 and updated in August 2012. Key word searches using terms Nutrition, Malnutrition, Child Development, Responsive Care, Stimulation, Low and Middle Income Countries and Resilience were undertaken using PubMed and Psychinfo. Results: Dietary adequacy is critical for growth and development, but current evidence indicates that nutrition supplementation alone is insufficient to foster resilience to protect against, mitigate, and recover from nutritional threats and to promote healthy development. The combination of nutrition interventions with stimulation and responsive care is necessary. Combined nutrition and psychosocial stimulation approaches can potentially work effectively together to promote protective factors and mitigate risks for poor cognitive, motor, social, and affective functioning helping children to adapt in times of adversity. However, there are gaps in our existing knowledge to combine nutrition and psychosocial stimulation interventions effectively and promote these interventions at scale. Conclusions: Research needs to address barriers at the level of family, community, programme, and policy which have prevented thus far the uptake of combined nutrition and psychosocial intervention strategies. Further investigations are needed on how to provide support to caregivers, enabling them to implement appropriate care for feeding and stimulation. Finally, the effect of combined interventions on pathways of care and protective mediators that foster resilience need to be better understood to determine focus areas for content of combined intervention curricula which help families in high-risk settings.

Of 3995 youths sampled from 1598 mental health programs in the United States, 14% lived away from their own families, either in foster care, group care settings, or correctional settings, or were emancipated. As a group, youths living away from families were more seriously emotionally disturbed and more likely to receive treatment in residential care programs. Youths who lived in foster care were more likely to be admitted to outpatient programs, while youths who lived in group care settings or correctional settings were more likely to be admitted to residential care programs, controlling on demographic and clinical characteristics. Targeting resources to enhance the availability and therapeutic capacity of foster care may facilitate community living, and decrease time spent in institutional settings.

AB  - The National Center on Educational Outcomes (NCEO) has developed a framework for educational accountability that specifies outcomes and indicators for six developmental levels (ages three and six, grades four, eight, and twelve, and post-school). The framework is designed to be used for the development or revision of district and states assessment and accountability systems. The framework can also be used to design alternate assessment systems and guide the Individualized Educational Program planning process for students with disabilities, ensuring that individual goals are comprehensive and aligned with state and/or district standards. This document focuses on outcomes and indicators for the post-school individual. Checklists are provided for the following domains: (1) academic and functional literacy; (2) physical health; (3) responsibility and independence; (4) citizenship; (5) personal and social well-being; (6) satisfaction; (7) participation; (8) family involvement; and (9) accommodation. It also examines the relationship between the NCEO framework and the SCANS Skills and Competencies, and the NCEO framework compared to transition components required under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Appendices include the SCANS Skill and Competencies and describe the domains, indicators, and source of information that can be adopted or adapted for use in system-wide or individual accountability.

AB  - Life-threatening illness (e.g. cancer) is recognized as a traumatic stressful event. Cancer patients who receive medical treatment may present some notable psychological complaints, such as depressive and posttraumatic stress symptoms. Thus, factors associated with these psychiatric symptoms may play an important role in the adjustment and recovery of the postoperative cancer patients. Empirical researches suggest rumination as a powerful predictor of the maintenance of depressive and PTSD symptoms in response to stress. However, the relationship between rumination and PTSD symptoms in cancer patients has been little understood in the western literature or examined in Taiwan. Therefore, the first purpose of the present study was to investigate the relationship among rumination, depression, and PTSD symptoms in postoperative breast cancer patients. This study also sought to examine the ability of rumination in predicting depression and PTSD symptoms. Specifically, ruminative response style was hypothesized to predict depressive and PTSD severity in postoperative cancer patients. In addition, rumination was assumed to have a unique contribution to the prediction of PTSD severity, controlling for current level of depressive severity. Two hundred and forty four postoperative breast cancer female outpatients recruited from National Taiwan University Hospital volunteered to participate in this study. The measures included the Symptom Check List-90-Revised short form, Post Traumatic Stress Reaction Index-short form, and Chinese Response Style Questionnaire-short form. The results showed that, as predicted, response style could both significantly predict depression and PTSD severity in postoperative breast cancer patients. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that, after demographical variables and depression severity were controlled, ruminative response style had a unique contribution to the prediction of PTSD severity. The findings of this study suggest that rumination may play an important role in the development and maintenance of PTSD symptoms in cancer patients. It is speculated that ruminating traumatic experiences may trigger intrusive traumatic memories and affect the cognitive reconstruction of traumatic events. Ruminative responses may also interfere with instrumental behaviors such as seeking care and reducing problem solving ability thus so to result in exacerbation of PTSD. Finally, it will be helpful to replicate this study in patients with different types of cancers. Moreover, future studies can adopt different research paradigms, such as prospective design, to establish the causal relationship of rumination and PTSD symptoms.

AB  - This study assesses the impact of computerized physician order entry (CPOE) implementation in pediatric hospitals on reported adverse drug events. Using a nested matched case-control design; we linked CPOE implementation information from the health information management systems society anallytics database with reported adverse drug event (ADE) from the national association of children's hospitals and related institutions case mix comparative data program. Differences were examined using univariate and multivariate conditional logistic regression analyses. Patients from CPOE hospitals were more frequently seen in larger hospitals have more co-morbidities than those from non-CPOE hospitals. When matched by admitting diagnosis, age, gender and race, ADE cases were associated with more reported co-morbidities, and were reported less frequently in hospitals with CPOE. Patients from hospitals without CPOE were 42% more likely to experience reportable ADE after adjusting for the presence of co-morbidities. In conclusion, we found significant beneficial associations between reportable ADE and CPOE adoption in a representative sample of pediatric hospitals. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The objective of this dissertation is to determine the program effects of studying abroad for college students at a northeastern U.S. university including: the motivation for studying abroad, the relationships between participants’ characteristics and program effects, and the interrelationships among program effects. A series of investigations have been conducted to answer three research questions and six proposed hypotheses. The questions and hypotheses are based on the results of a pilot study and an intensive review of the previous literature. A total of 265 college students participated in this study and completed a web-based survey in 2005. The dissertation is organized in a three-article format. The first study explores the motivations for studying abroad and concludes, via qualitative content analysis, that there are six main motivations for studying abroad: cultural learning, academic learning, foreign experience, personal development, pleasure, and social interactions. Moreover, this motivation study showed that the expectancy-valence theory is an alternative approach to interpret participants motivations for studying abroad and the findings exemplify and illustrate that students are motivated by the expected program benefits. However, this study did not testify the application of expectancy-valence theory in study abroad context. The second study determines the program effects and examines the relationship between participants’ characteristics and program effects. Five program effects are extracted from the answers to a 24-item questionnaire including: language learning, cultural immersion, foreign connection, personal growth, and career development. The results suggest that gender and year-in-college are not significant predictors in terms of program effects. Also, the rest of the findings suggest that business and science majors have higher levels of foreign cultural learning than art majors. Also, the semester-based programs significantly contribute to increasing foreign connections because the homestay option is the most effective living arrangement for foreign language learning among all residency arrangements. Local friendships also contribute to foreign connection and cultural learning. The third study examines six hypotheses with respect to the interrelationships among program effects. Two models were derived from previous literature and tested in these data. After statistical analyses, an intercultural connection model suggests that language learning is the antecedent for cultural immersion and cultural immersion is the antecedent for foreign connection. Cultural immersion fully mediates the relationship between language learning and foreign connection. In a personal progress model, foreign connection serves as an antecedent both for personal growth and career plans and personal growth also has positive relationship to career plans. Personal growth partially mediates the relationship between foreign interaction and career plans. Taken together, all results suggest that studying abroad plays a crucial role in the 'University of Travel' (Pearce & Foster, 2007), where the close relationship between travel and learning. College officials might consider developing more customized programs for specific target audiences than before, like language learning-oriented or foreign experience-oriented travel programs based on the findings from the second and third studies. From an academic perspective, this study might serve as the primary step in describing the program effects and comprehending how tourism and education cohere together in a travel context. Moreover, future research is needed to examine the program effects longitudinally and experimental-designed research would be an effective approach to identify the cause and effect relationships in terms of program effects.

AB  - BACKGROUND It has been demonstrated in previous studies that pharmacist management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the outpatient setting not only improves diabetes-related clinical outcomes such as hemoglobin A1c but also blood pressure (BP), total cholesterol (TC), and quality of life. Improved control of BP and TC has been shown to reduce the risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD), which has placed a heavy economic burden on the health care system. However, no study has evaluated the cost-effectiveness of pharmacist intervention programs with respect to the long-term preventive effects on CVD outcomes among T2DM patients. OBJECTIVES To (a) quantify the long-term preventive effects of pharmacist intervention on CM) outcomes among T2DM patients using evidence from a matched cohort study in the outpatient primary care setting and (b) assess the relative cost-effectiveness of adding a clinical pharmacist to the primary care team for the management of patients with T2DM based on improvement in CM) risks with the aid of an economic model. METHODS Clinical data between the periods of June 2007 to February 2010 were collected from electronic medical records at 2 separate clinics at Kaiser Permanente (KP) Northern California, 1 with primary care physicians only (control group) and the other with the addition of a pharmacist (enhanced care group). Patients in the enhanced care group were matched 1:1 with patients in the control group according to baseline characteristics that included age, gender, A1c, and Charism comorbidity score. The estimated 10-year GO risk for both groups was calculated by the tilted Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKFDS) Fisk Engine (version 2) based on age, sex, race, smoking status, atrial fibrillation, duration of diabetes, levels of A1c, systolic BP (SBP) and TC and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C)observed at 12 months. There was no statistical difference in the baseline clinical inputs to the Risk Engine (A1c {[}P=0.115], SBP {[}P=0.184], TC{[}P=0.055], and HDL-C{[}P=0.475]) between the 2 groups. A Kharkov model was developed to simulate the estimated CM) outcomes over 10 years and to estimate cost-effectiveness. The final outcomes examined included incremental cost and effectiveness measured by life years and per quality-acquested life year gained. Both deterministic sensitivity analysis (SA) and probabilistic SA were conducted to examine the robustness of the results. RESULTS The estimated risks for coronary heart disease (OHD) and stroke (both nonfatal and fatal) at the end of the follow-up were consistently lower in the enhanced care group compared with the control group, even though baseline risks in both groups were similar. The absolute risk reduction (ARR) between the enhanced care and control groups increased over time. For example, the ARR for nonfatal CHD risk in year 1 was 0.5% (1.2% vs. 0.7%), whereas the ARR increased to 5.5% in year 10 (14.8% vs. 9.3%). Similarly, the ARR between the enhanced care and the control groups was calculated as 0.3% for fatal OHD in year 1 and increased to 4.6% in year 10. Results from the Markov model suggest that the enhanced care group was shown to be a dominant strategy (less expensive and more effective) compared with the control group in the 10-year evaluation period in the base-case (average or mean results) scenario. Sensitivity analysis that took into account the uncertainty in all important variables, such as wage of pharmacists, utility weight (the degree of preference individuals have for a particular health state or condition), response rate to pharmacists' care, and uncertainty associated with the estimated 10 years of CVD risk, revealed that the relative value of enhanced care was robust to most of the variations in these parameters. Notably, the level of cost-effectiveness measured by net monetary value depends on the time horizon adopted by the payers and the magnitude of CM) risk reduction The enhanced care group has a higher chance of being considered as a cost-effective strategy when a longer time horizon such as a minimum of 4 to 5 years is adopted CONCLUSIONS Adding pharmacists to the health care management team for diabetic patients improves the long-term CM) risks. The longer-term CVD risk reductions were shown to be more dramatic than the short-term reduction. A longer time horizon adopted by health plans in managing T2DM patients has a higher probability of making the intervention cost-effective. Copyright (C) 2013, Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy.

AB  - Background Robust evidence suggests a strong association between juvenile victimization and delinquency. Yet, there is a lack of research on the protective factors at the individual level that may buffer the relationship between victimization and delinquent behaviors. Objectives This study adopted a positive psychology perspective to examine the effects of three types of personal strength (self-regulation, interpersonal, and intellectual) on the relationship between different types of victimization and delinquency. Participants and Setting Data were collected from 631 Chinese migrant children (mean age = 10.52 ± 0.92 years) via convenience sampling. Methods Participants completed a self-reported questionnaire that assessed experiences of victimization in family, interpersonal, and community settings, involvement in delinquent behaviors, and personal strengths. Results The prevalence of different delinquent behaviors was significantly higher in the victimization groups than in the non-victimization groups. Regression analyses revealed that all three types of personal strength served as direct predictors of delinquency (Bself-regulation = −0.46, SEself-regulation = .09, p < .001; Binterpersonal strength = −0.23, SEinterpersonal strength = .06, p < .001; Bintellectual strength = −0.19, SEintellectual strength = .05, p < .001), while self-regulation further moderated the victimization-delinquency relationship. When self-regulation was high, the association between victimization and delinquency was significantly weaker than when self-regulation was low. Conclusions Our findings suggest that personal strengths are important protective factors for youth exposed to experiences of victimization. Identifying methods to help victims recognize, develop, and use their personal strengths should be integral to support and intervention efforts for young victims.

AB  - <bold>Background: </bold>An individualized approach using shared decision-making (SDM) and goal setting is a person-centred strategy that may facilitate prioritization of treatment options. SDM has not been adopted extensively in clinical practice. An interprofessional approach to SDM with tools to facilitate patient participation may overcome barriers to SDM use. The aim was to explore decision-making experiences of health professionals and people with diabetes (PwD), then develop an intervention to facilitate interprofessional shared decision-making (IP-SDM) and goal-setting.<bold>Methods: </bold>This was a multi-phased study. 1) Feasibility: Using a descriptive qualitative study, individual interviews with primary care physicians, nurses, dietitians, pharmacists, and PwD were conducted. The interviews explored their experiences with SDM and priority-setting, including facilitators and barriers, relevance of a decision aid for priority-setting, and integration of SDM and a decision aid into practice. 2) Development: An evidence-based SDM toolkit was developed, consisting of an online decision aid, MyDiabetesPlan, and implementation tools. MyDiabetesPlan was reviewed by content experts for accuracy and comprehensiveness. Usability assessment was done with 3) heuristic evaluation and 4) user testing, followed by 5) refinement.<bold>Results: </bold>Seven PwD and 10 clinicians participated in the interviews. From interviews with PwD, we identified that: (1) approaches to decision-making were diverse and dynamic; (2) a trusting relationship with the clinician and dialog were critical precursors to SDM; and, (3) goal-setting was a dynamic process. From clinicians, we found: (1) complementary (holistic and disease specific) approaches to the complex patient were used; (2) patient-provider agendas for goal-setting were often conflicting; (3) a flexible approach to decision-making was needed; and, (4) conflict could be resolved through SDM. Following usability assessment, we redesigned MyDiabetesPlan to consist of data collection and recommendation stages. Findings were used to finalize a multi-component toolkit and implementation strategy, consisting of MyDiabetesPlan, instructional card and videos, and orientation meetings with participating patients and clinicians.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>A decision aid can provide information, facilitate clinician-patient dialog and strengthen the therapeutic relationship. Implementation of the decision aid can fit into a model of team care that respects and exemplifies professional identity, and can facilitate intra-team communication.<bold>Trial Registration: </bold>Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02379078.

AB  - Robust evidence suggests a strong association between juvenile victimization and delinquency. Yet, there is a lack of research on the protective factors at the individual level that may buffer the relationship between victimization and delinquent behaviors. This study adopted a positive psychology perspective to examine the effects of three types of personal strength (self-regulation, interpersonal, and intellectual) on the relationship between different types of victimization and delinquency. Data were collected from 631 Chinese migrant children (mean age = 10.52 ± 0.92 years) via convenience sampling. Participants completed a self-reported questionnaire that assessed experiences of victimization in family, interpersonal, and community settings, involvement in delinquent behaviors, and personal strengths. The prevalence of different delinquent behaviors was significantly higher in the victimization groups than in the non-victimization groups. Regression analyses revealed that all three types of personal strength served as direct predictors of delinquency (B self-regulation = −0.46, SE self-regulation =.09, p <.001; B interpersonal strength = −0.23, SE interpersonal strength =.06, p <.001; B intellectual strength = −0.19, SE intellectual strength =.05, p <.001), while self-regulation further moderated the victimization-delinquency relationship. When self-regulation was high, the association between victimization and delinquency was significantly weaker than when self-regulation was low. Our findings suggest that personal strengths are important protective factors for youth exposed to experiences of victimization. Identifying methods to help victims recognize, develop, and use their personal strengths should be integral to support and intervention efforts for young victims.

AB  - Aims. The aim was to explore the prevalence of five components of metabolic syndrome with respect to gender and health-promoting lifestyle behaviours. Background. Age- and gender-specific strategies might be useful as an approach to controlling metabolic syndrome. Prevention or delaying the onset of metabolic syndrome is of utmost importance in terms of chronic disease care in Taiwan. Design. This was a cross-sectional study. Method. Participants self-completed a questionnaire and replied via mail. Results. The overall prevalence rate of metabolic syndrome was 24·07%, with men showing a higher rate than women. High blood pressure was the first abnormal component. The genders were significantly different in the prevalence of high blood pressure, hypertriglyceridemia and decreased HDL-C. Age was also a significant determinant and positively correlated to the total Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile II (HPLP II) scale score ( r = 0·11*), nutrition ( r = 0·14**), physical activity ( r = −0·16**) and health responsibility ( r = 0·12**). Conclusions. Young, employed adult men were most at risk for having metabolic syndrome. It would seem that it is essential to control blood pressure and abdominal obesity to prevent metabolic syndrome; however, accomplishing this by trying to improve the level of physical activity does not seem to be a viable solution. Moreover, lifestyle modification has been proposed using gender-, age- and location-specific interventions. Nurses should not only strive to investigate the factors that lead to the adoption of unhealthy lifestyle behaviours by using the system approach, but also to empower people to participate in designing health programmes. Relevance to clinical practice. By understanding the components of metabolic syndrome, it will be possible to develop more effective strategies for its prevention. Based on this, it will help if healthcare providers focus their efforts on the specific components of metabolic syndrome and on the individuals who are at the greatest risk of developing metabolic syndrome.

AB  - Aim. The present study examined the factors related to self-care behaviour in type 2 diabetic patients aged ≥65 years. In addition, this study tested the effect of the important explanatory factors on self-care behaviour. Background. Along with the development of an ageing society, diabetes occurs frequently among older people. Diabetes requires continual medical treatment, with patients responsible for self-care. Although the relationships among social support, depression and self-care have been widely studied, little is know about older diabetic patients, especially in Taiwan. Design. A correlational design was adopted. In total, 165 patients recruited using convenience sampling were diabetic outpatients at three hospitals in southern Taiwan from January–March 2005. Methods. The participants were interviewed using the Personal Resource Questionnaire 2000 (PRQ 2000), Diabetes Self-Care Scale and Taiwan Geriatric Depression Scale (TGDS). Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and multiple regression analysis. Result. Self-care behaviour scores were significantly influenced by different gender, education level, economic status and religious beliefs of older diabetic patients. Depression and self-care behaviour were negatively correlated. Social support, education and duration of diabetes significantly affected self-care behaviour, accounting for 35·6% of total variance. Conclusions. Social support plays a vital factor in contributing to the facilitation of self-care behaviour. These analytical findings demonstrate the importance of social support, education and duration of diabetes in determining self-care behaviour for diabetic older diabetic patients and serve as references for future studies of self-care behaviour in type 2 older diabetic patients. Relevance to clinical practice. Implication for nurses highlights the significance of providing patients with social support that will enable them to have good support systems during their disease treatment to enhance self-care abilities and improve quality of life.

AB  - Objectives: This study aims to investigate the association between clustering of health-related behaviors and heath-care services utilization amongst emerging adults. Methods: This study utilized a sub-sample between 18 and 25 years of age from the 2009 National Health Interview Survey. A two-step cluster analysis was used to identify groups of emerging adults with similar behavior patterns. Logistic regression and a zero-inflated negative binomial regression model were used to determine the association between groups of clustering and utilization of emergency care and outpatient healthcare services. Results: Three clusters were identified, including "smoking-alcohol," "unbalanced diet," and "healthy lifestyle." Those who were classified in the "smoking-alcohol" cluster were more likely to use emergency care services (OR=1.59; 95% CI=1.14-2.21), and those who were in the "unbalanced diet" cluster were more likely to use emergency care service (IRR=1.49; 95% CI=1.08-2.05) when compared to those in the "healthy lifestyle" cluster. The current study showed no relationship between the clusters and outpatient healthcare services, whether or not use or the number of visits was considered. Conclusions: Health-related behaviors tend to cluster amongst emerging adults. In addition, health behavior clusters were shown to be associated with a higher risk of using emergency care and more visits of emergency care services. These findings suggest that whether school- or workplace-based, health promotion program could adopt an integrated approach and taior-made programs, when taking into account the common determinants across different types of health behaviors.

AB  - With emerging technology, computerised, internet-based and virtual reality (VR)-based treatment and training became increasingly popular. VR provides an immersive experience into a simulated environment. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterised by social communication deficits and repetitive behaviours. Children with ASD often require social skills training while VR provides a safe, controllable environment to practice skills repeatedly. The Centre for Innovative Applications of Internet and Multimedia Technologies (AIMTech Centre) at City University of Hong Kong developed a VR-enabled training program to examine its efficacy on emotional and social skills with six VR scenarios depicting the daily lives of typical children in Hong Kong. 94 children from mainstream primary schools in Hong Kong completed the study and 72 children were included in the analysis. Children from training group scored higher on emotion expression and regulation (M = 20.2, SD = 3.00) than before the training (M = 18.9, SD = 3.57, t(35) = -2.174, p = .037) and higher on social interaction and adaptation after the training (M = 21.8, SD = 2.99) than before training (M = 20.2, SD = 3.43, t(35) = -3.987, p < .0005). There was a statistically significant interaction between group and time on affective expressions, F(1, 70) = 5.223, p = .025, partial η2 = .069, and on social reciprocity, F(1, 70) = 7.769, p = .007, partial n2 = .100. Children were able to engage in VR training despite initial challenges with viewing goggles. Some children declined to participate due to scheduling reasons which may be minimised through the adoption of head-mounted displays as a portable, cost-effective device. VR seems to be a promising asset to traditional training and therapy while the importance trainers' or therapists' support has yet to be further investigated.

AB  - Objective: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) may experience psychiatric problems while having to cope with the various characteristics of the disease. Identifying the level of hope, coping strategies, and perceived social support may provide valuable information to improve treatment plans and the response to treatment. This study aimed to evaluate the association between hope, anxiety, depression, coping strategies, and perceived social support in patients with CKD. Method: A total of 65 grade 3 or 4 CKD patients and a healthy control group (51 volunteers) with matched baseline sociodemographic characteristics were included. The participants were evaluated using a sociodemographic data form, the Herth Hope Scale (HHS), Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), COPE Inventory, and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). Results: The level of hope was lower, depression scores were higher and non-functional coping strategies were observed more often in patients with CKD compared to the healthy control group. In multiple linear regression analysis, anxiety and depression levels were found to have a negative effect and perceived social support by the family a positive effect on the level of hope in patients with CKD. Conclusion: Anxiety, depression, and perceived social support by the family predict the hope level of patients with CKD. A multidisciplinary approach including psychiatric consultation should be adopted in the treatment of patients with CKD as hope plays an important role in treatment compliance.

AB  - The focus of this book is on children and families. Beginning with a conceptual understanding of family health social work practice, Dr. Yuen distinguishes various approaches for defining and understanding health issues and urges readers to change their perspectives on health and family practice. Contributors address family health practice interventions as well as policy, programs, and emerging family themes, and they include case studies and examples. Regarding practice interventions, Skibinski and Connor focus on child sexual abuse examination and treatment processes, highlight the importance of diversion programs, and suggest helpful child sexual abuse litigation strategies. Pardeck introduces the use of bibliotherapy when working with children of divorced parents and offers practical steps to match appropriate books with specific problems. Dollar addresses adaptive strategies for assisting rural families living with HIV/AIDS and discusses high-risk groups, poverty, and the multiple impacts and stressors on, as well as family and community interventions for, this emerging and neglected population. Orgassa contributes on the topic of families with children with disabilities and utilizes a crisis intervention helping model that reflects family health care services. Burris centers on children's reactions to loss in terms of grief and coping, offers practical ways of helping, and discusses developmental issues involved in the process. Ramirez Barranti explores the personal characteristics of Mexican migrant and seasonal and life experiences of this group. Addressing policy and program concerns, Price highlights an increasingly visible family pattern of grandparents as parents and helps readers understand the concerns of custodial grandparents. She underlines psychosocial challenges, racial and ethnic considerations, problem behaviors of grandchildren, and relationship issues with adult children. Kennedy writes about lesbian and gay families and comments on legal inequities, such as custody laws, health insurance, tax laws, medical care, and estate planning. Taylor analyzes the child welfare and foster care policies affecting family health and well-being, pointing out service differentiation, policies of contradictory care, child welfare services, and the need for child health care services. Eggman portrays the health care needs of homeless women with children, discussing demographics, historical events, poverty and homelessness, and previous health care policies for homeless families. She revisits the issues of health and health care for homeless families and offers an interesting model of family health care for this population. Nicotera opens up the neighborhood as a resource for family health care practice, discusses understanding the neighborhood as a habitat and niche, and reviews literature from the adult's and child's worldviews. She suggests that the neighborhood is an appropriate resource for understanding assessment and intervention. Finally, Erlich examines family health and community practice and focuses on decent housing, safe streets, adequate transportation, day care, and recreation. His paradigm revolves around two programs: PREPARE (Problems, Reality, Establish, People, Assess, Risks, Evaluate) and IMAGINE (Idea, Muster, Assets, Goals, Implement, Neutralize, Evaluate).

AB  - The expanding number of Americans living with chronic illness necessitates educating future physicians about chronic illness care. Weill Cornell Medical College's Chronic Illness Care in the Home Setting Program (CIC-HSP), a mandatory part of the primary care clerkship, exposes medical students to persons with chronic illness via a half day of house calls with a geriatrics team. The investigators sought to qualitatively assess the effect of the CIC-HSP on medical students and recent medical graduates. Fifty-two prospective participants were approached, and 50 (96%) with varying training levels and time since completing the program were interviewed. Most respondents (63%) found that the home visits taught them important approaches to caring for the chronically ill, such as individualizing care to meet patients' individual needs and improving quality of life as a goal of care. Students remarked that the experience enhanced their empathy (18%) and sensitivity (20%) toward chronically ill patients and increased their appreciation for chronic illness care (35%). Many participants reported that patients were more empowered in the home (55%) and perceived greater rapport and warmth between the doctor and patient (57%) in the home (vs office) setting. The vast majority of recent medical graduates (84%) related that this educational exposure continued to positively influence their approach to patient care. A home visit experience with a geriatrics team can help foster medical students' understanding of the psychosocial and medical aspects of chronic illness, teach relevant approaches to patient care, and improve students' attitudes toward caring for the chronically ill.

AB  - Background: Female sex workers (FSWs) are often considered as the vector, if not reservoir, of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Building upon the existing evidence on the role of psychological health in sexual health, the aim of this protocol is to describe a trial investigating the effectiveness of the Personal Resilience and Enrichment Programme (PREP), a resilience-promoting intervention that targets at psychological well-being i.e. self-esteem, self-efficacy and coping, to facilitate adaptation and ultimately safe sexual practices among FSWs, which could be an innovative strategy in controlling the spread of these infections. Methods: A total of 132 FSWs will be recruited and randomly assigned to either the intervention or usual care (control) groups in a multi-centred randomised controlled trial. Based on the resilience framework, this intervention is comprised of six weekly sessions focused on the awareness, expression and management of emotions, identifying roles and personal strengths, and effective problem-solving skills. Complex intervention assessment on both intervention process and effectiveness will be adopted when the primary outcome reduction of sexual risk behaviour and other psychological outcomes include their perceived stress, self-esteem, self-efficacy, coping overall resilience, and psychological distress will be measured at baseline, post-treatment and 3-month post-intervention and differences assessed by ANOVA. The relationship of resilience factors, psychological health and HIV preventive behaviours will be evaluated using structural equation modelling. Discussion: It is anticipated that this study will increase our understanding of the relationships between individual resilience attributes, positive adaptation, psychological health and sexual health practices. If successful, this programme will provide an innovative direction for HIV prevention by applying the personal resilience factors to promote both psychological well-being and safe sex for this high risk population.

AB  - The immigrant population in Hong Kong is steadily increasing every year. This immigrant population largely comprises families, most of whom have pre-school and school-age children. However, limited information is known on the practices that immigrant parents adopt when they become involved in their children's schooling. In the present study, the researcher implemented a Quality Education Fund project called 'Building a caring community: Family support and empowerment.' The project aimed to promote parent education and to build a caring community by implementing a group parent education program (GPEP) for low-income and new immigrant parents. The parent leaders conducted an outreach parent education program in which the low-income, new immigrant parents (target parents) had their children enrolled in two kindergartens. The parent leaders imparted parenting knowledge, shared positive parenting strategies, and exchanged their own experiences with target parents. The present research aims to study how new immigrant parents evaluate their experiences and the effectiveness of the GPEP. Results suggest that providing opportunities for mutual support and emotional healing correlates with improved parenting attitudes and practices.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Few trials have been conducted to address the psychological difficulties of parents in managing their child's asthma. Fostering parental psychological flexibility through Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) may help parents to accept these psychological difficulties and improve their management of childhood asthma. METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, a 4-session, group-based ACT plus asthma education (ACT group) was compared with an asthma education talk plus 3 telephone followups (control group) to train parents of children diagnosed with asthma. The use of health care services due to asthma exacerbations in children and the psychological well-being of their parents were assessed before, immediately after, and at 6 months after the intervention. RESULTS: A total of 168 parents and their children aged 3 to 12 years with asthma were consecutively recruited in a public hospital in Hong Kong. When compared with the control group, children whose parents were in the ACT group made significantly fewer emergency department visits (adjusted 6-month incidence rate ratio = 0.20; confidence interval [CI] 0.08 to 0.53; P = .001) due to asthma exacerbations at 6 months postintervention. These parents also reported a decrease in psychological inflexibility (mean difference = 25.45; CI 27.71 to 23.30; P = .014), less anxiety (mean difference = 22.20; CI 23.66 to 20.73; P = .003), and stress (mean difference = 22.50; CI 24.54 to 20.47; P = .016). CONCLUSIONS: Integrating ACT into parental asthma education was effective at decreasing parental anxiety and stress and reducing the asthma-related emergency department visits of children at 6 months postintervention.

AB  - This study investigated understanding of language ambiguity as a source of individual differences in children’s reading comprehension skill, and the role of peer metalinguistic discussion in fostering comprehension improvement. Twenty-four 7- to 9-year-old children worked in pairs to discuss and resolve ambiguities in joking riddles. Their reading comprehension increased significantly more than a group of 24 no-treatment controls. Analysis of the children’s discussions shows that comprehension improvement was associated with increases over training sessions in frequency of metalinguistic comments about the text ambiguities, and in particular with the simultaneous explanation of two meanings. We discuss individual differences in metalinguistic and metacognitive capabilities and their role in the process of comprehension improvement.

AB  - The report considers two major issues in the provision of special education services to handicapped children in Minnesota schools: eligibility for instruction and services, and effectiveness of special education programs. The first chapter provides an overview of special education programs in the state, with data on number and types of children served, levels of service provided, types of service providers, student-teacher ratios, and funding sources. Chapter 2 examines programs for students with learning disabilities, noting the need for improving eligibility criteria and assessment practices. Recommendations are made for more specific criteria, clarification about tests and procedure requirements, and more active review of local district practices. In terms of program evaluation for students with learning disabilities, the report recommends identification of possible outcome measures, assistance in interpretation of results, and dissemination of "best practice" information. Chapter 3 addresses eligibility and effectiveness issues concerning emotional and behavioral disorders. Despite the finding that the department's eligibility criteria are an improvement over the existing federal definition, inadequacies are pointed out in the guidelines criteria and handbook. Chapter 4 addresses four areas: speech/language services; services to low incidence and severely handicapped persons; early childhood special education; and problems in out-of home placements in licensed residential facilities. Summary information and recommendations for action on the part of the Department of Education, school districts, the State Board of Education, and the State Legislature are presented in the concluding chapter.

AB  - Objectives. The objective of this paper is to discuss suffering in general, the criticism against fibromyalgia and other central sensitivity syndromes (CSS), the deleterious effects of disease-illness dualism, a new unifying paradigm for this duality, and then to suggest a remedial model for better patient care. Methods. A review of the literature using Medline and other sources, and an amalgamation of known knowledge with author's own ideas and inquiry. Results. Bias against CSS are harbored by many physicians, thwarting the progress for a better understanding and treatment of these syndromes. Most physicians believe in disease-illness dichotomy and pay more attention to the structural than the functional pathology, eg, neurochemical endocrine (NCE) abnormalities. Both types of pathology are likely based on biology. Even psychosocial distress is mediated by neurochemistry. A model is suggested for proper care where patients and physicians work together with a common satisfying goal, each fulfilling their individual responsibilities. Conclusion. Most physicians treat CSS with a negative attitude. The outdated model of diseaseillness dualism should be abandoned in favor of a fresh approach to medical education that fosters compassionate care irrespective of the disease label.

AB  - Mental Health Problems are among the most important contributors to the global burden of disease and disability. Gender is a critical determinant of mental health and mental illness. The gender specific determinants and mechanism that promote and protect mental health and foster resilience to stress and adversity have received very little attention as compared to the morbidity associated with mental illness. Against this backdrop the paper examines the relationship between gender and mental health—correlates and consequences. It starts with an introduction to the field of mental health and the concept of gender. This is followed by a description of significant mental disorders and problems faced by women as there are marked male/female differentials in the prevalence of specific disorder; especially depression and eating disorders exhibit a marked female excess, while in men, substance abuse disorders are more prevalent. In analyzing the role played by gender in shaping these prevalence patterns, an attempt is also made to explore how gender factors might interact to influence certain risk factors, help seeking behaviour treatment care and finally their social consequences. Recommendation regarding prevention and interventions targeted for a particular gender conclude the paper. Mental health is a term used to describe either a level of cognitive or emotional well being or an absence of a mental disorder. From perspective of the discipline of positive psychology or holism mental health may include an individual’s ability to enjoy life and procure a balance between life activities and efforts to achieve psychological resilience. Mental health is an expression of our emotions and signifies a successful adaptation to a range of demands. The World Health Organization defines mental health as a being of well-being in which the individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully and is able to make a contribution to his or her community. Most recently, the field of Global Mental Health has emerged, which has been defined as 'the area of study research and practice that places a priority on improving mental health and achieving equity in mental Health for all people worldwide.'

AB  - Osteoporosis as a worldwide problem is discussed in the present review and the question of improving peak bone mass to reduce the risk of osteoporosis and osteoporotic fracture is addressed. The available evidence points to pre-puberty and puberty as the most opportune periods for intervention, but the potential for achievable increments in bone mass is shown to be small compared with the overwhelming influence of heredity, body composition and hormonal factors on bone. Lean body mass appears to be positively correlated with bone mass, while black-white racial differences in bone mass appear to be related to greater lean mass and lower bone turnover rate in blacks. Within races, twin and parent-offspring models have suggested that 46-80 % of the variance in bone mineral density can be explained by inherited factors; however, the mechanism of the genetic influence on bone density remains poorly understood. Moderate regular exercise seems to maintain bone mass while more vigorous regular exercise increases it in children and young adults. Ca intake has been found to be positively associated with bone mass in many but not all studies, possibly because of a ceiling at about 1300-1500 mg/d for young people. Other nutritional variables, including vitamin D, have been little investigated in relation to childhood and adolescent bone mass. The influence of milk as a source of highly bioavailable Ca and other nutrients has also been less frequently investigated, which is of concern given the cessation of school milk programmes in Western countries over the last three decades. Intervention studies to improve bone health in young people have mainly been based on Ca milk or exercise. The evidence points to the benefits to bone of such interventions, particularly when commenced pre-puberty, and it seems that daily consumption of 200-300 ml milk/d by children and adolescents has no adverse side effects. The benefits to bone are almost universally shown to be lost fairly rapidly after Ca or exercise intervention ceases; there is therefore no justification in terms of bone health for short-term interventions of this nature. The question of withdrawal of milk supplementation has undergone very little examination. Further, very little evidence is available on the effects of long-term interventions of any sort on bone health. Nevertheless, the data obtained so far permit the suggestion that promotion of Ca intake (e.g. at the higher level of current recommendations) and exercise commencing in the pre-pubertal period should be adopted as policy now.

AB  - Juvenile offenders (n = 266), 12 to 18 years old) confined to a juvenile detention facility were interviewed using a structured questionnaire about personal, home, and school characteristics and experiences that may have placed them at risk for delinquency. The sample was divided into two groups, those who had special education experience and those who had not. Characteristics and experiences of the entire sample as well as comparisons between the special education and non-special education groups were reported. Most of the participants experienced multiple risk factors that predisposed them to delinquency. A high proportion (37.1%) had been in special education, with most classified as having behavior disorders (BD), learning disabilities (LD), or both. Males were more likely than females to have special education experience and to be classified as having BD, and African Americans were more likely than other racial and ethnic groups to be so classified. Although the experiences of special education and non-special education groups were similar in most ways, where differences were apparent, the special education group appeared to be at higher risk. Juvenile offenders with special education experience were more likely to need corrective lenses, to have been identified as having attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and to have taken medications for emotional problems. They had more foster placements, had attended more schools, and were more likely to have assaulted school officials. They got into trouble in school, were suspended, and made their first court appearances earlier than juvenile offenders without special education experience. Implications for prevention and intervention are suggested. (HCC)

AB  - Government can impede or foster the development of systems of care for children and adolescents with mental health needs. Government's policies and the collaboration of its agencies can promote better integrated and more comprehensive services for children. However, if government leaders are not supportive of services based on interagency collaboration, the care of youth can remain disjointed, duplicative, inefficient, and often less effective. This chapter examines the ways in which federal government and several state and provincial governments in the US and Canada are promoting the development of systems of care for children and adolescents.

AB  - Background: Bronchial thermoplasty (BT) is a recently developed treatment for patients with moderate-to-severe asthma. A few studies have suggested the clinical efficacy of this intervention. However, no study has evaluated the cost-effectiveness of BT compared to other alternative treatments for moderate-to-severe allergic asthma, which currently include omalizumab and standard therapy. Objective: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of standard therapy, BT, and omalizumab for moderate-to-severe allergic asthma in the USA. Methods: A probabilistic Markov model with weekly cycles was developed to reflect the course of asthma progression over a 5-year time horizon. The study population was adults with moderate-to-severe allergic asthma whose asthma remained uncontrolled despite using high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS, with or without long-acting beta-agonists [LABA]). A perspective of the health-care system was adopted with asthma-related costs as well as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and exacerbations as the outcomes. Results: For standard therapy, BT, and omalizumab, the discounted 5-year costs and QALYs were $15,400 and 3.08, $28,100 and 3.24, and $117,000 and 3.26, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of BT versus standard therapy and omalizumab versus BT was $78,700/QALY and $3.86 million/QALY, respectively. At the willingness-to-pay (WTP) of $50,000/QALY and $100,000/QALY, the probability of BT being cost-effective was 9%, and 67%, respectively. The corresponding expected value of perfect information (EVPI) was $155 and $1,530 per individual at these thresholds. In sensitivity analyses, increasing the costs of BT from $14,900 to $30,000 increased its ICER relative to standard therapy to $178,000/QALY, and decreased the ICER of omalizumab relative to BT to $3.06 million/QALY. Reducing the costs of omalizumab by 25% decreased its ICER relative to BT by 29%. Conclusions: Based on the available evidence, our study suggests that there is more than 60% chance that BT becomes cost-effective relative to omalizumab and standard therapy at the WTP of $100,000/QALY in patients with moderate-to-severe allergic asthma. However, there is a substantial uncertainty in the underlying evidence, indicating the need for future research towards reducing such uncertainty.

AB  - The research study explored a deeper understanding of the lived experience for 10 women who packed with garbage bags to move while living in foster care. The Administration for Children and Families Children Report (AFCAR) is published annually, and each report reflects statistics from the previous fiscal year. The number of children in foster care rose from 404,878 in 2010 to 415,129 children in 2014. For decades, foster children have been moved by placing their personal items in garbage bags, but current research literature is not addressing this topic specifically. The following questions guided the research project: 'What is the lived experience of adult women who had to move their belongings with garbage bags while living in foster care as a youth?' This qualitative study, in the transcendental phenomenological tradition, explored the lived experience of 10 adult women who packed with garbage bags to move while living in foster care as a youth. Their data was processed utilizing in vivo coding techniques, and NVivo 11 computer program for reference. The 10 co-researchers in the study ranged in ages from 24 to 55 years and lived in different states throughout the United States. The women described the following themes when they reflected back on their lived experience of packing with garbage bags to move while living in foster care (from most to least): 'Hurried', 'Chaotic', 'Devalued', 'Unwanted', 'Disposable', 'Worried'. The results of the study emphasized the emotional impact of foster children packing with garbage bags in foster care to move. The implications and recommendations for future research projects are discussed in Chapter 5. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

By drawing on 21 in-depth interviews conducted in Lahore and Sialkot (Pakistan), we found that the women tried to cope with violence by using various strategies, both emotion focused (e.g., use of religion, placating the husband, etc.) and problem focused (e.g., seeking support from formal institutions, etc.). The data showed that a majority of the women used emotion-focused strategies, especially spiritual therapies, which somehow reduced the violence and provided them with psychosocial solace. Nonetheless, these strategies incurred some costs, such as the consumption of scarce resources, time, and emotional energy. Our data also showed that few women opted for problem-focused strategies, such as seeking help from formal institutions, as these strategies could lead to overt confrontation with their husbands and may result in divorce, the outcome least desired by most of the Pakistani women. We noted that the coping behavior of Pakistani women was complex, subjective, and nonlinear and that the boundaries between emotion-focused and problem-focused strategies were diffuse and blurred. Although the women never surrendered to violence, they were fully aware of their structural limitations and vulnerabilities. Being mindful of the consequences of their actions, women carefully tailored a combination of strategies which could be helpful in resisting or reducing violence but, at the same time, should not be counterproductive. This article argues that Pakistani women alone cannot effectively resist violence while living under a harshly patriarchal regime, where violence against women is embedded in the social, political, and legal structures of society. There are no quick fixes to change the status quo. The Pakistani government, civil society, and formal institutions must proactively support women in reducing their vulnerabilities and facilitate them in expanding their capabilities to address the real causes of violence against them.

AB  - Romania and Hungary, two countries of the former Soviet Bloc, have started on their post-communist project having pretty many similarities. In the beginning they adopted the same soviet model of social organization and similar institutional framework, but, until the end of the regime they matured following divergent paths. One of the most obvious differences between the two was their different attitude towards nationalism. While the western neighbour was constantly trying to avoid it, at least at the official level, the eastern one evolved into a far-eastern type nationalist communism. On the one side of the border Hungary was boiling its "goulash communism" while living in "the merriest barrack", on the other side Romania was building "The Golden Age", one of the most gruesome despotisms in the modern Europe. The fall of Communism has not brought the expected wealth for the recently liberated nations, which seem to compensate this lack of economic success, at least partly, by the revitalisation of national feelings. One of the most important changes in the period of time that followed the fall of communism was the softening of the very strictly monitored border lying between Hungary and Romania. This border have divided not only contiguous economic and cultural micro-regions, by separating villages from their urban centres, but also human communities and even families. The border villages became practically remote dead-ends and their situation started to improve only after 1989, but real change came only after the two countries started the adhering process to the European Union. Thanks to the initial assistance offered by the Union and the subsequent accession, there has been an about-turn in the relations existing between Romania and Hungary. The aim of this paper is to present the EU financial support for cross-border cooperation since 1990, with particular emphasis on the period 2007-2013. I present the nature of the projects involved in the program, their means of financing and the efficiency of their implementation. The targeted area contains 4 counties (NUTS-II level entities) on each part of the border, namely Szabolcs-Szatmár-Bereg, Hajdú-Bihar, Békés and Csongrád counties on the Hungarian side, Satu Mare (Szatmár), Bihor (Bihar), Arad and Timiș (Temes) counties on the Romanian side. Undoubtedly, the trans-frontier projects helped a lot Hungarian and Romanian communities from both sides of the border. 159 Regarding my sources of data, the study is mainly based on official figures provided by the lead authorities, the national statistical institutes and the Eurostat. In the end, I also try to outline some conclusions based on the results of the former period of financing and to sketch some forecasts of the actual one, 2014-2020. The paper also intends to be the starting point of a comparative study between the Hungarian-Romanian and the Romanian-Bulgarian cross-border co-operations in the above mentioned period of time.

AB  - The B-->Z transition of DNA modified by platinum(II) complexes has attracted considerable interest because of a possible relationship with the molecular mechanism of antitumor activity of these metal-based compounds. Until recently it was generally accepted that the cia geometry of leaving groups in the bifunctional platinum(II) complexes should be therapeutically active. This paradigm had to be abandoned recently due to the finding that several analogues of clinically ineffective trans-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (transplatin) exhibit antitumor activity. One of these therapeutically active trans compounds is trans-dichlorobisiminoetherplatinum(II) (trans-EE) {[}iminoether = E-HN=C(OMe)Me]. In view of the fact that DNA is the main pharmacological target for platinum(PI) complexes and that these complexes attack preferentially guanine residues in DNA, it is of interest to examine the effect of iminoether platinum(II) complexes on the conformation of double-stranded poly(dG-dC) and its synthetic analogues. As these polymers can undergo the B-->Z transition, we have investigated in detail the effect of trans-EE and its cis isomer (cis-EE) on this conformational transformation using different techniques. They include circular dichroism spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and immunochemical assay employing specific antibodies against Z-DNA. It has been shown that cis-EE somewhat facilitates the B-->Z transition induced by increasing NaCl concentration and radically lowers its cooperativity. The polymers modified by cis-EE at low or high salt concentrations have been found to adopt distorted conformations which belong to the B and Z families respectively. Thus, cis-EE affects the B-->Z transition in DNA in a way similar to antitumor cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (cisplatin). On the other hand, trans-EE was found to affect B-->Z transition (its cooperativity or the NaCl concentration corresponding to the midpoint of the salt-induced transition) only slightly. This behavior of trans-EE was, however, fundamentally different from that of clinically ineffective transplatin, which hinders B-->Z transition and lowers its cooperativity. The different effects of trans-EE on the B-->Z transition in comparison with the effects of cisplatin, transplatin and monofunctional chlorodiethylenetriamineplatinum(II) chloride are consistent with a unique DNA binding mode of this new antitumor trans compound, which might be associated with its unexpected biological efficacy.

AB  - This article discusses the role of pediatricians in fostering resilience in parents of children with autism spectrum disorders. It has been well documented that parents and caregivers of children with autism often face tremendous emotional strains, changes in lifestyle, and economic hardship associated with caring for their children. Professional input and individualized information has been shown to positively impact competence among parents of children newly diagnosed with autism. A recent policy statement from the American Academy of Pediatrics emphasized the need for pediatricians to adopt a more proactive leadership role in promoting the implementation of interventions that support healthy child development, such as positive parenting programs. It is essential that the pediatricians identify and support protective factors that mitigate the negative effects of having a child with autism on the caregiver’s ability to parent. To date, brief, cost-effective, evidence-based practices that encourage parental resilience via the promotion of protective factors have not been readily available for pediatricians. The Primary Care Stepping Stones Triple P, aims to maximize the social, emotional, and behavioral competencies of children with autism by enhancing parental self-efficacy, self-sufficiency, self-management, personal agency and problem solving.

AB  - Parents’ involvement in early intervention (EI) services fosters positive developmental trajectories in young children. Although EI research on parenting skills has been abundant, fewer data are available on parents’ knowledge of normative child development. Sixty-seven mothers of children participating in a Midwestern city’s EI program completed the Knowledge of Infant Development Inventory. Compared with mothers in normative referent samples, mothers of children enrolled in EI reported significantly less knowledge of normative child development and were significantly more likely to underestimate the timing of normative developmental milestones. The race/ethnicity of mothers of children in EI was significantly related to their milestone accuracy scores even after the mothers’ education level was controlled. Implications of the findings are discussed within the context of providing EI services that are family centered.

AB  - This qualitative biographical inquiry examined the personal and musical lives of adolescents with foster care experience. Individual structured interviews were conducted with 10 participants (six males, four females) who were enrolled in outpatient therapy. Results indicated that foster care experiences had various impacts upon these adolescents' relationships to music. For example, their involvement in active musicmaking activities tended to decrease as they moved from one placement to another. Music also appeared to influence these adolescents' experiences of foster care. Participants who described positive or healthy relationships with their foster care families tended to be more involved in formal and active music-making activities such as school music programs, participation in music groups, or taking music lessons. Finally, all participants indicated that they spent a significant amount of time listening to music and that they did so for personal and psychological reasons. Music listening helped these adolescents to cope with the ongoing trauma, grief, and loss that they encountered throughout their lives. Implications for music therapy practice, research, and theory are presented.

AB  - Introduction. Although everyone working in routine mental health services recognizes the scientific and ethical importance to ensure that treatments being provided are of highest quality, there is a clear lack of consensus regarding what outcome domains to include, what measure of assessment to use and, moreover, who to question when assessing. Literature findings. Since the fifties, social functioning is considered as an important dimension to take into account for treatment planning and outcome measuring. But for many years, symptoms scales have been considered as sufficient outcome measures and social functioning improvement expected on the basis of symptoms alleviation. As symptoms and social adjustment sometimes appear relatively independent, no accurate conclusion concerning the patient's social functioning can so be driven on the basis of his clinical symptoms. More attention has then been directed toward the development of instruments specifically intended to measure the extent and nature of social functioning impairments observed in most psychiatric syndromes. Many of these instruments are designed to be completed by caregivers or remain time consuming and difficult to use routinely. Presently, in clinical practice, there is a need to rely on simple and brief instruments considering patients' perspective about their social adjustment as a function of time. Aim of the study. The aim of this study is to present a new instrument, the QFS, initially developed in order to assess social functioning in patients involved in group psychotherapy programs conducted in a specialist mental health setting, as well as its psychometric characteristics. Methodology. It was designed to be completed in less than 10 minutes and the questions are phrased in a simple and redundant way, in order to limit problems inherent to illiteracy or language comprehension. The OFS is a 16 items self-report instrument that assesses both the frequency of (8 items) and the satisfaction with (8 items) various social behaviours adopted during the 2 weeks period preceding the assessment. It yields three separate indexes of social functioning, defined a priori and labelled << frequency >>, << satisfaction >> and << global >>. The higher the scores, the better the social functioning. The OFS was administered to 457 subjects, aged between 18 and 65, including 176 outpatients (99 with anxious or depressive disorders, 25 with personality disorders and 52 with psychotic disorders) and 281 healthy control subjects. Results. No significant difference was found between patients and controls according to age or gender distribution. Acceptance rate was high (> 95%). Moreover, the QFS was generally acceptable to the clinicians who used it. Internal consistency calculated for each index ranged from 0.65 to 0.83 (Cronbach alpha). Test-retest reliability, calculated within a 15 days time interval on a sample of 49 healthy controls, ranged from 0.69 to 0.71 (intraclass correlation coefficient). Discriminant validity was calculated on healthy controls and patients divided into sub-groups according to their diagnosis. It showed to be excellent, with significantly higher scores in control subjects than in psychiatric patients and significant differences across diagnostic categories (Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA with post-hoc tests, all p < 0.05). The convergent validity of the QFS with other measures of social functioning was calculated, using the Social Adaptation Self-Evaluation Scale (SASS) and the Social Adjustment Scale Self-eport (SAS-SR). With the SASS, the convergent validity was higher among patients (Spearman r(S) 0.71 to 0.92, p < 0.01) than controls (r(S) from 0.49 to 0.66, p < 0.001). In healthy controls, correlation with the SAS-SR was moderate but statistically significant (r(S) from -0.21 to -0.44, p < 0.05). When comparing OFS scores with self-rated symptoms severity, lower levels of social functioning were significantly associated with more severe symptoms according to the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI: r(S) from -0.38 to -0,65, p < 0.001). The QFS indexes demonstrated sensitivity to change (Wilcoxon : all p < 0.05) on a sample of 27 but-patients suffering from anxious-depressive disorders questioned before and after 4 months of cognitive behavioural group therapy running on a weekly basis during 16 sessions of 2 hours-each. The factorial validity of the CPS was measured;through 3 separate factor analysis conducted using the data of 4-57 subjects., The first analysis, considered only Frequency items; 7 out of 8 items had loadings above 0.5 on factor 1 accounting for 30.7% (unrotaded) of the variance. The second analysis considered only Satisfaction items; all items had loadings above 0.6 on Factor 1 explaining 43.4% (unrotaded) of the variance. And finally, in the third factor analysts, all, QFS items were included; 15 out of 16 items had loadings above 0.4 on Factor 1 accounting for 30% (unrotated) of the variance. Conceming the factorial validity of the instrument, these results suggest that all QFS items belong to the same underlying dimension. Discussion. Finally, provisional norms for the QFS are provided for healthy controls in order to characterise individual patients or patients subgroups. In conclusion, the need for assessment in clinical routine, in order to estimate different aspects of patients conditions aswell as the qualify of the treatment provided, has contributed to the development of a large variety of instruments measuring several domains. Concerning the level of social functioning, many instruments fail to meet chief criterion of feasibility, remaining often too complex or time onsuming. Moreover, only few of them are available in French. Conclusion. The QFS presented here is a brief, simple and easy to administer self-rating scale that displays satisfactory psychometric properties. It seems to be a valuable instrument for the monitoring of social functioning in psychiatric patients Which, from a therapeutic point of view, may have a clear impact as it sets up expectation of change and allows both to-reality testpatibnts and therapists beliefs about the presence of progress or not and to identify if therapy is working on this specific outcome domain. Though, to date, the administration of the OFS to other populations and treatment modalities requires further investigation.

AB  - The objective was to verify the effect of an intervention, based on the attendance of the basic psychological needs (NPB) and pro and antisocial behaviors in school physical education classes. Thirty-five students and two teachers of Physical Education, divided into Control Group (CG) and Intervention (GI) participated in this study. The students answered the Attitudes Questionnaire in Sport (QAE-23) and participated in a semi-structured interview in the pre- and post-intervention moments. The intervention was performed with the GI teacher for 10 weeks, aiming to promote NPB during class. The Student's t-test was used and adopted p < 0.05. The interviews were categorized and analyzed. It was observed perception of NPB care and reduction of antisocial behaviors. It was concluded that intervention based on NPB compliance enabled a reduction of antisocial behavior, but the duration of the study may have been a limiting factor of greater effect in relation to the internalization of these behaviors.

AB  - Marital Conflict and Children's Emergent Negative Emotionality: A Genetically Informed Approach Previous research consistently demonstrates that exposure to marital hostility is associated with negative developmental outcomes for children. Few studies, however, have examined the processes through which marital hostility affects children's outcomes. Guided by Emotional Security Theory (EST; Davies et al., 2002) the current study used a cross-lagged design to examine associations between marital hostility and the temperament trait of toddler negative emotionality in a longitudinal, adoption sample, with an additional focus on the moderating role of genetic influences. Adoption designs are well-suited to examine the main and interactive effects of genetic and environmental risks because the adoptees are not genetically related to their adoptive parents. As such, the children's genetic and environmentally-based risks for heightened negative emotionality are independent of each other. Participants were drawn from the Early Development and Growth Study (EGDS). EGDS is a prospective adoption study that includes 561 adoptees placed at birth, along with their adoptive parents (APs) and birth parents (BPs). Child negative emotionality was assessed via APs' reports at 9- and 27-months of child age. The emotional quality of the interparental relationship was included as an environmental predictor of child negative emotionality, and was assessed via AP report at 9- and 27-months of child age. Genetic influences included the birth mothers' self-reported temperament characteristic of harm avoidance. Overall findings indicated that: 1) There is high stability in marital hostility over time; 2) there is moderate stability in child negative emotionality over time; and 3) change in temperament was partially accounted for by an interaction between genetic predisposition and marital hostility. Specifically, when using adoptive-mother reported temperament, the impact of marital hostility on children's developing temperament trait of negative emotionality was greater for a subset of genetically vulnerable children. Collectively, these findings underscore the importance of both genetic and environmental contributions to developing temperament and the need for targeted intervention programs, as well as highlight differences between parents in their perception of their children's temperament.

AB  - Foster children are academically at risk as a result of abuse, neglect and family disruptions. Findings from previous studies have underscored the critical role played by foster parents in monitoring the academic progress of the children placed in the home. The purpose of this qualitative phenomenological research study was to identify the skill sets foster parents use to address the academic problems and educational needs of the children placed in their homes. Apart from identifying skills used to address academic problems, the interview findings revealed how the foster parents' sense of self-efficacy impacted their skill sets in addressing the academic problems and educational needs of their foster children. Six themes resulted from the coding and analysis of the participants' responses: inspiration from others, internal resources, religion/spirituality, meeting foster child's educational needs, interaction with others, and psychosocial resources. The findings of the study indicated the training programs for prospective foster parents did not adequately equip them with the necessary competencies to address the academic problems of foster children. The recommendation suggested revision of the training program and the related materials and manuals to include a component addressing the educational needs of the children in foster care and clarification of the accountability for monitoring the child's academic progress. The development of a collaborative relationship among concerned adults, specifically foster parents, caseworkers, and school personnel it was part of the recommendation and was a critical factor in helping foster parents to address the educational problems and academic needs of their foster child.

AB  - Socio-emotional skills are fundamental in acquiring a social network and in the transition to adult life. Youth in care are at serious risk of exclusion in their transition to adult life, and young mothers in care must face this difficult step with the added responsibility of motherhood. The aim of this study is to explore whether girls who are in residential care have fewer emotional skills than their peers, and if so, whether these girls have similar socio-emotional skills to girls who also experience disadvantaged environments but live with their families. Moreover, we will also analyse whether they have different skills to girls in care who are also mothers. One group was composed of the 18 teenage mothers in care who lived in the two residential care homes specialized for teen mothers in care in Catalonia (mother group). Another group comprised 18 girls from two residential care homes (girls in care group). Two more groups were included as controls groups: the normative group was made up of 18 girls from a secondary school attended by children from working middle-class families (normative group); the disadvantaged group was composed of 18 girls from disadvantaged families supervised by the Social Services participating in an NGO programme for children in families at risk. To this end, an emotional intelligence test (EQi Bar-on) was administered to 72 girls: 18 girls in care; 18 teenage mothers in care; 18 girls from a normative group (secondary school); and 18 girls from families at social risk. Those participant girls in foster care who were not mothers obtained lower scores than the normative group for the global EQi index, and on the scales of Self-actualization; Empathy; Social Responsibility; Problem Solving; Reality Testing; Impulse control and Happiness. However, the scores obtained by girls in foster care did not differ from those of their peers from disadvantaged backgrounds, with the exception of the Happiness scale, which were worse. The group of young mothers in care scored higher than those girls in care who are not mothers, their scores being similar to those of the normative group from working middle-class families. In the discussion, we analyse the possible factors underlying the observed relationships. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Growing concern about science literacy in the United States has led to the active involvement of scientists in educational reform. Yet scientists have often found it difficult to communicate content knowledge in an effective manner to both teachers and children. This model project, funded by the National Institute of Drug Abuse, has been aimed at increasing the awareness and understanding of neuroscience among elementary school children to indirectly decrease drug use and unhealthy behaviors. The project created a partnership between neuroscientists, health professionals, and the Boys and Girls Clubs of Omaha, Nebraska, to present hands-on activities about basic and applied aspects of the nervous system in a ``reverse{''} science fair setting. Neuroscientists and health professionals created hands-on, interactive exhibits that the children judged. This particular study examined the perceptions of neuroscientists and allied health professionals regarding their ability to communicate neuroscience knowledge to school-age children and their understanding of the knowledge and interest of children about neuroscience in relation to children's self-reports of knowledge and interest in neuroscience. Participation in a fair significantly raised professionals' perceptions of their ability to communicate science content to fourth- and sixth-grade children. There was considerable discrepancy between the professionals' assessment of what children know, and want to know, about neuroscience, and what the children do know and want to know about the nervous system. After observing children engaging in neuroscience activities, many presenters rated children's interest levels in neuroscience and in their projects considerably higher than before. Presenting neuroscience concepts to the children was thus less difficult than the professionals had perceived prior to the fair. The reverse science fair approach is one way to foster the involvement of neuroscientists and health professionals in increasing knowledge transfer, and neuroscience literacy, in the formative childhood years.

AB  - As policymakers have sought to balance the goal of fostering poor children's well-being with that of encouraging adult's self-sufficiency, public assistance has become more predicated on custodial parents' involvement in work or mandatory welfare-to-work programs. This summary report examines the effects of welfare-to-work programs implemented as part of the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training Program (JOBS) on the children of adults mandated to participate. The evaluation focused on children's development and well-being in a sample of families with preschool-age children at the start of the evaluation. The findings indicated that the welfare-to-work programs implemented as part of the JOBS program did have significant impacts on children's development, but these impacts were not widespread and were generally small. There were favorable impacts particularly in the area of cognitive development and particularly at one site. There were unfavorable child health impacts, specifically at one site. Findings in the area of children's behavior and emotional adjustment encompassed both favorable and unfavorable impacts. Findings for a subgroup of higher risk families were few and tended generally to be small. Unfavorable impacts were found for children from lower-risk families at three sites. The unfavorable and policy relevant impacts occurred in a concentrated manner and some had moderate to large effect sizes. It was concluded that most children were not adversely affected, and in some cases were helped, by their mothers' participation in a JOBS program. Further follow-up will be important because of the limited unfavorable impacts. (Contains 37 references.) (KB)

The most comprehensive resource on measuring quality in both home- and center-based settings, this book brings together a who's who of early childhood experts to establish what's working in quality measurement and how it can be strengthened to support better programs and optimal child development. Readers will explore specific approaches to measuring the quality of factors that are key to school readiness, including: (1) supports for early language and literacy development; (2) math and science curricula and instruction; (3) environmental supports for social and emotional competence; (4) health-related factors such as nutrition, safety, and adequate physical activity; (5) family-sensitive child care; (6) cultural responsiveness; (7) services for children with disabilities; and (8) practices that promote dual language learners' development and learning. To help them measure these factors accurately, readers will get critical analyses of dozens of current assessment measures, plus an exclusive inside look at today's most promising new tools. Readers will also find invaluable guidance on "big picture" issues--such as how to align quality measures with professional development goals and desired child outcomes; how to make sound, data-driven decisions when implementing a large-scale Quality Rating and Improvement System, and how to conduct integrated quality assessments that combine the best of observational and structural approaches. An essential reference for anyone involved in a statewide effort to improve program quality, this book also makes an ideal graduate-level text for tomorrow's early childhood decision makers. Readers will have the knowledge base they need to strengthen their quality measurement--so they can be sure their programs lead to positive outcomes and get children ready for school success.

AB  - Women are under-diagnosed for coronary artery disease (CAD) compared to men; the reasons for under-diagnosis are unclear. Diagnosing CAD may foster stereotype usage because presenting symptoms of CAD can be ambiguous and physicians are under time constraints to make diagnoses. I propose that stereotypes about women being portrayed as more emotional than men, and that women's emotions reflects a dispositional attribute rather than a contextual factor, influence how a physician perceives and diagnoses a female patient. Furthermore, I propose that acknowledging and contextualizing one's emotions, through a process called skilled self-labeling (SSL), can disrupt this bias. To test these predictions, I showed medical students and residents a video vignette of a standardized patient presenting with CAD and asked participants to diagnose the patient. The patient was either female or male, and presented CAD with either no emotion, with anxiety that was ignored, or with anxiety and SSL. Confirming predictions, only women were affected by the anxious display; specifically, while women in the no emotion condition were diagnosed similarly to men, women who ignored their anxiety were under-diagnosed. Using SSL eliminated this under-diagnosis effect. Results suggest emotion stereotypes as a mechanism for why under-diagnosis of CAD occurs for women, and offers patients SSL as a means of empowerment so as to interrupt these stereotypes and help physicians provide more accurate diagnoses. Furthermore, these results inform future research concerning the development of interventions, translating feminist social psychological work to the health domain, and improving health care for older adults.

AB  - Nurses deal more effectively with cultural diversity when they have an ethnorelative orientation toward cultural difference and commonality on the Intercultural Development Continuum, which was the theoretical framework of this study. Scholarly literature shows limited knowledge on what fosters nurses' intercultural development. Thus, this quantitative, retrospective study was the first investigation in health care in Switzerland conducted on nursing students' orientation on the Intercultural Development Inventory (IDI) and the relationship to student demographic variables. The sample for this secondary data analysis consisted of the IDI results from nursing students enrolled between 2010 and 2016 at the largest nursing college in Switzerland ( N = 3,410) where the systematic integration of the development of intercultural competence into the curriculum began in 2010. Descriptive statistical analysis indicated that the students' developmental orientation (DO) toward cultural difference and commonality represented a mindset of minimization (M = 86.3, SD = 13.7), whereas the orientation gap between the DO and the students' perceived orientation (PO) was high ( M = 32.5), indicating that students believe they have higher intercultural competence than they have. Chi-square-tests revealed significant relationships between gender, age, and time living in another country and the students' PO and DO. The paired samples t test demonstrated a higher end of program DO (p = .01) compared to beginning DO scores, suggesting the program provided challenges that met the students' level of readiness for cultural development. The findings may affect positive social change by providing knowledge on contributors to development of intercultural competence that educators can use.

AB  - Creative thinking in child care providers can foster creativity in children. The literature documented a general decline in creativity in America since the 1990s and low creativity among Latino children in particular. The purpose of this quantitative analysis was to fill a gap in the literature about the effectiveness of trainings based in 2 theories of creativity development; Csikszentmihalyi's theory of spontaneous flow and Carson's structured 7 steps for Latina child care providers. The primary research question addressed the effects of 2 types of training (based on flow and 7 steps) each compared to a randomly assigned control group on 5 categories of creativity (fluency, originality, abstractness of titles, elaboration, and resistance to premature closure). A 3 x 5 repeated measures analysis of variance based on a post-test only cross-sectional design resulted in a significant interaction effect and significant simple main effects (i.e., differences among categories of creativity within each training program and differences among programs within each category of creativity). Both flow and 7 steps training approaches significantly improved creativity for 4 of the 5 categories when compared to controls. Abstractness of titles was significantly lower for both approaches and for the control group. Secondary research questions addressed the extent to which programs were sensitive to the Latina culture and the extent to which participants were satisfied with training. Independent sample t tests found Carson's approach was more culturally sensitive, even though both received high ratings, and found no difference in participant satisfaction. A panel of experts rated training fidelity high for both programs. Implications for positive social change include validation of two theories that can be used to inform improved creativity among Latina child care providers and ultimately improve the creativity of the children they serve.

AB  - There is considerable evidence showing that attachment to parents and peers serves as a protective factor against adolescent anti-social behavior. However, less is known about whether the strength of these attachments serves as a protective factor against being victimized at school. Furthermore, no study has examined the relationship between primary language spoken at home and victimization experienced at school. In a sample of 1200 middle and high school students from an urban-fringe school district, the current investigation examined links between the strength of attachments to parents and peers and the frequency of victimization reported by students. Participants completed surveys in their classrooms as part of a random stratified sampling of classrooms from 6th–12th grades, which included self-report measures of the strength of attachment to primary caregivers and peers, frequency of victimization experienced at school, and primary language spoken in the home. Students who reported stronger attachments to parents and peers, reported less frequent victimization, though results appear to be clinically insignificant. Furthermore, students who reported speaking a language other than English in the home reported more frequent victimization, though attachment did not mediate this finding. These findings suggest the need for interventions which foster the development of strong attachments, and which address improving tolerance for students who speak languages other than and in addition to English.

When the child arrives at St. Clare's, a process is initiated to find a long-term environment for the child. St. Clare's offers many services to children and their families including medical, social, family involvement, foster parent training, respite care, emergency placement, and discharge planning. A case example of one resident is provided. The ARFC has also established Haller House Family Resource Center to provide various programs and services to individuals and families trying to cope with the effect of AIDS. St. Clare's is designed to provide a transitional function; in this vein, potential foster parents are given the opportunity to know the infant or child and to become familiar with various aspects of HIV infection and existing support services. St. Clare's works with the staff in dealing with the transitional nature of their relationships with the children and with the families to assure their financial support. 1 figure and 1 table

AB  - In this chapter, we focus on understanding the origins of attachment disturbances in young children and the methods that have been used to diagnose and to ameliorate such disturbances. We examine the important contributions from both the developmental literature and the clinical literature and address ways in which the 'clinical-developmental gap' can be bridged. We begin by reviewing the evolution of the concept of attachment disturbances in at-risk children, paying particular attention to maltreated and institutionalized children. We then present two programs whose goals include the (re)establishment of attachment relationships and the reduction of attachment disturbances. We consider findings from developmental attachment research on disorganized and atypical attachments and then review research from the clinical perspective on reactive attachment disorder in similar populations. Next, we describe our experiences in two intervention efforts designed to enhance the development of attachment relationships in these two populations. The first is an intervention program for young children in foster care in New Orleans in which comprehensive and integrated services are offered to address the challenges of building attachment relationships with foster parents and enhancing attachment relationships with birth families. The second is an intervention project in Bucharest, Romania, in which formerly institutionalized children are placed in foster care and their development is compared with that of a group of institutionalized children. For each initiative, we review approaches to building attachment relationships and the child and parent barriers to developing attachments, and we consider how to improve disturbed attachment relationships.

AB  - The Bucharest Early Intervention Project (BEIP) is the first ever randomized controlled trial of foster care as an alternative to institutional care for young children. It involved a collaboration between American investigators and Romanian health and child protection professionals. We present a brief description of the Romanian context and the project itself before discussing a number of ethical issues raised by the project. Organized around a discussion of exploitation, risk/benefit ratio, and cultural sensitivity, we evaluate a number of ethical issues involved in the BEIP using the Ethical Clinical Research Framework and the Fair Benefits Framework. Based on this review, we conclude that notwithstanding challenging ethical dilemmas, the benefits of the project outweighed its risks. Throughout the planning and implementation of the project, ethical issues were a central focus of discussion among the investigators and in the collaboration between Americans and Romanians. Thoughtful discussions from multiple perspectives are necessary to conduct research that is ethically sound and scientifically meaningful. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Objective: There is increasing interest in the relations between adverse early experiences and subsequent psychiatric disorders. Institutional rearing is considered an adverse caregiving environment, but few studies have systematically examined its effects. This study aimed to determine whether removing young children from institutional care and placing them with foster families would reduce psychiatric morbidity at 54 months of age. Method: Young children living in institutions in Bucharest were enrolled when they were between 6 and 30 months of age. Following baseline assessment, 136 children were randomly assigned to care as usual (continued institutional care) or to removal and placement in foster care that was created as part of the study. Psychiatric disorders, symptoms, and comorbidity were examined by structured psychiatric interviews of caregivers of 52 children receiving care as usual and 59 children in foster care when the children were 54 months of age. Both groups were compared to 59 typically developing, never-institutionalized Romanian children recruited from pediatric clinics in Bucharest. Foster care was created and supported by social workers in Bucharest who received regular consultation from U.S. clinicians. Results: Children with any history of institutional rearing had more psychiatric disorders than children without such a history (53.2% versus 22.0%). Children removed from institutions and placed in foster families were less likely to have internalizing disorders than children who continued with care as usual (22.0% versus 44.2%). Boys were more symptomatic than girls regardless of their caregiving environment and, unlike girls, had no reduction in total psychiatric symptoms following foster placement. Conclusions: Institutional rearing was associated with substantial psychiatric morbidity. Removing young children from institutions and placing them in families significantly reduced internalizing disorders, although girls were significantly more responsive to this intervention than boys.

AB  - Introduction: Numerous studies have been done about the impact of the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder on the parents’ quality of life and the family as a whole. Confronting child suffering, day-to-day disability management and difficulties in integrating the child have an impact on the physical and mental well-being of parents. Parenting with a child suffering from a disability requires significant cognitive, emotional and behavioral adjustments by the parents. New knowledge in this field would make possible to adjust as much as possible the therapeutic management, in particular in the accompaniment of parents experience and parenting role. The main objective of this study is to identify links between coping strategies of parents to deal with the stressful events induced by the child's disability and their sense of parental competence. The second objective is to observe whether the integration of parents into the therapeutic management of the child has an impact on well-being. Method: Thirty-three parents of children with autism spectrum disorder completed the WCC-R, PANAS, QAECEP and ASR. We have studied the links between coping strategies adopted by parents to deal with the stressful events induced by the child's disability and their sense of parental competence, a factor influencing their subjective well-being. We were interested in the consequences of the integration by the professional team of the parent in the care of the child on the feeling of parental competence. Results: Coping strategies centered on emotions disrupt feelings of parental satisfaction. In addition, parents who are satisfied with their role tend to express a better sense of subjective well-being and parental skill than the less satisfied parents. Finally, the integration of the parent in the child care process promotes the sense of parental competence. Conclusion: It seems important to note that the better the feeling of parental competence, the less the depressive symptomatology is high. The results confirm the need for professional teams in charge of the autism spectrum disorder child to integrate, support and help parents in their parenting role. This support allows them to develop a good sense of parental competence and fosters their sense of well-being.

La parentalité auprès d’un enfant handicapé nécessite d’importants ajustements cognitifs, émotionnels et comportementaux de la part des parents. L’hypothèse principale est que des difficultés d’adaptation dans ces différents domaines pourraient générer de la souffrance et impacter le sentiment de bien-être des parents. De nouvelles connaissances dans ce champ permettraient d’ajuster au mieux les prises en charge thérapeutiques, notamment dans l’accompagnement du parent dans son vécu et son rôle parental. Méthode: Trente-trois parents d’enfants atteints de troubles autistiques ont rempli la WCC-R, la PANAS, le QAECEP et l’ASR. Nous avons étudié les liens existants entre les stratégies de coping adoptées par les parents pour faire face aux évènements stressants induits par le handicap de l’enfant et leur sentiment de compétence parentale, facteur influenc¸ant leur bien-être subjectif. Nous nous sommes intéressés aux conséquences de l’intégration, par l’équipe professionnelle, du parent dans la prise en charge de l’enfant sur le sentiment de compétence parentale. Résultats: Les stratégies de coping centré sur les émotions perturbent le sentiment de satisfaction parentale. De plus, les parents satisfaits dans leur rôle ont tendance à exprimer un meilleur sentiment de bien-être subjectif que les parents se disant moins satisfaits. Enfin, l’intégration du parent dans le processus de soin de l’enfant favorise son sentiment de compétence parentale. Conclusion: Le soutien des parents leur permettrait de développer un bon sentiment de compétence parentale et de favoriser leur sentiment de bien-être.

AB  - APA Books® announces the "APA Handbook of Industrial and Organizational Psychology"--the first offering in an new reference series covering core and emerging subdisciplines, the "APA Handbooks in Psychology." I/O Psychology is both a science/practice and an applied/basic research discipline. Appropriately, the "APA Handbook of Industrial and Organizational Psychology" offers an in depth examination of the types of behavioral and structural issues that I/O psychologists study every day, from both a theoretical and applied perspective. It explores a natural progression, from how problems are diagnosed to how research is conducted to generate answers to those problems to how interventions are implemented and, finally, to how they are evaluated. It examines what is currently known--including basic historical reviews--and identifies the most pertinent sources of information in both the core and emerging literatures. It pinpoints practical issues, probes unresolved and controversial topics, and looks at future theoretical, research, and practice trends. One of the givens in the field is that, when an organization or employer attempts to affect one aspect of behavior--for example, job satisfaction--the organization or employer is likely to affect several other areas, such as compensation, supervision, performance review, and the like. Accordingly, through extensive cross-referencing to other chapters, individual chapters attempt to acknowledge the links with other topics in order to present an integrated approach to the field, both within and across volumes. The reader will thus achieve a clearer understanding of the complexities of each topic, and, more globally, a clearer understanding of the complexities of organizations and of the people within them. The volume titles indicate a particular sequence that informs content: (Volume 1, Building and Developing the Organization, Volume 2, Selecting and Developing Members for the Organization, and Volume 3, Maintaining, Expanding, and Contracting the Organization); flow naturally from issues concerned with designing, building, and developing the structure of the organization into issues related to selecting the organization's members, their roles, and issues that pertain to maintaining and ensuring the viability of the organization. Also included in the discussion are issues concerned with growing, expanding, and, even, contracting the organization. The goal of the entire set is to provide the reader with a well-rounded understanding of the complexities and intricacies of trying to study and affect behavior within and between organizations. The tables of contents for the volumes provide the following: Volume 1: Building and Developing the Organization is divided into three sections and Section I, Foundational Issues in Industrial and Organizational Psychology, presents the following chapters: (1) A Historical Survey of Research and Practice in Industrial and Organizational Psychology (Andrew J.

AB  - Functions of group time in early childhood programs are discussed and steps to leading a successful group time are described. Group time gathers children at transition time, stimulates thinking and introduces concepts, develops listening skills, fosters social development, nurtures emotional growth, and develops a sense of community and a joy of living. Steps to leading group time successfully include: (1) achieve children's attention; (2) define spaces within the group; (3) vary the pace and kind of activities; and (4) provide closure. Concluding remarks suggest that use of effective group time strategies may provide one of the most stimulating and diverse teaching systems for adults working with young children. (RH)

AB  - Within the special needs field, interactive interventions are gaining attention as a means of promoting social engagement for individuals with communicative impairments. The present paper examined the experiences of practitioners of one such approach, Intensive Interaction (II), by analysing written reflections provided by 12 newly trained practitioners. Their insights are particularly interesting because they were working in a voluntary capacity with a novel population: Romanian children living in state care, whose communicative impairments have been complicated by a history of neglect. A thematic analysis indicated that one hour's training in II was sufficient for (i) enabling trainees to identify key changes in children's engagement (e.g. increased attention to partner, decreased distress) and (ii) strengthening trainees' sense of connection to the children. If such brief training sessions are effective in improving communicative interactions, this offers benefits to health and education service providers seeking to implement communicative intervention programmes. While interactive approaches have potential in all regions, they may be particularly valuable in countries such as Romania, which face monumental financial challenges in improving standards of childcare.

AB  - Reviews the book, Boys of Few Words: Raising Our Sons to Communicate and to Connect by Adam J. Cox (see record [rid]2006-02152-000[/rid]). Early in his book, the author sets forth the many reasons why parents and professionals ought to attend to the difficulties boys ordinarily experience when attempting to express themselves to others. Their natural communicating styles can be impeded by the very nature of boys--who they are as people--and by the impact cultural, social, familial, and educational influences have on them. Cox has worked with boys ages 4 through late adolescence to foster loving relationships among sons and their parents. He meets with boys individually or in groups and has extensive experience working with boys in schools. His book's purpose is to give readers a 'road map to help [boys] forge healthy relationships, without fear or limitations' (p. 1). His therapeutic aim is to build 'the expressive and social skills required for successful participation in the family, school, and community' (p. 2). Most boys, writes Cox, 'struggle to find the words they need to define their feelings and thoughts and, as a result, miss important opportunities to participate in all that life has to offer' (p. 1). The author urges parents to recognize and adapt to the psychological realities of boyhood. In this way they will be better prepared to understand boys' communication problems, styles, and modalities, resulting in better communication and a greater sense of human connectedness. Cox believes that boys must learn to use words in order to understand their emotions. He illustrates his premise in two vignettes of boys in treatment with him. Later portions of Cox's book are geared to guiding the parents of boys who won't communicate. Parents will appreciate the empathy Cox shows them when he suggests concrete, enjoyable tactics likely to work with uncommunicative boys. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The number of American families choosing to adopt a child from Ethiopia has increased exponentially since 2004. Over the past five years alone, between 2006 and 2011, 13.5% of internationally adopted children in the U.S. came from Ethiopia. The purpose of this study was to examine psychological adjustment and relational development of Ethiopian adoptees who have been adopted during 2007 -2010 and their families who reside in Montana. Using a convenience-sampling method, data were collected from 25 adoptive parents who adopted a total of 35 children from Ethiopia. All families live in Montana and responded to questions through an online survey. In addition, four families participated in a semi-structured in-depth interview. Descriptive statistics were used to examine the parents' scores on parental adjustment, cultural competency, parenting intervention skills and their perceptions about their child's adjustment. To compare the relationships between different variables, one-tailed Spearman's non-parametric correlations and Mann-Whitney U test were used. The study's findings suggest that: 1) Parents report a variety of environmental characteristics as risk factors that challenge the relationship development with their adopted child. 2) Ethiopian adopted children are described by their adoptive parents as being generally well adjusted. 3) Adoptive parents also appear to: be well adjusted to the adoption process; have good awareness about their own and their adopted child's culture; and report good parenting intervention skills. 4) Parents who live in the more urban, populated areas of Montana seem to be better adjusted to adoption compared to parents who live in the rural areas of the state. 5) Parents with biological children seem to have better intervention skills in comparison to parents without any biological children. The correlational analyses of the study also show that perception of lower level of adoptee's adjustment problems was found to be related to higher levels of parental cultural competency; and, parental adjustment was positively correlated with their cultural competency and to their parenting intervention skills. This study replicates findings of previous studies regarding the relationship between adoptees' adjustment and parents' cultural competence. Implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - Reviews the book, The Moose's Children: A Memoir of Betrayal, Death and Survival by David M. Mokotoff (2011). In The Moose's Children: A Memoir of Betrayal, Death and Survival, the reader is taken on a turbulent ride that vividly depicts the long-term effects of childhood sexual abuse on not only an individual but an entire family. The author, David Mokotoff, who was a cardiologist in Florida in 1985, met a nurse, Christina (Tina) whom he became captivated by. Although they both were in romantic relationships at the time of their initial meeting, they felt unfulfilled and betrayed by their significant others’ past infidelities. Desiring a better future, they delved into a relationship together. Their palpable physical attraction, similar interests, and emotional bond caused the relationship to flourish despite various tribulations. They get married, have a beautiful daughter, and adopt a dog together. Everything seemed close to idyllic until Tina proclaimed one day 'I think I am an alcoholic'. After Tina's declaration, everything made sense to Mokotoff. His wife, who he viewed more as an avid wine drinker, was obviously showing signs of alcoholism and liver failure. With Mokotoff's new revelation, his world begins to go from up to down to up to down again as he puts his wife into treatment multiple times. Soon it becomes apparent that the sexual and physical abuse that Tina was subjected to at the hands of her stepfather in her childhood was the root of her alcoholism. Mokotoff not only takes you on his, Tina, and their daughter's journey with honesty and great detail, he also takes you on the journey of Tina's extended family members. Mokotoff gives us brief glimpses into how Tina's 10 brothers and sisters have also been affected by their childhood abuse. This compelling story is brief, descriptively written, and never lackluster, making it easy to finish in a relatively short time. However, it is a story that will stay with you well after you are done. It is a great book for those who are survivors of childhood abuse as they can relate to Tina's story and also understand the effects of their behavior on others. It is also useful for family and friends of those who have incurred abuse as it can help bring awareness and hopefully preventive measures to those at risk for ongoing problems. For clinicians, this is a great book to read to obtain more understanding into what certain clients may be dealing with and also can be used as a therapeutic tool by recommending it to trauma survivors and their family members. Overall, it is an easy-to-read, gripping tale that can bring insight to the losses that trauma survivors could experience: the loss of health, relationships, quality of living, and eventually life. It is evident that the author wrote his memoir with great deliberation and care as he related some very raw personal experiences. He also took care to interview family members, trying to corroborate his stories. His thoroughness and joy of writing in depicting revealing stories comes through on the pages.

AB  - The significance of enhancing parenting skills to reduce child maladjustment is well-established and supports the important role of evidence-based parenting programs. However, the notion that parenting should be the exclusive focus for enhancing child behavior is necessarily limiting. Evidence is growing that relationship-oriented treatments may be another powerful approach to improve child adjustment, albeit the underlying effects in couple- versus parenting-focused programs have been subject to limited study. The aim of this RCT was to compare the treatment effects of (1) a couple-focused program (the Couples Coping Enhancement Training) to (2) a parenting training ( Triple P) and (3) a control group on children's behavioral problems in 150 couples. The parents' perceptions of relationship quality, parenting behavior, and child's behavioral problems were assessed by means of questionnaires completed prior to and 2 weeks after the end of the treatment. Multi-group path analyses revealed that in mothers' perception the couple-focused program reduced child behavioral problems by enhancing the relationship quality whereas improved parenting mediated the benefits in the parenting training. In fathers' evaluations the couple-focused program reduced dysfunctional parenting which largely accounted for the benefits in child adjustment. The dearth of research on child outcomes in couple-focused intervention studies is a striking gap that should be overcome. It is a promising field because of its evident potential to foster the health of many children.

AB  - Children in foster care represent one of the most educationally vulnerable populations of students. There are estimated to be 542,000 children in the United States in foster care (US Department of Health and Human Services, 2003), most of whom are at great risk of school failure. These children have been removed from their parents' custody by the courts and placed in out-of-home care with relatives, in foster homes, or in group homes. The problems children in out-of-home care have in receiving an adequate education are considerable. Within US schools, the personal histories of these youngsters and the impact on school performance too often go unnoticed or are misunderstood. Few learning supports are made available by the schools to address the significant academic, emotional and behavioral problems many experience. This commentary describes the educational barriers to learning and achieving facing children in foster care as well as some innovative interventions to improve school outcomes.

AB  - Children in foster care represent one of the most vulnerable, academically at risk populations in the United States. Aside from lower standardized achievement test scores, higher grade retention numbers, and a greater dropout rate than non-foster youth, between 30% to 50% of children in foster care are placed in special education programs, generally related to either a learning disability or an emotional disturbance. This study investigated the effectiveness on school performance of an education liaison from the school system who worked with social workers to resolve educational barriers to learning and achieving. Advocacy by the education liaison led to positive results in terms of school performance of foster youth. Recommendations are made for better addressing the educational needs of children in foster care. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This article examines ethnic conflict and its impacts on intramural relations within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). It suggests that ethnic politics at home often propels leaders to get involved in ethnic conflict elsewhere. In the ASEAN context, regional institutions, especially the principle of non-interference, mitigate the effects of ethnic politics and preclude the possibility of coercive intervention. The third state is more likely to appeal to facilitation or mediation. On the side of the host state, when the regime faces complex legitimacy crisis, it is more likely to reject the third state's involvement. Ethnic conflict is likely to cause diplomatic tussles between the two states. In contrast, when the regime of the host state enjoys a higher level of legitimacy, it is more amenable to the third party's mediation. Cooperation on conflict management will foster inter-state trust. This article illustrates the above mechanism by examining Malaysia's role in Thailand and the Philippines’ ethnic insurgencies.

AB  - As the major publicly financed early childhood education and care program, Head Start provides comprehensive and high-quality services, including early education, medical, dental, mental health, nutrition, parental involvement, and other social services, for disadvantaged preschoolers in the U.S. It aims to improve participants' school readiness, social competence, learning skills, health, and nutrition. Due to the issue of selection bias, the effects of Head Start have been a subject of continuous debate. This dissertation investigates the effects of Head Start participation in the year prior to kindergarten on child outcomes from kindergarten to elementary school years, and examines whether the effects, if any, vary by participants' race/ethnicity, English speaking at home, or gender. It adopts multiple analytic approaches, including propensity score matching, fixed effects, and multivariate regressions, and uses data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K). This dissertation includes three free-standing empirical papers focusing on different aspects of participants' outcomes respectively: test scores, childhood overweight and obesity, and social-emotional development. Implications for future research, practice, and policy changes are discussed. Overall, the dissertation finds that compared to non-parental non-center-based care (i.e., exclusively parental care, relative care, and non-relative care), Head Start tends to lift children's test scores in math and reading, reduce their risk of overweight/obesity through the 3rd and 5th grade years, and increase children's externalizing problem behaviors in kindergarten but not the 3rd grade or later years. Compared to other center-based care Head Start is less likely to increase children's test scores in kindergarten but not the 3rd grade or later years, more likely to reduce the risk of childhood overweight, obesity, and problem behaviors, and more likely to increase children's self-control ability and interpersonal skills. Compared to multiple non-parental care arrangements, Head Start tends to increase children's test scores, approaches to learning, self-control, and interpersonal skills and to reduce their risk of overweight/obesity, and externalizing problem behaviors. Overall, the dissertation finds little evidence that the effects of Head Start vary significantly by child race/ethnicity, English speaking at home, or gender.

AB  - In this study, the authors used data from a large longitudinal birth cohort study of primarily low-income children in urban areas, the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS), to investigate the effects of Head Start participation on children's school readiness. The fact that their sample was mainly made up of disadvantaged families helped address some of the issues with regard to selection bias, but to further address possible selection bias, they adopted several different analytic approaches, including ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions with a rich set of controls, city-fixed effects, and propensity score matching models. In addition, they were able to control for children's earlier developmental outcomes (i.e., at age three when almost none of the children had attended Head Start), which has not been possible in most of the previous research. In common with prior studies, they first examined the effects of Head Start by comparing Head Start participants to all non-participants (regardless of what their child care arrangements were). Then, to address the problem of the lack of clarity with regard to the reference group, they compared children who attended Head Start to children who attended specific types of other care arrangements separately, including parental care, pre-kindergarten, other center-based care, and other non-parental care. They also analyzed whether the effects of Head Start were moderated by child gender and race/ethnicity. (Contains 2 tables.)

AB  - Using data ("n" = 3,790 with 2,119 in the 3-year-old cohort and 1,671 in the 4-year-old cohort) from 353 Head Start centers in the Head Start Impact Study, the only large-scale randomized experiment in Head Start history, this article examined the impact of Head Start on children's cognitive and parent-reported social-behavioral outcomes through first grade contingent on the child care arrangements used by children who were randomly assigned to the control group (i.e., parental care, relative/nonrelative care, another Head Start program, or other center-based care). A principal score matching approach was adopted to identify children assigned to Head Start who were similar to children in the control group with a specific care arrangement. Overall, the results showed that the effects of Head Start varied substantially contingent on the alternative child care arrangements. Compared with children in parental care and relative/nonrelative care, Head Start participants generally had better cognitive and parent-reported behavioral development, with some benefits of Head Start persisting through first grade; in contrast, few differences were found between Head Start and other center-based care. The results have implications regarding the children for whom Head Start is most beneficial as well as how well Head Start compares with other center-based programs.

AB  - Purpose of Study: Global health electives have the potential to foster opportunities for service learning and create a platform to educate students on the key determinants of health, and cultural competencies and logistics necessary for successful program delivery. To be effective and relevant to the host country such electives require structure. Methods Used: We describe the key elements (identified via annual evaluation) central to success of a five year global-health partnership (Brighter Smiles) between the University of British Columbia and Makerere University in Uganda. Summary of Results: SERVICE DELIVERY - School-based health promotion is an effective model endorsed by WHO. Giving interactive workshops provides knowledge and skills for healthy practices and promotes change in school health culture. This informs and empowers the next generation on a broad range of health and social issues. COMMUNITY-BASED LEARNING - Clinical opportunities and collaborative research/evaluation provide new knowledge. Students learn the priorities and realities of medical care, prevention and social and cultural practices, establish the effectiveness of service delivery programs, and provide feedback and future direction to participating individuals and communities. COLLABORATION - Partnership of teams from different universities with local community leaders during project delivery and workshops generates invaluable dialogue and learning opportunities. Insights into realities and opportunities are gained, and essential skills learned re teamwork, communication, and cultural sensitivity. MENTORSHIP - Passion and experience shared by local and visiting faculty is infectious and invaluable. This is an essential component to ensure safe, culturally-relevant and sustainable student experiences. Conclusions: Global health electives based on the 'Brighter Smiles' template should prove to be relevant, and offer effective and appropriate learning for university students.

AB  - Introduction: Home smoking bans significantly reduce secondhand smoke exposure among children, but parents may offer discordant reports on whether there is a home smoking ban. The purpose of this study was to examine national trends in (a) parental discordance/concordance in the reporting of home smoking bans and (b) correlates of discordant/concordant reports among two-parent households with underage children from 1995 to 2007. Methods: Data from the 1995/1996, 1998/1999, 2001/2002, 2003, and 2006/2007 Tobacco Use Supplement of the U.S. Current Population Survey were used to estimate prevalence rates and multinomial logistic regression models of discordant/concordant parental smoking ban reports by survey period. Results: Overall, the percentage of households in which the 2 parents gave discordant reports on a complete home smoking ban decreased significantly from 12.7% to 2.8% from 1995 to 2007 (p < .001). Compared with households where both parents reported a complete smoking ban, discordant reports were more likely to be obtained from households with current smokers (p < .01) across survey periods. Compared with households where both parents reported the lack of a complete home smoking ban, discordant reports were more likely among households with college graduates, no current smokers, and parents with Hispanic ethnicity (p < .05). Conclusions: Parental concordance on the existence of a home smoking ban increased from 1995 to 2007. This suggests estimates of home smoking bans based on just one parent may be more reliable now than they were in the past. Interventions to improve the adoption and enforcement of home smoking bans should target households with current smoker parents.

AB  - The Green Revolution (GR-I) included worldwide adoption of semi-dwarf rice cultivars (SRCs) with mutant alleles at GA20ox2 or SD1 encoding gibberellin 20-oxidase. Two series of experiments were conducted to characterize the pleiotropic effects of SD1 and its relationships with large numbers of QTLs affecting rice growth, development and productivity. The pleiotropic effects of SD1 in the IR64 genetic background for increased height, root length/mass and grain weight, and for reduced spikelet fertility and delayed heading were first demonstrated using large populations derived from near isogenic IR64 lines of SD1. In the second set of experiments, QTLs controlling nine growth and yield traits were characterized using a new molecular quantitative genetics model and the phenotypic data of the well-known IR64/Azucena DH population evaluated across 11 environments, which revealed three genetic systems: the SD1-mediated, SD1-repressed and SD1-independent pathways that control rice growth, development and productivity. The SD1-mediated system comprised 43 functional genetic units (FGUs) controlled by GA. The SD1-repressed system was the alternative one comprising 38 FGUs that were only expressed in the mutant sd1 backgrounds. The SD1-independent one comprised 64 FGUs that were independent of SD1. GR-I resulted from the overall differences between the former two systems in the three aspects: (1) trait/environment-specific contributions; (2) distribution of favorable alleles for increased productivity in the parents; and (3) different responses to (fertilizer) inputs. Our results suggest that at 71.4 % of the detected loci, a QTL resulted from the difference between a functional allele and a loss-of-function mutant, whereas at the remaining 28.6 % of loci, from two functional alleles with differentiated effects. Our results suggest two general strategies to achieve GR-II (1) by further exploiting the genetic potential of the SD1-repressed and SD1-independent pathways and (2) by restoring the SD1-mediated pathways, or `back to the nature' to fully exploit the genetic diversity of those loci in the SD1-mediated pathways which are virtually inaccessible to most rice-breeding programs worldwide that are exclusively based on sd1.

AB  - In the consumer market, demand for a product is ultimately determined by the collective purchase decisions of consumers. Understanding the drivers and implications of consumer purchase behavior is often of pivotal importance for firms. This dissertation considers several operational models that incorporate consumer behavior. We study how operational decisions, such as pricing, advertising spending, and product variety, can be used as levers to manage consumer demand in order to boost firm profitability. First, we develop game theoretical models to analyze the effectiveness of advertising-related corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices in discouraging the consumption of unhealthy foods. Childhood obesity is one of the major concerns around the world often attributed to children's increased calorie consumption and lack of physical activity. As part of their CSR programs, several major food manufacturers have adopted advertising initiatives that limit the advertising of unhealthy food categories to children, based on the belief that less advertising would lead to less consumption in those food categories. However, food manufacturers usually distribute products to consumers through retailers, whose advertising is not bound by those initiative programs. This essay studies a Stackelberg competition in a supply chain where a manufacturer sells a single unhealthy food product to customers through a single retailer. We show that the effectiveness of advertising initiatives is critically dependent on the spillover effect and sensitivities of manufacturer advertising and retailer advertising, as well as on the power distribution between the manufacturer and the retailer in the supply chain. Put simply, an advertising initiative is usually more effective if the advertising level of the supply chain leader is restricted. Interestingly, we show that sales of an unhealthy food product can increase as an advertising initiative becomes more stringent. Second, we investigate whether and how a firm's optimal pricing and product variety decisions change with strategic, forward-looking consumer behavior. We consider a monopolist that sells vertically differentiated products. The monopolist decides on prices over time to maximize his profit from selling two products. Consumers weigh the expected payoffs of purchasing different products at different times, and decide when and where to purchase in order to maximize their individual surpluses. Our results show that, other than cost structure, strategic consumer behavior also plays an important role in determining the product variety. We conduct numerical experiments to illustrate our results and generate insights into the role of strategic customer behavior. Not surprisingly, we see that strategic customer behavior decreases the firm's profits. Interestingly, we show that sometimes firms strategically commit to static pricing policies, and systematically vary their product portfolio over time. Our work differs from much of the existing work on product variety by explicitly modelling consumer purchase decisions over time, and by illustrating that a static product portfolio is not necessarily sub-optimal and can lead to a significant profit increase.

AB  - Aims: Since the early 1980s, the one-child policy has been implemented nationwide in China. A special group called the “only-child-lost family” (OCL family) has emerged and has become a social phenomenon that cannot be ignored. We report latent profiles of posttraumatic growth and their relation to differences in resilience among OCL people in China. Methods: A total of 222 OCL people were investigated using the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory and the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. Latent profile analysis was applied to explore PTG latent profiles. Multinomial logistic regression was used to analyze the socio-demographic variables in each latent profile and the association between profile membership and resilience. Results: Three latent profiles were identified and labeled the “high appreciation-power group” (30.6%), the “general moderate growth group” (47.7%) and the “low growth and extreme possibility group” (21.7%). Compared to those in the high appreciation-power group, individuals with monthly income >2000 ($312) were less likely to be in the general moderate growth group (OR = 0.13, P<0.01), whereas individuals with a spouse were less likely to be in the low growth and extreme possibility group (OR = 0.43, P<0.01). Individuals in the “general moderate growth group”(OR = 0.92, P<0.01, 95%CI:0.89–0.94) and the “low growth and extreme possibility” groups (OR = 0.83, P<0.01, 95%CI:0.79–0.87) demonstrated significantly lower levels of resilience compared to the high appreciation-power group. Conclusion: The PTG patterns in only-child-lost parents were varied. Promoting resilience may be a way to foster these parents’ PTG. Targeted intervention should be developed based on the characteristics of each latent class, and timely attention must be paid to the mental health of OCL parents who are without a spouse and have low income.

AB  - Bacillary dysentery has long been a considerable health problem in southwest China, however, the quantitative relationship between anthropogenic and physical environmental factors and the disease is not fully understand. It is also not clear where exactly the bacillary dysentery risk is potentially high. Based on the result of hotspot analysis, we generated training samples to build a spatial distribution model. Univariate analyses, autocorrelation and multi-collinearity examinations and stepwise selection were then applied to screen the potential causative factors. Multiple logistic regressions were finally applied to quantify the effects of key factors. A bootstrapping strategy was adopted while fitting models. The model was evaluated by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), Kappa and independent validation samples. Hotspot counties were mainly mountainous lands in southwest China. Higher risk of bacillary dysentery was found associated with underdeveloped socio-economy, proximity to farmland or water bodies, higher environmental temperature, medium relative humidity and the distribution of the Tibeto-Burman ethnicity. A predictive risk map with high accuracy (88.19%) was generated. The high-risk areas are mainly located in the mountainous lands where the Tibeto-Burman people live, especially in the basins, river valleys or other flat places in the mountains with relatively lower elevation and a warmer climate. In the high-risk areas predicted by this study, improving the economic development, investment in health care and the construction of infrastructures for safe water supply, waste treatment and sewage disposal, and improving health related education could reduce the disease risk.

AB  - Recent development of benzoxaborole-based chemistry gave rise to a collection of compounds with great potential in targeting diverse infectious diseases, including human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), a devastating neglected tropical disease. However, further medicinal development is largely restricted by a lack of insight into mechanism of action (MoA) in pathogenic kinetoplastids. We adopted a multidisciplinary approach, combining a high-throughput forward genetic screen with functional group focused chemical biological, structural biology and biochemical analyses, to tackle the complex MoAs of benzoxaboroles in Trypanosoma brucei. We describe an oxidative enzymatic pathway composed of host semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase and a trypanosomal aldehyde dehydrogenase TbALDH3. Two sequential reactions through this pathway serve as the key underlying mechanism for activating a series of 4-aminomethylphenoxy-benzoxaboroles as potent trypanocides; the methylamine parental compounds as pro-drugs are transformed first into intermediate aldehyde metabolites, and further into the carboxylate metabolites as effective forms. Moreover, comparative biochemical and crystallographic analyses elucidated the catalytic specificity of TbALDH3 towards the benzaldehyde benzoxaborole metabolites as xenogeneic substrates. Overall, this work proposes a novel drug activation mechanism dependent on both host and parasite metabolism of primary amine containing molecules, which contributes a new perspective to our understanding of the benzoxaborole MoA, and could be further exploited to improve the therapeutic index of antimicrobial compounds.

AB  - Background: Acceptance of disability relates to the process of adaptation, which reflects how the values of a patient change over time to accept herself or himself as an intrinsically worthy person. Acceptance of disability (AOD) plays an important role in the adjustment of persons with physical disability to their environment. However, no studies on the level of AOD in patients with breast cancer are available in the literature. Purpose: The aim of this study was to explore the significant factors that influence disability acceptance in Chinese women with breast cancer. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 292 patients with breast cancer between January and April 2017. Participants were assessed using the Acceptance of Disability Scale-Revised, Medical Coping Modes Questionnaire, Sense of Coherence Scale, Social Relational Quality Scale, and general information questionnaire. Multiple regression analysis was used to determine the factors associated with the level of disability acceptance. Results: The mean score for AOD was 79.14 and ranged from 32 to 128. Multiple regression analysis indicated that family intimacy, friendships, confrontation, manageability, family commitment, marital status, surgery, and acceptance–resignation significantly affected disability acceptance, explaining 49.1% of the total variance in disability acceptance. Conclusions/Implications for Practice: The participants had a moderate level of disability acceptance. Disability acceptance is an important factor in the psychosocial adaptation to cancer. Healthcare staff should pay special attention to low scores for this factor and explore the potential of psychological interventions to effectively reduce the posttraumatic stress response, encourage the adoption of positive coping strategies, and hasten disability acceptance and return to society.

AB  - Background: The gut microbiota plays an important role in host immunity and metabolic homeostasis. Although analyses of gut microbiotas have been used to assess host health and foster disease prevention and treatment, no comparative comprehensive study, assessing gut microbiotas among several species of farmed snake, is yet available. In this study, we characterized and compared the gut microbiotas of four species of farmed snakes (Naja atra, Ptyas mucosa, Elaphe carinata, and Deinagkistrodon acutus) using high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rDNA gene in southern China and tested whether there was a relationship between gut microbiotal composition and host species. Results: A total of 629 operational taxonomic units across 22 samples were detected. The five most abundant phyla were Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, and Actinobacteria, while the five most abundant genera were Bacteroides, Cetobacterium, Clostridium, Plesiomonas, and Paeniclostridium. This was the first report of the dominance of Fusobacteria and Cetobacterium in the snake gut. Our phylogenetic analysis recovered a relatively close relationship between Fusobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Alpha diversity analysis indicated that species richness and diversity were highest in the gut microbiota of D. acutus and lowest in that of E. carinata. Significant differences in alpha diversity were detected among the four farmed snake species. The gut microbiotas of conspecifics were more similar to each other than to those of heterospecifics. Conclusion: This study provides the first comparative study of gut microbiotas among several species of farmed snakes, and provides valuable data for the management of farmed snakes. In farmed snakes, host species affected the species composition and diversity of the gut microbiota.

AB  - Background: Substance abuse has been prevalent among caregivers involved in child welfare and is a major barrier to their achieving favorable outcomes. Family Treatment Drug Courts (FTDCs) have been viewed as one of the most promising interventions but research has reported mixed effects on child welfare outcomes. No meta-analysis was conducted to synthesize the findings to reach a more generalizable conclusion. Objective: The meta-analysis synthesized findings from existing evaluations to examine whether and to what extent FTDC participants achieved better reunification and safety outcomes than non-participants. Participants and Setting: Among 17 identified studies dated from 2004 to 2018, the pooled sample subjects in the intervention and comparison groups were 3402 and 3683 for the 16 studies on reunification outcomes, and 842 and 632 for the eight studies on child safety outcomes. Methods: We first estimated the FTDCs’ pooled effects on child reunification and safety outcomes. Furthermore, we conducted a series of subgroup meta-analysis to compare FTDCs’ effects across study and program characteristics. Results: Subjects participating in FTDCs were substantially more likely to achieve reunification (OR = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.38, 2.22) without increasing the risk of subsequent foster care reentry or maltreatment re-report. Subgroup meta-analysis suggests factors such as research design, FTDC model, observation length, publication type and period may contribute to FTDCs’ disparities on reunification outcomes. Conclusions: The synthesized findings strengthen evidence for the implementation and expansion of FTDCs for serving substance abusing caregivers in the child welfare system.

AB  - In clinical trials comparing different treatments and in health economics and outcomes research, medical costs are frequently analysed to evaluate the economical impacts of new treatment options and economic values of health-care utilization. Since Lin et al.'s first finding in the problem of applying the survival analysis techniques to the cost data, many new methods have been proposed. In this report, we establish analytic relationships among several widely adopted medical cost estimators that are seemingly different. Specifically, we report the equivalence among various estimators that were introduced by Lin et al., Bang and Tsiatis, and Zhao and Tian. Lin's estimators are formerly known to be asymptotically unbiased in some discrete censoring situations and biased otherwise, whereas all other estimators discussed here are consistent for the expected medical cost. Thus, we identify conditions under which these estimators become identical and, consequently, the biased estimators achieve consistency. We illustrate these relationships using an example from a clinical trial examining the effectiveness of implantable cardiac defibrillators in preventing death among people who had prior myocardial infarctions.

AB  - Autism-affected users, such as autism patients, caregivers, parents, family members, and researchers, currently seek informational support and social support from communities on social media. To reveal the information needs of autism- affected users, this study centers on the research of users' interactions and information sharing within autism communities on social media. It aims to understand how autism-affected users utilize support groups on Facebook. A systematic method was proposed to aid in the data analysis including social network analysis, topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and inferential analysis. Social network analysis method was adopted to reveal the interaction patterns appearing in the groups, and topic modeling method was employed to uncover the discussion themes that users were concerned with in their daily lives. Sentiment analysis method helped analyze the emotional characteristics of the content that users expressed in the groups. Inferential analysis method was applied to compare the similarities and differences among different autism support groups found on Facebook. This study collected user-generated content from five sampled support groups (an awareness group, a treatment group, a parents group, a research group, and a local support group) on Facebook. Findings show that the discussion topics varied in different groups. Influential users in each Facebook support group were identified through the analysis of the interaction network. The results indicated that the influential users not only attracted more attention from other group members but also led the discussion topics in the group. In addition, it was examined that autism support groups on Facebook offered a supportive emotional atmosphere for group members. The findings of this study revealed the characteristics of user interactions and information exchanges in autism support groups on social media. Theoretically, the findings demonstrated the significance of social media for autism users. The unique implication of this study is to identify support groups on Facebook as a source of informational, social, and emotional support for autism-related users. The methodology applied in this study presented a systematic approach to evaluating the information exchange in health-related support groups on social media. Further, it investigated the potential role of technology in the social lives of autism-related users. The outcomes of this study can contribute to improving online intervention programs by highlighting effective communication approaches.

AB  - Aims The aim of this study was to elucidate whether depressive symptoms mediate the association between insomnia symptoms and health‐related quality of life (HRQOL) and to explore whether insomnia symptoms and depressive symptoms synergistically interact to affect HRQOL among older adults in nursing homes. Methods Older adults living in nursing homes (n = 323) completed Athens Insomnia Scale, the 15‐item Geriatric Depression Scale, and the 36‐item Short Form Health Survey. PROCESS for SPSS was used in the mediation model. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to obtain odds ratios (OR) for insomnia symptoms, depressive symptoms, and HRQOL. The relative excess risk due to interaction, the attributable proportion due to interaction, and the synergy index were assessed. Results Insomnia symptoms and depressive symptoms were negatively related to HRQOL. Depressive symptoms mediated the relationship between insomnia symptoms and HRQOL. Compared with the older adults without insomnia symptoms or depressive symptoms, those with only depressive symptoms (OR = 8.36, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.46–20.18) or insomnia symptoms (OR = 2.24, 95%CI: 1.04–4.83) had a lower HRQOL. Also, the co‐presence of insomnia symptoms and depressive symptoms significantly increased the risk of lowering HRQOL (OR = 25.79; 95%CI: 12.72–52.28). The relative excess risk due to interaction, attributable proportion due to interaction, and synergy index were 16.19, 0.63, and 2.88, respectively. Conclusions Depressive symptoms may play a mediating role between insomnia symptoms and HRQOL. Comorbid insomnia symptoms and depressive symptoms synergistically interact to affect HRQOL. It is vital to focus on elderly nursing home residents with insomnia symptoms and/or depressive symptoms and to adopt interventions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Autism-affected users, such as autism patients, caregivers, parents, family members, and researchers, currently seek informational support and social support from communities on social media. To reveal the information needs of autism- affected users, this study centers on the research of users' interactions and information sharing within autism communities on social media. It aims to understand how autism-affected users utilize support groups on Facebook. A systematic method was proposed to aid in the data analysis including social network analysis, topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and inferential analysis. Social network analysis method was adopted to reveal the interaction patterns appearing in the groups, and topic modeling method was employed to uncover the discussion themes that users were concerned with in their daily lives. Sentiment analysis method helped analyze the emotional characteristics of the content that users expressed in the groups. Inferential analysis method was applied to compare the similarities and differences among different autism support groups found on Facebook. This study collected user-generated content from five sampled support groups (an awareness group, a treatment group, a parents group, a research group, and a local support group) on Facebook. Findings show that the discussion topics varied in different groups. Influential users in each Facebook support group were identified through the analysis of the interaction network. The results indicated that the influential users not only attracted more attention from other group members but also led the discussion topics in the group. In addition, it was examined that autism support groups on Facebook offered a supportive emotional atmosphere for group members. The findings of this study revealed the characteristics of user interactions and information exchanges in autism support groups on social media. Theoretically, the findings demonstrated the significance of social media for autism users. The unique implication of this study is to identify support groups on Facebook as a source of informational, social, and emotional support for autism-related users. The methodology applied in this study presented a systematic approach to evaluating the information exchange in health-related support groups on social media. Further, it investigated the potential role of technology in the social lives of autism-related users. The outcomes of this study can contribute to improving online intervention programs by highlighting effective communication approaches. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This work aimed to study the relationship between psychological-behavioral characteristics and fractures in children to provide a basis for development of preventive strategies. The study included 84 children hospitalized for fractures (fracture group) and 78 children without fractures (control group). The following questionnaires were utilized: temperament questionnaire, Eysenck Personality Questionnaire, and the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). There were more children with problem behaviors in the fracture group than in the control group (P < 0.01). Furthermore, level of activity and attention dispersion showed a significant relationship with fractures (P < 0.05). Scores for the psychoticism, extroversion, and neuroticism subscales of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire were higher for the fracture group than the control group (P < 0.05 or < 0.01). For the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist, the average score for boys and/or girls was higher in the fracture group than the control group in 4-5-year and/or 6-11-year olds. In addition, in 6-11-year olds, boys in the fracture group had higher scores for restlessness, aggression, and violation of discipline and girls in the fracture group had higher scores for aggression and depression than those in the control group (P < 0.05). Children with fractures had more psychological and behavioral problems. Psychological intervention measures could be adopted to reduce the occurrence of fractures in children.

AB  - Background: Electronic health records (EHRs) are a rich resource for developing applications to engage patients and foster patient activation, thus holding a strong potential to enhance patient-centered care. Studies have shown that providing patients with access to their own EHR notes may improve the understanding of their own clinical conditions and treatments, leading to improved health care outcomes. However, the highly technical language in EHR notes impedes patients' comprehension. Numerous studies have evaluated the difficulty of health-related text using readability formulas such as Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL), Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG), and Gunning-Fog Index (GFI). They conclude that the materials are often written at a grade level higher than common recommendations. Objective: The objective of our study was to explore the relationship between the aforementioned readability formulas and the laypeople's perceived difficulty on 2 genres of text: general health information and EHR notes. We also validated the formulas' appropriateness and generalizability on predicting difficulty levels of highly complex technical documents. Methods: We collected 140 Wikipedia articles on diabetes and 242 EHR notes with diabetes International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision code. We recruited 15 Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) users to rate difficulty levels of the documents. Correlations between laypeople's perceived difficulty levels and readability formula scores were measured, and their difference was tested. We also compared word usage and the impact of medical concepts of the 2 genres of text. Results: The distributions of both readability formulas' scores (P<.001) and laypeople's perceptions (P=.002) on the 2 genres were different. Correlations of readability predictions and laypeople's perceptions were weak. Furthermore, despite being graded at similar levels, documents of different genres were still perceived with different difficulty (P<.001). Word usage in the 2 related genres still differed significantly (P<.001). Conclusions: Our findings suggested that the readability formulas' predictions did not align with perceived difficulty in either text genre. The widely used readability formulas were highly correlated with each other but did not show adequate correlation with readers' perceived difficulty. Therefore, they were not appropriate to assess the readability of EHR notes.

AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) pathogenesis is related to imbalance of immune responses, and the equilibrium between inflammatory T cells and Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) plays an important role in the intestinal homeostasis. Protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) regulate chromatin remodeling and gene expression. Here, we investigated whether inhibition of PRMTs affects colitis pathogenesis in mice and inflammatory bowel disease patients and further explored the underlying mechanisms. In this study, we found that protein arginine N-methyltransferase inhibitor 1 (AMI-1) treatments increased Tregs frequency, function, and reduced colitis incidence. Adoptive transfer of AMI-1-treated Tregs could reduce the colitis incidence. Colitis was associated with increased local PRMT5 expression, which was inhibited by AMI-1 treatment. Additionally, PRMT5 knockdown T cells produced a better response to TGF beta and promoted Tregs differentiation through decreased DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) expression. PRMT5 also enhanced H3K27me3 and DNMT1 binding to Foxp3 promoter, which restricted Tregs differentiation. Furthermore, PRMT5 knockdown led to decreased Foxp3 promoter methylation during Tregs induction. PRMT5 expression had a negative relationship with Tregs in UC patients, knockdown of PRMT5 expression increased Tregs frequency and decreased TNF alpha, IL-6, and IL-13 levels. Our study outlines a novel regulation of PRMT5 on Tregs development and function. Strategies to decrease PRMT5 expression might have therapeutic potential to control UC.

AB  - Background: Corn oil recovery and conversion to biodiesel has been widely adopted at corn ethanol plants recently. The US EPA has projected 2.6 billion liters of biodiesel will be produced from corn oil in 2022. Corn oil biodiesel may qualify for federal renewable identification number (RIN) credits under the Renewable Fuel Standard, as well as for low greenhouse gas (GHG) emission intensity credits under California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard. Because multiple products [ethanol, biodiesel, and distiller's grain with solubles (DGS)] are produced from one feedstock (corn), however, a careful co-product treatment approach is required to accurately estimate GHG intensities of both ethanol and corn oil biodiesel and to avoid double counting of benefits associated with corn oil biodiesel production. Results: This study develops four co-product treatment methods: (1) displacement, (2) marginal, (3) hybrid allocation, and (4) process-level energy allocation. Life-cycle GHG emissions for corn oil biodiesel were more sensitive to the choice of co-product allocation method because significantly less corn oil biodiesel is produced than corn ethanol at a dry mill. Corn ethanol life-cycle GHG emissions with the displacement, marginal, and hybrid allocation approaches are similar (61, 62, and 59 g CO2e/MJ, respectively). Although corn ethanol and DGS share upstream farming and conversion burdens in both the hybrid and process-level energy allocation methods, DGS bears a higher burden in the latter because it has lower energy content per selling price as compared to corn ethanol. As a result, with the process-level allocation approach, ethanol's life-cycle GHG emissions are lower at 46 g CO2e/MJ. Corn oil biodiesel life-cycle GHG emissions from the marginal, hybrid allocation, and process-level energy allocation methods were 14, 59, and 45 g CO2e/MJ, respectively. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to investigate the influence corn oil yield, soy biodiesel, and defatted DGS displacement credits, and energy consumption for corn oil production and corn oil biodiesel production. Conclusions: This study's results demonstrate that co-product treatment methodology strongly influences corn oil biodiesel life-cycle GHG emissions and can affect how this fuel is treated under the Renewable Fuel and Low Carbon Fuel Standards.

AB  - Background: Insight into user adherence to Web-based intervention programs and into its relationship to intervention effect is needed.Objective: The objective of this study was to examine use of a Web-based self-help intervention program, the Chinese version of My Trauma Recovery (CMTR), among Chinese traumatized individuals, and to investigate the relationship between program use and user characteristics before the intervention and change in outcomes after the intervention and at 3-months' follow-up.Methods: The sample consisted of 56 urban survivors of different trauma types and 90 rural survivors of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, who used the CMTR in 1 month on their own or guided by volunteers in a counseling center. Predictors were demographics (sex, age, highest education, marital status, and annual family income), health problems (trauma duration, posttraumatic symptoms, and depression), psychological factors (coping self-efficacy), and social factors (social functioning impairment and social support). Program use was assessed by general program usage (eg, number of visiting days) and program adherence (eg, webpages completed in modules). Outcome measures were the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS), Symptom Checklist 90-Depression (SCL-D), Trauma Coping Self-Efficacy scale (CSE), Crisis Support Scale (CSS), and Social Functioning Impairment questionnaire (SFI) adopted from the CMTR.Results: (1) Program use: rural participants had a larger total number of visiting days (F1,144=40.50, P<.001) and visited more program modules in 1 month (χ(2)3=73.67, P<.001) than urban participants. (2) Predictors and program use: total number of visiting days was correlated with CSS at pretest (r=.22, P=.009), and total number of completed webpages was associated with SFI at pretest (r=.19, P=.02). Number of webpages completed in modules was correlated with all demographic, disease severity, psychological, and social factors at pretest. (3) Program use and outcomes change: in general, use of the triggers and self-talk modules showed a consistent positive association with improvement in PDS, SCL-D, SFI, and CSE. The relaxation module was associated with positive change in PDS, but with negative change in CSS and SFI. The professional help module was associated with positive change in SCL-D, but its use on the first day was associated with negative change in CSS and CSE. The unhelpful coping module was associated with negative change in SFI. The mastery tools module showed a consistent association with negative change in PDS and SCL-D.Conclusions: These findings suggest that both individual (eg, demographic, health problems, psychological) and social factors (eg, social functioning, social support) should be considered when delivering Web-based interventions, particularly in collectivist cultures. Specific program adherence indicators (eg, webpages completed in each module, activity types completed), rather than general program usage indicators (eg, total number or time of visiting), should be developed to examine the effectiveness of various program modules or elements.Clinical Trial: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: ACTRN12611000951954; https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=343399 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/6G7WyNODk).

AB  - Objective: To investigate the detection rate and correlates of behavior problems among children aged 4-16 years old in Wuhan. Methods: Using stratified randomization sampling method, 2361 children from 16 schools were administered with the Achenbach's Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), a child physical abuse inventory, and a self-made other risk factor questionnaire. Logistic regression was used to identify associated risk factors. Results: The detection rate of behavior problems was 12.7% (95% CI: 11.3-14.1). The treatment-seeking rate (95%CI) for behavior problems was 3.0% (95% CI: 2.31-3.69). The risk factors and their corresponding odds ratios [OR (95% CI)] for behavior problems were living in foster family [5.80 (1.38-24.50)], being on bad terms with classmates [5.58 (1. 73-18.0)], being the only child [ 4. 02 (3.07-4.96)], having maltreated physically in the last year [3.60(2.96-4.23)], parents' drinking [2.23(1.64-3.02)], having common relationship with classmates [2.08(1.59-2.73)], living in rural-urban fringe zone [1.80(1.33-2.43)], studying in non-key school [1.49 (1.13-1.96)], and living in extend family [1.43(1.05-1.94)]. Conclusion: The detection rate of behavior problems among children and youth in Wuhan is high. Some measures of reducing physical abuse in family and school need to be taken to prevent child behavior problems. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This paper describes a rapid, simple, cost-effective questionnaire for screening school-aged children at risk for Asian schistosomiasis in China. Five hundred and thirty-two children, aged 8-14 years, were selected from 3 schools in an area moderately endemic for Schistosoma japonicum in Hunan province. The questionnaire, comprising 15 multiple-choice questions, was administered by teachers in order to collect both ethnographic and epidemiological data relevant to current S, japonicum infections.This was followed by Kato-Katz thick smear stool examinations, miracidium hatching tests, and soluble egg antigen-enzyme linked immunosorbent assays in order to validate the efficacy of the questionnaire approach. The results from a combination of all 3 procedures indicated that the overall schistosomiasis prevalence in the 3 schools was 29.9% (138/472). Six risk factors (episodes of diarrhoea, frequency of water contact, school grade attained, weakness, past history of S. japonicum infection(s), and whether a subject had been previously treated for schistosomiasis) in the questionnaire were determined by logistic regression to be highly statistically significant predictors of individual current infection. The sensitivity (93.7%), specificity (91.9%) and low cost (c. US$ 0.6/true positive case) associated with the 6 variables model make the questionnaire approach a very useful diagnostic tool for screening marshland and lake communities at high risk for schistosomiasis in China before selective treatment with praziquantel or diagnostic follow-up. An even simpler 3 variables `yes/no' model was derived from the questionnaire and found to be nearly as good at predicting individual infection (sensitivity 86.2% and specificity exceeding 97.6%) and extremely simple to use. If validated in other ecological settings in China the questionnaire, modified or as presented here, could be adopted by the national schistosomiasis control programme.

AB  - Today, many immigrant neighborhoods are plagued with poverty, inadequate schools, family disruption, single parenthood, teenage pregnancies, youth gangs, violent crimes, drug abuse and alcoholism, and anti-intellectual youth subcultures. Such unsettling environments put immigrant children of the inner city at greater risk than those living elsewhere. This brief reports on a study that focused on three immigrant neighborhoods in Los Angeles (Korean, Chinese, Latino) to examine ways in which neighborhood-based social structures influence immigrant children's after-school life by investigating types of social structures and differences by race/ethnicity; how these structures interact with one another to contribute to community-building, and types of social relations that the different structures foster. Fieldwork included pre-arranged one-on-one interviews with adolescents and adults with teenage children; random interviews with parents, local leaders, social workers and business owners' nonintrusive participant observations of structured activities and random gatherings; and participant observations with researchers doing volunteer work in selective publicly funded programs for children and parents, private after-school services, and cultural centers. Data from the U.S. census, California Department of Education and Los Angeles Unified School District were analyzed, as well as mainstream and ethnic media. Three demographic patterns were noted: racial makeup, nativity, and poverty. Public schools reflect these patterns. A wide range of retail businesses are found in the three neighborhoods, and all three also have various ethnically specific businesses and professional services. Formal organizations and institutions with specific programs serving children or youths exist in all three neighborhoods. The numbers and types of both nonprofit community-based organizations (CBOs) and the programs they offer do not vary drastically. Many depend primarily on public funds or on a combination of funds from various levels of government, private foundations, and individual or organizational donations. Although the functions and services of nonprofit CBOs are similar across ethnic neighborhoods, inequalities exist in the availability of private services oriented toward youths. The study found that children and adolescents who are involved in supervised after-school activities in their neighborhoods tend to do better in school, be more ambitious and articulate about their college plans and future careers, and have a clearer sense of purpose than those who are not so involved. Researchers postulate that the Asian-Latino difference in school performance and college preparation is largely due to the noted unequal access to neighborhood-based resources, such as privately run after-school activities. The study concludes that publicly funded school-based and community-based after-school programs are instrumental but insufficient in inner-city neighborhoods. Nonprofit and faith-based organizations have the experience and infrastructure to implement such support for immigrant families, yet they are largely under-funded and under-staffed. The role of ethnic entrepreneurship is critical for community building, as is the case of private supplementary educational establishments for facilitating the flow of information and enhancing intergenerational relations. The study recommends state action to: (1) provide multilingual educational materials to inform immigrant communities about college preparation and options; (2) encourage inter-group relations and coalitions by providing incentives to neighborhood businesses that provide services to more than one ethnic group, and allocating resources to building public-private partnerships; and (3) provide incentives to entrepreneurs to develop educational enrichment and other educationally related programs.

AB  - Education for all and success for all are human rights as well as our common goals to achieve in the 21st century. However, schools in modern societies have failed largely to help building an equal society by offering equal educational opportunities for all children, fulfilling the 'natural goals' of education as expected by functionalists (Stromquist, 2002; Feinberg & Soltis, 1998). Rather, as criticized by conflict and critical theories, it plays a major role perpetuating social and economic inequalities in society (Bowles and Gintis, 1976; McLaren 1994). Consequently, while most students from privileged families are guaranteed school success, a large number of students from low socio-economic backgrounds have suffered from school failure. How to help all students to achieve success in school? This has been a thorny problem for schools both in the West and the East. Success in school in our era of globalization is significant not only for individuals' personal development but also for a nation's economic growth and social development. School failure has caused many serious problems such as student dropout, juvenile delinquency, emotional and mental problems among students, unemployment, and so forth. To address these problems, over the past few decades many reform initiatives have been put forward, yet success stories are few. This research investigates an educational experiment in a middle school in Shanghai, China. The school, called Zhabei No. 8 Middle School (hereafter No. 8 School), is located in a run-down, lower working class district. Since the mid-1980s the school has experimented on an educational reform program called success education, aiming to help those at-risk students to be successful in school. The objective of this research is to investigate how this educational experiment has been carried out and to identify experiences that could be learned by the international educational community. The study adopts a case study approach and employs a theoretical framework, the Comprehensive School Reform model (CSR), which has developed rapidly in the United States since the 1990s, to analyze the data. The study examines the comprehensive school reform efforts that have been carried out in Zhabei No. 8 Middle School, and analyzes the critical role played by Principal Liu Jinghai. Particular attention is paid to the strategies adopted by the school to help enhance students' self-esteem through integrating love and care throughout the school's curriculum and activities. The critical roles played by teachers called 'class directors' are meticulously studied, and efforts the school has made to collaborate with parents and the local community are examined. An ethnographic approach was used to gather data in this study. A combination of interviews, participant-observation, and document analysis was applied to arrive at a systematic and complex understanding of this educational endeavor in China.

AB  - This paper presents findings from a study examining the out-of-home care (OOHC) experiences of children aged less than one year (infants), based on data collected by the NSW Department of Community Services (DoCS), Australia. The purpose of the study is to develop a profile of infant children in OOHC and to better understand why so many young children require OOHC services and their experiences with the child welfare system. Using administrative data, we employ both descriptive and multivariate analysis to explore how child, child maltreatment history and system factors are related to the placement of infants in care. Our results are in line with research conducted in the USA and UK. The most notable finding is the high child protection reporting rate and high entry rate by infants and by Indigenous infants in particular. The tendency for infants to stay in care longer than other children, coupled with a high entry rate to care, has and will continue to have a significant impact on the child welfare system and its consequences. The implications for development of policy and early intervention programmes are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Appropriate diagnostics to monitor disease trends and assess the effectiveness and impact of interventions are essential for guiding treatment strategies at different thresholds of schistosomiasis transmission and for certifying elimination. Field validation of these assays is urgently needed before they can be adopted to support policy decisions of the national programme for control and elimination of schistosomiasis in P. R. China. We compared the efficacy and utility of different immunoassays in guiding control strategies and monitoring the endemic status of S. japonicum infections towards elimination. Methodology/Principal Findings: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in seven villages with different transmission intensities settings to assess the performance and utility of three immunoassays, e. g., an indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA_JX), an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA_SZ), and a dot immunogold filtration assay (DIGFA_SH). 6,248 individuals aged 6-65 years old who gave consent and supplied their stool and blood samples were included for data analysis. Results showed that ELISA_SZ performed significantly higher sensitivity (95.45%, 95%CI: 92.94-97.97%) than IHA_JX (87.59%, 95%CI: 83.51-91.49%) and DIGFA_SH (79.55%, 95%CI: 74.68-84.41%), especially in subgroups with very low infection intensity. The specificity of ELISA_SZ, IHA_JX, DIGFA_SH in 6-9 year olds with occasional exposure was nearly 90%. DIGFA_SH performed the highest screening efficacy for patients among three assays with overall positive predicative value of 13.07% (95%CI: 11.42-14.72%). We found a positive correlation of antibody positive rate of IHA_JX with results of stool examination in age strata (r = 0.70, P<0.001). Seropositivity of IHA_JX in children aged 6-9 years old showed an excellent correlation with prevalence of schistosome infection in the seven communities (r = 0.77, P<0.05). Conclusions/Significance: Studies suggest that ELISA_SZ could be used to guide selective chemotherapy in moderate or low endemic regions. IHA_JX could be used to as a surveillance tool and for certifying elimination of schistosomiasis through monitoring children as a sentinel population.

AB  - Differences in parental feeding practices revealed across and within different ethnic/cultural groups indicate that cultural examinations of feeding practices in understudied non-European-American populations require urgent attention. China ranks as the second largest source country for children in foreign-born U.S. households. Contrary to the stereotype of slender Asians, Chinese-American young children are at high risk for obesity but have not received sufficient attention from researchers and practitioners dealing with parental feeding practices and childhood obesity. The present study aimed to understand food-related parenting practices among Chinese immigrants in the U.S. using qualitative focus groups. Twenty-two mothers with preschool aged children participated in a discussion regarding parent–child food-related interactions and feeding practices. A thematic approach was adopted to analyze the focus group data following five stages of framework analysis. Thirteen key themes of feeding practices were identified, including 9 that are in existing feeding measures (pre-exiting practices) and 4 practices that have not been documented or emphasized in previous feeding measures (culturally-emphasized practices), including regulating healthy routines and food energy, spoon-feeding, using social comparison to pressure the child to eat, and making an effort to prepare/cook specific foods. Through the use of an emic approach and meaning-centered evidence, the complexities of parent–child interactions and unique nuances of parental feeding in this understudied population were revealed. Our findings can guide future development of culturally-appropriate measurement and inform intervention programs to promote the healthy development of Chinese-American children.

AB  - NLRP3 (Nod-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3) inflammasome has been reported to contribute to obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance. However, there are few drugs targeting NLRP3 inflammasome for the treatment of insulin resistance. In the present study, we showed that berberine (BBR) significantly suppressed saturated fatty acid palmitate (PA)-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) release in macrophages, which was one of the most important mediators in the insulin sensitivity of adipose tissue. BBR treatment dramatically upregulated macrophage autophagic level while knockdown beclin1 and autophagy inhibitor reversed BBR’s suppression on inflammasome. Furthermore, AMPK (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase) inhibitor Adenine 9-β- d -arabinofuranoside (Ara-A) blocked most effects of BBR, suggesting that AMPK signals may be involved in BBR-induced macrophage autophagy. Importantly, BBR also prevented NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent inflammation and metabolic disorder in a high-fat-diet-induced insulin resistance model. Adoptive transfer of BBR-treated bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), which was induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plus palmitate-bovine serum albumin (PA-BSA), significantly ameliorated insulin resistance of ob/ob mice as compared with control mice. However, the co-treatment of the BMDMs with autophagy inhibitor 3-Methyladenine (3-MA) reversed the effect of BBR almost completely. Taken together, BBR exerted its anti-inflammatory effects through activation of AMPK-dependent autophagy in adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs). This study amplified the mechanisms of BBR and its potential in attenuating insulin resistance.

AB  - This research study aimed to investigate the lack of student engagement in Chinese library science (LS) undergraduate education. Specifically, this study aimed to identify and understand the causes of the lack of student engagement and to articulate effective and pragmatic resolving strategies. This study adopted an inductive approach and a single case study design. The LS program at Wuhan University was employed as the case study, in which 29 full-time students were interviewed using a semi-structured question script. A thematic analysis of the interview transcripts pointed to 11 causes of the lack of student engagement. The conceptualisation of the research findings suggested revising the existing LS curricula and maintaining dynamic and interactive relationships among three main determinants of student engagement: curricular design, students' individual interests, and career prospects. This study provides a perspective on the development and survival of LS education in China and shares important lessons and experiences for LS educators and policy makers across international borders.

AB  - This paper presents research results from the evaluation of the Medical Financial Assistance (MFA) program, supported by the World Bank, to extremely poor rural residents. It is found that MFA can help to improve the ability of the poor to make use of medical services, and especially their ability to receive services from township clinics. The present study also shows that adoption of the MFA mechanism helps to reduce the impact of disease on the economies of poor families, and prevents the poor afflicted with serious illnesses from being marginalized. However, as the beneficiaries often suffer from serious, complicated and lasting illnesses, the financial assistance is often insignificant in relation to medical expenses. Furthermore, the MFA plays no significant role in restoring a patient's income-earning ability.

AB  - Aims and objectives To explore the impact of emotional intelligence and organisational justice on work engagement in Chinese nurses and to examine the mediating role of organisational justice to provide implications for promoting clinical nurses' work engagement. Background The importance of work engagement on nurses' well-being and quality of care has been well documented. Work engagement is significantly predicted by job resources. However, little research has concentrated simultaneously on the influence of both personal and organisational resources on nurses' work engagement. Design A descriptive, cross-sectional design was employed. Methods A total of 511 nurses from four public hospitals were enrolled by multistage sampling. Data collection was undertaken using the Wong and Law Emotional Intelligence Scale, the Organizational Justice questionnaire and the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale-9. We analysed the data using structural equation modelling. Results Emotional intelligence and organisational justice were significant predictors and they accounted for 44% of the variance in nurses' work engagement. Bootstrap estimation confirmed an indirect effect of emotional intelligence on work engagement via organisational justice. Conclusions Emotional intelligence and organisational justice positively predict work engagement and organisational justice partially mediates the relationship between emotional intelligence and work engagement. Relevance to clinical practice Our study supports the idea that enhancing organisational justice can increase the impact of emotional intelligence. Managers should take into account the importance of emotional intelligence and perceptions of organisational justice in human resources management and apply targeted interventions to foster work engagement.

AB  - Purpose: To further observe and verify the effect of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) on the response to antiviral therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and investigate the relationship between the virologic response and insulin resistance. Patients and methods: A retrospective study was adopted and 61 NAFLD patients with HBeAg-positive CHB were included as the observation group (group A), and 64 patients with simple CHB were included as the control group (group B). Results: After 12 weeks of treatment with entecavir, the total virologic response rate in group A was statistically significantly lower than that in group B (P<0.05). During weeks 24-96, the difference was not statistically significant (P>0.05). In weeks 48 and 96, there was no significant difference in the HBeAg seroconversion rates between the two groups (P>0.05). In weeks 12 and 24, there was also no significant difference in the alanine transaminase (ALT) normalization rate between the two groups (P>0.05). Then, in weeks 48 and 96, the ALT normalization rate of group A was obviously lower than that of group B (P<0.05). Group A patients were divided into group A1 (<= M) and group A2 (>M) according to the median value (M=2.79) of the baseline homeostatic model assessment method insulin resistance levels. In weeks 48 and 96, the ALT normalization rate of group A1 was significantly higher than that of group A2 (P<0.05). The correlation coefficient (r) of the baseline homeostatic model assessment method insulin resistance level and the severity of fatty liver in group A was 0.426 (P=0.001). Conclusion: NAFLD cannot affect the long-term total virologic response rate and HBeAg seroconversion rate in CHB patients treated with entecavir but can reduce the long-term biochemical response rate, which has a positive correlation with the severity of fatty liver and the insulin resistance index.

AB  - Commuting between home and work is an important aspect of everyday life. Based upon the broaden and build theory of positive emotions, experiencing happiness during commutes generates positive emotions that are beneficial for both individual and societal well-being. The existing literature on commute happiness is dominated by studies from the U.S., Canada, and Europe. Little is known about commute happiness in Chinese cities where electric bikes and employer-provided shuttle buses are common commute modes. This study uses original survey data collected from Xi’an, China to examine how commute happiness may differ across eight commute modes (walk, private bike, public bike, bus, subway, electric bike, shuttle bus, and private car) and by commute duration and frequency, while controlling for personal demographics and overall health and well-being. Results show that commute mode and duration are significantly associated with commute happiness while commute frequency is not. People who use employer shuttle buses reported the highest commute happiness, followed by people who use private bikes and then people who walk. People who use regular city buses reported the lowest commute happiness. People who use subway, public bikes, and electric bikes show no differences in commute happiness from car users. Longer commute duration is associated with lower happiness. Recommendations for Chinese cities to promote commute happiness include improving public bus services, investing in pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure, enhancing bike-transit integration, encouraging employer shuttle bus programs, and fostering jobs-housing balance. The results also indicate a gender gap in commute happiness that merits additional research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This cohort study assesses association of the type and age of exposure to childhood maltreatment with hyperactive and hypoactive amygdala responses in young adults. Key PointsQuestionWhat is the association between exposure to childhood maltreatment at different ages and adult amygdala response to threatening faces? FindingsIn this cohort study of 202 young adults, self-reported exposure to maltreatment during early childhood was significantly associated with blunted amygdala response via functional magnetic resonance imaging, whereas early teen exposure was significantly associated with augmented amygdala response. MeaningThe findings suggest that maltreatment may be a risk factor for disorders characterized by hyperactive amygdala response and disorders associated with hypoactive amygdala responses, which may be associated with differences in age at the time of exposure to specific types of adversity during childhood. ImportanceAbnormalities in amygdala response to threatening faces have been observed in anxiety disorders, autism, bipolar disorder, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and schizophrenia. Abnormally hyperactive and hypoactive responses have typically been associated with anxiety and inhibition vs risk taking and inappropriate social behaviors. Maltreatment is a major risk factor for most of these disorders and is associated with abnormal amygdala function. ObjectiveTo identify the type and age of exposure to childhood maltreatment that are associated with hyperactive and hypoactive amygdala responses in young adulthood. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsData collection for this retrospective cohort study took place from November 8, 2010, to August 23, 2012. Data analyses were conducted from September 20, 2012, to June 27, 2018. Participants were recruited from the urban and suburban Boston vicinity without diagnostic restrictions based on exposure history. ExposuresThe Maltreatment and Abuse Chronology of Exposure (MACE) scale was used to retrospectively assess type and age of exposure to childhood maltreatment. Main Outcomes and MeasuresActivation and pattern information functional magnetic resonance imaging were used to assess bilateral amygdala response to angry and fearful faces vs neutral faces or shapes, and sensitive exposure periods were identified using cross-validated artificial intelligence predictive analytics (50 averaged randomized iterations with training on 63.3% and testing on 36.7% of the sample). ResultsOf the 202 participants (mean {[}SD] age, 23.2 {[}1.7] years; 118 {[}58.4%] female), 52 (25.7%) reported no exposure to maltreatment and 150 (74.3%) reported exposure to 1 or more maltreatment types. Eight participants (15.1%) with a MACE score of 0 and 51 (34.2%) with a MACE score of 1 or higher had a history of major depression (odds ratio, 2.40; 95% CI, 1.05-6.06; P=.03); 8 unexposed participants (15.1%) and 46 with MACE scores of 1 or higher (30.9%) had a history of 1 or more anxiety disorders (odds ratio, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.03-6.50; P=.03). Retrospective self-report of physical maltreatment between 3 and 6 years of age and peer emotional abuse at 13 and 15 years were associated with amygdala activation to emotional faces vs shapes. Early exposure was associated with blunted response (beta=-0.17, P<.001), whereas later exposure was associated with augmented response (beta=0.16, P<.001). Prepubertal vs postpubertal maltreatment was associated with an opposite response on the voxelwise response pattern in clustering stimuli of the same type (eg, mean {[}SD] emotional ellipse areas for physical maltreatment at age 4 years vs nonverbal emotional abuse at 13 years: 1.41 {[}1.05] vs 0.25 {[}0.10], P<.001) and in distinguishing between stimuli of different types (eg, mean {[}SD] emotional vs neutral faces distance for peer emotional abuse at age 6 years vs 13 years: 1.89 {[}0.75] vs 0.80 {[}0.39], P<.001). Conclusions and RelevanceThe findings suggest that prepubertal vs postpubertal developmental differences in the association between maltreatment and amygdala response to threatening or salient stimuli exist. Understanding the role of adversity in different sensitive exposure periods and the potential adaptive significance of attenuated vs enhanced amygdala response may help explain why maltreatment may be a risk factor for many different disorders and foster creation of targeted interventions to preempt the emergence of psychopathology in at-risk youths.

AB  - Introduction: On Tuesday, February 22, 2011, a 6.3 magnitude earthquake struck Christchurch, New Zealand. This qualitative study explored the intensive care units (ICUs) staff experiences and adopted leadership approaches to manage a large-scale crisis resulting from the city-wide disaster. Problem: To date, there have been a very small number of research publications to provide a comprehensive overview of crisis leadership from the perspective of multi-level interactions among staff members in the acute clinical environment during the process of the crisis management. Methods: The research was qualitative in nature. Participants were recruited into the study through purposive sampling. A semi-structured, audio-taped, personal interview method was chosen as a single data collection method for this study. This study employed thematic analysis. Results: Formal team leadership refers to the actions undertaken by a team leader to ensure the needs and goals of the team are met. Three core, formal, crisis-leadership themes were identified: decision making, ability to remain calm, and effective communication. Informal leaders are those individuals who exert significant influence over other members in the group to which they belong, although no formal authority has been assigned to them. Four core, informal, crisis-leadership themes were identified: motivation to lead, autonomy, emotional leadership, and crisis as opportunity. Shared leadership is a dynamic process among individuals in groups for which the objective is to lead one another to the achievement of group or organizational goals. Two core, shared-leadership themes were identified: shared leadership within formal medical and nursing leadership groups, and shared leadership between formal and informal leaders in the ICU. Conclusion: The capabilities of formal leaders all contributed to the overall management of a crisis. Informal leaders are a very cohesive group of motivated people who can make a substantial contribution and improve overall team performance in a crisis. While in many ways the research on shared leadership in a crisis is still in its early stages of development, there are some clear benefits from adopting this leadership approach in the management of complex crises. This study may be useful to the development of competency-based training programs for formal leaders, process improvements in fostering and supporting informal leaders, and it makes important contributions to a growing body of research of shared and collective leadership in crisis.

AB  - Background: The digital divide persists despite broad accessibility of mobile tools. The relationship between the digital divide and health disparities reflects social status in terms of access to resources and health outcomes; however, data on this relationship are limited from developing countries such as China.Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the current rates of access to mobile tools (Internet use and mobile phone ownership) among older Chinese individuals (aged ≥45 years), the predictors of access at individual and community levels, and the relationship between access to mobile tools and health outcomes.Methods: We drew cross-sectional data from a national representative survey, the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), which focused on the older population (aged ≥45 years). We used two-level mixed logistic regression models, controlling for unobserved heterogeneity at the community and individual levels for data analysis. In addition to individual-level socioeconomic status (SES), we included community-level resources such as neighborhood amenities, health care facilities, and community organizations. Health outcomes were measured by self-reported health and absence of disability based on validated scales.Results: Among the 18,215 participants, 6.51% had used the Internet in the past month, and 83% owned a mobile phone. In the multivariate models, Internet use was strongly associated with SES, rural or urban residence, neighborhood amenities, community resources, and geographic region. Mobile phone ownership was strongly associated with SES and rural/urban residence but not so much with neighborhood amenities and community resources. Internet use was a significant predictor of self-reported health status, and mobile phone ownership was significantly associated with having disability even after controlling for potential confounders at the individual and community levels.Conclusions: This study is one of the first to examine digital divide and its relationship with health disparities in China. The data showed a significant digital divide in China, especially in the older population. Internet access is still limited to people with higher SES; however, the mobile phone has been adopted by the general population. The digital divide is associated with not only individual SES but also community resources. Future electronic health (eHealth) programs need to consider the accessibility of mobile tools and develop culturally appropriate programs for various social groups.

AB  - An interdisciplinary team approach to handling cases of child abuse and neglect is discussed. The 2 major purposes of such teams are: to understand the problem from a comprehensive perspective, and to implement solutions which address all aspects of the problem. These teams can have 4 functions: coordination and evaluation of services, community and continuing education, case assessment and consultation, and treatment. Organization of the team must be done through the collective effort of the professional community. It may be difficult to develop all team functions at once, and energies must be channeled where the greatest assessed needs exist. Many communities have established 'children-at-risk committees' made up of a wide range of service agencies and organizations that come together to discuss problems, share resources, and analyze service gaps and strengths. The case evaluation team may have membership from the same agencies as children-at-risk committees. The treatment team has an open- ended membership of primary service providers working with the given family. Its role is to share information, vent frustrations, and find solutions. For the team process to work effectively, it is crucial for members to know each other and have ongoing relationships that foster trust and respect. Beyond the commitment of the individual members, the community as a whole needs to give its active support to this process. Engaging all of the relevant agencies in ongoing work for the team ensures its relevance to the total service community.

AB  - A national indifference to children is indicated by the system of foster child care and by the treatment of mental retardates. Another manifestation is the attack on Head Start. Criticism based on the program's failure to raise standardized intelligence or aptitude scores is misplaced. Head Start is a broad developmental program having many components. Approximately 40 percent of children coming to Head Start centers have an identifiable physical defect. Over 75 percent have had their defects treated. The author asserts he is proud to have been one of the architects of Head Start, for which was enunciated the principle of parent participation. Through such participation, one sees parents getting a new sense of dignity and a new sense of being able to control their own destiny and that of their children. In 58 communities where Head Start was available, it changed their health and education delivery system. Head Start is directed toward improving the social competence of the child, rather than toward massive IQ changes. The children's centers of the seventies should provide both a variety of services for children on a full-day rather than half-day basis, and the means for mixing children of different socio-economic groups.

AB  - Research on attachment predominantly traces the effect of a single or primary attachment and/or attachment style on working models and behavior. However, most children form multiple attachments. This article reviews research on multiple attachment representations in children and considers how such information can usefully be applied to clinical settings. Through the case study of a six-year-old adopted boy with a history of maltreatment, it explores how those internal working models can be assessed in treatment and the clinical value of recognizing different attachment representations and styles. Implications for treatment interventions are explored. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Accumulating evidence suggests that children suffering deprivation and maltreatment at critical times in their development often pay a cognitive toll. While children vary to the extent that neurocognitive domains are affected, those factors influence how children process, manage and understand traumatic and attachment experiences as well as how they respond to treatment. Current research on trauma and attachment favor some aspects of cognition over others. The literature discusses attention, memory, cognitive biases, internal working models, beliefs and attributions as ways that impact an individual’s understanding of experience. Other categories such as working memory, processing speed, verbal, auditory or perceptual processing, metacognitive skills, and cognitive rigidity or flexibility rarely surface. This paper examines what is and is not known about the interface of cognition with attachment and complex trauma and how that knowledge can inform treatment. It explores existing research and offers a case vignette as an example of how that knowledge can be integrated into treatment strategies.

AB  - Despite a high level of documented mental health needs among children who have experienced foster care, research indicates that treatment outcomes are often disappointing. In order to improve outcomes, evidence-based treatments for attachment, trauma and behavioral difficulties are often promoted for this population. However, little research exists on whether or not those interventions effectively address the unique and complex mental health needs of many foster children. While a rather robust literature exists on foster children’s multifaceted difficulties, most treatments do not fully represent that range and complexity in their interventions. This article attempts to begin to fill that gap by outlining the knowledge and skills clinicians must acquire if they are to effectively treat foster children. Treatment of foster children should be seen as a subspecialty within the field of child mental health, and trainings that help clinicians gain more knowledge of foster children’s unique needs should be more available.

AB  - OBJECTIVE Immunization rates for influenza and pneumococcal vaccines among the elderly (especially minority elderly) are below desired levels. We sought to answer 4 questions: (1) What factors explain most missed immunizations? (2) How are patient beliefs and practices regarding adult immunization affected by racial or cultural factors? (3) How are immunizations and patient beliefs affected by physician, organizational, and operational factors? and (4) Based on the relationships identified, can typologies be created that foster the tailoring of interventions to improve immunization rates? STUDY DESIGN A multidisciplinary team chose the PRECEDE-PROCEED framework, the Awareness-to-Adherence model of clinician response to guidelines, and the Triandis model of consumer decision making as the best models to assess barriers to and facilitators of immunization. Our data collection methods included focus groups, face-to-face and telephone interviews, self-administered surveys, site visits, participant observation, anti medical record review. POPULATION To encounter a broad spectrum of patients, facilities, systems, and interventions, we sampled from 4 strata: inner-city neighborhood health centers, clinics in Veterans Administration facilities, rural practices in a network, and urban/suburban practices in a network. In stage 1, a stratified random cluster sample of 60 primary care clinicians was selected, 15 in each of the strata. In stage 2, a random sample of 15 patients, was selected from each clinician's list of patients, aiming for 900 total interviews. CONCLUSIONS This multicomponent approach is well suited to identifying barriers to and facilitators of adult immunizations among a variety of populations, including the disadvantaged.

AB  - Background: High-income countries with established infection control programs have demonstrated effective control of infection transmission in health care settings. The guidelines and advice underlying these effective control programs have been produced by high-income countries for their own social, economic, and health environments. These have also been adopted by low- and middle-income (LMI) countries, but these countries appear to have a limited ability to apply these principles using the same methods. Methods: A systematic search for literature published in English was conducted exploring the relationship between the available infection prevention and control advice and the capacity of LMI countries to apply this guidance in their health care settings. Articles relevant to this exploration were identified and subsequently informed further search terms and identified other significant documents. Results: Infection control guidelines designed for high-income countries are being utilized by LMI countries, with varying degrees of success mainly because of physical, environmental, and socioeconomic factors. There is a lack of published studies exploring the implementation of comprehensive infection control advice and programs, including the minimal advice, which is designed specifically for resource-limited settings. Conclusion: What is evident from the literature is that there is a need for the development of infection control and prevention guidelines based on evidence but adapted to the specific needs of health care workers in LMI countries. This must be done in collaboration with those same LMI countries' health care workers. Equally, because of finance and health priorities, health care facilities should choose those interventions most relevant to the needs of their population and workers to prevent infection transmission. Opportunities for further research into application of available infection control advice in LMI countries are identified. Through such research, more appropriate advice may be devised to assist with the development of infection control programs in these settings.

AB  - Psychotherapy is unconceivable without communication between the healthcare provider and the client. Thus, good communication is essential for effective treatment in mental health care. Yet, what actually happens during the psychotherapy encounter has been given limited attention in the literature to date. Different functions were be distinguished in medical communication. These seem to apply to mental health care equally well. First, relationship building, or fostering the relationship, is considered. Relevant elements such as respect, trust, and rapport are necessary components of such a therapeutic relationship. Second, therapists need to gather information from their patients about symptoms, experiences, and expectations for establishing a diagnosis and treatment plan. Third, information is provided: Patients need information to understand their illness and treatment, to make decisions, and to cope throughout the treatment trajectory. As a fourth function, we distinguished involving the patient in decision making. In both the shared and the informed decision-making models, communication is essential to reach decisions based on preferences and possibilities along with the patient. A fifth communicative function is the support or promotion of behavior related to the treatment: This may involve medication use, therapy attendance, or homework to be done. We have proposed the term enabling disease and treatment-related behavior. Finally, the sixth function, the need to respond to emotions, is obvious in the mental health context. Mental health problems are laden with emotion, and obviously clinicians cannot deny those. On the contrary, they are the essential elements, or may even be the core material, in the treatment of psychological distress. The six functions described have separate characteristics and go along with specific communicative behaviors. At the same time, they are not independent. A good relationship is most important. It is needed in the assessment of underlying problems, in conveying information and making the patient understand what is at stake, in making satisfactory decisions as well as in promoting treatment-related behavior, and finally, in giving the patient the room and confidence that emotions can be safely explored. In fact, without a good relationship, none of the other goals in the therapeutic encounter can be pursued optimally. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Previous research has consistently documented high rates of tobacco smoking and substance use disorders among young people with serious mental illness. However, limited studies have been conducted outside traditional clinical settings. In an attempt to address this shortfall and to better understand the needs of young people accessing its services, a national psychiatric disability support service (Neami) examined the prevalence and impact of substance use among 120 consumers from across Australia aged 30 years and under. Results indicated extremely high rates of tobacco use, with 68% of participants identified as daily smokers. In addition, 33.4% met criteria for an alcohol use disorder, whilst 40.8% met criteria for a cannabis use disorder. Overall rates of other illicit substance use were low. This study reinforces the need for routine alcohol and drug screening and assessment across all mental health settings, as well as appropriate support strategies that address high level smoking and caffeine intake.

AB  - Abstract: Using a combination of survey and administrative data describing 453 public kinship foster family placements in Illinois, this study examines the relationship between kinship family type and the timing and disposition of children''s placement discharge outcomes. Family types are identified using an empirically-grounded typology of kinship families based on family structure and household composition (Zinn, 2010). In order to explore the mechanisms governing the relationships between family type and children''s discharge outcomes, the moderating effects of several other kinship family characteristics are also examined. Results suggest significant differences in the type and timing of children''s discharge outcomes across kinship family type as well as two other kinship family characteristics: caregiver age and fostering competency. Implications for kinship family scholarship, policy, and practice are discussed.

AB  - Surgical site infection (SSI) as a high-risk procedures in orthopedics and traumatology are the most common cause of postoperative complications. They are the reason for an extended period of hospitalization, increased costs of treatment and adverse health and social consequences. These adverse events are also a major cause of morbidity and mortality among patients operated. In orthopedic surgery the predominant etiologic agent of SSI associated with the prosthesis are bacteria of the genus Staphylococcus. The arthritis associated with a prosthesis are also isolated: Enterococcus spp., beta-hemolytic streptococci, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Corynebacterium spp., Propionibacterium acnes. The incidence of infections in orthopedics is closely related to the kind performed in patients of surgical procedures and the applicable definitions and criteria for prospective surveillance of this form of infection. At the risk of SSI is also affected by factors related to the patient and environmental factors. Active monitoring of infections and the risk of infection is a priority and the most urgent and the most advanced standard of modern medicine infections. You should take all possible steps to minimize the risk of SSI by developed rational surveillance program wound infections supported by the director of the hospital. Analysis of the main etiological factors SSI and their sensitivity to antibiotics should allow to develop their own standards of decision- making both perioperative prophylaxis, medical and local recommendations diagnosis and treatment of infections for use in orthopedics ward. In order to reduce the risk of developing SSI is required to appropriate preventive approach for reducing the patient's stay in the ward before surgery, proper preparation of the patient for surgery, prevention of perioperative, aseptic procedures during surgery, aseptic procedures after the operation, proper care of the wound, proper closure of wounds and selection of sterile dressings and the controlled movement of the operating room - adopted unanimously consensus Philadelphia (100%). Modern technologies and methods of infection control in addition to the continuous monitoring of antibiotic therapy and the use of disinfectants in the hospital can reduce the risk of infections, including SSI.

Przyczyniają się do: wydłużonego okresu hospitalizacji, zwiększenia kosztów leczenia oraz niekorzystnych skutków zdrowotnych i społecznych. ZMO pozostają także głównym powodem zachorowalności i śmiertelności w grupie pacjentów operowanych. W chirurgii ortopedycznej dominującym czynnikiem etiologicznym zakażeń miejsca operowanego, związanym z protezą, są bakterie z rodzaju Staphylococcus. W zapaleniach stawów związanych z protezą izoluje się także: Enterococcus spp., paciorkowce beta-hemolityczne, pałeczki z rodziny Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Corynebacterium spp. oraz Propionibacterium acnes. Częstotliwość występowania zakażeń w ortopedii pozostaje w ścisłym związku z rodzajem wykonywanych procedur chirurgicznych oraz ze stosowanymi definicjami i kryteriami prospektywnego nadzoru nad tą formą infekcji. Na ryzyko ZMO wpływ mają również czynniki związane z pacjentem oraz czynniki środowiskowe. Aktywne monitorowanie infekcji i ryzyka zakażenia to priorytetowy, najpilniejszy oraz najnowocześniejszy standard współczesnej medycyny zakażeń. W celu zminimalizowania ryzyka ZMO należy podejmować wszystkie możliwe działania, z wykorzystaniem opracowanego racjonalnego programu nadzoru nad zakażeniami ran, wspieranego przez dyrektora szpitala. Analiza głównych czynników etiologicznych zakażenia miejsca operowanego oraz ich wrażliwości na antybiotyki powinna umożliwić opracowanie własnych standardów decyzyjnych - zarówno profilaktyki okołooperacyjnej oraz medycznej, jak i lokalnych rekomendacji diagnostyki oraz terapii zakażeń do stosowania w oddziałach ortopedii i traumatologii. W celu zmniejszenia ryzyka rozwoju ZMO konieczne jest: odpowiednie prewencyjne podejście dotyczące skrócenia pobytu chorego w oddziale przed operacją, prawidłowe przygotowanie pacjenta do operacji, profilaktyka okołooperacyjna, aseptyczne postępowanie podczas operacji, aseptyczne postępowanie po operacji, właściwa pielęgnacja rany, właściwe zamkniecie rany i dobór sterylnych opatrunków, a także kontrolowany ruch na sali operacyjnej (jednogłośnie przyjęte stanowisko konsensusu filadelfijskiego (100%)). Nowoczesne technologie i metody kontroli zakażeń - oprócz ciągłego monitorowania antybiotykoterapii oraz stosowania środków dezynfekcyjnych, szczególnie w zakresie dezynfekcji rąk w warunkach szpitalnych - mogą ograniczyć ryzyko rozwoju infekcji, w tym ZMO.

AB  - People speculate with the fantastic. Fantasy is a celebrity and money-making machine. As a module in people's brains, it has the capacity to transform plain junk into gold that glitters. Fantasy mobilizes and instrumentalizes the fantastic to form and celebrate spectacles that exist and have always existed--illusions of social relations of exploitation based on power. It is through fantasy that people have always sought to make sense of the world, not through reason. Reason matters, but fantasy matters more and, perhaps, it has mattered too much. But if fantasy is to provide resistance to real existing social conditions in the form of critical reflection and spiritual regeneration, it is important to know first what it is and how it operates in the brains and in the public sphere. In this article, the author talks about fantasy, how it operates in people's lives, and why it matters too much. The author offers a few brief examples in so-called children's or youth culture that includes picture books, comic books, graphic novels, television programs, and films to demonstrate the diverse modes of the fantastic employed by writers and artists to induce effects intended to create difference and reveal the extraordinary in the ordinary. These examples of the fantastic are personal choices of works that have struck the author's imagination. In each case, the author focuses on how the fantastic can foster alternative thinking and viewing and negate spectacle and delusion.

AB  - Parents of special needs children know how hard their children work to master new skills. It can be heartrending when hard-won progress evaporates. Summer can present a particular dilemma to those with learning challenges. The freedom, recreation, and fun is something everybody looks forward to, but this break from learning can result in the loss or critical academic skills--something that may have a lasting impact on their educational development. Quality summer programming helps children to maintain competency skills over the summer. Summer classes reinforce academic learning in subjects like reading and math and provide an opportunity to practice social and behavioral skills with peers. By keeping skills fresh over the summer, students are better prepared to transition back into school in September and take on the challenges of a new academic year. Summer programming for children with special needs has important quality-of-life benefits too. For special learners, summer break is often anything but a "vacation." The productive, predictable routine of school is replaced by a tremendous quantity of unstructured time. This can be disorienting, frustrating or lonely for a child with special needs. A summer program can foster friendships and provide opportunities to try new activities in a supportive environment. Socialization and recreation are important for special needs learners, but they may have difficulty taking part in mainstream sports or recreation activities. Issues such as health, motor planning, behavioral issues, over stimulating environments and difficulties inferring social cues and understanding abstract language can interfere with their participation. When looking for the right summer learning program for their child, the first thing parents want to look for is balance. The ideal summer program integrates both social and emotional development with engaging academics to build on a student's interests and strengths while maintaining what they have accomplished. The right blend of socialization and academics offers the special learner the ability to stay academically engaged while still experiencing a balanced and enjoyable summer "break."

AB  - Parent-child interaction therapy (PCIT) is an evidence-based treatment (EBT) for young children with disruptive behavior disorders (DBDs). Disruptive behavior is the most common reason for the referral of young children for mental health services and can vary from relatively minor infractions such as talking back to significant acts of aggression. The DBDs may be classified as oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) or conduct disorder, depending on the severity of the behavior and the nature of the presenting problems. The DBDs often co-occur with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). PCIT has been used effectively to treat disruptive behavior across the full range of problem severity. Based on Baumrind's developmental theory of parenting, PCIT draws from both attachment and social learning principles to teach authoritative parenting—a combination of nurturance, good communication, and firm control. The authoritative parenting style has been associated with fewer child behavior problems than alternative parenting styles across a diverse range of clinical populations. According to attachment theory, parental warmth and responsiveness to the emotional needs of young children contribute to the development of a secure working model of relationships, which, in turn, leads to greater emotional regulation and enhances the child's desire to please and willingness to comply. Conversely, parents who are unresponsive to their children's emotional expression and needs foster insecure attachment. Maladaptive parent-child attachment has often, been linked to children's aggressive behavior, low social competence, poor coping skills, low self-esteem, and poor peer relationships. Moreover, an insecure parent-child attachment is related to increased maternal stress and increased risk of child abuse and neglect. The specific behavior management techniques taught in PCIT are based on social learning theory, which emphasizes the contingencies that shape dysfunctional interactions between disruptive children and their parents. These interactions are characterized by mutual and escalating aversive behaviors resulting from the attempts of both the parent and child to control the actions (e.g., arguing, criticizing, whining, aggression) of the other. To interrupt this cycle, in our view, parents must change their behavior to incorporate clear limit setting in the context of an authoritative relationship. Thus, the goals of PCIT are to improve both the parent-child relationship and parental behavior management skills. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - CONTEXT. Studies have revealed that youth in foster care covered by Medicaid insurance receive psychotropic medication at a rate >3 times that of Medicaid-insured youth who qualify by low family income. Systematic data on patterns of medication treatment, particularly concomitant drugs, for youth in foster care are limited. OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this work was to describe and quantify patterns of psychotropic monotherapy and concomitant therapy prescribed to a randomly selected, 1-month sample of youth in foster care who had been receiving psychotropic medication. METHODS. Medicaid data were accessed for a July 2004 random sample of 472 medicated youth in foster care aged 0 through 19 years from a southwestern US state. Psychotropic medication treatment data were identified by concomitant pattern, frequency, medication class, subclass, and drug entity and were analyzed in relation to age group; gender; race or ethnicity; International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, psychiatric diagnosis; and physician specialty. RESULTS. Of the foster children who had been dispensed psychotropic medication, 41.3% received >= 3 different classes of these drugs during July 2004, and 15.9% received >= 4 different classes. The most frequently used medications were antidepressants (56.8%), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder drugs (55.9%), and antipsychotic agents (53.2%). The use of specific psychotropic medication classes varied little by diagnostic grouping. Psychiatrists prescribed 93% of the psychotropic medication dispensed to youth in foster care. The use of >= 2 drugs within the same psychotropic medication class was noted in 22.2% of those who were given prescribed drugs concomitantly. CONCLUSIONS. Concomitant psychotropic medication treatment is frequent for youth in foster care and lacks substantive evidence as to its effectiveness and safety.

AB  - One of the major concerns in organ transplantation is the early detection of humoral rejection, through improved diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Longterm survival of renal allografts is significantly lower in recipients developing donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies (DSAs) either pretransplant or posttransplant. Patients can form antibodies following blood transfusions, pregnancies or previous transplants. DSAs can lead to endothelial damage through complement-dependent or independent pathways. Universal testing of kidney transplant patients and careful monitoring of graft function if DSAs are detected are recommended. Since there are different techniques to detect DSAs presence and serum levels, nephrologists have to face challenges in their interpretation due to variable sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, other biomarkers of rejection (T-cell reactivity, gene expression pattern modulation, early features of immunological damage in protocol renal biopsies) may be adopted together with DSAs detection tools, thus providing a global approach to the issue. To date, however, there are no well-defined strategies of intervention in cases of humoral graft damage. Future resolution of both interpretative and therapeutic concerns will make DSAs monitoring a very effective way to predict incoming immunological events. Therefore, an operative protocol for DSAs detection in renal recipients has been illustrated.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This cross-sectional study evaluated the impact of Medicaid-eligibility category on the increased use of antipsychotic medication by Medicaid-insured youths across a decade. METHODS: The authors analyzed computerized administrative claims data for 456,315 youths aged two to 17 years who were continuously enrolled in Medicaid in a mid-Atlantic state in 1997 (N=159,171) and 2006 (N=297,144). Bivariate and multivariable analyses quantified changes in antipsychotic use in relation to the youths' psychiatric diagnosis and eligibility category (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families [TANF], state Children's Health Insurance Program [SCHIP], Supplemental Security Income [SSI], and foster care). A second multivariable regression model examined changes in demographic and clinical characteristics of antipsychotic users with a psychiatric diagnosis. RESULTS: The prevalence of antipsychotic use increased from 1.2% in 1997 to 3.2% in 2006. The increase in odds of antipsychotic use in 2006 was greatest among youths enrolled in SCHIP (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=5.9), followed by youths enrolled in foster care (AOR=4.1), TANF (AOR=3.6), and SSI (AOR=2.8). Among users of antipsychotics who had a psychiatric diagnosis, youths with externalizing behavior disorders and bipolar disorder had 2.4- to 3.8-fold greater odds of using antipsychotics in 2006 versus 1997 compared with youths with schizophrenia or other psychoses and pervasive developmental disorders. The proportion of youths using antipsychotics between 1997 and 2006 increased significantly more among African Americans and Hispanics than among whites. CONCLUSIONS: The expansion of antipsychotic use was most prominent among youths who were Medicaid eligible because of low family income (SCHIP) and reflects increased medication use for behavioral problems.

AB  - The clinical case presented herein addresses the following 2 key issues: (1) the meaning and consequences of bypassing a major symptom or syndrome in a patient’s treatment to facilitate development and growth in other dimensions of her life that were being hindered due to their interrelations with the symptom; and (2) the therapeutic impact of incorporating strategic, cognitive, and behavioral interventions into a relational psychodynamic psychotherapy modeled on Wachtel’s (1997) cyclical psychodynamics theory. The primary distress, symptoms, personal, and family background of the patient are outlined, followed by a description of the psychodynamic formulation and detailed clinical considerations lying behind the adoption of a cyclical integrative therapeutic plan. The treatment plan comprised strategic intervention, interpretative work around the psychodynamic formulation, cognitive challenging, augmenting self-esteem, reinforcing active and independent behaviors, with a focus on the therapeutic effects of therapeutic alliance, and corrective experiences. The discussion, outcomes, and conclusions sections demonstrate the importance of adopting creative, flexible, and integrative attitudes when working with patients suffering from defined complex symptoms among other complaints and distresses.

AB  - The term, 'self-determination', implies that individuals have choice and control over aspects of their lives. Individual/ family preferences and choices are now core aspects of Australia's National Disability Insurance Scheme, underpinning the importance attributed to these concepts in relation to the fostering of wellbeing. As occupational therapists, in collaboration with our clients, we facilitate and enable occupational performance goals which are personally meaningful and self-endorsed. As such, our professional practice provides us with a powerful motivational tool by which we can harness individuals' energies in the pursuit of their goals - occupation. Self-Determination Theory (SDT) is an influential theory of human motivation and is presented as a way of understanding the elements of our occupational therapy transactions, and the way in which we enact them so as to enhance client outcomes. In SDT, it is proposed that individuals engage in, pursue and persist with certain behaviours when three psychological needs are being met. These needs are for autonomy (engaging in behaviour that is self-endorsed), relatedness (feeling cared for and connected to others) and competence (feeling effective in one's environment). A focus on supporting satisfaction of these basic psychological needs, it will be argued, engenders therapeutic alliance and internalisation of goal pursuits, thus optimising therapy engagement and outcomes. Examples of practice approaches that attend to the psychological needs for autonomy, relatedness and competence will be presented. A case will be made for embedding SDT into our models of practice as a sound way of articulating how we practise.

AB  - Objective: This study compares homeless women who had childhood histories of foster care or other out-of-home placement to those who have not. Method: A countywide probability sample of homeless women (n = 179) received structured interviews. Results: One-third of homeless women reported being raised apart from their parents. Among women with children under age 18, most (61.5%) had children who had lived in foster care or other out-of-home placements. Variables associated with homeless mothers' children living in foster care or other out-of-home placements were: Child was school-age, mother was age 35 or older, mother had a current alcohol or drug use disorder, mother experienced childhood sexual abuse, and mother ran away from home (when under age 18). Conclusions: Parenting is difficult for homeless mothers who may need to place their children with others to facilitate school attendance. Parent-child interaction may be problematic in family shelters where privacy is rare. Thus, programs promoting family preservation for homeless mothers should provide parenting support as well as permanent housing. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Objetivo: Este estudio compara mujeres sin hogar quienes tenían historias de cuidado sustituto u otras colocaciones fuera del hogar con otras que no. Método: Se realizaron entrevistas estructuradas a una muestra probabilística de mujeres sin hogar (n = 9). Resultados: Un tercio de las mujeres sin hogar reportaron haber sido criadas separadas de sus padres. Entre las mujeres con hijos menores de 18 años, la mayoría (61.5%) tenían hijos que habían vivido en hogares sustitutos u otras colocaciones fuera del hogar. Las variables asociadas con que los hijos de las madres sin hogar vivieran en hogares sustitutos u otras colocaciones fueron: el niño tenía edad escolar, la madre tenía 35 años o mayor, la madre tenía un desorden de uso de alcohol o droga, la madre había sufrido abuso sexual en la niñez, y la madre se había fugado de su casa (cuando tenía menos de 18 años). Conclusiones: La crianza es difícil para las madres sin hogar que pueden necesitar el poner a sus hijos con otros para facilitar su asistencia a la escuela. La interacción padre-hijo puede ser problemática en refugios familiares donde es raro tener privacidad. De manera que los programas que promueven la preservación de la familia para las madres sin hogar deben ofrecer apoyo en la crianza así como casas permanentes. (Spanish) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Objectif: Cette étude compare deux groupes de femmes: des femmes sans logis qui ont vécu en foyers d'accueil ou dans d'autres milieux hors de la famille durant leur enfance et des femmes qui ont grandi dans leur famille. Méthode: On a mené des entrevues structurées auprès d'un échantillon national de 179 femmes sans logis. Résultats: Un tiers des femmes sans logis ont grandi à l'extérieur du milieu familial. Parmi les femmes qui avaient des enfants de moins de 18 ans, la plupart (61,5 p.c.) Avaient des enfants qui avaient été placés en foyers d'accueil ou autre milieu hors-famille. On a relevé les variables suivantes pr rapport à ces enfants: ils étaient d'âge scolaire, leur mère avait 35 ans ou plus, elle souffrait de problèmes d'alcool ou de drogue, elle avait subi des agressions sexuelles en enfance et elle avait fui le foyer avaint l'âge 18 ans. Conclusions: Il est difficile pour des femmes sans logis de remplir leur rôle de parent. Elles doivent souvent plaer leur enfant en foyer d'accueil pour qu'ils puissent aller à l'école. L'interaction entre parent et enfant est rendue difficile lorsqu'ils vivent dans un abri. Ainsi, les programmes qui cherchent à préserver la vie familiale des mères sans logis devraient les appuyer dans leur rôle de parent en plus de leur fournir un logement.

AB  - Sharing the daily struggles of children and families residing in transitional situations (homelessness or because of risk of homelessness, being connected with the child welfare system, or being new immigrants in temporary housing), this text recommends strategies for delivering mental health and intensive case-management services that maintain family integrity and stability. Based on work undertaken at the Center for the Vulnerable Child in Oakland, California, which has provided mental health and intensive case management to children and families living in transition for more than two decades, this volume outlines culturally sensitive practices to engage families that feel disrespected by the assistance of helping professionals or betrayed by their forgotten promises. Chapters discuss the Center's staffers' attempts to trace the influence of power, privilege, and belief on their education and their approach to treatment. Many U.S. children living in impoverished transitional situations are of color and come from generations of poverty, and the professionals they encounter are white, middle-class, and college-educated. The Centers' work to identify the influences or obstacles interfering with services for this target population is therefore critical to formulating more effective treatment, interaction, and care.

AB  - Soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) affects men and women with equal frequency and commonly presents as an asymptomatic mass in patients 40 to 50 years of age. Recent study has identified physical, emotional and psychological factors associated with a diagnosis of malignancy, but the issues affecting the STS patient population may differ from those of more common cancers due to physical dis-ability secondary to treatment. Research to date has not dealt specifically with gender differences in the reaction and adaptation to the cancer diagnosis. This pilot study was designed to evaluate the treatment experiences of five males and five females treated with surgery and radiation for STS of the thigh and followed posttreatment for at feast 2 years. The open-ended interview was used so collect data, which was then subjected to a constant comparative analysis technique. The STS patients shared many concerns of cancer patients, with additional physical complaints. Physical symptoms were common to men and women, but women adapted more easily with explanation. Women feared losing life, family role, and relationships. Along with men, they also feared the losses of limb and career. For women, support included faith and shaving stories with others, whereas men preferred to deal with their illnesses individually and concealed emotions from loved ones. The perception of disease time frame was also distinct, with men adopting a fatalistic attitude and regarding their disease as an isolated episode. Women believed their condition was ongoing, Women need repeated information from several sources along with reassurance and increased social support.

AB  - TWENTY-FOUR EMOTIONALLY DISTURBED CHILDREN BETWEEN THE AGES OF 7 AND 16 WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS, ONE IN WHICH PARENTING AND THERAPY WERE DONE BY THE SAME WORKER AND ONE IN WHICH THE TWO FUNCTIONS WERE ASSIGNED TO SEPARATE WORKERS ON THE HYPOTHESIS THAT CHILDREN IN THE SPLIT-CASE GROUP WOULD SHOW MORE IMPROVEMENT AT THE END OF 2 YEARS THAN THOSE IN THE SINGLE-CASE GROUP. EVALUATION OF EACH CHILD COVERED SCHOOL PERFORMANCE, RELATIONS WITH PEERS, HIS OWN EVALUATION, AND THE CASEWORKER'S JUDGMENT OF THE CHILD'S ADJUSTMENT AND PSYCHOLOGICAL TEST RESULTS. MOST OF THE CHILDREN IN BOTH GROUPS IMPROVED AFTER 2 YEARS, AND ALTHOUGH NOT PROVED, IT WAS FELT THAT PARENTAL FORCE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE IMPROVEMENT IN BOTH GROUPS. THE MAJORITY OF THOSE WORKING WITH THE CHILDREN DID NOT FAVOR THE SPLIT CASE AS THE PREFERRED METHOD. THE AGENCY SHIFTED ITS FOCUS OF INTEREST FROM THE SPLIT-CASE METHOD TO AN OVERALL PHILOSOPHY OF THE AGENCY AS PARENTAL FORCE. RECOMMENDATIONS WERE THAT (1) AGENCIES CONDUCT STUDIES COMPARING PARENTAL FORCE WITH ANOTHER METHOD, (2) RESEARCH BE UNDERTAKEN TO ESTABLISH CRITERIA FOR GUIDING JUVENILE COURTS AND CHILD CARING AGENCIES IN DECISIONS SEPARATING A CHILD FROM HIS FAMILY, FOR EFFECTING THE SEPARATION WITH A MINIMUM OF TRAUMA, AND FOR PROVIDING THE CHILD WITH A PARENTING EXPERIENCE, AND (3) THE CHILDREN IN THE PROJECT BE STUDIED FURTHER FOR MORE EFFECTIVE EVALUATION OF CHANGES.

AB  - While there is a large body of literature documenting the efficacy of family-based childhood obesity (FBCO) treatment interventions, there is little evidence that these interventions have been systematically translated into regular practice — particularly in health disparate regions. To address this research-practice gap, this project was guided by a community advisory board (CAB) and the RE-AIM planning and evaluation framework within a systems-based and community-based participatory research approach. Families with overweight or obese children between 5 and 12 years old, in the medically-underserved Dan River Region, were randomly assigned to one of two FBCO treatment programs (i Choose vs. Family Connections) delivered by local Parks & Recreation staff. Both programs have previously demonstrated clinically meaningful child BMI z-score reductions, but vary in intensity, structure, and implementation demands. Two clinical CAB partners embedded recruitment methods into their regional healthcare organization, using procedures representative to what could be used if either program was taken to scale. The primary effectiveness outcome is child BMI z-scores at 6-months, with additional assessments at 3-months and at 12-months. Secondary goals are to determine: (1) reach into the intended audience; (2) effectiveness on secondary child and parent outcomes; (3) intervention adoption by organizations and staff; (4) fidelity, cost, and capacity for intervention implementation; and (5) maintenance of individual-level changes and organizational-level sustainability. This research addresses literature gaps related to the features within clinical and community settings that could improve both child weight status and the translation of FBCO interventions into typical practice in medically-underserved communities.

AB  - Background and objective: The parental/caregiver/helper, in one word psychological, overprotection is one of the most important background factors of childhood and adult psychopathologies (mainly neurotic anxiety and depressive disorders). Its scientific investigation and the psychotherapeutic and educational application of the related results however, are scarce. This article presents the most significant empirically founded results published in the field of overprotection to date. Method: The present study is a selective review. Results: The most important result of the study is the synthesis of the heterogeneous research areas of psychological overprotection, thus the attempt to establish a common basis of these areas to foster effective scientific communication. This article clusters those phenomena under the term psychological overprotection, which have been integrated only partly or to a little extent in the international scientific literature yet. Based on the former attempts at a definition, it offers a comprehensive definition, which places the different types of overprotection in a uniform frame, accentuating not just the protective parental functions but the preparing functions as well. The author positions the psychological overprotection among other parental/helper maltreatment forms, namely abuse and neglect, proposing an integrated theoretical framework for further investigations of the phenomenon. Conclusions: It is important to emphasize that psychological overprotection is a maltreatment that is difficult to identify but in its consequences and harmful effects competes with the other forms of abuse. For this reason, prevention and therapeutic interventions are of high significance both for parents/ helpers and children/helpee. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Although self-efficacy is a potential determinant of feeding and care behaviors, there is limited empirical analysis of the role of maternal self-efficacy in low- and middle-income countries. In the context of behavior change interventions (BCIs) addressing complementary feeding (CF), it is possible that maternal self-efficacy can mediate or enhance intervention impacts. Objective: In the context of a BCI in Bangladesh, we studied the role of maternal self-efficacy for CF (MSE-CF) for 2 CF behaviors with the use of a theoretically grounded empirical model of determinants to illustrate the potential roles of MSE-CF. Methods: We developed and tested a locally relevant scale for MSE-CF and included it in a survey (n = 457 mothers of children aged 6-24 mo) conducted as part of a cluster-randomized evaluation. Qualitative research was used to inform the selection of 2 intervention-targeted behaviors: feeding green leafy vegetables in the last 24 h (GLV) and on-time introduction of egg (EGG) between 6 and 8 mo of age. We then examined direct, mediated, and potentiated paths of MSE-CF in relation to the impacts of the BCI on these behaviors with the use of regression and structural equation modeling. Results: GLV and EGG were higher in the intensive group than in the nonintensive control group (16.0 percentage points for GLV; P < 0.001; 11.2 percentage points for EGG; P = 0.037). For GLV, MSE-CF mediated (beta = 0.345, P = 0.010) and potentiated (beta = 0.390, P = 0.038) the effect of the intensive group. In contrast, MSE-CF did not mediate or potentiate the effect of the intervention on EGG. Conclusions: MSE-CF was a significant mediator and potentiator for GLV but not for EGG. The divergent findings highlight the complex determinants of individual specific infant and young child feeding behaviors. The study shows the value of measuring behavioral determinants, such as MSE-CF, that affect a caregiver's capability to adopt intervention-targeted behaviors.

AB  - Objectives This theory-building case study examined the zone of proximal development (ZPD) in psychotherapy within the assimilation model. Theoretically, the ZPD is the segment of the continuum of therapeutic development within which assimilation of problematic experiences can take place. Work within a problem's current ZPD may be manifested as a Winnicottian ability to play, that is, an ability to adopt a flexible reflexive stance to the presenting problem and be involved in joint examination of possible alternatives. Play may be recognized in the client's receptivity to and creative use of the therapist's formulations of the presenting problems. Design and methods A case was selected from a comparative clinical trial of two very brief psychotherapies for mild to moderate depression, the Two-Plus-One Project (Barkham, Shapiro, Hardy, & Rees, 1999, J. Consult. Clin. Psychol., 67, 201). Martha, a woman in her late forties, received two sessions of psychodynamic-interpersonal therapy 1week apart and a follow-up (plus one') session approximately 3months later. Dialogical sequence analysis was used to analyse the transcripts of the three sessions. Results The analysis revealed Martha's problematic action pattern, which remained unchanged throughout the three sessions. Her ability to use and elaborate the therapist's formulations depended on the referential object that the therapist addressed; in particular, she seemed unable to play with the therapist's formulations of her more problematic experiences. Conclusions The case helped elucidate how the ZPD is content dependent. Winnicott's conception of playing emphasizes the quality of client response as an indicator of this content sensitivity. Differing breadths of major problems' ZPD, manifested as differing abilities to play with therapists' formulations may explain why some clients improve in psychotherapy while some do not. Practitioner points Accessing very problematic content may be very difficult even though the client's ability to mentalize other material appears ordinary. Mildly depressed clients who have developed powerful care-taking coping strategies may not respond to very brief therapeutic interventions. A client's minimal acknowledgements may mislead the therapist into supplementing the client's failing self-reflection rather than addressing the issue that provokes this failure. 10.1111/(ISSN)2044-8341

AB  - The debate about how, where and by whom young children should be looked after is one which has occupied much social policy and media attention in recent years. Mothers undertake most of the care of young children. Internationally, out-of-home day-care provision ranges widely. These different levels of provision are not simply a response to different levels of demand for day-care, but reflect cultural and economic interests concerning the welfare of children, the need to promote mothers' participation in paid work, and the importance of socialising children into society's values. At a time when a decline in family values is held responsible for a range of social problems, the day-care debate has a special prominence. To quantify the effects of out-of-home day-care for preschool children on educational, health and welfare outcomes for children and their families. Randomised controlled trials of day-care for pre-school children were identified using electronic databases, hand searches of relevant literature, and contact with authors. Studies were included in the review if the intervention involved the provision of non-parental day care for children under 5 years of age, and the evaluation design was that of a randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trial. A total of eight trials were identified after examining 920 abstracts and 19 books. The trials were assessed for methodological quality. Day-care increases children's IQ, and has beneficial effects on behavioural development and school achievement. Long-term follow up demonstrates increased employment, lower teenage pregnancy rates, higher socio-economic status and decreased criminal behaviour. There are positive effects on mothers' education, employment and interaction with children. Effects on fathers have not been examined. Few studies look at a range of outcomes spanning the health, education and welfare domains. Most of the trials combined non-parental day-care with some element of parent training or education (mostly targeted at mothers); they did not disentangle the possible effects of these two interventions. The trials had other significant methodological weaknesses, pointing to the importance of improving on study design in this field. All the trials were carried out in the USA. Day care has beneficial effect on children's development, school success and adult life patterns. To date, all randomised trials have been conducted among disadvantaged populations in the USA. The extent to which the results are generaliseable to other cultures and socioeconomic groups has yet to be evaluated.[CINAHL Note: The Cochrane Collaboration systematic reviews contain interactive software that allows various calculations in the MetaView.]

AB  - This rapid systematic review examined the reported effects of large-scale online education on the behaviour and, ultimately, practice of health and social care professionals. Electronic databases of health and education literature were searched, 193 unique records were screened against inclusion and exclusion criteria, 31 papers were accessed for full text reading and six were included. Identified studies reported primarily qualitative results, which were synthesised according to outcomes. Factors that contributed to the results were also identified. All papers reported that participation in e-learning programmes resulted in changes in behaviour and practice, including: increased awareness, changes in attitudes, improved communication, increased confidence and the actual changes applied in a workplace. Observed benefits of these programmes ranged from gaining new insights into own practice, through feeling empowered to apply changes, to eventually being able to provide more person-centred services and willing to adopt and spread a more humane evidence-based practice. While the current study is an early indication of the potential of large-scale online education to effect practice change, further research is recommended as is further in-depth investigation into how these changes are achieved and what factors contribute to success.

AB  - Designed to serve as a model and resource for teachers setting up family life education programs at the secondary level, this family life education curriculum guide presents a specific ten-session model for programs at both the high school and junior high school levels. While both programs attempt to provide a broad overview of the areas commonly covered in family life education courses, the junior high program tends to focus more on the issue of self-esteem, while the senior high programs focuses more on problem solving and decision making. Topics of the junior high program sessions are an introduction to self-esteem, listening and communicating, sex roles, adolescent growth and development, pregnancy and birth, decision making, birth control and parenting, and pregnancy alternatives and venereal disease. Session topics for the senior high program include reproductive anatomy and physiology, sex roles, decision making within relationships, venereal disease and communication, pregnancy and birth, teen parenting, pregnancy alternatives and birth control. Appendixes contain a family life education bibliography, audio-visual resources, film guides, a sample parent notification form, and a sample parents' review night. (MN)

AB  - Functional abdominal pain (FAP) is a common childhood somatic complaint that contributes to impairment in daily functioning (e.g., school absences) and increases risk for chronic pain and psychiatric illness. Cognitive behavioral treatments for FAP target primarily older children (9 + years) and employ strategies to reduce a focus on pain. The experience of pain may be an opportunity to teach viscerally hypersensitive children to interpret the function of a variety of bodily signals (including those of hunger, emotions) thereby reducing fear of bodily sensations and facilitating emotion awareness and self-regulation. We designed and tested an interoceptive exposure treatment for younger children (5–9 years) with FAP. Assessments included diagnostic interviews, 14 days of daily pain monitoring, and questionnaires. Treatment involved 10 weekly appointments. Using cartoon characters to represent bodily sensations (e.g., Gassy Gus), children were trained to be “FBI agents” – Feeling and Body Investigators - who investigated sensations through exercises that provoked somatic experience. 24 parent-child dyads are reported. Pain (experience, distress, and interference) and negative affect demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically significant change with effect sizes ranging from 0.48 to 71 for pain and from 0.38 to 0.61 for pain distress, total pain: X 2 (1, n = 24) = 13.14, p < 0.0003. An intervention that helps children adopt a curious stance and focus on somatic symptoms reduces pain and may help lessen somatic fear generally. Clinical trial registration NCT02075437.

AB  - This article describes stressful life events experienced by a multi-shelter sample of 162 homeless adults in the Central Florida area. Participants included homeless single men (n = 54), homeless single women (n = 54), and homeless women with children (n = 54). Subjects were interviewed with a modified version of the List of Threatening Experiences (Brugha & Cragg, 1990). Findings indicate that the two groups of women were more likely to have been both physically and sexually abused as children titan single men. Single women were more likely to have experienced sexual violence over the age of 18, experienced domestic violence, and been hospitalized in a psychiatric facility. Single men were more likely to have abused drugs and alcohol, and to have been incarcerated. Women with children were more likely to have lived in foster care. Overall, single women experienced significantly more stressful life events titan single men and women with children. These findings suggest that the three groups are unique and would benefit from prevention and/or treatment approaches developed for the specific subgroup.

AB  - Severe, unpreventable psychological blows to children who have already been injured seem commonplace among foster children. Although it is reassuring to think that the presence of a skilled therapist and long-term treatment will disrupt the pattern of children in a war zone-to think, 'Now, at least this child is safe'-it is not true. In the case this chapter discusses, my long-term, attachment theory-based, psychodynamic therapy could not erase old traumas nor prevent new injuries to the child in my care. However, such treatment can go some way to repair or restore essential emotional functioning, buffer the effects of new traumas, and assist in long-term healing, and it did so for this child. About 2 years into the successful weekly treatment of a school-age boy with a history of neglect, abuse, and abandonment, his foster parents died suddenly and violently. The loss was very difficult for him and reverberated painfully through the families, social agencies, and clinicians that were involved. It was very trying for me as his therapist and for my consultation group. Work with high-risk foster children is challenging on a number of counts. It can require advocacy with government agencies and other out-of the- office activities. It elicits stressful experiences for the therapist such as feelings of incompetence and failure, the blurring of boundaries, and the risk of indirect and direct traumatization. In my experience, a developmentally informed, relational clinical method and a parallel structure of consultation and support, a circle around the therapist, can help the therapist help the child through the stormiest of waters. Both can stay safe. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - While much research has been conducted on sports marketing efforts within Division I intercol legiate athletics and outsourcing sports marketing within Division I intercol legiate athletics, there are limited studies examining sports marketing within Division II athletics beyond factors impacting Division II football attendance or basketball attendance. Previous Division II scholarship has also focused on burnout, compliance, gambling, risk management, sports information work-family conflict and student-athlete development. This research examined what resources were al located towards marketing within Division II athletic departments to foster publicity efforts, revenue generation and community relations. It also examined which sports are prioritized as well as the preferred inventory for sponsors given that the Division II athletic programs are traditionally not afforded the same media opportunities as their Division I counterparts. Collected data was analyzed along with qualitative responses. The findings and recommendations are valuable to Division II athletic directors, administrators, presidents and conference commissioners to help discern best practices as well as those in academia to afford them a focused Division II perspective given the emphasis continuously placed on Division I sports marketing operations.

AB  - BackgroundIntensive outpatient programs address the complex medical, social, and behavioral needs of individuals who account for disproportionate healthcare costs. Despite their promise, the impact of these programs is often diminished due to patient engagement challenges (i.e., low rates of patient participation and partnership in care).ObjectiveThe objective of this study was to identify intensive outpatient program features and strategies that increase high-need patient engagement in these programs.DesignQualitative study.ParticipantsTwenty program leaders and clinicians from 12 intensive outpatient programs in academic, county, Veterans Affairs, community, and private healthcare settings.ApproachA questionnaire and semi-structured interviews were used to identify common barriers to patient engagement in intensive outpatient programs and strategies employed by programs to address these challenges. We used content analysis methods to code patient engagement barriers and strategies and to identify program features that facilitate patient engagement.Key ResultsThe most common barriers to patient engagement in intensive outpatient programs included physical symptoms/limitations, mental illness, care fragmentation across providers and services, isolation/lack of social support, financial insecurity, and poor social and neighborhood conditions. Patient engagement strategies included concrete services to support communication and use of recommended services, activities to foster patient trust and relationships with program staff, and counseling to build insight and problem-solving capabilities. Program features that were identified as enhancing engagement efforts included: 1) multidisciplinary teams with diverse skills, knowledge, and personalities to facilitate relationship building; 2) adequate staffing and resources to handle the demands of high-need patients; and 3) a philosophy that permitted flexibility and patient-centeredness.ConclusionsPromising clinical, interpersonal, and population-based approaches to engaging high-need patients frequently deviate from standard practice and require creative and proactive staff with adequate time, resources, and flexibility to address patients' needs on patients' terms.

AB  - Introduction: An increase in post abortion care (PAC) research with adolescents, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, has brought to attention several associated research ethics challenges. In order to better understand the ethics context of PAC research with adolescents, we conducted a scoping review of published literature. Methods: Following a systematic search of PubMed, HINARI, and Google Scholar, we analysed articles meeting inclusion criteria to determine common themes across both the ethical challenges related to PAC research with adolescents and any available guidance on the identified challenges. Results: The literature search identified an initial 3321 records of which 14 were included in analysis following screening. Several ethical challenges stem from abortion being a controversial, sensitive, and stigmatized topic in many settings. Ethical dilemmas experienced by researchers conducting adolescent PAC research included: difficulties in convincing local health providers to permit PAC research; challenges in recruiting and seeking consent due to sensitivity of the subject; effectively protecting confidentiality; managing negative effects of interventions; creating a non-prejudicial atmosphere for research; managing emotional issues among adolescents; and dealing with uncertainty regarding the role of researchers when observing unethical health care practices. Suggested strategies for addressing some of these challenges include: using several sources to recruit study participants, using research to facilitate dialogue on abortion, briefing health workers on any observed unethical practices after data collection, fostering a comprehensive understanding of contextual norms and values, selecting staff with experience working with study populations, and avoiding collection of personal identifiers. Conclusion: Addressing ethical challenges that researchers face when conducting PAC research with adolescents requires guidance at the individual, institutional, community, and international levels. Overall, despite the documentation of challenges in the published literature, guidance on handling several of these ethics challenges is sparse. We encourage further research to clarify the identified challenges and support the development of formal guidance in this area.

AB  - Background: Traditional health practitioners (THPs) play a vital role in the health care of the majority of the South African population and elsewhere on the African continent. However, many studies have challenged the role of THPs in health care. Concerns raised in the literature include the rationale, safety and effectiveness of traditional health practices and methods, as well as what informs them. This paper explores the processes followed in becoming a traditional healer and how these processes are related to THP roles. Methods: A qualitative research design was adopted, using four repeat group discussions with nine THPs, as part of a larger qualitative study conducted within the HIV Treatment as Prevention trial in rural South Africa. THPs were sampled through the local THP association and snowballing techniques. Data collection approaches included photo-voice and community walks. The role identity theory and content analysis were used to explore the data following transcription and translation. Results: In the context of rural Northern KwaZulu-Natal, three types of THPs were identified: 1) Isangoma (diviner); 2) Inyanga (one who focuses on traditional medical remedies) and 3) Umthandazi (faith healer). Findings revealed that THPs are called by ancestors to become healers and/or go through an intensive process of learning about traditional medicines including plant, animal or mineral substances to provide health care. Some THPs identified themselves primarily as one type of healer, while most occupied multiple healing categories, that is, they practiced across different healing types. Our study also demonstrates that THPs fulfil roles that are not specific to the type of healer they are, these include services that go beyond the uses of herbs for physical illnesses or divination. Conclusions: THPs serve roles which include, but are not limited to, being custodians of traditional African religion and customs, educators about culture, counsellors, mediators and spiritual protectors. THPs' mode specific roles are influenced by the processes by which they become healers. However, whichever type of healer they identified as, most THPs used similar, generic methods and practices to focus on the physical, spiritual, cultural, psychological, emotional and social elements of illness.

AB  - About 1·3 million people died of tuberculosis in 2012, despite availability of effective drug treatment. Barriers to improvements in outcomes include long treatment duration (resulting in poor patient adherence and loss of patients to follow-up), complex regimens that involve expensive and toxic drugs, toxic effects when given with antiretroviral therapy, and multidrug resistance. After 50 years of no antituberculosis drug development, a promising pipeline is emerging through the repurposing of old drugs, re-engineering of existing antibacterial compounds, and discovery of new compounds. A range of novel antituberculosis drugs are in preclinical development, several phase 2 and 3 trials are underway, and use of adjunct therapies is being explored for drug-sensitive and drug-resistant tuberculosis. Historical advances include approval of two new drugs, delamanid and bedaquiline. Combinations of new and existing drugs are being assessed to shorten the duration of therapy and to treat multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. There has also been progress in development of new antituberculosis drugs that are active against dormant or persister populations of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In this Review, we discuss recent advances in antituberculosis drug discovery and development, clinical trial designs, laboratory methods, and adjunct host-directed therapies, and we provide an update of phase 3 trials of various fluoroquinolones (RIFAQUIN, NIRT, OFLOTUB, and REMoxTB). We also emphasise the need to engage the community in design, implementation, and uptake of research, to increase international cooperation between drug developers and health-care providers adopting new regimens.

AB  - The genetics of many heritable disorders are not well understood due to the complex relationship between multiple genes and the environment. Psychiatric disorders are particularly interesting in this respect as they are modulated by multiple genetic factors while remaining susceptible to environmental stimuli. The environment of prenatal and/or early postnatal developmental periods is one such stimulus, and it is dependent on the maternal genotype. If genetic variability alters maternal physiology and behavior during this time, then we postulate that the overall genetic impact on the offspring is measured by the effect produced by the transmitted genes as well as by the effect produced by the maternal environment induced by those genes. This is the basic premise of our Dual Impact Model, which applies this supposition to offspring disease susceptibility. Using two mouse lines, one a model of a human disorder, the Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), and the other a mouse lacking the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), we generated both littermate and non-littermate wild type and knockout mice, allowing us to discern between genetic and environmental influences on behavior. We found that parental-genotype dependent modifications of the environment contribute to life-long behavioral changes in offspring. The convergence of the offspring and maternal genotype dependent effects likely leads to the full phenotype associated with a genetic abnormality/variability. This has potential implications in the treatment of genetic disorders as targeting the mechanisms of offspring genotype-dependent phenotypes may not be sufficient to relieve all symptoms. In these cases, a dual target approach is necessary. Strikingly, some disease-associated behaviors were frequently observed in genetically unaffected offspring, indicating that these parental genotype-dependent environmental effects can increase disease susceptibility in genetically unaffected offspring. The importance of the maternal genotype on modulating environmental stimuli is further supported by cross-fostering experiments showing that pre and/or postnatal maternal genotype effects (depending on the strain) are sufficient to modify adult behavior of genetically normal animals. These findings bring to attention the need to better understand the epigenetic mechanisms by which certain environmental stimuli exert their effects so that inadvertent programming of offspring behavioral processes can be avoided.

AB  - Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) is a cytokine that not only coordinates local and systemic immune responses {[}1, 2] but also regulates neuronal functions. Most prominently, glia-derived TNF-alpha has been shown to regulate homeostatic synaptic scaling {[}3-6], but TNF-alpha-null mice exhibited no apparent cognitive or emotional abnormalities. Instead, we found a TNF-alpha-dependent intergenerational effect, as mothers with a deficit in TNF-alpha programmed their offspring to exhibit low innate fear. Cross-fostering and conditional knockout experiments indicated that a TNF-alpha deficit in the maternal brain, rather than in the hematopoietic system, and during gestation was responsible for the low-fear offspring phenotype. The level of innate fear governs the balance between exploration/foraging and avoidance of predators and is thus fundamentally important in adaptation, fitness, and survival {[}7]. Because maternal exercise and activity are known to reduce both brain TNF-alpha {[}8] and offspring innate fear {[}9], whereas maternal stress has been reported to increase brain TNF-alpha {[}10] and offspring fear and anxiety {[}11, 12], maternal brain TNF-alpha may report environmental conditions to promote offspring behavioral adaptation to their anticipated postnatal environment.

AB  - The term 'brittle diabetes' describes a subtype of instable type-I diabetes, characterized by high variations of blood sugar without any evident cause and despite careful clinical management. Clear guidelines for a precise definition of the condition are still lacking; this fosters insecurities concerning diagnosis and therapy of the disease. Psychosocial influences, triggering these conditions, were discussed. The patient-doctor-relationship appears to be tensed due to an often missing compliance. Using a paradigmatic case study as background, the specific diagnostic and therapeutic problems in brittle diabetes were presented. Brittle diabetes advocates a close cooperation between internal and psychosomatic medicine units and a combination of patient education and psychotherapy. Seen under a psychosomatic paradigm, brittle diabetes can be detected early and effective treatment may avoid further complications in these young patients.

AB  - Highlights • This study aimed to assess validity and reliability of a short version of the ASI-3. • The Short Scale Anxiety Sensitivity Index (SSASI) had good internal consistency. • There was evidence of excellent convergent and discriminant validity. • There was also evidence of full measurement invariance across time. Abstract Anxiety sensitivity, defined as the fear of anxiety and arousal-related sensations, has been among the most influential cognitive-based transdiagnostic risk and maintenance factors in the study and treatment of emotional and related disorders. The currently available anxiety sensitivity measures are limited by their length. Specifically, the length of these instruments discourages the adoption of routine anxiety sensitivity assessment in clinical or medical settings (e.g., primary care). The goals of this study were to develop and assess the validity and reliability of a short version of the Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3 (ASI-3; Taylor et al., 2007), entitled the Short Scale Anxiety Sensitivity Index (SSASI), using three independent clinical samples. Results indicated that the abbreviated five-item version of the SSASI had good internal consistency and a robust association with the ASI-3. Further, across the samples, there was evidence of unidimensionality and excellent convergent and discriminant validity. There also was evidence of partial measurement invariance across sex and full measurement invariance across time. Overall, the five-item scale offers a single score that can be employed to measure anxiety sensitivity. Use of the SSASI may facilitate screening efforts and symptom tracking for anxiety sensitivity, particularly within clinical settings where practical demands necessitate the use of brief assessment instruments.

AB  - The issue of balance between research and treatment in clinical trials conduct has been surrounded by controversies. Scientific characteristics of trials may compromise medical care available to participants, while conceiving research participation as having therapeutic value may foster the therapeutic misconception. However, it has also been questioned whether research can and should always be separated from medical care provision. In this paper we analyze how these concerns played out in practice settings of the three trial sites in Russia, specialized in trials in cardiovascular diseases. Using in-depth interviews with participants of phase II and III trials (n = 21) and discussions with physician-investigators (n = 7), we found that trial enrollment allowed participants to establish continuous supportive relationships with the physician-investigators. In the context of unresponsive health care, chronically ill participants received regular monitoring, treatment recommendations and help in case of problems and emergencies through such relationships. The trial designs in the three sites did not preclude the provision of individualized treatment. We suggest that debates about the research/treatment interface in trials need to become more attuned to the conditions in locations of their conduct, views and experiences of actors involved and evolving trial methodologies. Too much focus on categorical differentiation of research and treatment may obscure the fact that globalizing clinical trials proceed amidst profound health disparities, dismiss diverse concerns of people on the ground and risk attenuating responsibilities of trial organizers, sponsors and investigators towards research participants.

AB  - Background: Despite a burgeoning interest in using interprofessional approaches to promote effective collaboration in health care, systematic reviews find scant evidence of benefit. This protocol describes the first cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) to design and evaluate an intervention intended to improve interprofessional collaborative communication and patient-centred care. Objectives: The objective is to evaluate the effects of a four-component, hospital-based staff communication protocol designed to promote collaborative communication between healthcare professionals and enhance patient-centred care. Methods: The study is a multi-centre mixed-methods cluster randomized controlled trial involving twenty clinical teaching teams (CTTs) in general internal medicine (GIM) divisions of five Toronto tertiary-care hospitals. CTTs will be randomly assigned either to receive an intervention designed to improve interprofessional collaborative communication, or to continue usual communication practices. Non-participant naturalistic observation, shadowing, and semi-structured, qualitative interviews were conducted to explore existing patterns of interprofessional collaboration in the CTTs, and to support intervention development. Interviews and shadowing will continue during intervention delivery in order to document interactions between the intervention settings and adopters, and changes in interprofessional communication. The primary outcome is the rate of unplanned hospital readmission. Secondary outcomes are length of stay (LOS); adherence to evidence-based prescription drug therapy; patients' satisfaction with care; self-report surveys of CTT staff perceptions of interprofessional collaboration; and frequency of calls to paging devices. Outcomes will be compared on an intention-to-treat basis using adjustment methods appropriate for data from a cluster randomized design. Discussion: Pre-intervention qualitative analysis revealed that a substantial amount of interprofessional interaction lacks key core elements of collaborative communication such as selfintroduction, description of professional role, and solicitation of other professional perspectives. Incorporating these findings, a four-component intervention was designed with a goal of creating a culture of communication in which the fundamentals of collaboration become a routine part of interprofessional interactions during unstructured work periods on GIM wards.

AB  - Given the current Canadian focus on child support policy and its link to child poverty, it is important that a broad framework of underlying policy issues be identified in order to evaluate proposed reforms. The effects and goals of each child support reform must be placed within an ideological framework and evaluated based on whether it reflects an appropriate distribution of the economic consequences of the separation of parents, recognizes the relationship between the family and the state in providing for the costs of raising children, and promotes women's economic independence and substantive equality. The author identifies and discusses six major themes in family, income security, and income tax literature on child support policy choices: child support versus family support; balancing public and private strategies; the concept of the "monolithic" family and promoting women's economic independence; the value of women's work, direct and indirect child rearing costs, and lost opportunity costs; listening to women's voices from all communities; and integrating family, income security, and income taxation policy goals and effects. Without a broader theoretical perspective, reforms risk failing outright, creating non-congruence in family, income tax, and income security policy or focusing solely on the private solution of increasing support payments. This latter strategy has the potential for exacerbating the segregation of women within the private/family sphere of activity. Other complementary or alternative public approaches, such as universal advanced maintenance programs, a guaranteed income, or reform of the income tax system, would be abandoned.

Les effets et les buts de chaque réforme touchant les aliments des enfants doivent être situés dans un cadre idéologique et l'on doit les évaluer en se demandant si la proposition de réforme reflète une répartition adéquate des conséquences économiques de la séparation des parents, si elle reconnaît la relation entre la famille et l'État quant au paiement des frais engagés pour l'éducation des enfants et si elle favorise l'indépendance économique et l'égalité véritable des femmes.

AB  - The authors discuss the growing need for primary care residents to learn how to care for patients of many cultural backgrounds. To effectively learn the needed skills, residents must incorporate insights from areas outside medicine. The authors focus on three such areas: cultural competency, public health, and community-oriented primary care. Regarding cultural competency, the authors make clear that on the one hand, physicians must be trained to be sensitive to cultural differences and patterns, but on the other, they cannot be expected to know the many cultures of their patients in depth. They discuss the Core Curriculum Guidelines on Culturally Sensitive and Competent Health Care created by the Society of Teachers of Family Medicine. Regarding community-oriented primary care (COPC), a process introduced from Europe in 1982, the authors state char one of its key elements is to provide accessible care to diverse and often underserved populations. However, various factors have kept COPC, and the federally funded community health centers that address the concerns of COPC, from having the widespread effects they could have. Regarding public health, the authors review the various services and orientations of public health and show how these help foster care for diverse populations. The authors then briefly describe their own residency program and its work with diverse populations. They conclude by emphasizing the importance for residents of learning the principles and practices embodied in cultural competency, public health, and COPC in order to effectively communicate with their patients.

AB  - Background: The concepts of medication adherence and Treatment satisfactions are commonly used in clinical research for assessing pharmaceutical care and improving treatment outcomes. Generally, one would expect a positive relationship between the two concepts. The objectives of this study were to investigate the factors associated with adherence to antihypertensive therapy among hypertensive patients and to assess the relationship between antihypertensive medication adherence and treatment satisfaction. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted, adopting the Morisky eight-item Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS) for the assessment of medication adherence and using the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM 1.4) for the assessment of treatment satisfaction. Descriptive and comparative statistics were used to describe sociodemographic and disease-related characteristics of the patients. All analyses were performed using SPSS v 15.0. Results: Four hundred and ten hypertensive patients were enrolled in the study. The mean age of participants was 58.38 ± 10.65 years; 52% were female and 36.8% had low antihypertensive medication adherence. There was a significant difference in the mean scores in the Effectiveness (p < 0.001), Convenience (p < 0.001), and Global Satisfaction (p < 0.001) domains, but not in the Side Effects (p = 0.466) domain among patients with different levels of adherence. After adjustment for covariates using multiple linear regression, global treatment satisfaction was still statistically significantly (p = 0.001) associated with medication adherence. Conclusions: Low treatment satisfaction may be an important barrier for achieving high rates of adherence to treatment. These study findings could be helpful in clinical practice, mainly in the early treatment of hypertensive patients, at a point where improving treatment satisfaction is still possible.

AB  - Chronic physical illness burdens children and their families with organic and functional problems, repeated medical visits, complicated tests, frequent hospitalizations, uncertainty about the future and complex secondary psychological, social and educational problems. Purpose: The purpose of the present study was the presentation and the critical approach to the adjustment difficulties of a child with chronic disease (7-11 years) and of its family as recorded in Greece and internationally. Material and Methods: In this review, the methodology followed included specialized electronic search of articles in PubMed, in international and Greek biomedical journals that explore the process of adaptation of children to chronic diseases such as asthma, diabetes, thalassemia, cardiovascular diseases and neoplasms using special keywords e.g. chronic physical illness, chronic disease and family, child and chronic disease. There were 29 foreign articles and 16 greek ones during the last fifteen years. Results: Children with chronic physical diseases face psycho-emotional difficulties (depression, increased anxiety), behavioural disorders (hyperactivity, social isolation) and learning difficulties. Their families are equally affected by chronic disease on multiple levels as their cohesion is disrupted as well as the emotional relationships between them, the roles they should adopt towards the new situation (difficulties between the couple and the siblings). This situation in Greece highlights major problems and failures that require immediate attention (on grants and donations to associations, insurance providers, staffing and operation of hospital units, public awareness, etc.) Conclusions: The comprehensive treatment of the effects of chronic physical illness, both medical and psychosocial in level, requires the provision of comprehensive care through coordinated medical, psychological, educational and social services. Η χρόνια σωματική ασθένεια επιβαρύνει τα παιδιά και την οικογένειά τους με οργανικά και λειτουργικά προβλήματα, επανειλημμένες ιατρικές επισκέψεις, πολύπλοκες εξετάσεις, συχνές νοσηλείες, αβεβαιότητα για το μέλλον και σύνθετα δευτερογενή ψυχολογικά, κοινωνικά και εκπαιδευτικά προβλήματα. Σκοπός: Σκοπός της παρούσας ανασκόπησης ήταν η παρουσίαση και κριτική προσέγγιση των δυσκολιών προσαρμογής του παιδιού με χρόνιο νόσημα (7-11 ετών) αλλά και του οικογενειακού του περιβάλλοντος όπως καταγράφονται διεθνώς και στην Ελλάδα. Υλικό και μέθοδος: Στη παρούσα ανασκόπηση η μεθοδολογία που ακολουθήθηκε περιλάμβανε εξειδικευμένη ηλεκτρονική αναζήτηση άρθρων στο PubMed, σε διεθνή και ελληνικά βιο-ιατρικά περιοδικά που διερευνούν την διαδικασία προσαρμογής των παιδιών σε χρόνιες νόσους όπως το Άσθμα, ο Σακχαρώδης Διαβήτης, η Μεσογειακή αναιμία, οι Καρδιαγγειακές νόσοι και τα Νεοπλάσματα χρησιμοποιώντας ειδικές λέξεις-κλειδιά π. χ χρόνιο σωματικό νόσημα, χρόνια ασθένεια κι οικογένεια, παιδί και χρόνια ασθένεια. Ανευρέθηκαν 29 ξενόγλωσσα άρθρα και 16 ελληνικά της τελευταίας δεκαπενταετίας. Αποτελέσματα: Τα παιδιά με χρόνια σωματική νόσο αντιμετωπίζουν ψυχοσυναισθηματικές δυσκολίες (κατάθλιψη, αυξημένο άγχος) διαταραχές στη συμπεριφορά (υπερκινητικότητα, κοινωνική απομόνωση) και προβλήματα στη μαθησιακή τους επίδοση. Οι οικογένειές τους επηρεάζονται εξίσου από τη χρόνια νόσο του παιδιού σε πολλαπλά επίπεδα καθώς διαταράσσεται η συνοχή τους καθώς κι οι μεταξύ τους συναισθηματικές σχέσεις, οι ρόλοι που καλούνται να υιοθετήσουν απέναντι στα νέα δεδομένα (δυσκολίες στα αδέλφια και ανάμεσα στο ζευγάρι). H κατάσταση στην Ελλάδα αναδεικνύει σημαντικά προβλήματα και παραλείψεις οι οποίες ζητούν άμεση αντιμετώπιση (θέμα επιχορηγήσεων και δωρεών στους συλλόγους, παροχές ασφαλιστικών φορέων, στελέχωση και λειτουργία νοσηλευτικών μονάδων, ενημέρωση κοινού κ.α.). Συμπεράσματα: Η ολοκληρωμένη αντιμετώπιση των επιπτώσεων της χρόνιας σωματικής ασθένειας, τόσο σε ιατρικό όσο και σε ψυχοκοινωνικό επίπεδο, απαιτεί την παροχή ολοκληρωμένης φροντίδας μέσω συντονισμένων ιατρικών, ψυχολογικών, εκπαιδευτικών και κοινωνικών υπηρεσιών.

AB  - Both Greek and international literature suggest there is an increase in STDs worldwide, something that has motivated health agencies to design health promotion strategies. Aim: The aim of the present study was to assess knowledge and attitudes of women regarding STDs, as well as to correlate the findings with their sexual activity and gynecologic symptoms. Materials and Methods: Our reference population comprised of women residing in the city of Corinth. A specialized, valid and anonymous questionnaire was used, that included items concerning gynecologic diseases, STDs, prevention measures and birth control methods. Data collection took place from March to May 2013 and the SPSS 17.0 was used for the statistical analysis. Results: The majority of our sample (n=214) consisted of women aged 20 or younger (40.2%), without children (65.1%). 56.7% of the participants initiated sexual relationships at age 18 or older, while 55.2% said they always used condoms. Regarding STD history, 76.40% reported no such history. 67% thought that condoms were the safest birth control method, 64.4% said that casual relationships were the main cause for STD infections, 47.1% said that Pap tests should be done after menstruation, and 65.1% that mammograms should be a routine examination after the age of 30. Also, 65.4% of the participants said they consulted their gynecologist for anything regarding prevention examinations or gynecologic conditions. Conclusions: Despite some limitations, the present study concludes that many, mainly younger, women lack important information on such subjects and adopt high-risk behaviors. Consequently, the implementation of targeted, nation-wide sexual health programs and pre-symptomatic testing is deemed necessary.

Σκοπός: της μελέτης ήταν η διερεύνηση των γνώσεων και των στάσεων των γυναικών απέναντι στα Σεξουαλικώς Μεταδιδόμενα Νοσήματα, καθώς και η συσχέτιση των αποτελεσμάτων με τη σεξουαλική τους δραστηριότητα και την εμφάνιση συμπτωμάτων γυναικολογικών παθήσεων. Υλικό και Μέθοδος: Ο πληθυσμός της μελέτης ήταν γυναίκες όλων των ηλικιών που κατοικούν στην πόλη της Κορίνθου. Χρησιμοποιήθηκε εξειδικευμένο, έγκυρο και ανώνυμο ερωτηματολόγιο, που περιλάμβανε ερωτήσεις σχετικά με τις γνώσεις και στάσεις για τα γυναικολογικά νοσήματα, τα Σεξουαλικώς Μεταδιδόμενα Νοσήματα, τα μέτρα πρόληψης και τις μεθόδους αντισύλληψης. Η συλλογή των δεδομένων πραγματοποιήθηκε από το Μάρτιο ως το Μάιο του 2013 και η στατιστική ανάλυση των δεδομένων έγινε με το πρόγραμμα SPSS 17.0. Αποτελέσματα: Η πλειοψηφία του δείγματος (n=214) αποτελείτο από γυναίκες μικρότερες από 20 ετών (40.2%), χωρίς παιδιά (65.1%), Το 56.7% των γυναικών ξεκίνησαν σεξουαλικές επαφές σε ηλικία άνω των 18 χρονών, ενώ το 55.2% δήλωσε ότι κάνει πάντα χρήση προφυλακτικού. Όσον αφορά το ιστορικό λοιμώξεων από Σεξουαλικώς Μεταδιδόμενα Νοσήματα, το 76.4% απάντησε πως δεν είχε κάποιο τέτοιο πρόβλημα. Το φιλικό περιβάλλον αποτελεί το κύρια πηγή πληροφόρησης για θέματα σεξ, σε ποσοστό 52.9%. Το 67% θεωρεί πως το προφυλακτικό είναι η πιο ασφαλής μέθοδος αντισύλληψης, το 64.4% θεωρεί πως οι ελεύθερες σεξουαλικές σχέσεις χωρίς προφύλαξη είναι η κύρια αιτία για τις λοιμώξεις με Σεξουαλικώς Μεταδιδόμενα Νοσήματα, το 47.1% θεωρεί πως το τεστ ΠΑΠ πρέπει να γίνεται μετά την εμμηνορρυσία, το 65.1% ότι μετά τα 30 έτη πρέπει να γίνεται η μαστογραφία και το 50.9% δηλώνει ως ασφαλέστερο έλεγχο των μαστών τον συνδυασμό μαστογραφίας, υπέρηχου μαστών και ψηλάφησης, με το 11.4% του δείγματος να δηλώνει άγνοια περί προληπτικού ελέγχου για καρκίνο του μαστού. Επίσης, το 65.4% του δείγματος δήλωσε ότι συμβουλεύεται για τον προληπτικό έλεγχο και τις γυναικολογικές παθήσεις το γυναικολόγο τους. Συμπεράσματα: Από την παρούσα μελέτη, αναδεικνύεται η ελλιπής γνώση και την ύπαρξη επικίνδυνων σεξουαλικών συμπεριφορών από ικανό ποσοστό γυναικών, κυρίως νέων στην ηλικία. Συνεπώς, η εφαρμογή στοχευμένων εθνικών προγραμμάτων αγωγής σεξουαλικής υγείας και προσυμπτωματικού ελέγχου κρίνεται απαραίτητη.

AB  - Background. The increased number of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is observed worldwide today. Ambiguity of the reasons that cause the disorder, lack of the possibility to render effective medical care make actual the need of non-HCP (according to medical research full treatment cannot be found). The solution of this problem is possible by using effective mechanisms of child training in the society. The Objective is to develop the complex model for ASD children rehabilitation in preschool education based on the analysis of various correction methods that are widely used in the USA Europe and Russia. There considered are possibilities and limitations, and their application in preschool education. Design. The authors consider their own model for ASD children rehabilitation based on the direct practical experience with a specific ASD child suffering. The conditions for adopting this model in preschool education are described: creating a special environment that allows to compensate for missing skills and facilitate the child adaptation, psychological and educational support of all subjects of inclusive education, and teamwork of experts of different profiles (teacher, psychologist, speech therapist, and speech pathologist). Results. Based on the analysis of foreign and domestic experience of rehabilitation, a comprehensive model for the rehabilitation of the ASD child in the conditions of an educational organization has been developed. The construction of the individual rehabilitation route of the ASD child considers specific features of mutism, child's adaptation and behaviour, the accompanying disturbances complicating the development process, background and needs of the family, and also resources of the educational organization. The rehabilitation work emphasizes the development of the emotional sphere and communication skills. Conclusion. Rehabilitation work with the ASD child in the conditions of the educational organization will be effective if to carry out it by the group of experts in the following ways: correctional work with the ASD child, work with peers, work with teachers and parental support. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Актуальность. Во всем мире наблюдается рост числа детей с расстройствами аутистического спектра (РАС). Неоднозначность причин, вызывающих данное нарушение развития, отсутствие возможности оказания эффективной медицинской помощи (по данным медицинских исследований полное излечение от аутизма не представляется возможным) актуализирует необходимость поиска немедикаментозных способов компенсации проявлений болезни. Решение данной задачи возможно при определении эффективных механизмов обучения ребенка жизни в социуме. Цель исследования - разработка комплексной модели реабилитации детей, имеющих РАС в условиях дошкольной образовательной организации на основе анализа различных методов коррекции РАС, получившие распространение в США, Европе и России. Рассматриваются возможности и ограничения их применения в условиях дошкольной образовательной организации. Описание хода исследования. Авторы рассматривают собственную модель реабилитации ребенка с РАС, созданную на основе использования непосредственного практического опыта работы с конкретным ребенком, страдающим аутическим расстройством. Описываются условия реализации этой модели в условиях дошкольного образования: создание специально организованной среды, позволяющей компенсировать отсутствующие навыки и облегчить адаптацию ребенка, психолого-педагогическое сопровождение всех субъектов инклюзивного образования и командная работа с ребенком с РАС специалистов разного профиля (педагога-психолога, логопеда, дефектолога). Результаты. На основе анализа зарубежного и отечественного опыта реабилитации разработана комплексная модель реабилитации ребенка с РАС в условиях образовательной организации. В построении индивидуального реабилитационного маршрута ребенка с РАС учтена специфика имеющегося нарушения (мутизм), особенности его адаптации и поведения, сопутствующие нарушения, осложняющие ход развития, возможности и потребности семьи, а также ресурсы образовательной организации. Основные акценты в реабилитационной работе сделаны на развитии эмоциональной сферы и коммуникативных навыков. Выводы. Реабилитационная работа с ребенком с РАС в условиях образовательной организации будет эффективной, если ее проводить комплексно группой специалистов по четырем основным направлениям: коррекционная работа с ребенком, развивающая работа со сверстниками, просветительская работа с педагогами и поддержка родителей такого ребенка.

AB  - The article considers the challenges for the development of the theory of family education as one of the youngest and most promising branches of the contemporary science. Today’s relevance of this theory is directly related to the transformations of the Russian society in the last decades, which had a great impact on the family ideology in general and changed the goals, objectives, content and methods of family education in particular. The theorists of the family education intensified the search for a new selfdetermination and a new identity for the Russian family as an educational institution. Under such conditions, the theory of family education adopts the conceptual findings and relevant ideas of other social sciences to develop methodology and techniques of raising and educating children in the family context. The article considers the sources of such ideas in the particular theories in the field of pedagogy, psychology, sociology, cultural studies, economics and informatics. The author identifies and briefly characterizes three groups of different social theories that contribute to a deeper understanding of the goals of family education: pedagogical theories (of free education, self-determination, self-education, culturally appropriate education,ecological education, assimilation and accommodation, pedagogy of cooperation, programmed teaching, pedagogical empiricism, and pedagogical education focused on children), psychological theories (of step-by-step formation of mental actions, personality, adaptation, affiliation, interpersonal interactions, activity mediation of interpersonal relationships, isolation, and imitation), and sociological theories (of globalization, social capital, information, social inequality, social risks, power sharing, gender, rational choice, synergetics, small groups, and mass communications). (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Статья посвящена проблеме развития теории семейного воспитания как одного из молодых и перспективных научных направлений. Актуализация этой теории напрямую связана с проис- ходящими в российском обществе в последние десятилетия трансформациями, которые привели к изменению семейной идеологии в целом, в том числе целей, задач, содержания и методов семей- ного воспитания. Среди теоретиков-фамилистов активизировался поиск нового самоопределения и новой идентичности российской семьи как воспитательного института. В этих условиях теория семейного воспитания использует, в частности, концептуальные положения других социальных наук, заимствуя из них идеи для развития методологии и методики воспитания детей в пространстве семьи. В качестве источников заимствования таких идей в статье рассматриваются отдельные теории из области педагогики, психологии, социологии, культурологии, экономики и информатики. Автор выделяет и кратко характеризует три группы различных социальных теорий, способствующих более глубокому пониманию целей семейного воспитания: педагогические теории (свободного воспитания, самоопределения, самообразования, культуросообразности воспитания, природосо- образности воспитания, самовоспитания, ассимиляции и аккомодации, педагогики сотрудничества, программирования обучения, педагогического эмпиризма, детоцентризма, педагогического вос- питания), психологические теории (поэтапного формирования умственных действий, личности, адаптации, аффилиации, межличностных взаимодействий, деятельностного опосредования меж- личностных отношений, обособления, подражания) и социологические теории (глобализации, социального капитала, информации, социального неравенства, социальных рисков, разделения власти, гендера, рационального выбора, синергетики, малых групп, массовых коммуникаций).

AB  - Pre-exposure prophylaxis of HIV infection (PREP) the world health organization (WHO) and the joint United Nations programme on HIV/AIDS (UN AIDS) are now seen as a promising undertaking whose widespread adoption, along with the Treatment as prevention strategy, should halt the HIV pandemic. The basis for the development of the prep method and the study of its effectiveness were data on the effectiveness and safety of actively used methods of prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and post-exposure prevention of HIV infection. Closed and open randomized trials conducted in different regions of the world have shown the effectiveness of prep in groups of men who have sex with men (MSM), heterosexual men and women, and injecting drug users. Shows close relationship of the effectiveness of the PREP with the commitment of the participants in the study receiving used for prevention of drugs. Currently, the OST is becoming more widespread, mainly among MSM in economically developed countries. In Russia, the recommendations for the prep are given in the recommendations for the treatment of HIV infection and related diseases approved by the Plenum of the Board of the National scientific society of infectious diseases on 14.09.2018. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Доконтактная профилактика ВИЧ-инфекции (ДКП) в настоящее время рассматривается Всемирной организацией здравоохранения (ВОЗ) и Объединенной программой ООН по ВИЧ/СПИДу (UN AIDS) как перспективное мероприятие, повсеместное внедрение которого, наряду со стратегией «Лечение как профилактика», должно остановить пандемию ВИЧ-инфекции. Основанием для разработка метода ДКП и изучения его эффективности стали данные об эффектив- ности и безопасности активно применяемых методов профилактики передачи ВИЧ от матери ребенку и постконтакт- ной профилактики ВИЧ-инфекции. Проведенные в разных регионах мира закрытые и открытые рандомизированные исследования показали эффективность ДКП в группах мужчин, имеющих секс с мужчинами (МСМ), гетеросексуаль- ных мужчин и женщин, потребителей инъекционных наркотиков. Показана тесная связь эффективности ДКП с при- верженностью участников исследования приему применяемых для профилактики препаратов. В настоящее время ДКП получает все более широкое распространение, преимущественно среди МСМ в экономически развитых странах. В России рекомендации по проведению ДКП приведены в одобренных 14.09.2018 пленумом правления Национального научного общества инфекционистов Рекомендациях по лечению ВИЧ-инфекции и связанных с ней заболеваний.

AB  - Objective. Study of the risk factors for non-compliance with treatment of HIV-infected women from 4 CIS countries. Materials and methods. Results of a questionnaire of 380 women are reported. The average age of respondents was 35.4 years, 70% of women had secondary or advanced education, 42.1% worked, 40.1% were housewives. The period of living with HIV averaged 4.7 years, 42.6% of women had been living with HIV for 5 years or more. Results. The respondents from Uzbekistan considered the risks related to personal barriers (22.7%), fears and concerns related to family members (22.7%), memory and attention (18.2%) to be the most significant. The respondents from Kyrgyzstan had fears associated with a change in family relations (50%), interruption of ART deliveries (16.7%), drug side effects (11.1%). The respondents from Belarus considered the use of psychoactive substances (25%), limit access to ART (25%), memory and attention (25%) to be the most significant. In Armenia, 27.3% of respondents identified memory and attention as risks, 27.3% were afraid of side effects from drugs, 18.2% identified «stress» and «emotions». Conclusion. Questionnaire is an affordable practical method for identifying the risks of non-compliance with treatment. The multimodality of the identified risks of non-compliance requires the adoption and implementation of a multi-professional approach to minimize them. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Цель исследования. Изучение факторов риска нарушения приверженности лечению у ВИЧ-инфицированных женщин из 4 стран СНГ. Материалы и методы. Представлены результаты анкетирования 380 женщин. Средний возраст опрошенных - 35,4 года, 70% женщин имели среднее или среднее специальное образование, 42,1% работали, 40,1% были домохозяйками. Стаж жизни с диагнозом «ВИЧ-инфекция» составил в среднем 4,7 года, 42,6% женщин жили с ВИЧ 5 лет и более. Результаты. Для респонденток из Узбекистана наибольшее значение имели риски, связанные с личными барьерами пациенток (22,7%); страхами и опасениями, связанными с членами семьи (22,7%); памятью и вниманием (18,2%). У респонденток из Кыргызстана страхи и опасения, связанные с изменением отношений в семье, составили 50%; связанные с перебоями АРТ - 16,7%; опасения по поводу побочных эффектов от лекарств - 11,1%. Для респонденток из Беларуси наибольшее значение имели употребление психоактивных веществ (25%), опасения ограничения доступа к АРТ (25%), память и внимание (25%). В Армении память и внимание в качестве рисков выделили 27,3% респонденток, 27,3% опасались побочных эффектов от лекарств; «стресс», «эмоции» отметили 18,2% респонденток. Заключение. Анкетирование является доступным практическим инструментом для выявления рисков нарушения приверженности лечению. Мультимодальность выявленных рисков нарушения приверженности требует принятия и внедрения мультипрофессионального подхода для их минимизации.

AB  - Currently in the world there is no universal scientifically based criteria system aimed at assessing the dangers of waste. There are two waste classification systems adopted in Russia: SP 2.1.7.1386-03 on the degree of the impact on the environment and human health wastes are divided into 4 hazard classes; Criteria of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MNRE) of the Russian Federation on the degree of the negative impact of wastes on the environment are divided into 5 classes of danger. In the Russian practice in all areas of toxicology and health care, in justifying the MAC in the fishery waters 4 classes of dangerous substances are used. The least dangerous substances are referred to class 4 of danger, “a little dangerous.” Any chemical substance under certain conditions can have adverse effects on human health and nature. Introduction of hazard class V in Criteria MPR is contrary to the generally accepted concepts and practice of evaluation of substances. Examples of differences in the contents of two documents are given, indicating the intention of the authors of MPR Criteria to reduce the requirements for waste treatment conditions. The MNRE Criteria miss the very concept and method of the evaluation of substances that have carcinogenic properties. The SP 2.1.7.1386-03 in case of the presence in waste of substances with proven carcinogenicity for humans, assigns to the waste component the highest value of the danger index, other indices may not be considered. This approach is not proposed in MNRE Criteria. They completely ignore results of basic research, which showed the lack of the regular toxicity relationship for bioassays and mammals. MNRE criteria cannot be regarded as the only document on the determination of the waste hazard class. It is necessary to create a universal document to determine the hazard class of waste in production and consumption, ensuring safe conditions of human life and protection of the natural environment. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] В статье приведены примеры различий между двумя принятыми в России системами классификации отхо- дов: в СП 2.1.7.1386-03 по степени воздействия на среду обитания и здоровье человека отходы разделены на четыре класса опасности; в «Критериях отнесения отходов к I-V классам опасности по степени негатив- ного воздействия на окружающую среду” Минприроды России, или Критериях МПР, по степени негативного воздействия на окружающую среду отходы разделены на пять классов опасности (V класс - практически безопасные вещества). В российской практике во всех областях санитарной токсикологии и гигиены при обосновании ПДК веществ в водоемах рыбохозяйственного назначения используются четыре класса опасности веществ и наименее опасные из них отнесены к 4-му классу - “малоопасным” (но не “неопасным”) веществам, Введение V класса опасности в Критериях МПР противоречит общепринятым понятиям и практике оценки веществ. Приведены примеры различий в содержании двух документов, свидетельству- ющие о стремлении авторов Критериев МПР снизить требования к обращению с отходами. В Критериях МПР отсутствуют само понятие и метод оценки веществ, обладающих канцерогенными свойствами. В СП 2.1.7.1386-03 при наличии в составе отходов веществ с доказанной для человека канцерогенностью компоненту отхода присваивается наивысшее значение показателя опасности, остальные показатели могут не учитываться. Такой подход не предусмотрен в Критериях МПР. В них полностью игнорируются результаты фундаментальных исследований, которые показали отсутствие закономерной связи токсичности для биотестов и млекопитающих. Сделан вывод о том, что Критерии МПР не могут рассматриваться как единственный документ по определению класса опасности отходов. Необходимо создание единого документа по определению класса опасности отходов производства и потребления, обеспечивающего безопасные условия жизни человека и охраны природной среды.

AB  - The article presents the empirical and theoretical foundations of experimental work to determine the effectiveness of game practice as a remedial and preventive resource in psychological work. A game program composed of traditional (folklore) games is presented. The program is considered as the basis of a lively gaming cultural environment with a high correctional and preventive potential. The goal of the program is early prevention of a tendency toward deviant behavior in preschool children. The main parameters of the level of social and communicative development of a child, on which the tendency to deviant behavior depends, are defined: the ability to follow the rules, the ability to interact, emotional stability, the ability to maintain friendly relationships in the group. The measurement indicators of the adopted parameters are highlighted in the framework of the relevant diagnostic methods.

AB  - One of the most obscure yet appealing issues within the field of psychoanalytic thinking, from the standpoint of interpretation as an interventive tool and as an explanative stance, is the domain of psychotic development, or the development of psychotic states. Addressing the presumed “infantile catastrophe" of the psychotic individual, Wilfred R. Bion coined the term “alpha-function in reverse" (1962, 1970). By this term Bion meant to refer to the annihilation of the mutual, reciprocal relationship between primary and secondary thinking processes, in which first the mother and then the child learn to be able to be recipients of emotional data, initially basic and raw (beta elements), that they subsequently learn to encode by naming. This gradual process soon enables the budding mind to be able to dream, think, and to experience thought as thought. in Bion's view, this development does not take place, at least not sufficiently, in the psychotic mind. in contemporary analytic writing, Piera Aulagnier addresses several additional factors that may foretell the potential for, or toward, psychoses. The first is the absence of the father–literally, sometimes, but primarily as a symbolic agent–from the discourse of the “word-bearer" (the mother). This primary absence leaves the infant exposed to the incestuous contents that the mother was herself unable to repress (in principle, even a physically present father who is unable to serve in this symbolic function does not sufficiently serve in this critical shielding function). The second factor is the mother's failure to repress her incestuous wishes that are directed at her own mother. What such a mother secretly desires is indeed not the birth of a new subject, but rather her own rebirth by her mother. This unconscious wish for rebirth is in effect a death wish directed at her newborn, because what this type ofmother desires is not her child's mental birth as a potential owner of its future. instead, she envisions or experiences the child as an object through which she will strive to reconstitute her own past. Following Bion's and Aulagnier's conceptualizations, which i spell out, i then examine two functions or operations of the development of psychotic syntax within the non-psychotic personality under certain circumstances. The first operation is the production of a split between voice and meaning within the mother-infant relationship, a split whose aim is to disengage contact with contents that cannot be metabolized because these are associated with the mother's denied death wish toward her infant. The second function or operation pertains to the use of psychotic syntax as a way of denying separateness throughout discourse by, among other things, annihilating the sense of a speaking I within the self. While the overall personality of such individuals might not conform with the external criteria for the standard diagnosis of psychosis, the language or discourse of such individuals, and its use–and its effect on a partner, such as the psychoanalyst–tends to be heavily characterized by associative looseness, vagueness, fragmentation, and a subtle but pervasive reliance upon a sort of “anti-syntax" and an utter lack of the capacity to adopt the “narrator's position." Instead of enjoying the experience of a healthy developmental process within which the infant-subject's sounds and soon his language are pleasurably and coherently generated from an adult subject's language, in the problematical instances upon which I am focusing a psychotic “hybrid" language is generated. This hybrid language contains many adult characteristics, such as sophisticated words, which coexist with a deeply infantile syntax that “secretly" and consistently annihilates meaning. This annihilation often takes place in the context of an indifferent, monotonous tone of voice, which in itself contributes to the attack on meaning as well as on the other's (oftentimes the analyst's) capacity for attentiveness. The overall structure of this syntax serves to deny separateness in the ambient linguistic surround, and attacks the processes of the infant's psychological birth. Once the infantile self begins to be bud and the evidence of self structure is revealed–so is the maternal death wish that is directed at this germination, which puts the young mind's life at risk. in this turn of events, the infant's only way of avoiding risk is to defeat its own natural tendency to be born into the dimension of the “first person," and to not develop a sense of the autonomous speaking I. Later in life, as this pattern is enacted within all new relationships with others, a kind of “anti"-dialogue is generated in which the other is rendered unable to quite recognize the speaker (the infant, the patient in analysis) as a truly separate entity so that the other would tend to not direct a death wish toward it, as this infant's mother initially did do. Thus this linguistic hybrid serves both to deny the other's separateness as well as to conceal the self from the other. in this sense, then, the psychotic syntax, or the psychotic hybrid language, may be seen as an attack on language rather than as a language in its own right. The above ideas are illustrated with two clinical examples and followed by a discussion of a specific poem by Paul Celan [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Ma'arag: Israeli Journal of Psychoanalysis is the property of Hebrew University Magnes Press and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

AB  - “It is not a bad usage to employ hysteria for a metaphysical purpose [emploi]; metaphysics is hysteria." This remark, made by Jacques Lacan (1901–1981) in Brussels in 1977 [1981], draws our attention to the fact that both hysteriaand metaphysics tend nowadays to be excluded from their relevant fields of discourse; and, he showed, the loss is significant. These terms cannot simply be dropped, for they refer to something whose existence must be marked by concepts such as these—for these words to disappear is to eliminate something basic for mental experience! This exclusion has to do with the way the subjecthas become “crushed" between positivistic-mechanistic conceptions, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, overly global (almost mystical) attitudes that emphasize some kind of vague unity of the subject with the world/universe. The Hysteric—that diagnostic/existential entity that Lacan begs us to not discard after Freud troubled so hard to disclose her!—enables access to a certain gap or lack, one which we might rightfully call metaphysical, that is essential for substantiating the link between a subject and the world. The ability to facilitate this kind of substantiation has clinical consequences. Lacan sought to preserve for Hysteria a broader function than that originally conceived as defining a ‘merely' clinical structure. Hysteria characterizes, for example, one of the Four Discourses established by Lacan (the others are The Discourse of the Master, the University, and the Analyst; four possible formulations of the symbolic network that social bonds can adopt [or mimic]). The Discourse of the Hysteric, speaking summarily, points to symptoms which embody and reveal resistance to the prevailing Master Discourse, and which must ultimately be subverted by the Analyst's Discourse. The meaning of these discourses, each in its own way, is to highlight four chief ways in which ‘otherness' embodies or infiltrates our language. More than simply a symptom of a specific oedipal conflict as originally postulated by Freud, Lacan speaks more broadly of the way in which the enterprise of psychoanalysis performs its basic function by hystericizing the speech of the analysand—by pointing to the otherness which speaks the patient, as it were, blocking his or her access to an acknowledgement of desire. Lacan goes as far as to state that “what the analyst establishes as analytic experience can be put simply: it is the hysterization of discourse." Taken as such, Hysteria is a condition for entering analysis.Moving to my second focus, I note that Freud himself was cautious in applying metaphysics to psychoanalysis or about letting psychoanalysis seem to be a form of metaphysics. Specifically, Freud conceived of his task as turning metaphysics into metapsychology—an endeavor that may have reached its culmination in the critically important Beyond the Pleasure Principle. Yet there was crucial pragmatic value in the original metaphysics which Freud, for whatever reasons, tried to avoid but which, thankfully, he never really could. In a letter to Stefan Zweig (1881–1942) written late in 1932, Freud describes the incident of Josef Breuer's flight from Anna O. in seemingly metaphysical terms: “At this moment he (Breuer) held in his hand the key that would have opened the ‘doors to the Mothers,' but he let it drop!"—an allusion to the weird experiments described in Goethe's Faust. “The Mothers" refers to the goddesses who reside in a place where there is no time, space, or guiding will; i.e., a metaphysical locus. But Freud was not interested wholly in poetry: this “metaphysical space," or metaphysically demarcated space, is no less than the ‘space' or ‘time' of the transference, and the one who hands the key to the analysis is the hysteric. According to Freud, then, in order to obtain the keys to therapeutic effectiveness, the psychoanalyst has to be “Faustian," by which Freud meant to transcend a mere empiricist field of research. Transference is the gateway to this transcendence, and the key to the gate lies in the hand of the hysteric.Lacan seeks to return metaphysics to its proper position and places it in the gap “between the usage of the signifier and the weight of signification." He argues that in this gap “lies the world," and that this is the proper field of operation of the psychoanalyst (even when dealing with patients other than hysterics; a claim that can be debated independently). As Lacan reads Freud, the crucial clinical characteristic is not only the fact that words are charged with sexual meaning, but more that they have become sexuated—that they have achieved a certain sexual “mass." During the course of hysteric's demonstrative acting outside herself (as opposed to the obsessional who “drags the objects into the cage of his narcissism"), she is able to create access to a beyond, by which Lacan meant the aforementioned gap between the signified and signifier. It is important to realize that in Lacan's conception of the gap, metaphysics is weaved within language rather than lying external to it. When reconsidering the famous examples given by Freud (borrowed from Tausk) in his essay “The Unconscious" (1915), Lacan contrasts the schizophrenic who complains that her lover “twisted her eyes," meant non-figuratively as required by the well-known German expression Augenverdreher, to the hysteric who, under the same conditions, would “have in fact convulsively twisted her eyes," but retained, on some level, access to symbolic meaning. We can trace in these examples the schizophrenic effort to close the gap by virtue of the concrete, nonmetaphorical accusation towards her lover, while in the case of hysteria the gap is preserved through the signifying process of the conversion symptom.Thus, two approaches are established towards the aforementioned beyond: (1) “beyond" in the sense of what might be called “Non-Plus-Ultra," or beyond the end of the world, and (2) “beyond" as a concept that signifies—beyond figuratively construed, beyond as a structural gap. Two clinical examples are presented in order to illustrate those two modes of beyond, highlighting especially the analytic efficacy of the second approach. In the first example, a childhood memory is presented in which a 5 year-old girl sought to respond to a famous paradox stated by her father—“Can God create a stone He is unable to break?"—as a way to indicate that she was ‘beyond' the limitations of this paradox...and perhaps beyond the limits of the law laid by her father. This memory evoked its effects within the transference when it served to create a link—ultimately an explanatory link—to a break in the analysis. The second example bears witness to the production of an hysterical symptom, and enables us to trace a moment of hysterization, the inception of hysterization; i.e., the appearance of the I who speaks as divided, cleaved, and to mark the place of loss. This process, when exposed, makes way for the unconscious to assume its full role in analysis, to mark the place of desire in relation to the analyst (via transference). Both of these examples, each in its own way, highlight the irreplaceable role of hysteria in analysis and in the discourse of the epoch as well, as the embodiment (em-body-ment) of subjectivity itself by means of the divided subject.The question is raised, in conclusion, as to the fate of hysteria in an era when it has seemingly been excluded from medical discourse as well as others. From the outset Freud had spotted what might be called “the political dimension of hysteria." The hysteric—as best described, perhaps, in the famous dream of the “Butcher's wife" (Freud, 1900 [in discussing hysterical identification and condensation])—defies the analyst precisely as concerns the analyst's owning of knowledge. The hysterical subject, as contemporary Lacanian analyst Marie-Hélène Brousse (1950– ) puts it, wants a “master over whom to reign." As such, Hysterical Discourse is still—and maybe more than ever—a vital barrier against the complete objectification of human experience, and a precious reminder for psychoanalysts about the limits of their knowledge; a warning against all attempts to occupy the place of the Other (Big Other) of knowledge too recklessl [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Ma'arag: Israeli Journal of Psychoanalysis is the property of Hebrew University Magnes Press and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

AB  - This article offers a novel psychoanalytic perspective on the unique emotional affinity, the passion, that exists in couple relationships, familiarly known as Eros or love. For this purpose, my analysis surveys various expressions of the erotic dimension in Western culture—myth, religion, literature and legend—that shaped the perceptions, ideals and fantasies, conscious and unconscious, regarding romantic, passionate conjugal love. The sources from which I shall draw present a model of impersonal love in which Eros is seen as a force connecting man and God, or man and the forces of nature surrounding him, even as the dynamic force that connects man and his sense of narcissistic selfhood. This model widely informs the way in which we approach the treatment of tension or pathology within the couple relationship. While the attempt to comprehend the experience of conjugal love by rational means (i.e., beyond physiological, neurological and evolutional aspects), and the efforts to deal with the pathological aspects of love by means of purely psychological tools, leave us mostly perplexed and wondering, I wish to closely observe couples' relationships as an end in itself, as a dynamic union (or break in union) that takes place within a unique emotional interpersonal caesural space that connects and separates couples. I attempt to do so without diminishing the importance of sublimation as part of the psychic, spiritual and emotional development of the individual and society in general. Further, the evolution of the erotic element will be described from a dynamic and relational perspective, as presented in Freudian and post-Freudian psychoanalysis, which tends to echo the tension that exists between passion as an expression of an urge seeking an outlet, and love that develops within the framework of an interpersonal relation. I add to my initial characterization those deeper insights of Freud (1856-1939), Klein (1882-1960), Winnicott (1896-1971), Benjamin (1946- ) and Mitchell (1946-2000) that acknowledge the role of aggression in the development of the ability to love, all the while seeking to emphasize the dialectical affinity that can be found between Eros and Thanatos, between love and hate, and between passion and aggression in the development of mature love relationships. My clinical experience has motivated me to adopt this more complex approach to the power of Eros. This affinity between love and destruction, order and disarray, is clinically illustrated in stories of couples that lived in an emotional, passionate and turbulent field including multiple upheavals, ranging from psychic dissolution to psychic integration—demonstrating that Eros thrives close to the ‘dragon,' excitedly and painfully. That is to say, Eros, and hence passion, requires a close relationship with chaos, and hence the tendency of creative, complex, and perhaps even mature love to weave itself, as it were, around an intricate texture of relationship where passion, aggressiveness and death emerge out of each other as well as collapse into one another. In addition, an attempt is made to address the question of whether love and passion can coexist for a long time within a relationship once we fully confront the fact that love and passion provide an answer to two fundamentally conflicting human needs. Love seeks control, stability, continuity and certainty, whereas passion seeks surrender, adventure, renovation and the unknown. Hence the paradox within dwells at the epicenter of the experience of romantic love. By nature, romantic love is neither sable nor predictable, and by trying to control and secure such love within a long term relationship, one generally finds oneself creating a mythic, illusional or even false sense of security. The net effect of this is that, ultimately, the passionate dimension of love is diminished, or suffocates. In the light of this hypothetical conclusion, I then ask if it is not the case that the destiny of romance is doomed. I reply that this is not necessarily the sole outcome, yet the dialectic between spontaneous, even lawless passion, on the one hand, and â€›stable' relations with commitment, on the other hand, requires that we develop a sense of commitment that is not so rigid as to prevent spontaneity and a sense of ‘contained spontaneity' that is not so labile as to prevent commitment. In view of the complexity and difficulties discussed above, I suggest a tripartite or three-stage developmental path for couple relations. My idea is inspired by Analytical Psychology as expounded by Carl Gustav Jung (1875-1961) and his research on the meaning of alchemical symbols, and the seemingly unrelated views of Emmanuel Levinas (1906-1995) and his approach to understanding the phenomenology of Eros. I refer to the insights of other psychoanalysts and thinkers as well. According to the model that I propose, couples relationship begins in an initial phase that I will refer to as Attraction between Similar to Similar. This phase is based on the understanding that the erotic (as opposed to the ‘merely sexual,' though Eros and sexuality cannot be ever completely separated) attraction between man and woman is the result of a tension between undamentally polar forces taking place within the psyche of each partner, projected upon each other unconsciously. According to this understanding, the individuation process, during which a man and a woman become whole (that is, with an integrated selfhood as their center), is made possible through the develo-pment of an increasing awareness (or “owning") of the inner states we project upon the other, returning them to oneself, and accepting the difficult task of working out a better pathway of connection between the inner elements of one's own psyche and, as a result, a more fluid connection to the other or partner in the interpersonal field. In a subsequent dimension of this first stage, the pairing between man and woman, and in parallel, the pairing of the intrapsychic masculine and feminine elements with each of them, becomes a realization or deep reflection of the “sacred marriage archetype," referred to as the Coniunctio (literally: conjunction, or coitus, the union of spirit and soul, body and mind) in the language of the alchemists, which was adopted for its chiefly psychological meaning by Jung. This archetype establishes the psychic foundation for romantic love and attraction, and its representational drive is projected unconsciously on the desired mate in the quest for a total symbiotic psychic and physical connection. As the fire of passion that characterizes the first phase of falling in love gradually fades (or seems to), the couple is motivated to move toward the second stage that I refer to as Waking-up and Returning Projections. At this point the experience of being expelled from any semblance of naïve “couple's paradise" can be looked at in light of the Mortificatio, or Death in the alchemical ouvre—not as in a passive or waning process, but rather as an integral part of the process of nigredo or putrefaction that leads to a release of powerful emotional forces. In the psychological sense, it refers to returning mutual projections from one another, as forces and impulses draw each individual toward opposite and complementary poles. The unfulfilled expectations, as well as the emerging of conflicting emotions and needs of each individual in the marital dyad, invite each to further develop within this new stage, in which they will need to learn to negotiate and channel their feelings and needs without surrendering, controlling or destroying one another. The formation of a “couple container," as it were, that can endure the oscillation of contradictions, may enable the couple to develop a more mature partnership, based on the creation of a live, authentic and intimate interpersonal space.The nearness to the formation of what I referred to as a couple container comprises the third phase I discuss: Relationship in Dialogical Space. The connection in dialogical space is based upon the ability of both partners to see each other as they are, while they maintain intimacy based on separateness and reciprocity, all the time preserving the autonomy and uniqueness of each individual. At this stage in the relationship, the desire to love and be loved is experienced less as a need for merging with each other, and more as an evolving ability to respect and bear otherness through rapport and intimate relationship. The latter includes the ability to bear the sense of otherness that exists in one's own the psyche. At this point, my essay comes to its conclusion, having touched as deeply as I am able upon the reality and essence of Eros, defined by the wise philosopher Socrates as “the best Divine Madness," and having illuminated the characters and expressions of the erotic element in couple relationships. I believe that I have shown the sense in which the power of Eros is that it can carry the soul upward toward heaven, back down to the underworld, and up again. Out of the turmoil and anguish of the longing soul, mourning or yearning, human subjectivity comes into being: perhaps wounded, torn but reconciled and integrated in light of its desires, privations and pains in its relationship to others and to itself [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Ma'arag: Israeli Journal of Psychoanalysis is the property of Hebrew University Magnes Press and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

AB  - Recently, the countries began adopting a comprehensive development plans aimed to target poverty and to improve the living conditions as well as to support charities and institutions that provide housing for lowincome families. In this study the "Satisfaction with the housing services charity and its relationship to the quality of life of low-income Saudi families". Among its objectives is to determine the relationship between satisfaction with housing services charity and the quality of life of low-income Saudi families, and determine the relationship between the families to take advantage of a developmental program and family interaction, the availability of resources, the family's ability to solve problems, and capacity to deal with community institutions. This study is one of the descriptive studies that relied on social survey method style of the sample. The community of the study includes (461) families and has been taking a random sample (193) families, The questionnaires were applied on a simple random sample of resident families in charitable housing complexes of the Prince Salman Charity Housing Association. The study showed that there is a direct correlation medium statistically significant at the level of 0.001 between the moral satisfaction for charitable housing services, the quality of life of low-income Saudi families and the value of Pearson's correlation coefficient (0.285). The study recommends activating the services of developmental program provided in the housing charity to benefit families in improving their quality of life, and adopting and implementation of a strategy of social and economic empowerment for low-income families and living in housing complexes charity.

AB  - Introduction: Unhealthy life style causes health risks as well as non-communicative diseases in the adulthood. Theory- based educational needs assessment before-intervention can be introduced as a basis among adolescents regarding education planning in lifestyle promotion. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the influential factors in adopting lifestyle-promoting behaviors in adolescents using theory of planned behavior. Methods: In this cross-sectional analytic study, a sample of 175 students, aged 12-15 years, were selected via multistage random sampling. In order to glean the study data, a questionnaire was utilized based on constructs of planned behavior theory with regard to adolescent's life style. The study data were analyzed using SPSS software (ver. 20) via Pearson correlation, independent t-test and multi factorial regression. Results: The students' mean age was reported 13.5, 0.9 years. Quality of life decreased with increasing age of the students and their fathers' education level. No association was found between intention and behavior in healthy eating (P= 0.438) as well as smoking and alcohol rejection (p= 0.256). Healthy eating behavior (B=0.638) and intention (B=0.268) were most predicted by attitude. Intention in physical activity was most predicted by perceived behavioral control (B=0.244) and behavior (B=0.424) was most predicted by the subjective norms. Regarding stress management, intention was most predicted by subjective norms (B=0.455) and behavior was most predicted by the perceived behavioral control (B=0.767). In smoking and alcohol rejection, attitude (B=0.829) showed a strong association with intention and perceived behavioral control (B=0.311) revealed a strong relationship in regard with behavior. Conclustion: Lack of association between intention and behavior demonstrated that demographic variables, except for intention, may affect behavior in adolescents. Educational interventions focusing on perceived behavioral control construct seem to be an important way to achieve the healthy behavior. Since physical activity behavior was directly affected by the subjective norms, promoting exercise behaviors in the age groups will be more successful with the family cooperation.

AB  - Introduction: Given the chronic nature of diabetes and the fact that these patients encounter care problems on a daily basis, fostering attitudes of type II diabetes patients is of paramount importance. Herein, we aimed to evaluate the effect of teach-back communication strategy on improving attitude components of type II diabetes patients. Materials and Methods: This clinical trial was performed on 70 type 2 diabetic patients, who were randomly divided into experimental (n=35) and control (n=35) groups. Teach-back communication strategy was taught to patients in the intervention group during four sessions. Information was collected one month before and after the educational intervention through questionnaires, interviews, and self-report. To analyse the data, paired t-test, independent t-test, and Chi-square were run, using SPSS version 20. Results: The results showed that general attitude of both experimental and control groups significantly increased in the second phase of measurement. Independent t-test did not reflect a significant difference between the two groups in terms of general attitude of the patients before the intervention (P>0.05). However, this test indicated a significant difference between the groups in general attitude after the intervention (P<0.05). Conclusion: Considering the fact that the relationship between patient and caregiver is one of the most important issues of nursing profession, it can be said that the use of patient-centred communication techniques (such as teach-back) can improve patients' attitude, and in turn, result in positive outcomes of care.

AB  - Today, libraries and information centers, all around the world, are aiming to develop and update their management systems, counting on the most modern technological innovations to present an effective form for managing the work aiming at increasing performance, improving competencies and enhancing effectiveness. The integration of management and technology is one of the most important issues emerging at international level, as the new century is emerging with new challenges and opportunities. These are limitless except by human capabilities. We have to think of the potential that technology carries for management of libraries and information centers. Considering the nature of modern technologies in administration, libraries and information centers have found themselves facing great challenges to connect these technological applications in the administration and the success in achieving their goals through them. This is why scholars, specialists and technical experts have come to help them come up with policies, standards and rules to guide them to the right path for programs and the requirements of the electronic management application. Amongst which, we find the necessity for the existence of an organizational culture considering that it is one of the main elements that define the success or failure of libraries. Organizational culture focuses on values and concepts that push those who adopt technologies to be strict, work seriously, innovate, update and participate in the decision making process, to work on maintaining quality and improving performances and services, achieve the competitive advantage, to quickly respond to the needs of the recipients and other parties of the work environment. It can also be considered a radical element that affects the libraries ability of change and establish the electronic management application, and their capacity of catching up to the current technological evolutions around them. The more flexible librarians are, the more they can hope for the better, and the more they will be able to change and benefit of it. And vice versa, the more rigid librarians are, the more anxious, careful and more conservative, the less their potentials get, less prepared to develop, and to update through renewed execution of the electronic management concepts, especially after the environment got a more global content and way of thinking, new competitors have risen on the light of the diversity of resources and knowledge and technology developing really fast and in a high speed. We will attempt through this research to study the relation between the organizational culture and implementing an electronic management and its role in guaranteeing its application and investing in the right, adequate and proper way, manifested by the reach to positive results and the guarantee to provide the best electronic services in libraries and information centers.

AB  - Background and Objective: Investigating factors affecting the adoption of self-care behaviors in diabetic patients is necessary, especially by using a model that would identify and reinforce the factors affecting behavior. The purpose of this study was to assess the predictor factors associated with self-care behaviors among type2 diabetic patients by using social cognitive theory. Methods: In this descriptive-analytical cross-sectional study 320 patients with type2 diabetes mellitus were selected based on multistage random sampling. The data collection tools were a demographic researcher-made questionnaire based on the cognitive social model constructs- the validity and reliability of the questionnaires were calculated - and the standard self-care questionnaire for diabetes. After data collection, data were analyzed using independent t-test, one –way ANOVA and spearman’s correlation coefficient in SPSS21 at a significance level of 0.05. Results: According to the findings, Outcome Expectation(r =0.263, P<0.05), Outcome Values(r =0.151, P<0.05), Self-Efficacy (r =0.350, P<0.05, Barrier Efficacy (r =0.432, P<0.05), the Environmental (r =0.173, P<0.05), Observation Learning (r =0.416, P<0.05), Understanding the Situation (r =0.251, P<0.05), Self-Regulation (r =0.462, P<0.05) and Emotional Coping (r =0.374, P<0.05) variables were positive correlated with self-care behaviors. Also, Emotional Coping variable was the most predictive variable (Beta=0.283). Conclusion: To maintain and improve the health of diabetic patients, social cognitive theory can be used to design and implement educational interventions for the self- care of diabetic patients.

AB  - The internet has recently become a link between the countries of the world and an efficient incentive behind the various fields and activities of all society segments. The world has witnessed a remarkable increase in the number of internet users, especially young people and university students in particular. The internet has an important role in influencing certain skills, especially self-management skills, which enables university students to acquire flexibility and adaptation and helps them achieve progress in their personal lives and social relationships. Based on this, the present study aimed mainly to study the relationship between the use of university students of the internet and some self-management skills. A study sample was composed of 500 university students, who selected purposefully from the various scientific and literary colleges at Zagazig University, Sharkia Governorate, Egypt, and from different economic and social levels. Study tools were applied on the sample. These tolls were represented in: a general questionnaire of information regarding university students and their families; a questionnaire of university students usage of the internet with its various axes (ways of using the internet, the advantages of using the internet, the disadvantages of using the internet); a questionnaire for measuring some self-management skills for university students (decision-making, time-use, self-assessment, emotional intelligence). The study has adopted the descriptive and analytical approaches. The results obtained were as follows:There was a positive statistical correlative relation between the usage of university students of the internet (on all axes) and all self-management skills. There were statistically significant differences between the study sample’s average scores of both the use of the internet (on all axes) and all the skills of self-management (on all axes): according to the gender of the university student in favor of males; according to the nature of the study in favor of theoretical study; according to the place of residence in favor of the countryside. There were statistically significant differences between the study sample’s average scores of both the use of the internet (on some axes), and all the skills of self-management (on some axes). The study recommends pointing the attention of university administration to preparing educational lectures and seminars for university students on the importance and good use of the internet, and on benefiting from this service in developing their various skills and benefiting from it in their lives in general. This can be achieved through student leadership in universities. Also, the ministry of communications should block all sites that are not useful or pornographic, as this may have a huge impact on improving the awareness of university students regarding the optimum use of the internet. In addition, those working in the field of home management should prepare electronic educational programs to be broadcasted through various social networking sites, for the purpose of developing self-management skills of university students.

AB  - Government adopts a set of policies aimed at achieving economic growth to contribute to the well-being of families and nations. Thus, it is important to consid er measures, and alternatives of households in using goods and services provided by the State for their significance on the continuity of the economic growth of the state. One of the important economic aspects is the "hidden household income", which depends on the awareness of wives to manage family resources optimally. The current research aims at studying the impact of wife contribution in managing family resources to reduce the expenses and achieve the highest possible hidden income. Four-hundred working and non-working wives, aged between 20 and 50 years, were randomly selected to take part in the current study. Results show that the family hidden income was significantly correlated with all processes of the family resource manage ment, especially “implementation” and “evaluation” processes. No significant differences were detected between working and non-working wives on managing family resource. However, the leve l of education of wives recorded high positive impacts on management of family resources. The proceedings of the family resource management were associated with high family socioeconomic status. The highest correlations between the administrative steps were detected between "planning"-"regulation" and "impleme ntation"-"assessment" processes.

AB  - Background and Aim: The Internet is a tool that responds to many human needs, but this technology can also have an impact on people's lives. This study aimed to examine the role of the Internet in family values. Materials and Methods: This descriptive-analytic cross-sectional study was conducted in 2015 in Tehran, Iran. The research population consisted of all the students of Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, the sample size being 384. Data were collected using a questionnaire, as well as The Young's standard questionnaire, and analyzed by the SPSS software version 22, the statistical test being one-way analysis of variance. Results: The findings showed statistically significant positive associations (p<0.05) between the student's dependence on the Internet on the one hand and the following variables on the other: intimacy among users, family awareness and information, and the extent to which the students were using the Internet. However, no statistically significant relationship was found between Internet use and anonymity on the Internet. Conclusion: The constant use of the Internet and accepting it as the main reference and channel for obtaining information have caused negative effects on family life and the relationships and values within the family framework. Therefore, university students should try to make optimum, more proper use of the Internet. It is also recommended that responsible authorities adopt appropriate policies and implement cognitive-behavioral interventions aiming at changing the patterns of Internet use.

AB  - The foster care system is a social welfare service that supplements the functions of the family while enabling children, who cannot receive proper care from their biological parents, to receive the necessary protection under the plan within the prescribed period of time within a substitute or foster family. A large part of the emotional instability experienced by foster care children is interpersonal maladjustment. Low self-esteem leads to difficulty in forming social relationships due to negative interpersonal relationships. Thus, the purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of traditional dance programs on the foster children who live in Daejeon Metropolitan City. A comparison between the pre- and post-interpersonal scores showed that the scores were improved after the traditional dance program, and the children's intimacy formation and communication were also improved. The participants were less active at the beginning of the program, but became more interested and more active toward the middle of the program. The majority of the participants increased their degree of communication with the formation of intimacy toward the middle of the program, and their self-confidence improved in terms of their peer relationships. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of traditional dancing on the development of interpersonal relationships. In a subsequent study, a traditional dancing program consisting of various contents will be applied over a long period of time, which should provide them with the opportunity to improve their interpersonal skills. In addition, it is necessary to provide educational opportunities for helping foster children reduce their emotional instability with systemic and diverse traditional dance programs.

AB  - As only 7％ of abuse cases handled by the Child Guidance Centers in Japan result in removal of the children from their homes, the majority of maltreated children continue life within the community with their original families. Although community support is available for parents and children of mild to moderate abuse cases, lack of human resources and effective programs for their support and treatment remain the challenge. The aim of support in abuse cases is to help children recover from the negative impacts of abuse, allowing for healthy development through nurture of self-esteem. Family support is provided to achieve that goal by changing abusive parenting behavior, and shifting the home into an environment conducive to the child's emotional and physical development. This process often requires support not only for the parents, but multidimensional approaches including care for the child, the parent-child relationship, and help in bridging the parents with support from relatives, acquaintances, and the community. Abusive behaviors can at times be lessened by helping to relieve parents from isolation, reducing stress in their everyday life, and promoting the family's strengths and independence. However, some parents, particularly those with histories of being abused, require treatment and education to acquire appropriate parenting skills, and to reconstruct the parent-child relationship. This article reviews the compound factors giving rise to child abuse, classification of abuse by the mechanism fostering abuse helpful in determining the types of required support, supportive networks encompassing welfare, education, medical care and justice. Treatment and educational modalities are overviewed, including the Alternatives for Families: A Cognitive Behavior Therapy （AF-CBT）—an evidence-based treatment program developed in the US targeting both parents and children—comprised of core elements with proven efficacy in supporting families with abuse issues （safety planning, psychoeducation, emotion regulation, restructuring thoughts, parent training, and clarification of responsibility for abusive behavior and apology） (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] 虐待で分離となるのは児童相談所が扱ったケースの７ ％程度という現状があり，虐待を受けた子 どもたちの多くは，家族とともに地域で暮らしている。地域で中～軽度の虐待の問題を抱える親と 子どもに対する支援が始まりつつあるが，人手や有効な支援や治療プログラムが不足している状況 であり，今後の虐待対策の課題の一つとなっている。 虐待の支援の目的は，子どもが虐待の有害な影響から回復し，自尊感情を獲得して健全な発達を 遂げられるようにすることである。その目的に向かって，親の虐待的な養育行動を変化させ，家庭 が子どもの心身の成長を培う土壌となるように，家族支援が行われる。親だけでなく子どもや親子 へのケアも併せて必要となることが少くない。 親の孤立を和らげ，生活上のストレスを軽減させ，家族のストレングスと主体性を引出す中で虐 待が軽減していくが，それだけでは虐待問題が解決に向かわないことをしばしば経験する。 特に被 虐待歴を有している親の場合は，適切な養育を身につけ親子関係を再構築するには治療的・教育的 ケアが重要な役割を担っている。米国で有効性が実証され最近日本に導入された，親と子どもと双 方を対象としている治療プログラムAF-CBT（Alternatives for Families: A Cognitive Behavior Therapy）を紹介し，虐待問題を抱えている家族の治療に有効と思われる構成要素（安全プラン， 心理教育，感情調節，思考の再構成，ペアレントトレーニング，虐待行為の責任の明確化と謝罪な ど）について詳しく述べた。 (Japanese) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Japanese Journal of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry is the property of Japanese Society for Child & Adolescent Psychiatry (Nihon Jido Seinen Seishin Igakkai) and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

AB  - Objective To explore the clinical and genetic features in a pedigree of maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) due to a novel glucokinase inactive mutation (GCK-MODY). Methods The clinical and genetic data of a dominantly inherited GCK-MODY family from Peking Union Medical College Hospital in December, 2015 were retrospectively analyzed. The proband was a 31-year-old female, who was found elevated fasting plasma glucose (7.3 mmol/L) during early pregnancy accompanied with increased glycated hemoglobin level (6.6%). The levels of serum lipid profiles and hypersensitive C reactive protein were normal. She was diagnosed with pregestational diabetes mellitus. The proband's immediate family members had three generations of diabetes history. The affected family members developed diabetes between 40 and 55 years old. Lifestyle intervention or metformin was the adopted treatments for hyperglycemia. Until now there were no obvious diabetes complications reported in this pedigree. The function of genetic variation was predicted by genetic function software and compared with Human Gene Mutuation Database. Results GCK gene sequencing showed all of the affected members had a novel heterozygotic deletion c.1289_1294 del TGACGC mutation（p.lys 430fs）. Genetic function software suggested that this mutation led to not only splice site changes, but also premature termination codon. Literature review found there were above 680 kinds of GCK-MODY, which were dominantly inherited and had stable fasting hyperglycemia (5.5~7.8 mmol/L) without overt diabetes complication. Fasting hyperglycemia occurs in neonatal period but usually only can be found in medical check-up or during pregnancy. Therefore, it could be easily misdiagnosed as gestational diabetes mellitus. GCK-MODY rarely depends on pharmacotherapy except for during pregnancy and has a good prognosis. Conclusions GCK-MODY is a kind of monogenic diabetes with good prognosis and early pregnancy is a sensitive period for screening. Overtreatment should be avoided once the diagnosis is made.

AB  - Objective To investigate the incidence situation, influencing factors of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and the relationship between PMS and 16 personality traits among female college students.Methods The self-made basic information questionnaire, PMS diagnosis scale and Cattell′s 16 Personality Factors Questionnaire (16 PF) were adopted to conduct the measurement on 996 female students from a vocational college by using the cluster random sampling method from March to June 2017 and the obtained data were statistically analyzed.Results Among 996 female college students, 445 cases met the PMS diagnostic criteria, and the incidence rate was 44.7%.The PMS incidence rate had statistical differences among the female college students with different grades, different self control ability, different family atmospheres, different menarche ages, different painful menstruation symptoms and whether menstruation being regular or not (χ2=29.42, 6.62, 11.88, 18.49, 29.42, 8.83, P<0.05) ;the personality and secondary personality aspects of intelligence, stability, assertiveness, excitement, social boldness, sensitivity, suspicion, anxiety, self-discipline and tension, and appropriate and anxious, introverted and extroverted, emotional and serene alertness, mental health, professional achievement, adaptability had statistical differences between the PMS and non-PMS female college students (P<0.05) . The grade, stability, anxiety, tonicity and painful menstruation were the important factors affecting PMS occurrence. Conclusion The occurrence of PMS is correlated to the sensitivity, suspicion and anxiety in 16 PF, which prompts that it is necessary to analyze and evaluate the personality characteristics when the intervention is conducted on the female students with PMS.

AB  - Returning expatriates not only brought back to their native countries intellectual capital but also social capital. The transfer of academic social capital by expatriates give domestic scholars better access to foreign information, foster participation in the global academic community, and build confidence and academic reputation. But current research concerning the phenomenon of social capital transfer of expatriates is very limited. This study proposes a cross-border social capital transfer model of expatraites by applying the theory of homophily, peer effects and group homogenization. An analysis of the data on transnational academic capital transfers, collected from the Network of Thousands of Academic Collaborators, a recruitment network of returning expatraites, shows that returnees are able to accumulate significantly more academic social capital in their post-return career. Foreign academic social capital is transferred to the domestic academic community through a three-way triadic closure mechanism. The post-return accumulated capital appears to be transferred with higher efficiency. With such capital transfers, returnees help break stagnation and trigger a cascade of innovation. We propose a model as well as an analytic formula of transnational social capital transfer. We find that social capital transfer is a process, by which weak relations become strong and indirect contacts becomes direct contacts. Our research implies that cross-border social capital transfer happens when a scholar who possesses the homogenizing characters mediates between two heterogeneous groups and is able to bridge the differences. However once the transfer is completed, the mediator will lose his/her role, which leads to a decrease of clusters and an increase of cluster coefficient. Our study also examines the social impact of returning expatraites by means of quantitative methods. The paper recommends that in planning and modifying Chinese talent recruitment programs, the government should take into consideration the efficiency of social capital transfer.

AB  - Purpose As a preliminary step in considering how to support pregnant women at high risk who have no choice but to undergo long-term hospitalization during pregnancy and their husbands in elevating each other as parents, we aimed to clarify the differences between, and characteristics of, readiness for parenthood in first-time pregnant women and their husbands in normally progressing and high risk pregnancies. Subjects and Methods Subjects were pregnant woman-husband couples (20-40 years of age, 22 to <28 weeks into pregnancy with first child, who had accepted pregnancy, and who had not yet enrolled in a maternal or parenting course). We targeted 50 couples each for the normal progression group and the high-risk group (diagnosed with imminent abortion, premature rupture of the membrane, cervical incompetence, placenta previa, pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH), fetal growth restriction (FGR), multiple pregnancy, or previous problematic pregnancy; at least one week having elapsed after hospitalization). For the survey, we assessed characteristics, the marital relationship scale (6 items), the prenatal attachment inventory (21 items), realization of parenthood (19 items), and self-awareness and image of becoming a parent (visual analog scale) as well as contents of an anonymous self-completed questionnaire consisting of free responses related to this topic. SPSS Ver. 22 was used for statistical analysis, and as support for our interpretations, we adopted the results of free responses. Results Subjects included in the analyses were 16 couples in the normal progression group (response rate, 32%) and 9 couples in the high-risk group (response rate, 18%). Characteristics with significant differences between groups were the number of weeks into pregnancy at the time of questionnaire completion and family structure. Marital relationship and prenatal attachment were not significantly different between husbands and wives in either group, but they were strongly correlated with the item "realization and mental preparation of becoming a parent" in awareness of becoming a parent among wives, regardless of risk. Awareness of becoming a parent was significantly higher for the high-risk group in a comparison between the wives in each group with respect to the item "concern and anxiety about the to-be-born child" (p=.02). Self-awareness of becoming a parent was significantly higher in the high-risk group in a comparison between wives from marriage until pregnancy (p=.017); over the course of the time from marriage until pregnancy to the present, it significantly increased only for the wives of the normal progression group (p=0.18). The image of becoming a parent did not significantly differ between groups during the time from marriage until pregnancy or in the present, nor did it significantly differ within groups over time. However, it tended not to increase in the high-risk group for both wife and husband. Conclusion The results suggest that being in a high-risk state during pregnancy impacts the awareness and image of becoming a parent. Given that obstruction of this image during an important period in which practical preparations are made to become a parent can potentially cause confusion regarding parental roles after delivery as well as gaps in the marital relationship, there is a need to consider interventions that expand the images of becoming a parent for both husband and wife. 目　的 妊娠期に長期入院を余儀なくされるハイリスクな状態にある妊婦と夫が，共に親として高め合える支 援のあり方を検討するための前段階として，正常な経過をたどる初妊婦とその夫とハイリスクな状態に ある初妊婦とその夫を比較し，親準備性の違いや特徴を明らかにすることである。 対象と方法 妊娠22～28週未満，妊娠を受容し，母親・両親学級未受講の20～40歳の妊婦と夫で，両者の第1子 妊娠中の正常経過群とハイリスク群（切迫早産，前期破水，頚管無力症，前置胎盤，PIH，FGR，多 胎妊娠，既往妊娠の異常を診断名とし，入院後1週間以上経過）それぞれ50組を対象とした。調査に は，属性，夫婦の関係性尺度（6項目），胎児愛着尺度（21項目），親になる意識（19項目），親になる自 覚およびイメージ（VAS）とそれに関連する自由記述で構成された無記名自記式質問紙を用いた。分析は， SPSS Ver.22を使用し，統計的に比較し，その解釈の裏づけとして自由記述の結果を用いた。 結　果 分析対象は，正常経過群16組（回収率32％），ハイリスク群9組（回収率18％）だった。属性で，質問 紙記載時妊娠週数と家族形態に有意差を認めた。夫婦の関係性，胎児愛着は，両群の夫・妊婦間比較で 有意差はなかった。しかし，妊婦ではリスクの有無に関係なく夫婦の関係性および胎児愛着と親になる 意識の「親になる実感・心の準備」とに強い相関がみられた。親になる意識は，両群の妊婦間比較で「生 まれてくる子どもの心配・不安」がハイリスク群で有意に高かった（p=.02）。親になる自覚は，結婚～妊 娠までが妊婦間比較でハイリスク群が高く（p=.017），結婚～妊娠までと現在の時間的経過で正常経過群 妊婦のみ有意に高まっていた（p=.018）。親になるイメージは，結婚～妊娠までと現在では両群間および 時間的経過における両群内のいずれにも有意差はなかったが，妊婦・夫ともにハイリスク群ではイメー ジが高まらない傾向にあった。 結　論 妊娠期にハイリスクな状態にあることは，親になる意識やイメージに何らかの影響をおよぼすことが 考えられた。親になる具体的準備を行う大切な時期でのイメージの阻害は，出産後の親役割や夫婦の関 係性のギャップに戸惑う要因ともなり得ることから，夫婦共に親になるイメージが膨らむ介入の検討の 必要性が示唆された。

AB  - Background: Patients with endotracheal intubation often experience anxiety because they are unable to express their needs freely. However, the family members of these patients are able to provide encouragement, comfort, and substantive support. Purposes: The aims of the present study were: (1) to compare the anxiety scores, vital signs, and incidence of unplanned extubation (UE) between the two comparison groups; (2) to compare the differences in vital signs before and after the intervention in the experimental group; and (3) to explore the satisfaction of patients in the experimental group with the intervention. Methods: A quasi-experimental, pretest-posttest design was carried out. A convenience sampling was adopted to recruit patients with endotracheal intubation in intensive care units (ICUs). The experimental group listened to the UEprevention reminders of their family members for three times a day for 4 days. The control group was provided with usual care. Results: (1) No significant difference was observed in the anxiety scores between the two groups (t = -1.282, p = .205). (2) A repeated-measures analysis found no significant difference in vital signs, taken nightly at 10 p.m., between the experimental and control groups (p > .05). (3) The experimental group registered significantly lower heart rates, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and mean arterial pressure after the conclusion of the intervention (p < .05). However, no significant pre-test / posttest difference in breathing rate was observed for this group. (4) A large majority (89%) of the experimental group expressed satisfaction with the intervention treatment program. Conclusion/Implication for Practice: The present study, which used a DVD of family reminders encouraging and reminding patients about intubation safety, achieved a very high level of patient satisfaction and reduced their anxiety-related vital signs. The results may serve as a reference for providing intervention treatment to patients with endotracheal intubation in ICUs. 背　景放置氣管內管對病人而言，最大的壓力源是插管後無法順利表達自己的需要而感到焦慮，家屬能使 病人情緒獲得安慰與鼓勵甚至給予實質性支持。 目　的(一)比較實驗組與控制組病人焦慮分數、生命徵象、非計畫性氣管內管滑脫率之差異。(二)比較實 驗組病人介入前後生命徵象之差異。(三)探討實驗組病人對叮嚀影音方案之滿意度。 方　法本研究採類實驗前後測設計，採方便取樣，以加護中心接受氣管插管病人為研究對象。於氣管內管 留置期間，實驗組病人聆聽由家屬錄製的「預防非計畫性氣管內管滑脫叮嚀影音」，一天3次共4天， 控制組給予一般照護。 結　果（一）兩組間焦慮分數無顯著差異（t = -1.282, p = .205）。(二)兩組病人每晚10點介入後之生命徵象 以重複量數分析顯示兩組間無顯著差異（p > .05）。(三)實驗組每日3次介入前後生命徵象之差異， 在部份時間點的心跳、收縮壓、舒張壓、平均動脈壓有顯著下降（p < .05），病人呼吸次數沒有顯著 差異（p > .05）。(四)實驗組病人對於家屬叮嚀影音介入達89％滿意度。 結　論／ 實務應用 本研究設計以DVD播放家人叮嚀插管安全，研究獲得極高滿意度和達到降低病人焦慮。研究結果可 作為未來加護單位插管病人照護之參考。

AB  - This article described a post-anesthesia nursing experience of a preschooler suffering from burn undergoing debridement. The nursing period was from 12:50-13:50, September 25th, 2015. The health problems were identified as followed: pain, anxiety, stress, and caregiver role strain. The author effectively assessed the patient's pain level using face rating scale, and distracted the patient from pain by playing the movie "Ice Age" and the soundtrack. The anxiety toward being hospitalized and unfamiliar environment was also eased by therapeutic play. In order to relieve the caregiver role strain, the author encouraged the family to express their feelings, provided them with information and instruction on postoperative wound care, and involved the family in the care process. A problem the author had noticed in the nursing process was that the health education video can only be viewed inside the hospital. The problem could be solved if the caregiver could access the video by scanning a QR code, as it would enhance the cognition of the caregiver on the disease and relevant medical information that would reduce caregiver role strain and facilitate role adaptation. The author will discuss the request with the department supervisor and recommend the hospital to adopt the new policy.

AB  - Mindfulness-Based Intervention (MBI) integrates meditation， yoga， body scan and some cognitive-behavioral interventions to release pressure and prevent relapse of depression. The positive effects of MBI on reducing negative emotions and improving well-being have been supported. However， research regarding the process of cultivating mindfulness and the role of homework practice in this process is limited. Purpose: the aims of this study were (1) to investigate the processes of cultivating mindfulness successfully and unsuccessfully when MBI was adopted and (2) to explore the role of homework practice in these processes. Method: the study adopted the qualitative research method. Fifteen focus groups (49 adult participants) were conducted at the end of the 4th session and the 8th session， and one month after the completion of MBI. Results: the study found that the process of successfully cultivating mindfulness had four specific steps: being confused at the beginning， gaining benefits during exploration， experiencing changes after MBI， and adopting the attitude of mindfulness in daily life. In the process of successfully cultivating mindfulness， the acquisition of knowledge and the perception of experiences were equally important. Homework practice itself played a key role in experiencing mindfulness and becoming habituated to mindful awareness during the learning course. We also point out when and who might have difficulties with the cultivation of mindfulness. Conclusions: the process of successfully cultivating mindfulness included four steps. In addition， when and who might have difficulties with the cultivation of mindfulness and the benefits of homework practice in the process of successfully cultivating mindfulness were identified. These indicators would enable group facilitators to detect and prevent them as early as possible so that all group members could cultivate their mindfulness successfully.

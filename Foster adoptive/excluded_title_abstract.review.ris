AB  - Research evidence has shown that in childhood, a secure attachment to a reliable caregiver is important for future mental health and well-being. The theoretical and research basis for attachment theory continues to grow. As attachment theory has become more widely adopted there are challenges and opportunities both theoretically and in terms of its clinical use. Disordered attachment has been linked to psychopathology including internalising and externalising disorders. However, there are ongoing implications for researchers and clinicians as only the most extreme forms of attachment disorders are included in the current diagnostic systems. A wide range of reliable and validated observational assessments to classify attachment are available. Owing to the growing popularity of attachment-based interventions there is a need to develop assessments which are practical for use in clinical settings. The use of attachment-based parenting interventions in clinical settings is increasing as they have been found to be effective and relevant. This growth presents opportunities to further refine these interventions, so they are easy to deliver in clinical practice and tailored to different populations. Attachment-based interventions are being widely used in Australia, and this has led to a need to understand and adapt the theory, assessments, and interventions to this context. Attachment-based interventions demonstrate the importance of relationships and provide an important tool to support children and families. For psychologists here in Australia there are many opportunities to develop measures and interventions based on attachment theory that fit into the Australia context.

AB  - Trauma in early childhood has been shown to adversely affect children's social, emotional, and physical development. Children living in out‐of‐home care (OoHC) have better outcomes when care providers are present for children, physically, psychologically, and emotionally. Unfortunately, the high turnover of out‐of‐home carers, due to vicarious trauma (frequently resulting in burnout and exhaustion) can result in a child's trauma being re‐enacted during their placement in OoHC. Organisation‐wide therapeutic care models (encompassing the whole organisation, from the CEO to all workers including administration staff) that are trauma‐informed have been developed to respond to the complex issues of abuse and neglect experienced by children who have been placed in OoHC. These models incorporate a range of therapeutic techniques, and provide an overarching approach and common language that is employed across all levels of the organisation. The aim of this study was to investigate the current empirical evidence for organisation‐wide, trauma‐informed therapeutic care models in OoHC. A systematic review searching leading databases was conducted for evidence of organisation‐wide, trauma‐informed, out‐of‐home care studies, between 2002 and 2017. Seven articles were identified covering three organisational models. Three of the articles assessed the Attachment Regulation and Competency framework (ARC), one study assessed the Children and Residential Experiences programme (CARE), and three studies assessed The Sanctuary Model. Risk of bias was high in six of the seven studies. Only limited information was provided on the effectiveness of the models identified through this systematic review, although the evidence did suggest that trauma‐informed care models may have significantly positive outcomes for children in OoHC. Future research should focus on evaluating components of trauma‐informed care models and assessing the efficacy of the various organisational care models currently available.

AB  - Orphaned or abandoned children meet with divergent fates. Some are cared for by their extended kin, others find adoptive or foster homes providing them with a family life, yet others spend their days in orphanages or children's homes. The latter group may be worst off: Orphanages usually do not meet the conditions of the average expectable environment, a prerequisite for children's normal development, encompassing protective, stable caregiving and open opportunities for exploration and mastery of the world (Bowlby, 1998; Cicchetti & Valentino, 2006; Hartmann, 1958). Institutional rearing, because of its regimented nature, high child-to-caregiver ratio, multiple shifts and frequent change of caregivers, almost inevitably deprive children of reciprocal interactions with stable caregivers. In this respect, institutional care implies structural neglect. Numerous studies have shown that children growing up in orphanages are at risk in various domains of functioning, including their physical, socio-emotional and cognitive development (see records [rid]2008-17342-001[/rid]; [rid]2010-12541-001[/rid]; [rid]2010-12541-002[/rid]; [rid]2010-12541-003[/rid]; [rid]2010-12541-004[/rid]; [rid]2010-12541-005[/rid]; [rid]2010-12541-006[/rid]; [rid]2010-12541-007[/rid]; [rid]2010-12541-008[/rid]; [rid]2010-12541-009[/rid]; [rid]2010-12541-010[/rid]; [rid]2010-12541-011[/rid]; [rid]2010-12541-012[/rid]; [rid]2008-17342-002[/rid] and [rid]2008-17342-003[/rid]). In this review, the studies have been ordered according to their design. First we describe randomized control trials (five studies), after that studies using matched intervention and control groups (three studies), then studies with a nonmatched control group (four studies), and lastly pretest- posttest studies that did not include a control group of children who did not participate in the intervention (two studies).

AB  - The cognitive development of children of adolescent mothers has often been considered to be at risk. The purpose of this meta-analysis is to examine whether early intervention could help foster more positive cognitive development in the 0- to 4-year-old children of adolescent mothers. Twenty-two studies were reviewed, involving 29 different intervention strategies and 3577 participants. An overall effect size (corrected for publication bias) of d = .24 was found (95% CI .11, .36). Intervention strategies that focused specifically on the quality of parent-child interaction (d = .89; 95% CI .36, 1.43) or that included parent-child interaction as an important target of intervention (d = .53; 95% CI .34, .73) yielded greater effect sizes than those that emphasized maternal support and education (d = .23; 95% CI .12, .34). Intervention that was delivered in groups (d = .56; 95% CI .36, .74) yielded greater effectiveness than dyadic intervention (d = .27; 95% CI .14, .39). Intervention delivered by trained professionals (d = .39; 95% CI .22, .56) was more effective than that delivered by paraprofessionals (d = .20; 95% CI -.02, .61). Older studies (slope = -.015) and those that involved smaller numbers of participants (slope = -.0008) also yielded greater effect sizes. There was also a marginal tendency for shorter intervention strategies (slope = -.002), and those that involved younger children (slope = -.005) and mothers (slope = -.074) to show greater effects. Discussion focuses on the developmental and practical implications of these results.

AB  - This volume is the second in the Duke Series in Child Development and Public Policy, an ongoing collection of edited volumes that address the translation of research in child development to contemporary issues in public policy. The goal of the series is to bring cutting-edge research and theory in the vibrant field of child development to bear on problems facing children and families in contemporary society. The current volume represents the work of the second conference, on the topic of interventions to address dysfunction in the infant-parent attachment relationship. Attachment theory has inspired a huge number of empirical research studies in early social development over the past 50 years, but only recently has this field mounted systematic interventions that are designed to enhance the quality of the relationship between the infant and his or her caregivers. Several of these interventions bring excitement and hope for families in distress, and this volume attempts to bring attention to their promise. These interventions are being applied in a variety of settings, including Early Head Start, nurse-practitioner home-visiting programs, child trauma treatment settings, foster care, and community prevention programs. The public policy issues of financing, screening and triage, and standards of care loom large, and they are addressed here. This volume brings together for the first time a concise overview of the theory that has guided the development of these interventions, their application in several key contexts, the empirical evidence regarding efficacy in initial trials and effectiveness in real-world settings, and the policy issues that must be navigated to bring this promise to standard practice in the community. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved) The volume consists of two principal sections and a set of integrative commentaries. The first section centers on the theoretical and empirical bases for interventions to enhance early attachments. The authors draw on theory, research, and poignant case material to argue convincingly for greater integration of attachment theory, methods, and interventions into child trauma treatment, and for greater integration of child trauma assessments and treatments into attachment interventions. The volume's second section showcases a set of programs concerned with enhancing early attachments and the policy linkages of several of these programs. Reflecting the diversity of the field, some of these programs focus principally on enhancing early attachments, whereas in other programs enhancing attachment is one component of many. All of the programs are designed for mothers and children considered to be at risk, yet the programs' definitions of what constitutes 'risk' vary considerably. At the same time, the authors of these chapters are well aware of one another's work, and their participation in the conference that preceded this book led many to include thoughtful discussions of their programs in the context of the field as a whole, and in relation to some of the questions raised in the first section of this volume. The final section of the volume consists of three integrative commentaries. The first, draws on a series of meta-analyses to highlight the benefits of short-term, narrowly focused attachment interventions. The second commentary discusses some problems and solutions related to the translation of attachment theory and research methods into program and policy development, broadly writ. The third and final commentary synthesizes questions and issues across the chapters of this volume, arguing for the use of prevention science models and public health approaches in implementing and understanding future attachment interventions in the contexts of larger health, social service, and early education systems.

AB  - • Research shows that neglect in early life can affect biobehavioral development. • Children who have experienced neglect show distinct cortisol production patterns. • Early interventions have been shown to produce more typical cortisol patterns. • Future research should consider additional biomarkers and policy implications. Research on the effects of early life adversity, and in particular on the absence of responsive caregiving, has shown long-term impacts on well-being and development. These investigations have been conducted both in human populations and in animal models. The work has demonstrated that neglect experienced in the early years can affect not only behavior but also neurobiological functioning. In particular, studies of children in the foster care system show convergence with research on children adopted following institutional rearing in terms of dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which produces the neuroendocrine hormone cortisol. The characteristic pattern that has been most commonly observed involves diminished diurnal cortisol production, particularly in terms of low levels of cortisol upon awakening. Notably, however, a number of evidence-based interventions for infant, toddler, and preschool-aged foster children have been shown to produce more typical patterns of cortisol production, in combination with improved behavioral, socioemotional, and foster care placement outcomes. In this paper, we review the literature on the effects of early disruptions in care on biobehavioral development, and summarize the results of the interventions for young foster children.

AB  - QUESTION: In youths aged 10-17 years with conduct disorder or delinquency, do family and parenting interventions improve behaviour and long term psychosocial outcomes as well as parenting, family functioning, and parental mental health?Data sourcesStudies in any language were identified by searching Medline, EMBASE/Excerpta Medica, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Sociofile, ERIC, and HealthSTAR (up to mid 1999), and by searching the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. Bibliographies of relevant studies were reviewed, and experts were contacted for information on unpublished trials.Study selectionRandomised controlled trials were included if they evaluated family and/or parenting interventions for youths 10-17 years of age with conduct disorder (defined by standardised psychological assessment or psychiatric diagnosis) and/or delinquency (referral from a legal system for a youth who committed a serious crime and/or offended on >/= 2 occasions) and assessed >/= 1 objective or validated outcome measure. Trials of youths who committed only sex or drug offences were excluded.Data extraction2 reviewers independently extracted data on trial location and methods, patient characteristics, type and duration of the intervention, and outcomes. Study quality was assessed for allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessors, reporting of clinically important outcomes, and follow up.Main results8 studies (749 children and adolescents and their families) were included in the meta-analysis. Family and parenting interventions included short term family intervention, parent training, multisystemic therapy, multidimensional treatment foster care, and an adolescent diversion project with a family condition and a multifocus condition. Control conditions included usual care, waiting list, and no intervention. At follow up, fewer youths in the intervention than in the control group were subsequently arrested (table). Youths in the intervention group spent less time in institutions and had lower self reported delinquency than those in the control group (table). The groups did not differ for youths' behaviour, parental mental health, family functioning and relationships, risk of incarceration, and peer relationships.ConclusionIn youths aged 10-17 years with conduct disorder or delinquency, family and parenting interventions reduce the risk of subsequent arrest, length of time spent in institutions, and self reported delinquency compared with usual care or no intervention.

AB  - QUESTION: In youths aged 10-17 years with conduct disorder or delinquency, do family and parenting interventions improve behaviour and long term psychosocial outcomes as well as parenting, family functioning, and parental mental health?Data sourcesStudies were identified by searching Medline, EMBASE/ Excerpta Medica, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Sociofile, ERIC, and Healthstar (all to September 1999), and by searching the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. Bibliographies of relevant studies were reviewed, and experts were contacted for informaton on unpublished trials.Study selectionRandomised controlled trials in any language were selected if they compared family and parenting interventions with a control group (no treatment, waiting list, or usual care) and assessed outcomes that included youths' behaviour, parenting and parental mental health, family functioning and relationships, and long term psychosocial outcomes.Data extraction2 reviewers independently extracted data on the location of the study, patient characteristics, key components and duration of the intervention, quality of the study, and outcomes.Main results8 studies (749 children and adolescents and their families) were included in the meta-analysis. Family and parenting interventions included short term family intervention, parent training, multisystemic therapy, multidimensional treatment foster care, and an adolescent diversion project with a family condition and a multifocus condition. At follow up, fewer youths in the intervention than in the control group were subsequently arrested (table). Youths in the intervention group spent less time in institutions and had lower self reported delinquency than those in the control group (table). The groups did not differ for youths' behaviour, parental mental health, family functioning and relationships, risk of incarceration, and peer relationships.ConclusionIn youths aged 10-17 years with conduct disorder or delinquency, family and parenting interventions reduce the risk of subsequent arrest, length of time spent in institutions, and self reported delinquency compared with usual care or no intervention.

AB  - Interest in applications of mindfulness-based approaches with adults has grown rapidly in recent times, and there is an expanding research base that suggests these are efficacious approaches to promoting psychological health and well-being. Interest has spread to applications of mindfulness-based approaches with children and adolescents, yet the research is still in its infancy. I aim to provide a preliminary review of the current research base of mindfulness-based approaches with children and adolescents, focusing on MBSR/MBCT models, which place the regular practice of mindfulness meditation at the core of the intervention. Overall, the current research base provides support for the feasibility of mindfulness-based interventions with children and adolescents, however there is no generalized empirical evidence of the efficacy of these interventions. For the field to advance, I suggest that research needs to shift away from feasibility studies towards large, well-designed studies with robust methodologies, and adopt standardized formats for interventions, allowing for replication and comparison studies, to develop a firm research evidence base.

AB  - Parent training programs are the most common type of service prescribed for parents in the child welfare system. Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) is an evidence-based model originally developed as a parent-mediated treatment for disruptive behavior problems in preschool-age children. The model has been adapted to treat maltreating behavior in parents. PCIT uses behavioral principles to (1) increase positive parenting skills, (2) enhance the parent-child relationship, (3) establish effective and consistent behavior management strategies, and (4) decrease child behavior problems. The adapted version of PCIT, which includes a motivational enhancement component, has been found to significantly reduce parents' child welfare recidivism in two randomized trials, including one conducted in a frontline field setting. Other studies document mental health and behavior benefits among children in the child welfare system, including foster children. The PCIT model is flexible and has been extended to home-based services or combined with trauma treatment elements. The fact that PCIT robustly delivers two types of benefits (reduced recidivism and improved child behavior) in one compact and focused intervention makes it particularly appealing for child welfare service systems. This chapter describes PCIT and its adaptations for the treatment of abusive parents. The chapter also touches on cross-cultural adaptations of PCIT and summarizes implementation and scale-up issues.

AB  - Conduct disorder (CD) places huge costs on the individual, family and society. Parenting programmes can reduce CD symptomatology, but economic evaluations of their cost-effectiveness are rarely undertaken. The objective of this paper was to conduct the first specific systematic review of the published economic evidence of parenting programmes as a means to support families with children with or at risk of developing CD. A systematic search of 12 electronic databases was conducted. We identified 93 papers, of which six fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The search found one review article, mainly focusing upon clinical evidence with secondary focus on cost-effectiveness, one cost-effectiveness study, two partial economic evaluations and two cost studies. The costs of group parenting programme delivery ranged from £629.00 to £3839.00. Cost-effectiveness was influenced by intervention type and delivery method, i.e. individual versus group programme. The review highlights a need for a more standardized approach towards the comparison of the cost-effectiveness of parent programmes. In future studies it may be helpful to adopt a 'complex intervention approach', exploring in detail the attribution of cause and effect, the role of socio-economic setting and ripple effects, e.g. benefits to other family members.

AB  - Adopted children and adolescents are at an increased risk of experiencing emotional, behavioural and relational difficulties compared to their non-adopted peers. This systematic review aimed to establish the effectiveness of interventions with adoptive parents on adopted children and adolescents' psychological well-being, behavioural functioning and parent-child relationship. A systematic search was performed adhering to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA), including studies that assessed the effects of interventions with adoptive parents on adopted child and adolescent outcomes. Electronic databases, key journals, grey literature sources, reference and citation lists were searched and published authors in the field were contacted; 19 papers describing 15 interventions were included. The findings from this review provide preliminary support for the use of interventions with adoptive parents for improving adopted children's emotional and behavioural outcomes. However, overall, the studies were found to have a high risk of bias, and the significant heterogeneity across the studies limits the conclusions that can be drawn. Further research is required to provide conclusive recommendations regarding the effectiveness of interventions with adoptive parents on the outcomes of adopted children.

AB  - Approximately 30% of children in foster care have severe emotional, behavioral, or developmental problems. A systematic research synthesis of empirical studies was conducted in an attempt to identify and classify therapeutic interventions for foster children. Utilizing a treatment protocol classification system, empirical studies were classified according to their theoretical, clinical, and empirical support. A total of 18 studies were reviewed, including a compare and contrast of methodological strengths and shortcomings. In all, 6 out of the 18 interventions may be considered well-supported and efficacious, 3 interventions were determined to be supported and probably efficacious, and 9 were supported and acceptable. Interventions recognizing the unique experience of foster children and foster family dynamics were found to be lacking in the current literature. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The Triple P Positive Parenting Program is a multilevel parenting program to prevent and offer treatment for severe behavioral, emotional, and developmental problems in children. The aim of this meta-analysis is to assess the effectiveness of Triple P Level 4 interventions in the management of behavioral problems in children by pooling the evidence from relevant literature that included Level 4 Triple P interventions. Level 4 intervention is indicated if the child has multiple behavior problems in a variety of settings and there are clear deficits in parenting skills. Results indicate that Level 4 of Triple P interventions reduced disruptive behaviors in children. These improvements were maintained well over time, with further improvements in long-term follow-up. These effects support the widespread adoption and implementation of Triple P that is taking place in an increasing number of countries in quite diverse cultural contexts around the world.

AB  - The Triple P Positive Parenting Program is a multilevel parenting program to prevent and offer treatment for severe behavioral, emotional, and developmental problems in children. The aim of this meta-analysis is to assess the effectiveness of Triple P Level 4 interventions in the management of behavioral problems in children by pooling the evidence from relevant literature that included Level 4 Triple P interventions. Level 4 intervention is indicated if the child has multiple behavior problems in a variety of settings and there are clear deficits in parenting skills. Results indicate that Level 4 of Triple P interventions reduced disruptive behaviors in children. These improvements were maintained well over time, with further improvements in long-term follow-up. These effects support the widespread adoption and implementation of Triple P that is taking place in an increasing number of countries in quite diverse cultural contexts around the world.

AB  - The concept of caring, especially when applied to adolescents, is often overlooked in education, perhaps due to the belief that parents are their primary nurturers or that adolescents do not require nurturing. This literature review examines periodicals, documents, books, and a television broadcast, all produced between 1990 and 1996, that deal with caring strategies in relation to middle and secondary students. Major findings are presented in the following categories: (1) need for implementing concepts of care; (2) historical perspective; (3) fostering care by nurturing adolescent development; (4) care versus control, or care is control?; (5) fostering relationships--the administrator role, the teacher role, the student role, and parental involvement; (6) care and academic achievement; (7) care and curriculum integration; (8) caring programs; and (9) schools and social service collaboration. The conclusion summarizes several of its findings, such as students' need for support systems and training in interpersonal skills, the importance of high expectations for students' performance, and the need for partnerships with parents and communities. Contains 30 references. (EV)

AB  - Amendments to the child protection legislation in New South Wales (NSW), enacted in October 2014, prioritise adoption over foster care for children who cannot live safely with their families. Therefore, psychologists could have an increasing role in conducting assessments and interventions in this field. The purpose of this article is to provide psychologists and adoption researchers with a conceptual model for the psychosocial adjustment of foster care adoptees with a background of maltreatment. A scoping review of the literature on contributors to outcomes for children adopted from care was conducted. A model of adjustment was proposed in which the relationship between risk factors and adjustment is moderated by both adoptive family factors and relationship factors, and indirectly impacted by system supports. Finally, we name some of the psychological assessments and interventions that may have a key role in enhancing the adoptive family resources and parent–child relationships as moderators of outcomes.

AB  - The purpose of this chapter is to identify interventions that may be effective with the majority of children and families served by Child Protective Services (CPS) agencies (i.e., neglected children and their families). While consuming the majority of services, there has been far less attention to studying the effects of intervention with neglect compared to physical or sexual abuse. Because neglect and physical abuse are often found together and because much of the available research has not focused exclusively on neglect, interventions were identified in this chapter if study populations included a history of neglect or some combination of neglect and physical abuse. Interventions were not included if there was insufficient documentation about the nature of the intervention, if the results of the evaluation were not accessible through published reports or papers, if all of the children were living in out-of-home care, or if the intervention's effect on outcomes under study was inconclusive. Interventions were classified and findings synthesized according to positive outcomes in three domains: child well-being, child safety, and family well-being. Because some programs affected outcomes in multiple domains, brief descriptions of programs are included during the first reference. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Caregivers of children in alternative care face a complex range of challenges that can result in placement disruption and poor long-term outcomes. Interventions designed to help carers meet these challenges report positive outcomes. Nevertheless, several reviewers have reported these positive results may be mitigated by limitations in trial methodology. This review aims to systematically review these methodological challenges and limitations, to provide an analysis of the current state of the evidence base for these interventions. A systematic review was conducted into the methods used to evaluate the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for foster and kinship carers. Limitations relating to internal validity, external validity and clinical heterogeneity were identified and synthesised. Seventeen studies met inclusion criteria. The quality of methods used in the included studies is mixed, with high and unknown levels of bias in the majority of trials. Heterogeneity in participant characteristics, intervention aims and outcome measures across interventions reflect the diversity of carer and child needs and make it difficult to generalise results or compare and synthesise the efficacy of different interventions. These factors limit the application of trial results to evidence-based clinical practice. The diverse and complex needs of this population present significant challenges to robustly evaluating interventions for foster/kinship families. Participant needs, theoretical approaches, intervention aims and outcome measures need to be better coordinated, both within trials and across the field. Exploratory research should be used to generate focussed and concrete hypotheses that can be robustly tested in high-quality randomised controlled trials.

Kinniburgh (see record [rid]2010-13169-000[/rid]). Traumatic stress in children and adolescents is a significant social and health issue. This book does not provide a thorough overview of the research evidence around traumatic stress in children and adolescents. It does not provide a comprehensive or comparative synopsis of the various therapies that are used to treat traumatic stress in children and adolescents. Importantly, it is not intended to meet either of these objectives. What the book was intended to do it has done well; namely, provide a brief overview of traumatic stress and a comprehensive series of notes, suggestions, and strategies that the authors have used in their clinical practice.

AB  - Anecdotal evidence suggests that care farming practices have the potential to provide positive outcomes for young people in foster-care and residential care environments. A systematic review (searching; CINAHL, Web of Knowledge, PsychInfo) was conducted to explore how participation in care farming initiatives impacts attachment in children in foster-care and what aspects of care farming initiatives provides positive attachment outcomes. Thesystematicreviewdid not identify any research publication incarefarmingand foster-care. Therefore, it is imperative that practitioners realise that the evidence is lacking when using these types of interventions and keep a close account of the benefit and harms that may be encountered during the interaction processes.

AB  - This chapter addresses the impact of attachment difficulties that children and teens in the foster care system experience with their caregivers, and describes how therapists can utilize a prescriptive/integrative approach to treat them. Play therapists and other child therapists will be helped to understand the unique challenges these children/teens and their foster caregivers confront in forming attachments; ways to utilize play-based techniques that will directly address complex trauma suffered through loss of the biological parents, broken attachments, and other subsequent abuses; and ways to work with a caregiver and family in understanding a foster child's special emotional needs. I describe the need for both directive and nondirective treatment approaches in working with foster care children, as well as how and what expressive arts techniques can be successfully utilized to help heal the emotional hole in the heart of such a child.

AB  - Adoption requires thorough preparations prior to the arrival of the child and support post-adoption among parents, to promote a positive parent–child relationship and healthy family functioning. The purpose of our study was, therefore, to systematically review the literature on pre- and post-adoption interventions for caregivers, and determine the possibility for conducting a meta-analysis. We searched 12 electronic databases and identified 7574 references that were considered for inclusion by two independent raters. Articles meeting the following criteria were retrieved in full-text; studies that examined the effects of (a) a pre- and/or post-adoption intervention, (b) against a comparator (including quasi-experimental studies), and (c) report on outcomes for parents. Finally, we included 10 studies that met our inclusion criteria and which were assessed in terms of reported intervention effects and study quality using Cochrane’s Risk of Bias tool. All studies were associated with a high risk of bias in at least one out of seven domains and unclear reporting on several domains. Eight studies examined intervention effects related to interpersonal functioning; three of which found positive effects. In addition, three studies investigated effects on parenting and stress, respectively; however, only one study demonstrated effects on parenting and none on parental stress. Overall, the study designs, interventions, and results were characterized by substantial heterogeneity, making a meta-analysis unfeasible. In conclusion, the results from the included studies in our review does not point in any particular direction. The most consistent finding across studies was the lack of studies on pre-adoption interventions, and poor design and unclear reporting. Consequently, future studies should evaluate pre-adoption interventions, and need to use more rigorous design, transparent and comprehensible reporting, as well as more homogenous interventions and methods, to move the field forward in support of adoptive parents.

AB  - Looked-after children and young people (LACYP) are educationally disadvantaged compared to the general population. A systematic review was conducted of randomised controlled trials evaluating interventions aimed at LACYP aged =18 years. Restrictions were not placed on delivery setting or delivery agent. Intervention outcomes were: academic skills; academic achievement and grade completion; special education status; homework completion; school attendance, suspension, and drop-out; number of school placements; teacher-student relationships; school behaviour; and academic attitudes. Fifteen studies reporting on 12 interventions met the inclusion criteria. Nine interventions demonstrated tentative impacts. However, evidence of effectiveness could not be ascertained due to variable methodological quality, as appraised by the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Theoretical and methodological recommendations are provided to enhance the development and evaluation of educational interventions.

AB  - Looked-after children and young people (LACYP) are recognized as a high-risk group for behavioural and emotional problems, and additional specialist training for foster carers may reduce such problems. This systematic review aimed to identify and synthesize evidence on the effectiveness of additional training and support provided to approved carers, professionals and volunteers on the physical and emotional health and well-being of LACYP (including problem behaviours and placement stability). Searches of health and social science databases were conducted and records were screened for inclusion criteria. Citation and reference list searches were conducted on included studies. Included studies were synthesized and critically appraised. Six studies were included (five randomized controlled trials and one prospective cohort study), all of which focused on foster carers. Three studies reported a benefit of training and three reported no benefit but no detriment. Those reporting a benefit of training were conducted in the USA, and had longer-duration training, shorter follow-up assessment and recruited carers of younger children than studies that reported no benefit of training, which were conducted in the UK. Whether the difference in results is due to the type of training or to cultural or population differences is unclear. The findings suggest a mixed effect of training for foster carers on problem behaviours of LACYP. The evidence identified appears to suggest that longer-duration training programmes have a beneficial effect on the behaviour problems of LACYP, although future research should examine the impact of training durations and intensity on short-medium and longer-term outcomes of LACYP of different ages. Only training and support for foster carers was identified.

AB  - The current study undertook a narrative and meta-analytic review of the literature to examine the effectiveness of group-based in-service foster parent training programs in reducing externalizing child behaviors. All studies reported a significant decrease in at least one measure of child behavior problems for treatment-group participants. The programs appear to be effective across ethnically and nationally diverse samples and produce similar results for older and younger children, as well as boys and girls. Overall the evidence suggests that group-based foster parent programs are an effective method for reducing problem behaviors among children in out of home care.

AB  - Positive father involvement is critical to the healthy social, emotional, and academic outcomes of children at all stages of development. The purpose of this integrative review was to identify, categorize, and evaluate the potential impact of fatherhood interventions on father and child outcomes. A systematic search of four major research databases yielded 44 studies published between 1988 and 2018 that met study inclusion criteria. The most effective interventions were delivered in the community, with fathers convened in groups. Content focused on promoting positive parenting, co-parenting, and father/child relationships. Consequently, father involvement and child cognitive and socioemotional development were improved. Academic settings were underutilized in the fatherhood interventions in this review. We conclude that in order to optimize healthy child development, school officials must adopt a more inclusive stance toward the involvement of fathers in their children's education. Future randomized trials of fatherhood interventions delivered within school-based settings are warranted.

AB  - This briefing report presents preliminary results of a review of the effects of the 1980 foster care reforms. Particular attention was given to federal incentives for reform built into the requirements for the states' receipt of additional funds under the Child Welfare Services grants program. A total of 116 studies, reviews, and commentaries were identified through bibliographic searches. Interviews with program officials and external experts were conducted. Section 1 discusses background, objectives, and method. Section 2 lists conditions which a state must meet to receive its share of the appropriations for Child Welfare Services exceeding 141 million dollars. Also described in this section are administrative procedures for determining a state's compliance and eligibility for the incentive funds. Section 3 presents findings of the review. Findings concern the issue of whether the reforms have been implemented as the Congress and the responsible federal agency intended and in a cost-effective manner. Findings also concern the nature and extent of the relationships between this program and others, including the constraints or advantages for program operations that are created. (RH)

AB  - Research evidence has shown that in childhood, a secure attachment to a reliable caregiver is important for future mental health and well‐being. The theoretical and research basis for attachment theory continues to grow. As attachment theory has become more widely adopted there are challenges and opportunities both theoretically and in terms of its clinical use. Disordered attachment has been linked to psychopathology including internalising and externalising disorders. However, there are ongoing implications for researchers and clinicians as only the most extreme forms of attachment disorders are included in the current diagnostic systems. A wide range of reliable and validated observational assessments to classify attachment are available. Owing to the growing popularity of attachment‐based interventions there is a need to develop assessments which are practical for use in clinical settings. The use of attachment‐based parenting interventions in clinical settings is increasing as they have been found to be effective and relevant. This growth presents opportunities to further refine these interventions, so they are easy to deliver in clinical practice and tailored to different populations. Attachment‐based interventions are being widely used in Australia, and this has led to a need to understand and adapt the theory, assessments, and interventions to this context. Attachment‐based interventions demonstrate the importance of relationships and provide an important tool to support children and families. For psychologists here in Australia there are many opportunities to develop measures and interventions based on attachment theory that fit into the Australia context.

AB  - The Triple P Positive Parenting Program is a multilevel parenting program to prevent and offer treatment for severe behavioral, emotional, and developmental problems in children. The aim of this meta-analysis is to assess the effectiveness of Triple P Level 4 interventions in the management of behavioral problems in children by pooling the evidence from relevant literature that included Level 4 Triple P interventions. Level 4 intervention is indicated if the child has multiple behavior problems in a variety of settings and there are clear deficits in parenting skills. Results indicate that Level 4 of Triple P interventions reduced disruptive behaviors in children. These improvements were maintained well over time, with further improvements in long-term follow-up. These effects support the widespread adoption and implementation of Triple P that is taking place in an increasing number of countries in quite diverse cultural contexts around the world.

AB  - In programs of therapeutic foster care, youth who cannot live at home are placed in a foster home in which foster parents are trained to provide a structured environment for learning social and emotional skills. Youth in the program are monitored at home, in school, and in leisure activity; program personnel work closely with foster parents, and may collaborate with teachers, probation officers, employers, and others in the youth's environment to ensure prosocial learning and behavior. Evaluations have examined the effects of therapeutic foster care on violence among children with severe emotional disturbance and among adolescents with chronic delinquency. Therapeutic foster care is provided as an alternative to different forms of group and residential treatment or hospitalization for children and adolescents who have a history of chronic antisocial behavior, delinquency, or emotional disturbance. For adolescents with chronic delinquency, therapeutic foster care is regarded as suitable by justice system personnel for those who are not a substantial threat to public safety and can thus be treated in the community. Therapeutic foster care and the more conventional group home care are sometimes regarded as the last alternatives before placement in a secure facility (such as a state training school) is required for public safety.

AB  - The quality of the interparental relationship is recognized as an important influence on child and adolescent psychopathology. Historically, clinically oriented research on this topic has focused on the impacts of parental divorce and domestic violence as primary interparental relationship influences on child outcomes, to the relative neglect of dimensional or qualitative features of the couple/interparental relationship for youth (child and adolescent) psychopathology. Recent research has highlighted that children are affected by attributes of interparental conflict, specifically how parents express and manage conflicts in their relationship, across a continuum of expressed severity and negativity – ranging from silence to violence. Furthermore, new evidence highlights that children's emotional, behavioral, social, academic outcomes, and future interpersonal relationships are adversely affected by conflict between parents/carers whether adults are living together or not (i.e. married or separated), or where children are or are not genetically related to their rearing parents (e.g. adoption). We review evidence and present an integrated theoretical model, highlighting how children are affected by interparental conflict and what this evidence base means for effective intervention and prevention program development, as well as the development of possible cost–benefit models. Additionally, we review policy implications of this research and highlight some very recent examples of UK‐based policy focusing on addressing the interparental relationship and its impact on youth psychopathology.

AB  - A systematic review methodology was used to evaluate research regarding psychological interventions for adoptive parents. The effectiveness of the diverse intervention models scrutinised was found to be mixed with regard to a range of parent and child outcomes. When service user feedback was sought, psychological interventions were found to be acceptable to adoptive parents. Overall, findings were weakened by multiple sources of potential bias in the studies reviewed. Further research is needed, with particular attention to the method, site and timing of outcome measurement, before firm clinical recommendations can be made regarding the relative benefit of specific models of psychological intervention for adoptive parents. Implications for future research are discussed with reference to the unique contextual challenges of conducting clinical studies with adoptive families.

AB  - Reviews literature concerning the physical and psychological characteristics of foreign-born adoptees adopted by Dutch parents, and examined the prevalence of reactive attachment disorder (RAD) in such adoptees subsequently placed in residential care. Foreign adoption is often accompanied by complex problems, including reactive attachment disorder (RAD) and other serious health problems. The continuation of RAD in adulthood results in feelings of psychic homelessness. Dutch parents of 30 foreign-born adopted children that had been subsequently placed into residential care completed the Child Behavior Checklist (T. M. Achenbach and C. S. Edelbrock, 1983) (CBCL), and 40 adoptees (aged 15–20 yrs) in residential care completed a related questionnaire, the Youth Self- Report. As well, 2,148 adoptive parents with children not in residential care and a large group of 10–15 yr old adopted children completed the CBCL. Results show that nonadopted children, adopted boys, and those aged 12–15 yrs displayed more stealing, lying, cheating, vandalism, and other antisocial behaviors compared to controls. Adopted girls aged 12–15 yrs displayed higher scores related to cruel and aggressive behavior. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Over fifty years ago, John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth's research on the developmental psychology of children formed the basic tenets of attachment theory. And for years, following these tenets, the theory's focus has been on how children develop vis-á-vis the attachments--whether secure or insecure--they form with their caregivers. In the therapy room, this has meant working with individuals one-on-one, with the therapist assuming the role of the attachment figure in order to provide a secure base for treating clients' problems that arose from troubled interpersonal relationships in childhood. Here, Daniel A. Hughes, an eminent clinician and attachment specialist, is the first to expand this traditional model, applying attachment theory to a family therapy setting. Drawing on more than 20 years of clinical experience, Hughes presents his comprehensive, effective, and accessible treatment model for working with all members of a family--not simply the individual in question--to recognize, resolve, and heal personal and family problems using principles from theories of attachment and intersubjectivity. Beginning with an overview of attachment and intersubjectivity--the twin theories from which he forms his treatment plan--Hughes carefully outlines, chapter by chapter, the core principles and strategies of his family-based approach. He elaborates on the need to develop and maintain PACE (playfulness, acceptance, curiosity, and empathy)--the central therapeutic stance of attachment-focused family therapy--and supplies tips and sample dialogues for implementing this position. The importance of fostering affective/reflective (a/r) dialogue is covered in detail, as well as helping families to manage shame, understand and embrace the break-and-repair cycle of their interactions, and explore and resolve childhood trauma. Also discussed are the more procedural issues of how to incorporate parents into therapeutic conversations, when and how to question them on their own attachment histories, and how to 'be' with children. Grounded in the fundamental principle of parents facilitating the healthy emotional development of their children, Attachment-focused Family Therapy is the first book of its kind to offer therapists a complete manual for using attachment therapy with families. Extensive case studies, vignettes, and sample dialogues throughout clearly demonstrate how Hughes's model plays out in the therapy room. By showing therapists how to create a bond of psychological safety and intersubjective discovery with parents and caregivers, Hughes reveals how they, in turn, can bring about similar experiences of safety and discovery for their children.

AB  - Children with emotional difficulties often experience problems at school in terms of academic progress and within peer relationships. They are also more likely to continue to experience emotional problems in their adult lives. Nurture groups (NGs) were developed in the 1960s by the educational psychologist Majorie Boxall and their aim is to improve the emotional well-being of children who are struggling, through providing them with reparative attachment experiences. This review aims to evaluate the effectiveness of NGs. Eleven papers examining the effectiveness of NGs were included, as well as two papers which explore the particular communication styles adopted by NG teachers. There was evidence that NGs are effective in improving the emotional well-being of children, but there is a need for higher quality and longitudinal research. There is a paucity of research into secondary school NGs. The review highlighted the NG teachers' use of more positive verbal and non-verbal behaviour. Implications for future research are discussed.

AB  - The Bucharest Early Intervention Project (BEIP) is the first-ever randomized controlled trial of foster care for children who experienced institutional care due to abandonment at or soon after birth. In this chapter, we provide the theoretical and scientific foundations of this study, including the historical context and the study design. Furthermore, we discuss the key psychopathology findings from the BEIP, focusing on associations with institutional care history, the effects of a high-quality foster care intervention, and mediators and moderators of psychopathology following early adversity: (1) We discuss the unique value of conducting a randomized controlled trial of family-based care for abandoned children; (2) We provide evidence of significant intervention effects in a number of psychopathology domains; and (3) We also highlight policy implications from our work, including that children should be placed into high-quality and child-centered family-based care, that this placement should occur as early in life as is possible, and that these placements should be stable across the child's life.

AB  - Although it has been well-documented that parents and children who experience homelessness often have compromised health and well-being, few studies have examined the potential implications of homelessness on the process of parenting young children. In this review, we consider how parents of young children might function under the circumstances of homelessness. We begin with a brief overview of the psychological, social, and medical characteristics of homeless mothers and their young children. Using a developmental attachment perspective, we next briefly review the central tasks of parenting during the first 5 years of life, including emotion regulation and fostering of child autonomy, with an eye toward how homelessness may compromise a mother's ability to complete these tasks. Finally, we provide suggestions for further research that incorporate a developmental attachment perspective and other relevant viewpoints. Because of the paucity of research in this area, our review seeks to provide a heuristic framework for future research, intervention development, and policy. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Aunque se ha documentado muy bien el hecho de que tanto los padres como los niños que han experimentado el desamparo por falta de una casa a menudo han comprometido la salud y el bienestar, pocos estudios han examinado las potenciales implicaciones que el no tener casa tiene en el proceso de crianza de niños pequeños. En esta revisión, consideramos cómo los padres de niños pequeños pudieran funcionar bajo las circunstancias de no tener una casa. Comenzamos con un breve resumen de las características sicológicas, sociales y médicas de las madres sin casa y sus niños pequeños. Por medio de una perspectiva de afectividad de desarrollo, a continuación revisamos brevemente las tareas centrales de la crianza durante los primeros cinco años de vida, incluyendo la regulación emocional y la formación de la autonomía del niño, mirando hacia cómo el hecho de no tener casa pudiera comprometer la habilidad de la madre para completar tales tareas. Finalmente, presentamos sugerencias para investigaciones futuras que incorporan una perspectiva de afectividad de desarrollo y otros relevantes puntos de vista. A causa de la escasez de investigación en este campo, nuestra revisión busca proveer un marco heurístico para la investigación en el futuro, el desarrollo de la intervención, y las políticas respectivas.

Dans ce compte-rendu nous considérons la manière dont les parents de jeunes enfants peuvent fonctionner dans les circonstances présentées par le fait d'être sans abri. Nous commençons par un revue rapide des caractériques psychosociales, sociales et médiales des mères sans abri et de leurs jeunes enfants. Utilisant une perspective développementale de l'attachement nous passons brièvement en revue les responsabilités centrales du parentage durant les cinq premières années de la vie, y compris la régulation de l'émotion et l'encouragement de l'autonomie de l'enfant, en examinant plus particulièrement la manière dont le fait d'être sans abri pourrait compromettre la capacité de la mère à remplir ces responsabilités. Enfin, nous présentons des suggestions pour des recherches à venir incorporant une perspective développementale de l'attachement et d'autre points de vue pertinents. Du fait de la pauvreté des recherches dans ce domaine, notre compte-rendu cherche à présenter une structure heuristique pour les recherches à venir, le développement de l'intervention et les politiques à développer. (French) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Obwohl es weitgehend bekannt ist, dass die Gesundheit und das Wohlergehen von Eltern und Kindern, die Obdachlosigkeit erfahren oftmals kompromittiert ist, gibt es wenige Studien, die die potentiellen Auswirkungen der Obdachlosigkeit auf den elterlichen Erziehungsprozess untersuchen. In dieser Übersichtsarbeit beschäftigen wir uns damit, wie Eltern jüngerer Kinder unter Bedingungen der Obdachlosigkeit zurechtkommen. Einleitend geben wir eine kurze Übersicht über die psychologischen, sozialen, und medizinischen Eigenschaften von obdachlosen Müttern und ihren jungen Kindern. Nachfolgend befassen wir uns kurz, aus einer entwicklungspsychologischen Bindungsperspektive, mit den zentralen Aufgaben der Elternschaft in den ersten fünf Lebensjahren, die u. a. die Emotionsregulation und die Förderung der kindlichen Autonomie umfassen, und mit Blick darauf wie Obdachlosigkeit der Mutter eine eingeschränkte Bewältigung dieser Aufgaben zur Folge haben kann. Abschließend geben wir einige Empfehlungen für zukünftige Forschungsarbeiten, die eine entwicklungspsychologische Bindungsperspektive, sowie andere relevante Blickpunkte vereinigen. Aufgrund des Mangels an Forschung in diesem Bereich, stellt unsere Überblicksarbeit ein heuristisches Rahmenkonzept für zukünftige Forschungsarbeiten, Interventionsentwicklung, sowie politische Richtlinien vor.

AB  - The purpose of this integrative review is to summarize evidence describing delivery of healthcare services to adolescents while in foster care and to young adults after they exit foster care. The long-term, deleterious effect of abuse and/or neglect by caregivers among youth who have been placed in foster care is grounded in empirical evidence demonstrating the relationship between long-term health needs and exposure to trauma in childhood. Evidence is needed to provide culturally-specific care and also to identify knowledge gaps in the care of adolescents and young adults who have been in the foster care system. Peer-reviewed research studies published between 2004 and 2014 that include samples of youth 12 to 30 years of age are included in the review. Eighteen studies met inclusion criteria for the review. Physical and behavioral healthcare needs among youth with foster care experience are significant. The ability to adequately meet health needs are inextricable from the ability to negotiate resources and to successfully interact with adults. Challenges that youth with foster care histories experience when transitioning into young adulthood are comparable to other populations of vulnerable youth not in foster care. Nurses must use each healthcare encounter to assess how the social determinants of health facilitate or impede optimal health among youth with foster care experience. The development of integrated intervention strategies to inform best practice models is a priority for current and former foster care youth as they transition into young adulthood.

The book also details the different types of care a child could enter into within the child welfare system including biological family member placements, short term foster care, long term foster care, supervised independent living, and independent living. According to the authors, a childs inability to adjust quickly can result in a need for replacement. [...]the book offers a resource helpful for developmentalists seeking to understand responses to a variety of family challenges and their outcomes (see MacKenzie et al. 2015; Minnes et al. 2014; Morris et al. 2015; Ponnet 2014), as it reinforces the often ignored reality that families likely had interventions critical to consider in understanding developmental processes.

AB  - Purpose of review This study highlights recent publications on foster care, focusing on concerns for the general pediatrician, including risk factors for foster care placement, outcomes of foster care, healthcare and screening standards, and developmental and mental health problems. Recent findings Many children and youth in foster care have been exposed to complex trauma prior to foster care placement. As clinicians gain a greater understanding of the life experiences of children in foster care, more preventive and supportive efforts can be implemented in the clinical setting, specifically around health and mental health issues. Enhanced awareness of the issues would enable healthcare professionals to advocate effectively for the needs of children in the child welfare system. To address the complex health and socio-emotional needs of children in foster care, several healthcare models and innovative programs for the care of children in foster care have been developed. This literature review for the past year suggests a lack in program evaluation of these efforts. Summary Pediatricians have the opportunity to address physical and mental health issues for children in foster care, and can provide anticipatory guidance to foster and biological parents who bring their children for evaluation.

AB  - In 2008, the Department of Health made a referral to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence and the Social Care Institute for Excellence to develop joint public health guidance on improving the physical and emotional health and well-being of children and young people looked after by the local authority/state. To help inform the decision-making process by identifying potential research questions pertinent to the outcomes of looked-after children and young people (LACYP), a correlates review was undertaken. Iterative searches of health and social science databases were undertaken; searches of reference lists and citation searches were conducted and all included studies were critically appraised. The correlates review is a mapping review conducted using systematic and transparent methodology. Interventions and factors that are associated (or correlated) with outcomes for LACYP were identified and presented as conceptual maps. This review maps the breadth (rather than depth) of the evidence and represents an attempt to use the existing evidence base to map associations between potential risk factors, protective factors, interventions and outcomes for LACYP. Ninety-two studies were included: four systematic reviews, five non-systematic reviews, eight randomized controlled trials, 66 cohort studies and nine cross-sectional studies. The conceptual maps provide an overview of the key relationships addressed in the current literature, in particular, placement stability and emotional and behavioural factors in mediating outcomes. From the maps, there appear to be some key factors that are associated with a range of outcomes, in particular, number of placements, behavioural problems and age at first placement. Placement stability seems to be a key mediator of directional associations. The correlates review identified key areas where sufficient evidence to conduct a systematic review might exist. These were: transition support, training and support for carers and access to services. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Reunification with family is a primary goal in child welfare. However, some children re-enter foster care after reunification, which disrupts the continuity of their care and can impact their cognitive and social development. Using an ecological framework, this systematic review of the literature highlights the risk and protective factors of reentry. Key risk factors included child emotional and behavioral challenges, parental substance abuse, and short lengths of stay in foster care. Protective factors included placement with kin, social support, effective implementation of risk and safety assessments, and targeted pre- and post-reunification services. Understanding who is at greater risk and identifying points of intervention can help child welfare agencies develop, target, and evaluate their services more effectively. As new interventions develop, there is a great need for more research to evaluate their effectiveness and to scale-up evidence-informed practices that can help to prevent reentry to foster care.

AB  - Much of the research stimulated by relational–cultural theory (RCT) has focused on and affirmed the validity of its theoretical framework; this validity is also supported by studies coming from related fields. The burgeoning field of neuroscience has provided wide and convincing support for the core precepts of RCT: We are hardwired to connect; we suffer in isolation and exclusion; we need relationships like we need air and water; we thrive in growth-fostering relationships. Several studies have also specifically confirmed the efficacy of RCT therapy (Lenz, 2016; Oakley et al., 2013). Research on RCT psychotherapy outcomes is highighted. Assessments and evaluations of RCT are summarized. Research on RCT theoretical models is detailed. Specificially, mutality, relational health indices, the Connection-Disconnection Scale, mentoring, humiliation studies, patients with cancer, and parenting are addressed. Neuroscience findings are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Context International adoption involves more than 40 000 children a year moving among more than 100 countries. Before adoption, international adoptees often experience insufficient medical care, malnutrition, maternal separation, and neglect and abuse in orphanages. Objective To estimate the effects of international adoption on behavioral problems and mental health referrals. Data Sources We searched MEDLINE, PsychLit, and ERIC from 1950 to January 2005 using the terms adopt∗ combined with (behavior) problem, disorder, (mal)adjustment, (behavioral) development, clinical or psychiatric (referral), or mental health; conducted a manual search of the references of articles, books, book chapters, and reports; and consulted experts for relevant studies. The search was not limited to English-language publications. Study Selection Studies that provided sufficient data to compute differences between adoptees (in all age ranges) and nonadopted controls were selected, resulting in 34 articles on mental health referrals and 64 articles on behavior problems. Data Extraction Data on international adoption, preadoption adversity, and other moderators were extracted from each study and inserted in the program Comprehensive Meta-analysis (CMA). Effect sizes (d) for the overall differences between adoptees and controls regarding internalizing, externalizing, total behavior problems, and use of mental health services were computed. Homogeneity across studies was tested with the Q statistic. Data Synthesis Among 25 281 cases and 80 260 controls, adoptees (both within and between countries) presented more behavior problems, but effect sizes were small (d, 0.16-0.24). Adoptees (5092 cases) were overrepresented in mental health services and this effect size was large (d, 0.72). Among 15 790 cases and 30 450 controls, international adoptees showed more behavior problems than nonadopted controls, but effect sizes were small (d, 0.07-0.11). International adoptees showed fewer total, externalizing and internalizing behavior problems than domestic adoptees. Also, international adoptees were less often referred to mental health services (d, 0.37) than domestic adoptees (d, 0.81). International adoptees with preadoption adversity showed more total problems and externalizing problems than international adoptees without evidence of extreme deprivation. Conclusions Most international adoptees are well-adjusted although they are referred to mental health services more often than nonadopted controls. However, international adoptees present fewer behavior problems and are less often referred to mental health services than domestic adoptees.

AB  - This review examines the literature on the effectiveness of therapeutic day treatment for young maltreated children (birth to 5-years old). Nine peer-reviewed articles reporting treatment outcomes were included. Two independent reviewers evaluated methodological quality. Programs focused on therapeutic, educational, and developmental goals, and services were multi-modal. Many programs offered ancillary services, such as parenting support. Although there were several shared components, there was no standard protocol that guided service delivery, which has implications for replicating and evaluating this treatment approach. Seven studies used a pre-post design, two were follow-up studies, and three included comparison groups. Given the range of problems attributable to early maltreatment and challenges to providing services for foster children, results suggest day treatment may be an effective approach in improving maltreated children's social-emotional skills, behavior problems, and developmental delays. However, the methodological quality of the studies ranged from poor to fair. Suggestions for future research are discussed.

AB  - This dissertation provides a critical evaluation of Gerald Caplan's Consultee-Centered Case Consultation (CCCC) potential usefulness to help foster parents work more effectively with foster children's issues, enhance development foster parent child attachment security, and reduce factors that contribute to disruption of placement situations. Many researchers and clinicians have discussed the importance of and the difficulties that often characterize the foster parent-child relationship (Sandow, 1998; Hallas, 2000; McQuaid, 1995; Bennett, 2000; Phillips, 2001; Denby et al, 1999; Marcus, 1999). While great strides have been made describing the factors contributing to success or failure in foster parent-child relationships, viable interventions to prevent placement disruptions have not been offered. Proch and Taber (1987) found that foster care disruption of placement typically occurs due to reciprocal alienation and mutually rejecting interactions between child and caregivers. It is an intervention based on the resolution of problematic interactions within the foster parent-child relationship, rather than on a narrow focus on the child's behavior that will most likely be beneficial in disruption of placement situations. An intervention that could be utilized to focus on the foster parents' responses to factors that contribute to disruption of placement is CCCC. The CCCC intervention was developed to work with various kinds of caregiving professionals who in particular situations have old unresolved conflicts from their past reemerge when faced with a client who has similar problems. To date no theoretical analysis or research has been done to determine whether the CCCC model could be applied to foster parenting difficulties. John Bowlby's theory of attachment involving the constructs of internal working models and attachment classifications (Ainsworth, 1978 and Main, 1986) provides a theoretical perspective to understand how parent-child relationships operate and how the CCCC intervention model, when understood through the lens of attachment theory, could provide a vital and effective approach to managing disruption of placement difficulties in the foster parent-child relationship. This dissertation provides an extensive literature review of the significant factors involved in developing and maintaining attachment security between foster parents and children, the role of attachment theory in foster parent-child relationships and Caplan's Consultee-centered case consultation model.

AB  - Foster children frequently experience early trauma that significantly impacts their neurobiological, psychological and social development. This systematic review examines the comparative effectiveness of foster and kinship care interventions. It examines the components within each intervention, exploring their potential to benefit child and carer well-being, particularly focussing on child behaviour problems, and relational functioning. Systematic searches of electronic databases included PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Web of Science Core Collection, the Cochrane Collaborations Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and Scopus to identify randomised or quasi-randomised trials of psychosocial foster/kinship care interventions, published between 1990 and 2016. Seventeen studies describing 14 interventions were included. Eleven studies reported comparative benefit compared to control. Overall, effective interventions had clearly defined aims, targeted specific domains and developmental stages, provided coaching or role play, and were developed to ameliorate the effects of maltreatment and relationship disruption. Interventions effective in reducing behaviour problems included consistent discipline and positive reinforcement components, trauma psychoeducation, problem-solving and parent-related components. Interventions effective in improving parent–child relationships included components focussed on developing empathic, sensitive and attuned parental responses to children’s needs. Given the prevalence of both behaviour problems and relational difficulties in foster families, targeting these needs is essential. However, interventions have tended to measure outcomes in either behavioural or relational terms. A more coordinated and collaborative research approach would provide a better understanding of the association between parent–child relationships and child behaviour problems. This would allow us to develop, deliver and evaluate programs that combine these components more effectively. Protocol Registration Number: PROSPERO CRD42016048411.

Given the prevalence of both behaviour problems and relational difficulties in foster families, targeting these needs is essential. However, interventions have tended to measure outcomes in either behavioural or relational terms. A more coordinated and collaborative research approach would provide a better understanding of the association between parent-child relationships and child behaviour problems. This would allow us to develop, deliver and evaluate programs that combine these components more effectively. Protocol Registration Number: PROSPERO CRD42016048411. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Child welfare policy and practice increasingly emphasize the use of strength-based practice in concert with efforts to reduce identified risks to child safety. Compared with strategies for assessing risk, however, strength-based child welfare interventions lack a robust empirical foundation. Using data from a linked sample of primary caregivers (n = 679) and child welfare caseworkers (n = 327), the present study used path analysis to examine the relationship between parent report of workers' use of strength-based practice and parent investment in child welfare services. The study also examined the role of worker characteristics, organizational factors, child placement status, and parent risk factors. As hypothesized, parents' perceptions regarding their workers' use of strength-based practices robustly predicted their buy-in to services. Furthermore, those parents with a child in out-of-home placement, compared to those receiving in-home services, were less likely to perceive their worker as strength-based or to engage in services. The only significant organizational variable was workers' positive challenge, directly influencing strength-based practices and indirectly affecting parent engagement. Further, parents who reported using substances and those experiencing more economic hardship were more likely to buy-in to services. The findings provide empirical support for the link between parents' willingness to engage in services and the use of strength-based interventions, and contribute to current discussions regarding the appropriate balance between reducing risks to child safety and strengthening family capacities.

AB  - Reviews the book 'Pathways to Competence: Encouraging Healthy Social and Emotional Development in Young Children,' by Sarah Landy. There is growing recognition that a secure attachment, healthy self-esteem, the ability to regulate intense emotions, and the capacity for empathy and prosocial behaviours are important to healthy child development. With this in mind, the book was written by a developmental and clinical psychologist as a reference for child care providers, mental health workers, parents and others working with young children. The book emphasises the importance of both intervention and prevention to support the development of competence in children and there is a strong focus on the importance of attachment relationships between children and parents as the basis for healthy development. The book was developed from the experience of the author in running parenting groups and aims to provide ways to foster children's optimal development, particularly among high risk families. There are 10 chapters in this book. The first examines early childhood development and the effects of temperament. The following chapters look at what are considered to be the nine critical aspects of social and emotional development in children from birth to 6 years.

AB  - Children who have been adopted or fostered are at high risk of experiencing interpersonal difficulties and placement breakdown may occur if these difficulties are not addressed through interventions. The aim of this review was to identify the impact of attachment interventions with foster and adoptive parents on children’s behavioural, emotional and relational functioning. A systematic search process was undertaken; electronic databases were searched; key journals were hand searched; reference lists of included articles were searched; and authors who have published work in the field were contacted. Ten studies met the inclusion criteria. There is some evidence to support the positive impact of these interventions for children, particularly young children aged six months to six years. However, overall, the studies were of relatively poor methodological quality, making conclusions about the efficacy of these interventions difficult. Further research is therefore required to draw clearer conclusions about the impact of attachment interventions for fostered and adopted children.

AB  - Abstract Foster care is the preferred type of out-of-home placement for children and youth when they are not able to live with their own parents. However, placement instability, and its effect on children's behavioral well-being, remains a major issue in foster care. Ten multilevel meta-analyses were performed to examine factors that can affect instability of foster care placement. We included 42 studies (published between 1990 and 2017) examining putative factors associated with placement instability, which yielded 293 effect sizes. Indications of publication bias were found, but the trim and fill procedure confirmed the main findings. Medium significant effects were found for child behavioral problems (r = 0.35), (non-)kinship care (r = 0.31), and quality parenting (r = 0.29). Smaller effects were found for age of the child (r = 0.25), placement with(out) siblings (r = 0.16), and history of maltreatment of the child before placement (r = 0.14). The effects were generally modest, but showed generalizability across continents and time. The findings can be used to improve interventions for the prevention of placement instability in foster care, and further investigations. Highlights • Predictors of placement instability in foster care were investigated using meta-analysis. • Behavior problems, (non-)kinship care and parenting quality showed medium effects. • Smaller effects were found for children's age, placement with(out) siblings, and maltreatment. • Child characteristics may be considered as risk factors for placement instability. • Foster family characteristics may be protective factors for placement instability.

AB  - International adoption has been increasing since the 1960s and is now an important social issue. The majority of these adoptions take place in good conditions but some can be a source of great suffering for the new family. This study seeks out elements indicative of traumatic experiences in adoptive parents' accounts, especially during their first encounter with their child in situations of international adoption. We carried out a review of the literature concerning trauma narratives in order to find which characteristics in the structure of the account are present to a significantly higher degree among traumatized individuals as compared to healthy subjects. We added « lack of coherence » in the account, described according to the paradigm of attachment, measured by Edicode. These characteristics are called « traumatic markers ». Among the seven accounts collected in a clinical population of families in treatment in a consultation specialized in adoption, all contain traumatic markers in their structure. Moreover, the analysis of content in these narratives allows us to suggest areas for reflection concerning international adoption. The recognition of traumatic markers in the stories makes it possible to elaborate, and then to go beyond such markers so as to create a specific, vitalized bond between the parents and their child.

AB  - This chapter examines the evidence base for effective interventions for children doubly in need, in that they are both disabled and living away from home. Children in foster care have well-recognized health, social, educational and emotional needs, but still suffer from the 'inverse care law' and are less able to access services to reverse these inequalities. Children living away from home are particularly vulnerable to changes in their home environment, social interactions, rules and boundaries, family and school contacts. Adaptation difficulties are common, particularly with regard to family norms and expectations, and communication of 'unwritten rules' and the situation may be compounded by placement breakdown. Children with disabilities have similar problems with health, social and educational deficits, invisibility to and poor access to services. The particular problems of disabled children in foster care merit specific attention because of the concurrence and magnification of these common difficulties. Children with disabilities require a range of care services. For practical reasons the present review will mainly focus on children with physical disabilities, developmental delay and learning difficulties.

AB  - Preventing unnecessary out-of-home placement for youth with behavioral and emotional needs is a goal of several public child-serving services, including child welfare, juvenile justice, and child mental health. Although a small number of manualized interventions have been created to promote family driven and community-based services and have empirical support, other less established programs have been initiated by local jurisdictions to prevent out-of-home placement. To synthesize what is known about efforts to prevent placement, this article describes the common program and practice elements of interventions described in 37 studies (published in 51 articles) that measured placement prevention outcomes for youth at risk for out-of-home care because of behavioral or mental health needs. The most common program elements across published interventions were program monitoring, case management, and accessibility promotion. The most common clinical practice elements for working with youth were assessment and individual therapy; for caregivers, problem solving skills were most frequently included; and family therapy was most common for the family unit. Effect size estimates for placement-related outcomes (decreased out-of-home placement, decreased hospitalization, decreased incarceration, and decreased costs) were calculated to estimate the treatment effectiveness of the interventions in which the program components and clinical practices are embedded.

AB  - This is a systematic review of evidence-based treatments for children exposed to childhood maltreatment. Because exposure to childhood maltreatment has been associated with a broad range of trauma-related psychopathology (e.g., PTSD, anxiety, suicidal ideation, substance abuse) and with aggressive and violent behavior, this review describes psychotherapeutic treatments which focus on former broad range of psychopathological outcomes. A total of 26 randomized controlled clinical trials and seven non-randomized controlled clinical trials published between 2000 and 2012 satisfied the inclusionary criteria and were included. These studies dealt with various kinds of samples, from sexually abused and maltreated children in child psychiatric outpatient clinics or in foster care to traumatized incarcerated boys. A total of 27 studies evaluated psychotherapeutic treatments which used trauma-focused cognitive, behavioral or cognitive-behavioral techniques; only two studies evaluated trauma-specific treatments for children and adolescents with comorbid aggressive or violent behavior; and four studies evaluated psychotherapeutic treatments that predominantly focused on other mental health problems than PTSD and used non-trauma focused cognitive, behavioral or cognitive-behavioral techniques. The results of this review suggest that trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) is the best-supported treatment for children following childhood maltreatment. However, in line with increased interest in the diagnosis of complex PTSD and given the likely relationship between childhood maltreatment and aggressive and violent behavior, the authors suggest that clinical practice should address a phase-oriented approach. This review concludes with a discussion of future research directions and limitations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: An increasing number of children are placed in foster care (i.e., a kin or nonkin family home other than the biological parent) due to experiences of physical, sexual, emotional, or psychological abuse, and/or neglect. Children in foster care are at increased risk for a host of negative outcomes encompassing emotional, behavioral, neurobiological, and social realms. Methods: Areas of risk and vulnerability among foster children are described, including emotional and behavioral deficits, impaired neurobiological development, and social relationship deficits. Evidence suggesting the significance of family placement changes and prenatal exposure to substances as contributing mechanisms is presented. Based on a systematic search of the PsycINFO database (to March 2012), eight efficacious evidence-based interventions for foster families are summarized. Findings: Although the development of evidence-based interventions that improve outcomes for foster children has lagged behind the delivery of interventions in other service sectors (e.g., mental health and educational sectors), several interventions across childhood and adolescence offer promise. Service system constraints offer both challenges and opportunities for more routine implementation of evidence-based interventions. Conclusions: Given the increased likelihood of poor outcomes for foster children, increased efforts to understand the pathways to vulnerability and to implement interventions shown to be effective in remediating risks and improving outcomes for this population are indicated. Evaluation of efficacious interventions in countries outside of the United States is also needed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - It is necessary to understand the importance of attachment as a lifespan issue. Attachment is crucial for healthy child development, meaningful adult relationships, and effective and loving parenting. Foster and adoptive parents must obtain the knowledge, skills, and support necessary to facilitate secure attachment with their children. Training and education of mental health and social service professionals is also crucial. Although awareness of attachment issues has increased over the last decade, many child welfare professionals are still not cognizant of its importance for families and society. Combining child development, family systems, and attachment perspectives are effective for assessment and treatment with challenging clients. Our longitudinal outcome studies demonstrate an 80% reduction of children's severe symptoms, maintained over time, with enduring positive changes in family relationships (Levy & Orlans, 1998).

AB  - Treatment foster care (TFC) is a foster family-based intervention that aims to provide young people (and, where appropriate, their families) with a tailored programme designed to effect positive changes in their lives. TFC was designed specifically to cater for the needs of children whose difficulties or circumstances place them at risk of multiple placements and/or more restrictive placements such as hospital or secure residential or youth justice settings. To assess the impact of TFC on psychosocial and behavioural outcomes, delinquency, placement stability, and discharge status for children and adolescents who require out-of-home placement. We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CENTRAL) 2006 (Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2007), CINAHL (1982 to December 2006), PsycINFO (1872 to January 2007), ASSIA (1987 to January 2007), LILACS (1982 to January 2007), ERIC (1966 to January 2007), Sociological Abstracts (1963 to January 2007), and the National Research Register 2006 (Issue 4). Included studies were randomised controlled trials investigating the effectiveness of TFC with children and young people up to the age of 18 who, for reasons of severe medical, social, psychological and behavioural problems, were placed in out of home care in restrictive settings (e.g. secure residential care, psychiatric hospital) or at risk of placement in such settings. Titles and abstracts identified in the search were independently assessed for eligibility by the two authors (GM and WT) who also extracted and entered into REVMAN. Date were synthesised on the few occasions where this was possible. Results are presented in tabular, graphical (forest plots) and textual form. Five studies including 390 participants were included in this review. Data suggest that treatment foster care may be a useful intervention for children and young people with complex emotional, psychological and behavioural need, who are at risk of placements in non-family settings that restrict their liberty and opportunities for social inclusion. Although the inclusion criteria for this systematic review set a study design threshold higher than that of previous reviews, the results mirror those of earlier reviews but also highlights the tendency of the perceived effectiveness of popular interventions to outstrip their evidence base. Whilst the results of individual studies generally indicate that TFC is a promising intervention for children and youth experiencing mental health problems, behavioural problems or problems of delinquency, the evidence base is less robust than that usually reported.[CINAHL Note: The Cochrane Collaboration systematic reviews contain interactive software that allows various calculations in the MetaView.]

AB  - The purpose of this dissertation was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of previous studies that assess the efficaciousness of child-focused psychosocial interventions for children and adolescents with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The specific outcomes that were examined were internalizing and externalizing symptoms and behaviours, social skills, peer relationships, and family functioning. Although studies solely evaluating core ADHD symptom outcomes were not eligible, when provided in an eligible study, data for core ADHD symptoms (inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity) were extracted and analyzed. The aim was to provide clinicians with guidelines for treatment for children and adolescents with ADHD with specific associated symptoms, functional impairments, and comorbid disorders. In spite of identifying 26 studies that met criteria for this review, the data are insufficient to recommend, with confidence, any specific child-focused intervention to treat specific child problems. Results indicated that cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), mindfulness training, and social skills training (SST) interventions do not meet the criteria outlined by the American Psychological Association for an intervention to be considered as a well-established or probably efficacious intervention (APA Presidential Task Force on Evidence-Based Practice, 2006). Nevertheless, there is some evidence that some of the child-focused psychosocial interventions described in this systematic review and meta-analysis are promising and, as a result, that future research with high quality studies is needed to investigate whether these interventions are efficacious. Individual CBT with simultaneous parent treatment might be promising for improving externalizing and internalizing symptoms, parent-child relationships, and core ADHD symptoms in adolescents concurrently on medication. Furthermore, mindfulness training shows promise in reducing peer relationship problems, internalizing symptoms, and ADHD symptoms of adolescents, and might foster better parent-child relationships. Finally, there is evidence from strong and moderate quality studies that SST interventions are associated with improvements in social skills knowledge and assertion in school-age children. In addition, when SST is offered with concurrent medications, parent treatment and teacher consultation, lower doses of medication are required to achieve the same effect on internalizing symptoms, ODD symptoms, social skills, and personal closeness in parent-child relations.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to inform the development of policies and programmes to support children and young people's emotional wellbeing and mental health. It seeks to bring together findings both from recent systematic reviews, and from individual evaluation studies which have adopted a relatively rigorous methodology but whose findings have not to date been included in such analyses. Research undertaken in England is to be prioritised, to complement an existing evidence base comprised largely of findings from US-based research. Design/methodology/approach: Using five key search strategies, studies were categorised into three main categories--'demonstrably effective approaches', 'promising approaches' and 'approaches for which there is little or no supporting evidence'--according to robustness of evidence. Overall, 171 potentially relevant studies were identified, with 20 of these being robust enough for inclusion in the final review. Findings: In schools, sustained broad-based mental health promotion programmes combined with more targeted behavioural and cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) for those children with identifiable emotional wellbeing and mental health needs, offer evidence of a demonstrably effective approach. Early and brief intervention programmes which reduce waiting times for services appear promising approaches and seem to reduce the number of sessions a family require. There is a reasonably strong evidence base to support targeted work with both parents and children. Practical implications: By providing a detailed description of the successful initiatives reviewed, this paper should help policy-makers and practitioners to develop their work. Originality/value: By complementing the relatively narrow evidence base offered by systematic reviews, this more broadly based review offers policy-makers and practitioners in England an up-to-date, context-relevant guide for programme development within this field.

AB  - Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) is an empirically supported, parent-training program designed to teach parents specific techniques to manage the behavior of children between the ages of two and seven exhibiting extreme disruptive behavior. Over 30 published studies (see Herschell, Calzada, Eyberg, & McNeil, 2002b for a review) have lent support to the efficacy of this clinic-based program. The current paper will highlight the need for disruptive behavior disorder treatment for children in foster care, discuss the appropriateness of applying PCIT to children in foster care, and report on the effectiveness of and reported satisfaction with a modified procedure for training foster parents in PCIT skills.

AB  - Dyadic developmental psychotherapy (DDP) is a mental health intervention intended primarily for children with problematic attachment histories. It has received increased attention in the United Kingdom and the United States in the last few years. DDP has been publicized as a research-supported treatment, but a review of research shows that it does not meet ordinary standards for this category. In addition, DDP appears to be based on a number of questionable metaphors that have been used in attempted explanations of personality development and mental illness. Some unanswered questions about the background assumptions of DDP are presented. Caution about this method of therapy is recommended.

AB  - Purpose of review: Ever greater numbers of abused and subsequently fostered children, as well as international adoptees, have led to an increasing interest in the clinical manifestations and treatment options for attachment disorder. Recent work has provided new insights into the natural course of this condition and has examined possible ways of moderating its effects on children and their families. This paper provides a brief overview of selected studies addressing the assessment and treatment of this condition. Recent findings: Infants and toddlers raised in institutions and in neglectful homes have a high incidence of attachment disorders. There seems to be a linear relationship between length of stay in an institution and the rate of attachment disorder and other developmental abnormalities. However, while placement into an adequate home can ameliorate the cognitive and biological delays frequently associated with this condition, it does not seem to assure the development of selective attachments in these children. Furthermore, there are currently no empirical data that can substantiate a clinically effective treatment. Summary: There is increasing evidence that some key symptoms, including excessive inhibition and indiscriminate sociability, previously thought to...

AB  - This article provides a review of the literature in attachment theory, outcomes of being in foster care, impacts of trauma, and long-term attachment outcomes of foster care alumni. Thus far, minimal research has been conducted on the topic of attachment outcomes of foster care alumni in general as related to the field of marriage and family therapy. Attachment outcomes of foster care alumni is an important area to understand for marriage and family therapists because of the connection between attachment and relational functioning. The purpose of this article is to help gain an initial understanding of the experiences of foster care alumni and how those experiences may impact their development of attachment styles. Exploring this topic assists clinicians in providing services to children currently in foster care, foster care alumni, and their families.

AB  - This rapid review seeks to harvest and draw out common findings from intervention studies aimed at supporting the educational and socio-emotional attainments of school-age children and adolescents in foster care. Using carefully executed inclusion and exclusion criteria, data were collected systematically from six electronic databases. The 19 articles included were appraised critically for quality and analysed using qualitative content analysis. The survey of studies revealed an initial need to improve the quality and quantity of research designed to evaluate interventions of this kind. Nevertheless, an analysis of the findings produced sufficient robust evidence to inform policy and practice with regard to 10 aspects of children’s educational and socio-emotional development. The implementation of collaboration models involving all significant parties was especially effective in enhancing adults’ knowledge of and participation in children’s lives, thereby achieving a consistent circle of support. The children also benefited from individualised school-based support, across both academic and socio-emotional dimensions.

AB  - Youth in the U.S. foster care system are prescribed risky psychotropic medications at high rates. In response, state child welfare agencies have developed policies, yet there is little research to inform patient-centered care (PCC) approaches. To fill this gap, we aimed to identify (1) the perspectives of youth in or formerly in foster care and their caregivers and providers regarding how psychiatric care aligns or does not align with PCC, and (2) effectiveness of interventions aiming to improve PCC within this context. We conducted a systematic review of the literature based on PRISMA-P guidelines, searching four databases and gray literature. Eleven studies met inclusion criteria and quality appraisal benchmarks, none of which were interventions. We applied narrative synthesis techniques to six studies that described youth/former youth perspectives. They described a pervasive lack of knowledge, perceived little voice in decision-making, and described imbalanced power between patients and providers and weak therapeutic relationships, whereas feeling understood by providers and being provided autonomy in decisions were helpful. Systemic barriers also contributed to many concerns. We make a limited number of recommendations to leaders and policy-makers based on our synthesis, however, many critical research steps are needed.

AB  - Objective: To review preventive studies of disruptive behaviour disorders (DBDs) in light of recent empirical knowledge on their development.Method: We draw on the results of longitudinal studies of children starting in infancy to examine the onset, development, and risk factors for DBD symptoms. We review randomized controlled trials of preventive interventions provided to families before the child is aged 3 years, with reported outcome measures of DBD symptoms at follow-up.Results: Children who present high levels of DBD symptoms start to do so in the first 2 years of life and have risk factors that can be identified in the mother during pregnancy or even earlier, and shortly after the child's birth. Most preventive experiments have started relatively late after birth and have targeted parenting, with weak effects on children's DBDs. Preventive experiments that have provided intensive intervention to at-risk mothers starting during pregnancy have shown important effects in reducing key risk factors and some of the most severe consequences of DBDs. However, even those experiments have not succeeded in preventing childhood DBDs in the home and school contexts.Conclusions: We suggest adopting a sequential, multitarget, intergenerational, experimental approach both to increase our knowledge about causal mechanisms and to increase our effectiveness in curbing DBDs and their serious lifelong consequences.

AB  - The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 (ASFA) specified the accountability concerns for public child welfare and codified the outcomes for children served in these systems as safety, permanence, and well-being. The drive to define, measure, report, and manage these results has dominated the field for many years, even prior to the passage of ASFA. However, some people suggest that the outcome movement has so skewed attention to results that the practices that produce them have been lost. This chapter outlines an approach toward assessing the external validity of child welfare practices through research reviews of evidence-supported practices and policies across variations in populations, settings, interventions, and outcomes. This is the third phase of the cycle of research-oriented accountability. Child welfare policies based on the best available research evidence balance concerns for process and outcomes and improve agent effectiveness in achieving safety, permanence, and well-being on behalf of abused and neglected children.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Child maltreatment remains a prevalent problem for which notable best practices such as home visitation can be effective; however, most eligible families do not receive these beneficial services. Additionally, there are other promising prevention interventions to effectively address child maltreatment. This review focuses on the recent advances and strategies for child maltreatment prevention. RECENT FINDINGS: Although home visiting does not have a single clearly defined methodology of providing service to children and families, the general supportive framework to improve maternal, child, and family factors makes this intervention the most widely studied and accepted prevention strategy. However, there has been limited effectiveness for most models. The Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP) has provided consistently positive results by targeting families with many risk factors by using highly trained professionals when implementing a research-based intervention. A promising public health approach to parent training (Triple P) may reduce maltreatment and out-of-home placement. Parent-child interaction therapy (PCIT), while a treatment model, is becoming an increasingly important approach to child maltreatment prevention. There may be an opportunity to reduce child maltreatment by enhancing care in the pediatric medical home setting. SUMMARY: Effective child maltreatment prevention efforts exist; however, not all programs provide the same effectiveness, or target the same maltreatment issues. Pediatricians are in a key position to offer support to families in their own practice, as well as to direct families to the appropriate resources available.

The correction is present in the erratum.] With the increase in children adopted from Russia, family therapists in the United States face the dilemma of helping adoptive families care for their child and build a healthy family unit. This article familiarizes family therapists with children’s unique experiences in Russian institutionalized care and its impact on children’s social–emotional development, behavior, and attachment patterns. Implications for family therapists working with families adopting Russian orphans are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Childhood adversity negatively impacts the biological development of children and has been linked to poor health outcomes across the life course. The purpose of this literature review is to explore and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions that have addressed an array of biological markers and physical health outcomes in children and adolescents affected by adversity. PubMed, CINAHL, PsychInfo, Sociological Abstracts databases and additional sources (Cochrane, WHO, NIH trial registries) were searched for English language studies published between January 2007 and September 2017. Articles with a childhood adversity exposure, biological health outcome, and evaluation of intervention using a randomized controlled trial study design were selected. The resulting 40 intervention studies addressed cortisol outcomes (n = 20) and a range of neurological, epigenetic, immune, and other outcomes (n = 22). Across institutional, foster care, and community settings, intervention programs demonstrated success overall for improving or normalizing morning and diurnal cortisol levels, and ameliorating the impacts of adversity on brain development, epigenetic regulation, and additional outcomes in children. Factors such as earlier timing of intervention, high quality and nurturant parenting traits, and greater intervention engagement played a role in intervention success. This study underlines progress and promise in addressing the health impacts of adversity in children. Ongoing research efforts should collect baseline data, improve retention, replicate studies in additional samples and settings, and evaluate additional variables, resilience factors, mediators, and long-term implications of results. Clinicians should integrate lessons from the intervention sciences for preventing and treating the health effects of adversity in children and adolescents.

AB  - "Empirically Based Play Interventions for Children" is a compilation of innovative, well-designed play interventions, presented for the first time in one text. Play therapy is the oldest and most popular form of child therapy in clinical practice and is widely considered by practitioners to be uniquely responsive to children's developmental needs. Play promotes normal child development and can help alleviate emotional and behavioral difficulties. Even so, play-based interventions have often been criticized for the lack of an empirical base to prove their efficacy. In an era of cost-containment, the need to provide evidence of the effectiveness of interventions is increasingly important in order to gain the general acceptance of third-party payers, mental health professionals, and consumers. This book answers the call from professional and managed-care organizations for research-based treatment methods with proven efficacy. It describes a range of play interventions that feature flexibility in service delivery and across settings, child populations and age groups. The editors and their contributors detail vital treatment components, including interventions that accommodate the developmental level of the child, target functional behaviors and competencies in children and parents, use psychometrically sound and clinically sensitive outcome assessments, and define successful outcomes by statistically meaningful methods. Clinicians and researchers alike will benefit from this landmark text and will gain a fuller understanding of the key ingredients for developing future play interventions. This book begins with a foreword: (1) Announcing Empirically Based Play Interventions for Children (Linda A. Reddy, Tara M. Files-Hall, and Charles E. Schaefer).

AB  - Reviews the book, Psychotherapy with infants and young children: Repairing the effects of stress and trauma on early attachment by Alicia F. Lieberman and Patricia Van Horn (see record [rid]2008-06757-000[/rid]). This book provides a comprehensive overview of Child-Parent Psychotherapy (CPP). The authors demonstrate that CPP is a robust theory with practical applications for the mental health treatment of all young children from birth through age 5 years. They continue by describing CPP treatment strategies, with a focus on cultural considerations in treatment. They emphasize the importance of core competencies of the effective CPP clinician, explain the theory behind CPP intervention modalities, and provide CPP clinicians with guidelines on translating theory into practice. An interesting perspective provided in the discussion of therapeutic lapses in attunement addresses common mistakes made by therapists practicing CPP and emphasizes the importance of reflective supervision. Specific issues such as mandated treatment, limits of confidentiality, and CPP with foster parents are presented, which provides a practical resource for clinicians working in these settings. The authors emphasize in their conclusion that their book is not intended to prescribe specific treatment steps but rather to help clinicians develop clinical reasoning within the theoretical context of CPP.

AB  - Argues that attachment issues are sufficiently prevalent in the adopted child that adoption therapists need a knowledge base about attachment theory, issues, and treatment. The effective assessment of attachment hinges upon developing an individual attachment history for both the child and the parent, as well as the parent/child dyad. Therapeutic interventions are often sought by families who are experiencing attachment difficulties. The process of attachment therapy essentially reenacts the attachment cycle. An attempt is made to elicit the child's emotional pain or experience that is blocking present attachments. Handouts are appended. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This document presents a review of recent research literature on eight components in a system of care for children with serious emotional disturbances. It is intended to be a guide and source of information to communities for building systems of care. Components include: residential services (psychiatric hospitals and residential treatment centers), outpatient services (psychotherapy), day treatment services, family preservation services, therapeutic foster care, crisis and emergency services, case management/individualized care, and family support services. The review of each component consists of definitions, summaries of outcome and empirically based efficacy studies, cost-effectiveness data, and (for most components) research needs. Generally, only studies published since 1988 were included. (Each chapter contains references.) (JDD)

AB  - Background: The link between disorders of attachment and psychopathology is well documented. Consequently, a person’s attachment style has a profound effect on his or her development and psychological well-being. At-risk populations such as adopted children are more prone to developing pervasive patterns of attachment, given the maternal disruptions they experience early in life. Objective: The aim of this review was to identify and systematically appraise the current literature addressing a range of attachment-based interventions for adopted chidren. Methods: A comprehensive search of the literature from the most recent decade was conducted. The Cochrane, Ebscohost, Sage, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, and Wiley databases were used. Results: Three randomized controlled trials were included in this review. Two studies were conducted in the USA and one in the Netherlands. All studies made use of quantitative methodologies. Conclusion: Although each article highlighted significant findings in the respective study, there remains a deficit of empirical information aimed at addressing attachment-related behaviour in adopted children through intervention.

AB  - Parenting yields unique challenges for adolescent-aged foster youth. Given their age, past trauma, lack of social support, and lack of resources, foster youth are at increased risk for mental health problems, substance abuse, and homelessness compared with nonfoster youth. Many pregnant and parenting adolescent-aged foster youth are at high risk for perpetuating the same dynamics that they themselves experienced, specifically of having their children placed in foster care. This intergenerational trauma cycle will likely continue without interventions focused on the psychological, emotional, developmental, and social experiences of both parents and children. Moreover, interventions must also focus on those implementing the interventions and working with these youth. Staff working with foster youth have high burnout and turnover rates, resulting in inconsistent service provision and disrupted relationships for the youth. Fostering Relationships is a free, theory-based resource that works toward addressing the aforementioned challenges by promoting the development of healthy relationships between foster youth and staff, and between foster youth and their children. This paper uses a case example, a review of the literature, and discussion of underlying theory to detail the need for relationship-focused intervention and the benefits of fostering relationships in supporting staff and pregnant and parenting foster youth.

AB  - Reviews the book, Attachment handbook for foster care and adoption by Gillian Schofield and Mary Beek (2006). The aim of this handbook is to make attachment theory accessible and useful to foster carers, adopters and practitioners. The presentation of attachment from the perspective of children placed from care is a welcome shift to interest in the development of fresh relationships with unrelated carers. The book is packed with recommended parenting strategies and an optimism throughout that promoting sensitivity, availability, acceptance and mind-mindedness, will have a positive effect on the child. But the authors' approach, positioned more closely to the theoretical than the empirical literature, will need to be complemented by reference to the growth in evaluative studies of foster parent interventions and the hard lessons to be learned about what does and doesn't work.

AB  - Reviews the book, Psychological issues in adoption: Research and practice edited by David Brodzinsky and Jesus Palacios (see record [rid]2005-05979-000[/rid]). This book has 12 chapters which cover a good spread of topics including prenatal effects and early stress exposure on neuro-biological development, international adoption following orphanage care as well as domestic adoption following maltreatment. There are a couple of chapters on open adoption and adoptive parenthood and chapters on methodological issues and future research directions. The investigation of placement disruption rates and problem profiles of the children is moving beyond studying negative and disabling reactions to adversity to thinking about the positive adaptations that children can make. A theme commented upon in the book is that many new adoptive parents are unprepared for handling behaviour problems. Despite the advances in research and the growing enthusiasm for a variety of adoption interventions, the authors are forced to conclude rather bluntly, 'we simply do not know which services are most effective in promoting long-term psychological well-being for adoption triad members'.

AB  - Reviews the book, Nurturing attachments: Supporting children who are fostered or adopted by Kim S.Golding (see record [rid]2008-05678-000[/rid]). The author to write this book,having had a great deal of experience as a clinical psychologist working with looked-after and adopted children and their carers. At an earlier stage,the study of the processes of attachment and bonding in ordinary birth families was considered rather separately from parenting in relation to an older,abused child from the care system,but the field has become more integrated and this book endeavors to convey the improved understanding to current carers. The book is most useful in relating certain common disturbances of behavior to attachment patterns and to the parenting challenges they present. One limitation is the lack of reference to the parenting effectiveness literature and especially to recent attempts to evaluate parent-based interventions with foster and adoptive families.

AB  - This chapter addresses the ways in which adverse preadoption experiences may affect children's development and psychosocial functioning after adoption and about the types of interventions that could ameliorate the situation postadoption. Risk and resilience are discussed in terms of the nature and extent of risk and the resilience or recovery that children display of psychological functions as a result of experiences. The experimental aspect of adoption is then discussed. Adoption has been coined the 'natural experiment,' and several studies of babies born to substance-abusing mothers, reared in depriving institutions, neglected or abused, and adopted or fostered soon after birth have been undertaken, and the findings now discussed within this chapter. The interplay of nature and nurture in this research is addressed, as well as an overview of the effects of preadoption experiences. Concluding this chapter is a section on implications for research and practice. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - A meta-analytic review of the Triple P-Positive Parenting program by Wilson et al., recently published in BMC Medicine, claimed to demonstrate that although Triple P is widely disseminated and adopted, the evidence attesting to the effectiveness of the program is not as convincing as it may appear. Although this review addresses the important issue of evaluation and reporting methods within evidence-based interventions, we contend that the Wilson et al. review contains a number of significant conceptual, methodological and interpretational inadequacies that render the key conclusions of their review problematic.

AB  - Describes various aspects of psychiatric foster care, an alternative to inpatient care that involves placement of patients into host families. A review of the literature on the therapeutic effects of foster care and on the determinants of favorable outcomes is presented, and a case example of a prematurely terminated foster care situation is provided. This case example involving a middle-aged female psychiatric patient illustrates that the patient's integration into the host family is a highly sensitive process that is influenced by the personal history of the patient as well as by the constantly changing interaction between the foster family and the patient.

AB  - Children in foster care are at risk for behavioral and emotional problems that require higher levels of care than other children. To meet these needs and reduce placement disruptions, foster parents require effective parenting skills. Although a number of training models have been evaluated, the findings on the efficacy of foster parent training (FPT) are mixed. We conducted a meta-analysis of the FPT outcome research from 1984 to 2014 to develop a clearer understanding of the impact of such trainings. Fifteen samples (16 studies) were identified that investigated the impact of FPT on self-reported parenting skills and knowledge and child problem behaviors. The mean effect size for child disruptive behavior using a random effects model was small but significant at −.20 (95% confidence interval [CI] = [−.39, −.01], Z = 2.05, p < .05), suggesting that, on average, foster parents who were involved in the trainings reported fewer child behavior problems than parents who did not receive the training. The mean effect size for parenting was moderate and significant at .52 (95% CI = [.22, .82], Z = 3.38, p < .05), indicating that, on average, parents in the treatment groups reported higher levels of skills and knowledge following training than did those in the control group. While these results are promising, more research is necessary to investigate the inconsistency in effect sizes across studies.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence and relationship between mental health diagnoses, type of maltreatment, and physical health diagnoses among children who entered into the foster care system during the year 2004. Using an ex post facto, descriptive research design, de-identified health information derived from Comprehensive Child and Family Assessments was reviewed in order to determine the relationship between mental health diagnoses, physical health diagnoses, and type of maltreatment reported upon initial placement into the foster care system. The findings yielded that the majority of the children entering into the foster care system received mental health adjustment disorder diagnoses. This diagnosis type was identified and recorded for more than 55% of the children during the study period. This researcher was unable to link these findings to placement in foster care, or type of maltreatment reported, nor was this researcher able to infer a cause-effect relationship existed. Further, the rate of detected medical diagnoses was relatively low, and the majority of all reported medical findings were categorized as 'Other,' (e.g., poor vision, malnutrition, ear infections, obesity, and tooth decay) making up over 21% of all reviewed medical disorders, while over half of the records reviewed during this study indicated that no medical diagnosis was determined or found. Lastly, in comparing mental health and medical diagnoses, there was no relationship present, thereby suggesting that there is no relationship between these two variables for children entering into foster care during the study period. Given the large number of children entering into the foster care system on a grand scale, additional research is needed to understand the mental and physical implications of maltreatment and to provide interventions to improve the quality of life for these children and their families pre- and post-placement.

AB  - Millions of children witness intimate partner violence (IPV) in their homes each year, and large percentages of those children are infants and toddlers. Children often continue to live with or have frequent visits with their fathers following IPV. Social services agencies rarely provide services to target the father-child relationship beyond psychoeducational parenting classes. This article reviews what is known about parenting and father-child attachment for men with histories of IPV, describes how fathers' own early childhood experiences and attachments in their families of origin impact their relationships in adulthood, and describes how interventions could be designed and implemented to improve outcomes for families impacted by violence.

AB  - Reviews the book, Attachment theory in clinical work with children: Bridging the gap between research and practice edited by D. Oppenheim and D. F. Goldsmith (see record [rid]2007-05957-000[/rid]). This is a clinical book covering assessments and interventions with mother-infant (or young child) dyadic problems. The chapters have an array of well-known and well-established academics and clinicians. I recommend this book as a stimulating one and of interest to anyone involved in facilitating good enough parenting, working in the field of psychotherapy, with under-5s or working with foster carers and adopters. This is a useful book provoking much thought, resonating with one's own knowledge and experience and opening up ideas about how theory can be transferred to treatment approaches. Clinicians, not to say politicians, urgently need effective early interventions for parent-child relationship problems. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Purpose of review: To review the scale, symptomatology and determinants of mental health problems of children in alternate care, and to consider the need for specialized knowledge and clinical competence for assessment and treatment of these problems. Recent findings: The scale of mental health problems among children in care is exceptional for a nonclinical population, approaching that of clinic-referred children. Children in residential care have more mental health problems than those in family-type foster care, while those in kinship care have fewer problems. Children manifest complex psychopathology, characterized by attachment difficulties, relationship insecurity, sexual behaviour, trauma-related anxiety, conduct problems, defiance, inattention/hyperactivity, and less common problems such as self-injury and food maintenance behaviours. Summary: Children in care have complex symptomatology that is not well represented in present classification systems. There is a need for research into the characteristics and meaning of these complex presentations, and some re-appraisal of present taxonomies. Clinicians should consider these difficulties in their entirety, rather than as discrete disorders. It is recommended that assessment and intervention are provided by clinical teams that have specialist knowledge of children in care, and that use an ecological approach to assessment.

AB  - Most readers will know that a culture and ideas battle is underway within clinical professions and workplaces, around what kinds of knowledge one should use to guide practice. To date, there is remarkably little evidence that existing mental health interventions are effective for children with complex attachment- and trauma-related difficulties. This is not to say that there are no effective interventions. Rather, the present standards, which rate psychotherapy are disconnected from the reality of assisting children with complex difficulties in real-world clinical settings. It is believed that mental health intervention evidence ratings should be based on multiple evidence requirements. Well-designed (randomized controlled trials) RCTs have exceptional methodological rigor and internal validity. No other research design adequately isolates treatment effects from a myriad of potential biases that create an illusion of effectiveness. Few examples of how future psychotherapy RCTs can become more robust are also discusses. Dedicated mental health services for maltreated children, children in care, and adopted children are well placed to lead the push for change, given their specialized knowledge of complex attachment- and trauma-related difficulties.

AB  - In therapeutic foster care programs, youths who cannot live at home are placed in homes with foster parents who have been trained to provide a structured environment that supports their learning social and emotional skills. To assess the effectiveness of such programs in preventing violent behavior among participating youths, the Task Force on Community Preventive Services conducted a systematic review of the scientific literature regarding these programs. Reported and observed violence, including violent crime, were direct measures. Proxy measures were externalizing behavior (i.e., behavior in which psychological problems are acted out), conduct disorder, and arrests, convictions, or delinquency, as ascertained from official records, for acts that might have included violence. Reviewed studies assessed two similar interventions, distinguished by the ages and underlying problems of the target populations. Therapeutic foster care for reduction of violence by children with severe emotional disturbance (hereafter referred to as cluster therapeutic foster care) involved programs (average duration: 18 months) in which clusters of foster-parent families cooperated in the care of children (aged 5-13 years) with severe emotional disturbance. The Task Force found insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of this intervention in preventing violence. Therapeutic foster care for the reduction of violence by chronically delinquent adolescents (hereafter referred to as program-intensive therapeutic foster care) involved shortterm programs (average duration: 6-7 months) in which program personnel collaborated closely and daily with foster families caring for adolescents (aged 12-18 years) with a history of chronic delinquency. On the basis of sufficient evidence of effectiveness, the Task Force recommends this intervention for prevention of violence among adolescents with a history of chronic delinquency. This report briefly describes how the reviews were conducted, provides additional information about the findings, and provides information that might help communities in applying the intervention locally.

AB  - Fostering Now (Sinclair, 2005) is one of the most important books on foster care in recent years. It presents new information and is part of a series of publications on children's services designed to convey research messages to policy makers and practitioners. However, Michael Little argues that if key questions are to be answered and effective services developed, different types of research and new methods of dissemination are needed.

AB  - Objective: To assess the impact of treatment foster care (TFC) on psychosocial and behavioral outcomes, delinquency, placement stability, and discharge status for children and adolescents who, for reasons of severe medical, social, psychological and behavioural problems, were placed in out-of-home care in restrictive settings or at risk of placement in such settings. Method: Electronic bibliographic databases, web searches, and article reference lists were used to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effectiveness of TFC with children and young people. The Cochrane Collaboration’s criteria were used to assess the methodological quality of studies that met the inclusion criteria. Wherever possible, extracted outcome data from similar studies were synthesized with random effects meta-analyses. Results: A total of 5 studies including 390 participants were included in this review. Data suggest that TFC may be a useful intervention for children and young people with complex emotional, psychological, and behavioural need, who are at risk of placements in nonfamily settings that restrict their liberty and opportunities for social inclusion. Conclusion: Although the inclusion criteria for this systematic review set a study design threshold higher than that of previous reviews, the findings mirror those of earlier reviews. While the results of individual studies generally indicate that TFC is a promising intervention for children and youth experiencing mental health problems, behavioral problems, or problems of delinquency, the evidence base is not robust and more research is needed due to the limited number of studies in this area.

AB  - ABSTRACT Foster children experience a lot of stress because of their life histories and changes in their family circumstances, such as foster care placement. It is important that foster parents recognize the early signs of stress in foster children and learn how to act in a non-threatening and understanding manner. Family-based interventions may help in this. In this paper, we report on a meta-analysis of studies ( n= 19) of the effectiveness of such interventions. All studies used a pre-test/post-test design. Both problem behaviour in foster children and the parenting skills of foster parents improved by 30%; however, none of the interventions were specifically intended to help young children (<4 years) to cope with stress. The importance of interventions for young foster children is discussed, as well as the necessary elements these interventions should include.

AB  - Young foster children undergo an early separation from their caregiver(s) and often experience severe stress before placement. However, a considerable part of the children do not show apparent signs of distress, making it difficult for the foster carer to be aware of the amount of stress in their foster child. Potential evidence for using salivary cortisol levels as a dimension to evaluate the amount of stress in young foster children is reviewed. Moreover, the applicability of salivary cortisol in the evaluation of stress-reducing interventions for young foster children is discussed. A systematic review was performed using the databases Medline, Psychinfo, Embase, Ebscohost, and Academic Search Premier. Nine studies were traced in which salivary cortisol was used to measure stress in children placed in family foster care or in adoptive families. Stress in general but also neglect, early loss of a caregiver, a younger age at first placement, and a higher number of placements were associated with an altered hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis function in foster children. Moreover, four studies on the effect of stress-reducing interventions on HPA-axis functioning of young foster children were found. These studies suggest that caregiver-based interventions can actually help to normalize the HPA-axis function in foster children, and that such changes co-occur with improved behavioral functioning. Although the results from the papers discussed in this review suggest that diurnal cortisol with a wake up and a bedtime measurement may be a relevant tool to evaluate stress in young foster children, this cannot yet be concluded from the present studies, because statistical data from the studies on foster care and adoption in this review were not robust and researchers used different methods to collect the salivary cortisol. Still, it is noteworthy that all studies did find the same pattern of reduced levels in relation to chronic stress (caused by maltreatment and neglect of the child).

AB  - Abstract: Adopted children are hypothesized to be at risk of insecure attachment relationships because of their background of institutional care, maltreatment and neglect. We conducted two series of meta-analyses, one using only observational assessments of attachment and one using both observational and self-report assessments. Observational assessments showed that children who were adopted before 12 months of age were as securely attached as their non-adopted peers, whereas children adopted after their first birthday showed less attachment security than non-adopted children (d =0.80, CI =0.49–1.12). Regarding the overall effect for attachment security, adoptees were comparable to foster children. Adopted children showed more disorganized attachments compared to their non-adopted peers (trimmed d =0.36, CI =0.04–0.68), but again were comparable to foster children (trimmed d =0.35, CI =0.02–0.67). Compared to institutionalized children, adoptees were less often disorganized attached. When self-report measures of attachment were included no difference was found between adoptees and their non-adopted counterparts (trimmed d =0.12, CI =−0.02–0.26, 39 studies, N =2912 adopted children). Compared to institutionalized children, (early) adoption proves to be an effective intervention in the domain of attachment.

AB  - Background: Adopted children have been said to be difficult children, scarred by their past experiences in maltreating families or neglecting orphanages, or by genetic or pre- and perinatal problems. Is (domestic or international) adoption an effective intervention in the developmental domains of physical growth, attachment security, cognitive development and school achievement, self-esteem, and behaviour problems? Method: Through a series of meta-analyses on more than 270 studies that include more than 230,000 adopted and non-adopted children and their parents an adoption catch-up model was tested. Results: Although catch-up with current peers was incomplete in some developmental domains (in particular, physical growth and attachment), adopted children largely outperformed their peers left behind. Adoptions before 12 months of age were associated with more complete catch-up than later adoptions for height, attachment, and school achievement. International adoptions did not lead to lower rates of catch-up than domestic adoptions in most developmental domains. Conclusions: It is concluded that adoption is an effective intervention leading to massive catch-up. Domestic and international adoptions can be justified on ethical grounds if no other solutions are available. Humans are adapted to adopt, and adoption demonstrates the plasticity of child development. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - A proper preparation for foster parents to care for abused and neglected children includes effective training and initial diagnostics in order to plan individual treatment. Hence, a basic knowledge about the main psychosocial and developmental problems associated with abuse and neglect and their prevalence in foster children is needed. For this purpose, a systematical literature review and a series of meta-analyses were conducted. A total of 25 studies reporting data on development (n = 4,033), mental health (n = 726), and attachment (n = 255) of foster children in preschool age met the inclusion criteria. The meta-analyses indicated prevalence rates of approximately 40% for developmental, mental health problems, and insecure attachment. Rates of disorganized attachment were estimated to 22%. These findings outline the necessity of an initial trauma-oriented diagnostics and trainings for foster parents that address foster children’s development, mental health, and disorganized attachment.

AB  - In its seventh year of evaluating children's services, the Children's Program Outcome Review Team (CPORT), under the direction of the Tennessee Commission on Children and Youth, continued to collect and analyze data to improve service delivery to children and families involved in state custody. The CPORT evaluation for 2000 collected and organized essential information about the population served, needs of children and families, and the system's ability to adequately perform functions to meet those needs. Twelve reviewers collected pertinent information through in-depth structured interviews with a sample of the population served. Each interview contained questions about the status of the child and family, functions of the service delivery system, demographics, and TennCare (health insurance) implementation. Interviews were conducted with the child, parents, custodial department workers, caregivers, foster parents or care staff in group facilities, court representatives, teachers, and other relevant service providers. Case records were also reviewed. The 2000 CPORT findings indicated a slight decline in the overall status of children compared to 1999. Although most children were in a positive status (84 percent), the emotional well-being factor continued to be the primary factor in defaulting the overall status of the child to negative. The overall service system function declined to 42 percent in 2000 from 46 percent in 1999. The assessment indicator for identifying needs of children and families was the lowest ever (68 percent). The weakest system function was permanency plan design. Recommendations were made for improving services, for training case managers, and for additional resources. (Six appendices include preliminary regional findings, and graphs of data.) (KB)

AB  - Reviews the book, Connecting With Kids Through Stories by Denise B. Lacher, Todd Nichols, and Joanne C. May (2005). The book describes a treatment option called 'Family Attachment Narrative Therapy' that is presented as an effective tool to help children develop trust, heal from past experiences, and learn new behaviors. Family Attachment Narrative Therapy is offered as a parental tool that is non-provocative and non-intrusive, where parents are the primary agents of healing their hurt child-attempting to transform the child's negative inner working model. Its goal is the creation of a new, healthy model that changes the child's view of him/her self, of the adults around him/her, and the world. Replete with examples that assist the reader in seeing how narratives work as well as offering means for constructing these narratives, the text offers another technique for families struggling with difficult and complex issues. The authors' examples are extensive, illustrative, and rich. The book provides a creative, child-centered, and individually-created method for developing these connections between insecurely attached children and their adoptive families. The key is discovering the child's inner working model and meaning of the behavior. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Purpose – This paper seeks to explore three key aspects of the education of children in care: the composition of that population of children and the extent to which they differ from the general population of children due to difficulties most of them have experienced prior to as well as after entering care; issues relating to the identification of causal relationships and the extent of "underachievement" by children in care; and any evidence that care may provide more positive opportunities than is often supposed. Design/methodology/approach – The paper's approach is an extensive literature review of existing published research into social policy and practice of caring for looked after children. Findings – The significant factors that contribute to better achievement for children in care are: placement stability and support at school but for some children therapeutic help and specialist assessments are necessary to improve outcomes. Different analyses produce different results and the scrutiny of children's trajectories indicates better outcomes than one-off comparisons with children not in care. Originality/value – Extensive research has established that children in care achieve less educationally than their peers not in care, but does not explain why. This paper helps to fill this gap.

AB  - Internationally adopted (IA) children are at increased risk for health-related, developmental, and behavioral difficulties. This article reviews the literature on various interventions currently used with IA populations; including health-related interventions provided by medical specialists, preparation programs provided by adoption agencies and other social service organizations, treatments for attachment and behavioral disorders, psychoeducational services, programs designed to improve children’s care prior to adoption, and parent-based initiatives. Surprisingly, very little systematic information exists regarding the effectiveness of interventions designed to prevent and remediate these difficulties in IA children. Recommendations for future research activity and for best practice approaches to intervention are discussed.

AB  - Currently an ecological model for conceptualizing and capturing the refugee parenting experience is lacking. After an extensive review of the literature related to the usages of Bronfenbrenner’s ecological model of child development, a gap was found in knowledge and research centred on describing the environment of pre-resettlement (i.e. pre-flight, flight, migration, camp) contexts and their impact on refugee parents and carer experiences. The culture of the refugee parenting experience may be characterized by disruptions in and alterations to family structure and organization; values and norms; and gender roles. This paper begins by examining the definition and usages of existing ecological frameworks in the 20th and 21st century. Particular attention is drawn to the gaps in the existing literature and an ecological model is offered. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications for practice. The outcomes of this paper suggest the need for practitioners, policymakers and researchers to engage and develop culturally competent, relevant and appropriate interventions (i.e. reconciling differing beliefs and behaviours concerning child-rearing practices; affirming positive parenting practices of these families during engagement protocols and processes; adopting a strengths-based orientation) in the area of child protection whilst at the same time safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children within pre- and post-resettlement contexts.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Services have variable practices for identifying and providing interventions for 'severe attachment problems' (disorganised attachment patterns and attachment disorders). Several government reports have highlighted the need for better parenting interventions in at-risk groups. This report was commissioned to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of parenting interventions for children with severe attachment problems (the main review). One supplementary review explored the evaluation of assessment tools and a second reviewed 10-year outcome data to better inform health economic aspects of the main review.Data Sources: A total of 29 electronic databases were searched with additional mechanisms for identifying a wide pool of references using the Cochrane methodology. Examples of databases searched include PsycINFO (1806 to January week 1, 2012), MEDLINE and MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations (1946 to December week 4, 2011) and EMBASE (1974 to week 1, 2012). Searches were carried out between 6 and 12 January 2012.Review Methods: Papers identified were screened and data were extracted by two independent reviewers, with disagreements arbitrated by a third independent reviewer. Quality assessment tools were used, including quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies - version 2 and the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of parenting interventions was undertaken. A health economics analysis was conducted.Results: The initial search returned 10,167 citations. This yielded 29 RCTs in the main review of parenting interventions to improve attachment patterns, and one involving children with reactive attachment disorder. A meta-analysis of eight studies seeking to improve outcome in at-risk populations showed statistically significant improvement in disorganised attachment. The interventions saw less disorganised attachment at outcome than the control (odds ratio 0.47, 95% confidence interval 0.34 to 0.65; p < 0.00001). Much of this focused around interventions improving maternal sensitivity, with or without video feedback. In our first supplementary review, 35 papers evaluated an attachment assessment tool demonstrating validity or psychometric data. Only five reported test-retest data. Twenty-six studies reported inter-rater reliability, with 24 reporting a level of 0.7 or above. Cronbach's alphas were reported in 12 studies for the comparative tests (11 with α > 0.7) and four studies for the reference tests (four with α > 0.7). Three carried out concurrent validity comparing the Strange Situation Procedure (SSP) with another assessment tool. These had good sensitivity but poor specificity. The Disturbances of Attachment Interview had good sensitivity and specificity with the research diagnostic criteria (RDC) for attachment disorders. In our supplementary review of 10-year outcomes in cohorts using a baseline reference standard, two studies were found with disorganised attachment at baseline, with one finding raised psychopathology in adolescence. Budget impact analysis of costs was estimated because a decision model could not be justifiably populated. This, alongside other findings, informed research priorities.Limitations: There are relatively few UK-based clinical trials. A 10-year follow-up, while necessary for our health economists for long-term sequelae, yielded a limited number of papers.Conclusions: Maternal sensitivity interventions show good outcomes in at-risk populations, but require further research with complex children. The SSP and RDC for attachment disorders remain the reference standards for identification until more concurrent and predictive validity research is conducted. A birth cohort with sequential attachment measures and outcomes across different domains is recommended with further, methodologically sound randomised controlled intervention trials. The main area identified for future work was a need for good-quality RCTs in at-risk groups such as those entering foster care or adoption.Study Registration: This study is registered as PROSPERO CRD42011001395.Funding: The National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment programme.

AB  - Background: Disorganised attachment patterns in infants have been linked to later psychopathology. Services have variable practices for identifying and providing interventions for families of children with disorganised attachment patterns, which is the attachment pattern leading to most future psychopathology. Several recent government reports have highlighted the need for better parenting interventions in at risk groups. Objectives: The objective of this review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of available parenting interventions for families of children at high risk of developing, or already showing, a disorganised pattern of attachment. Methods: Population: Studies were included if they involved parents or caregivers of young children with a mean age under 13 years who had a disorganised classification of attachment or were identified as at high risk of developing such problems. Included interventions were aimed at parents or caregivers (e.g. foster carers) seeking to improve attachment. Comparators included an alternative intervention, an attention control, treatment as usual or no intervention. The primary outcome was a disorganised pattern in childhood measured using a validated attachment instrument. Studies that did not use a true Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) design were excluded from the review. Both published and unpublished papers were included, there were no restrictions on years since publication and foreign language papers were included where translation services could be accessed within necessary timescales. Results: A comprehensive search of relevant databases yielded 15,298 papers. This paper reports a systematic review as part of an NIHR HTA study identifying studies pre-2012, updated to include all papers to October 2016. Two independent reviewers undertook two stage screening and data extraction of the included studies at all stages. A Cochrane quality assessment was carried out to assess the risk of bias. In total, fourteen studies were included in the review. In a meta-analysis of these fourteen studies the interventions saw less disorganised attachment at outcome compared to the control (OR = 0.50, (0.32, 0.77), p = 0.008). The majority of the interventions targeted maternal sensitivity. We carried out exploratory analyses to examine factors that may influence treatment outcome but these should be treated with caution given that we were limited by small numbers of studies. Conclusions: Parenting interventions that target parental sensitivity show promise in reducing disorganised attachment. This is limited by few high quality studies and the fact that most studies are with mothers. More high quality randomised controlled trials are required to elucidate this further.

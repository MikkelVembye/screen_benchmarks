AB  - Among substance-dependent individuals, comorbid major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with greater severity and poorer treatment outcomes, but little research has examined mediators of posttreatment substance use outcomes within this population. Using latent growth curve models, the authors tested relationships between individual rates of change in 12-step involvement and substance use, utilizing posttreatment follow-up data from a trial of group Twelve-Step Facilitation (TSF) and integrated cognitive-behavioral therapy (ICBT) for veterans with substance dependence and MDD. Although TSF patients were higher on 12-step affiliation and meeting attendance at end-of-treatment as compared with ICBT, they also experienced significantly greater reductions in these variables during the year following treatment, ending at similar levels as ICBT. Veterans in TSF also had significantly greater increases in drinking frequency during follow-up, and this group difference was mediated by their greater reductions in 12-step affiliation and meeting attendance. Patients with comorbid depression appear to have difficulty sustaining high levels of 12-step involvement after the conclusion of formal 12-step interventions, which predicts poorer drinking outcomes over time. Modifications to TSF and other formal 12-step protocols or continued therapeutic contact may be necessary to sustain 12-step involvement and reduced drinking for patients with substance dependence and MDD.

AB  - The At Home / Chez Soi demonstration project was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the Housing First model in 5 Canadian cities. Using a randomized controlled trial design, this study evaluates the impact of this project on the use of health services by people with severe and persistent mental health problems and a history of homelessness in the greater Moncton area. The sample comprised 193 homeless persons, 95 in the control group and 98 in the treatment group. The results show a significant difference between the 2 groups only in the number of days of hospitalization, particularly in the psychiatric unit. Factors associated with the use of health services by people who are homeless and who have severe mental health problems need to be further investigated. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Le projet At Home / Chez Soi fut conçu afin d'évaluer l'efficacité du modèle Logement d'abord dans 5 villes canadiennes. Utilisant un devis expérimental, la présente étude examine l'effet du programme d'intervention At Home / Chez Soi sur le recours aux services de santé par des personnes itinérantes de la région de Moncton qui ont des troubles psychiatriques sévères et persistants. L'échantillon comprend 193 personnes itinérantes, soit 95 dans le groupe témoin et 98 dans le groupe intervention. Les résultats démontrent une différence significative entre les 2 groupes seulement en ce qui concerne le nombre de jours d'hospitalisation, en particulier à l'unité psychiatrique. Les facteurs associés au recours aux services de santé mentale par les personnes itinérantes ayant des problèmes sévères de santé mentale doivent être étudiés plus à fond.

AB  - Research to date suggests that the best treatment for many mental disorders is provided through the combination of medications and psychotherapy (e.g., Hollon, Thase, & Markowitz, 2002). However, the majority of studies supporting this point have been done utilizing highly restricted, controlled samples that may not accurately reflect the way mental illness is treated in the community. The present study attempted to replicate those findings in an outpatient community clinic. One hundred seventy-four adult clients who presented to a community clinic were rated as to their illness severity at both intake and termination of therapy using the Clinical Global Impression Scale and the Global Assessment of Functioning. These clients were divided into groups based on whether or not they took psychotropic medications at any point during therapy. Results showed that clients who took medications fared no better than clients who did not. These preliminary findings suggest that the combination of medications and psychotherapy may not be as effective in the "real world" as prior studies have implied, and point to the need for further research utilizing community samples.

AB  - Describes a sufficient (rather than comprehensive) model of integrated outpatient treatment for schizophrenic patients with psychoactive substance use disorders that meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-III-Revised (DSM-III-R) criteria. The authors discuss the need for integrated services by (1) examining the deficiency of separate services for dual diagnosis patients; (2) examining the possible effects of integrated services; and (3) discussing a pilot outpatient program for schizophrenic substance abusers, using supportive group psychotherapy and psychoeducation. Results suggest that the program was effective in engaging patients in treatment, reducing substance abuse, and improving psychiatric symptoms.

AB  - Background: Social skills training is commonly used for children and adolescents with ASD. There are few studies considering its efficacy in adults and those that exist usually compare it to standard treatment, as opposed to controlling for non-specific improvements that may result from receiving an intervention. We conducted a pilot study to investigate whether social skills training is more effective than non-specific support for adults with ASD. Methods: 19 adults with ASD were randomised to either social skills training or non-specific social interaction groups for 16 weeks. The Reading the Mind in the Eyes and Reading the Mind in the Voice Tasks were used to assess social cognition while the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-2) and the Weiss Functional Impairment Rating Scale (WFIRS-S) were used to measure real-life change pre- and post-treatment. Results: Taken together, both groups improved across the course of the study on the ‘Eyes’ task (p=0.049), SRS-2 (p=0.03) and WFIRS-S (p=0.053). However, there were no significant differences between the groups. There was some trend-level evidence that the social skills group improved more on the tests of social cognition (p≤0.1 for group x time interaction). This was not the case for the SRS-2 (p=0.25) and for the WFIRS-S there was a trend for the social interaction group to show greater improvements (p=0.07). Conclusions: This study did not show clear evidence of benefit from social skills training compared to facilitated social interaction, although larger studies are required to draw firm conclusions about efficacy.

AB  - Objective: To examine whether randomization to permanent supportive housing (PSH) versus usual care reduces the use of acute health care and other services among chronically homeless high users of county-funded services.Data Sources: Between 2015 and 2019, we assessed service use from Santa Clara County, CA, administrative claims data for all county-funded health care, jail and shelter, and mortality.Study Design: We conducted a randomized controlled trial among chronically homeless high users of multiple systems. We compared postrandomization outcomes from county-funded systems using multivariate regression analysis.Data Collection: We extracted encounter data from an integrated database capturing health care at county-funded facilities, shelter and jails, county housing placement, and death certificates.Principal Findings: We enrolled 423 participants (199 intervention; 224 control). Eighty-six percent of those randomized to PSH received housing compared with 36 percent in usual care. On average, the 169 individuals housed by the PSH intervention have remained housed for 28.8 months (92.9 percent of the study follow-up period). Intervention group members had lower rates of psychiatric ED visits IRR 0.62; 95% CI [0.43, 0.91] and shelter days IRR 0.30; 95% CI [0.17, 0.53], and higher rates of ambulatory mental health services use IRR 1.84; 95% CI [1.43, 2.37] compared to controls. We found no differences in total ED or inpatient use, or jail. Seventy (37 treatment; 33 control) participants died.Conclusions: The intervention placed and retained frequent user, chronically homeless individuals in housing. It decreased psychiatric ED visits and shelter use, and increased outpatient mental health care, but not medical ED visits or hospitalizations. Limitations included more than one-third of usual care participants received another form of subsidized housing, potentially biasing results to the null, and loss of power due to high death rates. PSH can house high-risk individuals and reduce emergent psychiatric services and shelter use. Reductions in hospitalizations may be more difficult to realize.

AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the influence of a 6-week group exercise intervention in the adjunctive treatment of depression. A total of thirty-one subjects were recruited from WPIC's Bellefield Clinic of the Adult Service Line and the surrounding community. Subjects were between the ages of 25 and 60 years, had a diagnosis of depression (dysthymic disorder, major depressive disorder, depressive disorder not otherwise specified, or bipolar disorder) according to the DSM-IV by a licensed therapist, and were enrolled in a standardized outpatient treatment program consisting of antidepressant medication and psychotherapy. Subjects were randomly assigned to either a 6-week exercise group intervention or a social control group (stress coping intervention). Groups were matched for group exposure, meeting for one hour, two nights a week. The IDS-SR was used to assess changes in depressive symptoms as a result of the intervention at 0 and 6-weeks. Additionally, the Q-LES-Q and the Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale were used to assess changes in quality of life and feelings of loneliness, respectively, as a result of the intervention at 0 and 6-weeks. The main hypothesis was that subjects randomized to the group exercise intervention would experience a significant decrease in depressive symptoms, as assessed by the IDS-SR, and a significant increase in quality of life, as assessed by the Q-LES-Q, when compared to the social control group. An additional hypothesis was that subjects in the group exercise intervention and the social control group would experience a significant and equal decrease in feelings of loneliness as assessed by the Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale. Statistical analysis included separate two-way (group x time) repeated measures ANOVA to determine between and within group mean differences on the IDS-SR, Q-LES-Q, and the Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale. Results indicated that subjects in the group exercise intervention and the social control group experienced a decrease in symptoms of depression, whereas no significant differences in either group for quality of life or feelings of loneliness were found. Results were the same for the intent-to-treat analysis and the non-intent-to-treat analysis. It was concluded that social interaction may have contributed to the positive findings concerning symptoms of depression. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Syrian refugees resettled in Turkey show a high prevalence of symptoms of mental disorders. Problem Management Plus (PM+) is an effective psychological intervention delivered by non-specialist health care providers which has shown to decrease psychological distress among people exposed to adversity. In this single-blind pilot randomised controlled trial, we examined the methodological trial procedures of Group PM+ (gPM+) among Syrian refugees with psychological distress in Istanbul,Turkey, and assessed feasibility, acceptability, perceived impact and the potential cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Methods: Refugees with psychological distress (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, K10 > 15) and impaired psychosocial functioning (World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule, WHODAS 2.0> 16) were recruited from the community and randomised to either gPM+ and enhanced care as usual (E-CAU) (n = 24) or E-CAU only (n = 22). gPM+ comprised of five weekly group sessions with eight to ten participants per group. Acceptability and feasibility of the intervention were assessed through semi-structured interviews. The primary outcome at 3-month follow-up was symptoms of depression and anxiety (Hopkins Symptoms Checklist-25). Psychosocial functioning (WHODAS 2.0), symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder and self-identified problems (Psychological Outcomes Profiles, PSYCHLOPS) were included as secondary outcomes. A modified version of the Client Service Receipt Inventory was used to document changes in the costs of health service utilisation as well as productivity losses. Results: There were no barriers experienced in recruiting study participants and in randomising them into the respective study arms. Retention in gPM+ was high (75%). Qualitative analyses of the interviews with the participants showed that Syrian refugees had a positive view on the content, implementation and format of gPM+. No adverse events were reported during the implementation. The study was not powered to detect an effect. No significant difference between gPM+ and E-CAU group on primary and secondary outcome measures, or in economic impacts were found. Conclusions: gPM+ delivered by non-specialist peer providers seemed to be an acceptable, feasible and safe intervention for Syrian refugees in Turkey with elevated levels of psychological distress. This pilot RCT sets the stage for a fully powered RCT.

AB  - INTERVENTION: This project aims to examine the efficacy, mechanisms of change, and cost‐effectiveness of a novel group cognitive behavioural therapy, imagery‐enhanced cognitive behavioural group therapy (IE‐CBGT), compared to gold standard verbally‐based cognitive behavioural group therapy (VB‐CBGT), in patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD). Both protocols target the same maintaining factors (negative cognitions, avoidance, safety behaviours, self‐focused attention, negative beliefs about how others’ perceive them, and core beliefs), but differ critically in the mode within which they are modified. The imagery‐enhanced protocol encourages patients to focus on multi‐sensory negative social images as a key maintaining factor and imagery monitoring, rather than focusing on verbal thoughts and thought monitoring. Cognitive challenging occurs within imagery rather than only using traditional verbal‐linguistic methods. Behavioural experiment predictions are guided by negative imagery rather than thoughts, new information is incorporated into imagery, and coping imagery is constructed. Imagery exercises are included in all within‐session behavioural experiments. Negative core beliefs are identified and challenged in IE‐GCT via past imagery rescripting techniques, rather than more traditional verbal cognitive methods. Both protocols involve 12, 2‐hour group therapy sessions (once/week) plus a one month group‐based follow‐up session of 2 hours duration. Groups comprise of between 6 and 12 patients. All treatment sessions will be facilitated by a registered psychologist with a masters or doctoral degree in clinical psychology. Clinicians will maintain an attendance register. Protocol adherence and homework completion will be monitored throughout the trial through coding of in‐session audio recordings and use of the Homework Rating Scale (HRS‐II), respectively. Additionally, the Working Alliance Inventory (WAI) and Gross Cohesion Scale will be used to measure therapist‐client alliance and cohesiveness/bond amongst group members. CONDITION: Social anxiety disorder PRIMARY OUTCOME: Clinician‐rated anxiety severity. Clinical severity of each disorder will be rated on a 0–8 scale reflecting severity relative to other people with the disorder and life impact. Diagnosis of social anxiety disorder on structured clinical interview (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM‐5 [SCID‐5]). Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS) ‐ a 20‐item measure of interaction/performance anxiety with high internal and test‐retest reliability, SECONDARY OUTCOME: Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation (BFNE) ‐ a self‐report measure of fear or worry about being negatively evaluated. Cognitive Avoidance Questionnaire (CAQ) ‐ a key imagery‐enhanced group cognitive therapy‐specific mediator measuring imagery suppression; tendency to actively transform distressing images into less distressing verbal thoughts. Depression severity using PROMIS scale of depressive symptomatology. The PROMIS scale is an 8‐item scale of depression severity. Duration of observable safety (anxiety‐mediated) behaviours assessed during a social speech task, the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). ; ; In the TSST participants are asked to perform an impromptu speech about a topic of their own choosing to the experimenter and a video camera. Participants are allowed to talk on any topic that is of personal relevance to them aside from their participation in the research. Safety behaviours will be rated by trained coders who are blind to group allocation. Fear of Positive Evaluation (FPE) ‐ measures fear and distress related to positive evaluation from others, a core feature of social anxiety. For health economic analysis the primary outcome measure will be the EQ‐5D‐5L, a standardised self‐report measure of health‐related quality of life providing a single value for health status. Group Cohesion Scale (GCS) ‐ a brief 9‐item measure designed to assess the degree of perceived cohesiveness and bond among members of a group. Homework Rating Scale II ‐ Client Version (HRS‐II) ‐ consists of 12 questions regarding homework completion over the past week. Negative Self Portrayal Scale (NSPS) ‐ measures concern about perceived negative self‐attributes (e.g., lacking personality, stuttering) exposed for public scrutiny in social situations. Probability and cost tracking measure. Instruction: You are asked to give a 3‐minute speech on a topic of your choice. Your speech will be video‐taped and watched by two people who will rate various aspects of your performance. What do you most fear happening in this situation? [participant writes a feared outcome]. Participant is then asked, if you were going to enter this situation today, How likely is it that this would happen? (0 = not at all likely, 4 = moderately likely, 8 = extremely likely) and How bad would it be for you if this happened? (0 = not at all bad, 4 = moderately bad, 8 = extremely bad.). Psychophysiological responding (heart rate variability and skin conductance level) will also be obtained throughout the TSST. ; ; The procedure begins with a 5 min baseline rest during which physiological activity is recorded. They are then given instructions for the subsequent task and 3 min of preparation time. After this they are instructed to talk for 5 min. The task concludes with a further 3 min baseline to assess recovery to baseline responding. ; ; Skin conductance level (SCL) will be recorded with two disposable electrodes attached to the thenar and hypothenar prominences of their non‐dominant hand. ; ; Heart rate variability will be measured via electrocardiogram (ECG). ; ; Respiration will be recorded using a chest strap transducer attached to the participant’s lower chest. It is used as a control measure for the main measures SCL and ECG. Repetitive Thinking Questionnaire (RTQ‐10) ‐ a transdiagnostic measure of repetitive negative thinking with high internal reliability and sensitivity to change. Self Consciousness Scale (SCS) ‐ a measure of self‐focussed attention, including items assessing tendency to take an external, observer’s perspective during interactions. Self‐Beliefs Related to Social Anxiety Scale (SBSA) ‐ assesses three types of beliefs characteristic of social phobia (high standards, and conditional and unconditional beliefs). Social Phobia Scale‐6 (SPS) ‐ a 6‐item measure of performance anxiety. Subtle Avoidance Frequency Examination (SAFE) ‐ measures safety behaviours and subtle avoidance. TiC‐P Adults Questionnaire on Medical Consumption and Productivity Losses associated with Psychiatric Illness ‐ measures health services used by patients and costs arising as a result of productivity losses. Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ) ‐ provides a valid and highly reliable psychometric measure of self‐reported vividness of visual imagery. Working Alliance Inventory (WAI) ‐ a 36‐item measure of therapist‐client alliance. INCLUSION CRITERIA: At least 18 years of age, principle diagnosis of social anxiety disorder (as assessed by the SCID‐5), Stable medications for at least 1 month, and willingness to be randomised.

AB  - INTERVENTION: This will be delivered by qualified psychologists, who will be trained in the treatment package. The psychologists will receive weekly supervision and fidelity will be assessed by video‐taping a random selection (n=20) of sessions. Treatment will consist of both individual and group psychotherapy, as described below. Individual sessions will comprise of tailored, trans‐diagnostic CBT; group sessions (co‐facilitated with an Indigenous Health Worker; IHW) will involve a focus on skills practice, including yarning about successes and difficulties in application, and obtaining peer support and reinforcement in this area. Individual Treatment: The first one or two sessions will involve the assessment of cognitive and behavioural factors maintaining the disorder. As the SCID‐I study has demonstrated that these assessments are typically lengthy, these treatment sessions will be up to 90‐minutes. The treating psychologist will then develop a tailored treatment plan, in consultation with a senior clinical psychologist and the participant. Changes in symptomatology may warrant adjustments or changes to the treatment plan. Up to 12 sessions of individual treatments will be provided by qualified psychologists using a combination of face‐to‐face delivery for primary treatment and telephone delivery to facilitate skills practice. Group Treatment: The efficacy of CBT relies on the use of â€˜homeworkâ€™ or skills practice to maintain treatment effects. We believe that skills practice will be difficult for many Indigenous participants so we will use group sessions for practice (in addition to telephone contacts as above). As such, a â€˜Yarning Skills Groupâ€™ is planned as an adjunct to individual sessions. The purpose of this group is to build on skills learnt in individual sessions, allow peer support in a positive supportive environment, and focus on personal and group strengths. Group treatment aims to be therapeutic, strengths‐based, and culturally friendly by: using CONDITION: Depression; ; Depression Mental Health ‐ Depression PRIMARY OUTCOME: The difference between changes in the control and intervention groups on depression scores as measured by BDI‐II from baseline to 6 months.[6 months post baseline] SECONDARY OUTCOME: Anxiety: Changes in Beck Anxiety Index (BAI) [Baseline to 6 months and baseline to 12 months ] Changes in number of mental health diagnoses as determined by the patients medical records..

AB  - INTERVENTION: An assessment then 4x 2 hour weekly sessions of face to face group transdiagnostic cognitive behavioural therapy (Group TCBT) for anxiety and depression. Maximum of 10 participants/group. Group TCBT will be facilitated by an experienced psychologist familiar with Group TCBT in various forms and co‐facilitated by a community therapist (nurse/Occupational Therapist/Social Worker/ or Psychologist) familiar with individual brief intervention counselling (the usual intervention for patients with anxiety and depression in the community). The Group TCBT will follow a manual developed specifically for this group by the experienced psychologists. The community therapist will participate in a 1 day training programme prior to group commencement. Content of the group will cover the following content: Socialisation to the group, goal setting and motivation, introduction to the TCBT model, understanding the function of emotion, emotion‐driven behaviours and the role of avoidance, behavioural activation, learning to observe emotions and thoughts (mindfulness exercises). Thinking biases and thought restructuring, behavioural experiments, awareness of and tolerating physiological sensations (including interoceptive exposures), and relapse prevention. A treatment integrity checklist will be used to ensure all planned content is covered during each group programme. Attendance at groups will be monitored. Assessments for the groups will occur in the month prior to group commencement. CONDITION: anxiety;depression; ; anxiety ; depression Mental Health ‐ Anxiety Mental Health ‐ Depression PRIMARY OUTCOME: Acceptability of treatment and study protocol measured by:; ; If fewer than 75% participants complete psychological measures at the 4 time points (baseline, 3,6, and 12 months) in both groups, the study will be deemed unfeasible.; ; Outcome measures are the PHQ‐9 and GAD‐7. These will be completed face to face at the assessment and then through telephone contact with the research assistant for subsequent time points.[12 months following baseline assessment.] feasibility of engagement measured by:; ; If fewer than 50% of patients approached agree to participate, this will be deemed unfeasible. ; ; Group TCBT co‐facilitators will ring all patients identified as potential participants through the triage process. The number of patients identified will be tracked and recorded in an Excel spreadsheet or similar. Actual numbers of patients who agree to participate following phone contact and face to face meeting will also be recorded and the percentage of patients who agree to participate calculated. ; [baseline] Feasibility of study intervention measured by: ; ; If greater than 50% of patients fail to complete at least 3/4 group treatment sessions, we will deem the trial unfeasible. Group attendance will tracked by taking a role and recorded for each group.[1 month (therapy completion)] SECONDARY OUTCOME: Acceptability of study intervention and design for Maori participants measured by sub‐group analysis of recruitment, treatment completion, drop‐out rates, and satisfaction ratings.[Baseline and 3,6,12 months] Reliable recovery. The definition of reliable recovery is taken from the Improved Access to Psychological Therapy (IAPT) study in the UK. ; ; Reliable recovery is measured by scoring above clinical cut‐off for PHQ‐9 and GAD‐7 at baseline assessment, scoring below clinical cut‐off for PHQ‐( and GAD‐& at the end of treatment, and showed reliable improvement over treatment (pre‐post change in PHQ‐9>5,3 and GAD‐7>3,53) (these are minimal change criteria and not results per se).[3, 6, and 12 months post baseline assessment] This is a composite measure measuring the acceptability and effectiveness of training group trans‐diagnostic facilitators. This will be assessed by a brief qualitative survey still to be designed specifically for the study.[Immediately following the 1 day training session.] INCLUSION CRITERIA: All patients referred for psychological assistance with anxiety and depression by GPs to brief intervention services and deemed appropriate for psychological intervention by brief intervention services will be eligible for study entry.

AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the level of additional treatment services obtained by patients enrolled in the NIDA Cocaine Collaborative Study, a multi-center efficacy trial of four treatments for cocaine dependence, and to determine whether these services impact treatment outcome. Cocaine-dependent patients (N = 487) were recruited at five sites and randomly assigned to six months of one of four psychosocial treatments. Assessments were made at baseline, monthly during treatment, and at follow-ups at 9, 12, 15, and 18 months post-randomization. On average, patients received little or no additional treatment services during active treatment (first six months), but the rate of obtaining most services increased during the follow-up phase (month 7 to 18). In general, the treatment groups did not differ in the rates of obtaining non-protocol services. For all treatment groups, patients with greater psychiatric severity received more medical and psychiatric services during active treatment and follow-up. Use of treatment services was unrelated to drug use outcomes during active treatment. However, during the follow-up period, increased use of psychiatric medication, twelve-step attendance, and twelve-step participation was related to less drug use. The results suggest that during uncontrolled follow-up phases, additional non-protocol services may potentially confound the interpretation of treatment group comparisons in drug use outcomes.

AB  - The authors applied cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for depression using the Healthy Management of Reality treatment manual. This 16-week group treatment comprised four 4-week modules: thoughts (cognitive restructuring), activities (behavioral activation), people (interpersonal skills training), and health (addresses physical health and depression). They illustrated the use of the culture-sensitive treatment manuals by way of the member characteristics and clinical process of a Spanish-language CBT group for depression. They highlighted the challenges and satisfactions of working with a Spanish-speaking population in the public sector, and focused on how culture and socioeconomic status influence patients, and how to adapt treatment to these factors. Last, they demonstrated how technological advances integrate with culture-sensitive, evidence-based treatments to better serve this population and reduce disparities.

AB  - Background: Emotional disorders are common, and they have become more prevalent since the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to a high attendance burden at the specialized level, most emotional disorders in Spain are treated in primary care, where they are usually misdiagnosed and treated using psychotropic drugs. This contributes to perpetuate their illness and increase health care costs. Following the IAPT programme and the transdiagnostic approach, the PsicAP project developed a brief group transdiagnostic cognitive-behavioural therapy (tCBT) as a cost-effective alternative. However, it is not suitable for everyone; in some cases, one-on-one sessions may be more effective. The objective of the present study is to compare, in cost-benefit terms, group and individual tCBT with the treatment usually administered in Spanish primary care (TAU). Methods: A randomized, controlled, multicentre, and single-blinded trial will be performed. Adults with mild to moderate emotional disorders will be recruited and placed in one of three arms: group tCBT, individual tCBT, or TAU. Medical data and outcomes regarding emotional symptoms, disability, quality of life, and emotion regulation biases will be collected at baseline, immediately after treatment, and 6 and 12 months later. The data will be used to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness and cost-utility ratios. Discussion: This trial aims to contribute to clinical practice research. The involvement of psychologists in primary care and the implementation of a stepped-care model for mental disorders are recommended. Group therapy and a transdiagnostic approach may help optimize health system resources and unblock waiting lists so that people can spend less time experiencing mental health problems.

AB  - This study examined whether starting with the behavioural component of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) decreases the drop-out rate in outpatients with comorbid anxiety and depression. Retrospective data were collected on 60 patients with anxiety and depression. Mean values of different psychosocial assessment scales during screening, mid-session and discharge session were compared between the patients receiving and not receiving any type of behavioural interventions and among the patients receiving different types of behavioural interventions. A significant relationship was found (p < .05) between behavioural interventions and retention in therapy. Patients who did not receive any sort of behavioural intervention showed a greater rate of drop-out than those who received behavioural interventions. In the group of patients receiving different types of behavioural interventions, there was significant improvement in mental health scores between the screening and discharge sessions in those who received exposure therapy. The study findings will be helpful to retain patients with comorbid anxiety and depression in an outpatient therapy setting. If patient retention is increased, CBT can be more effectively delivered and thereby achieve better health outcomes for patients, more effective use of therapy service resources, and decrease the socioeconomic burden of anxiety and depression on the community.

AB  - Introduction: The effectiveness of a behavioural group therapy programme over 10 double sessions for patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is evaluated. This out-patient group treatment programme provides education about OCD, instruction in a cognitive behavioural approach to self-treatment, guided behavioural treatment and additional multiple family groups. The group therapy (GRU) is compared with a pure medical treatment (MED) and a combined treatment (GRU/MED). Patients and Methods: For evaluation 155 patients ( GRU: 45; MED: 55; GRU/MED: 5) were investigated pre (t1) and post (t2) treatment. The groups did not differ significantly pre-treatment regarding Y-BOCS scores and the duration of disorder. The groups differed according to age, depressive symptoms ( Beck Depression Inventory) and psychosocial disability regarding work. Results: All groups showed a significant improvement of clinical pathology (Y-BOCS t1: 25.8 +/- 4.9; t2 19,3 +/- 7,8; p < 0.001), especially patients who received the group therapy or the combined treatment improved well (GRU t1: 25 +/- 5.4; t2: 16.7 +/- 8.9; GRU/MED t1: 25.6 +/- 5.3, t2: 16.7 +/- 7.09) compared to the purely medically treated group ( MED t1: 26.4 +/- 4; t2: 23.5 +/- 5.9). Discussion: Results show that behavioural group therapy with multiple family groups is an effective therapy option for patients with OCD.

AB  - Background: Bipolar disorder is a potentially lifelong and disable condition. It is of ten comorbid with other psychiatric disorders and causes substantial psychosocial morbidity. Even during periods of euthymia, patients may experience impairments in psychosocial functioning [1]. Poor treatment compliance is one of the main challenges to control the symptoms and prevent relapsing episodes. The insight, the disease awareness and the patient's attitude towards medication are believed to affect the adherence to treatment [2]. Although the evidence of specific psychosocial interventions for bipolar disorder is slowly building, there are studies showing positive effects of psychoeducation on enhancing bipolar patients' medication adherence [3]. However, in psycho logical treatment trials the recruited participants are usually euthymic, with no comorbidity and had moderate levels of bipolar disorder. Therefore, samples of ten exclude many of the individuals comprising the largest proportion of clinical caseload and are not representative of the cases that are most difficult to manage. The aim of this study is to assess the impact of psycho-educational group program on the attitude towards medication and global functioning of real patients with bipolar disorder. Method(s): We performed a non-randomized controlled trial, pre-post intervention study. We obtain a sample of 14 patients being attended in a public community mental health center who had being diagnosed of bipolar disease type I or type II based on a psychiatric structured interview. All subjects were assessed at baseline, one month and three months after the end of the psychoeducative program using Drug Attitude Inventory (DAI) and Functioning Assessment Short Test (FAST). We based our program in the shortened version of the Psychoeducation Manual for Bipolar Disorder [4] composed of 8 weekly sessions of 90 minutes, each aimed at improving illness awareness, treatment compliance, early detection of prodromal symptoms and recur rences and life-style regularity. Socio-demographic data and clinical variables were also recorded. Result(s): The study results are preliminary so far and contain data from the one-month-assessment. Mean age was 46.9 (SD 13.6), 64.3% were female, 42.7% have psychiatric comorbidity and 64.3% substance abuse. Mean number of hospitalizations: 2.5 (SD 3.3). Clinical Global Impressions Scale for use in Bipolar Disorder (CGI-BP) at baseline (mean 2.86; SD 1.7). Although the mean is slightly higher in one month assessment DAI (mean 16.9; SD 2.8) compare to the baseline test (mean 15.6;SD 2.9), it does not pass significant levels (P = 0.076). FAST mean score before (mean26.8;SD 15) and afterthe intervention (mean 31.5;SD 15.8) has not revealed any significant differences (P = 0.72). Conclusion(s): Our preliminary results do not support previous evidence of the effectiveness of psycho-educational therapies for improving medications adherence and global functioning in bipolar patients. However, we are aware that limitations of the study may affect the results. The small sample size and the severity of bipolar disorder among patients may act as biases and confounding factors difficult to control in clinical practice. Nonetheless, we have expectations of this study to be continued over time and we are hopeful that with a larger number of patients the results may become statistical significant.

AB  - The effect of group improvisational music therapy on depression in adolescents and adults with substance abuse was investigated. It was hypothesized that group improvisational music therapy would relieve depressive symptoms. Twenty-four Spanish-speaking patients receiving outpatient and inpatient treatment for substance abuse at Fundación José Felix Ribas (FJFR), located in Mérida State-Venezuela participated in the study. All participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) before being randomly assigned to experimental or control groups, each consisting of three cohort groups recruited over a nine month period. The experimental group received 12 group improvisation sessions over a three-month period, along with the standard treatment program provided at the facility, and the control group received only the standard treatment program. Post-test measures were completed at the end of each three-month treatment cycle. Differences between groups in pre-test and post-test scores were calculated using the Mann-Whitney U Test. Results showed that both groups were equally matched on all pretest measures. As for post-test measures, significant differences were found between the groups on HRSD, but not the BDI. The experimental group was significantly less depressed after treatment than the control group, as measured by the HRSD. Improvisational music therapy led to statistically significant greater improvements in psychologist-rated depression (HRSD) when compared to the regular treatment program alone; although no statistical differences were found in the improvements on the BDI between the two treatments, improvisational music therapy had a clinically significant effect. Possible explanations are offered. The most important limitations of the study were the small sample size, absence of a depression assessment tool specifically for substance abuse, and the use of the first version of the BDI instead of the second version as well as lack of information on demographic and clinical data.

AB  - This study was undertaken to provide an initial characterization of the current status of patients admitted to an alcoholism treatment program in Iceland. Consistent with the Minnesota Model, 12-step facilitation has been a central component of the program since its inception. Of the 94 patients assessed in this study, 67% were male and 40% had attended over 90 AA meetings prior to admission. The mean number of drinking days during the month prior to admission was 15.51 days and the mean length of hospital stay was 12.32 days. At time of hospital discharge, 39% were referred to residential treatment. Significant predictors of referral to residential treatment included having attended less than 90 AA meetings prior to admission and length of stay.

AB  - Introduction: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Addiction Programme of Probation (APP) created by the Substance Abuse Treatment Commission of Ministry of Health. Methods: The sample was consisted of probationers who were referred to Ege University by probation offices in February 2010. Literate probationers aged above 18, who fulfilled the SCID-I criteria for substance dependence, or had positive urine sample for illegal drugs were included. The probationers were allocated respectively to three treatment groups: APP (n=28); Motivational Interviewing (MI; n=30); Individual Intervention (II; n=30). The effectiveness of the treatment modalities was assessed by the State Anxiety Inventory; the WHO Quality of Life-Brief form; the Treatment Motivation Questionnaire. Visual analogue and Likert-type scales were used to assess the sense of the importance and the readiness of quitting drugs also the levels of craving. Urine toxicological analyses were performed fortnightly. Results: The APP increased the readiness of quitting drugs. The MI increased both the sense of importance and readiness of quitting drugs, decreased the frequency and severity of craving. The II improved the mental and physical health, increased the confidence in treatment also readiness of quitting drugs. Additionally, II decreased the level of anxiety, the severity, frequency and duration of craving. There was a significant decrease in positive urine samples of all groups. Conclusion: Because of changing only "the level of being ready to quit substance abuse", APP is considered as an inadequate program compared with MI and II.

AB  - Key Points: Question: Would a tailored behavioral health intervention reduce substance misuse and mental health symptoms, compared with enhanced usual care, in Latino immigrants with co-occurring mental health and substance misuse symptoms? Findings: In this randomized clinical trial from 3 sites of 341 immigrants with co-occurring mental health and substance misuse symptoms, the primary outcome of substance misuse did not change in the intent-to-treat analysis. Patients who received the treatment statistically significantly experienced decreased mental health symptoms, compared with controls under enhanced usual care, and only participants with moderate to severe symptoms who received the intervention statistically significantly reduced their substance misuse. Meaning: The intervention did not change drug misuse in a heterogeneous sample but did improve secondary mental health outcomes, a finding that might provide a path for treating Latino immigrants with co-occurring mental health symptoms whose symptoms are in the moderate-to-severe range. Importance: Immigrants are at an increased risk for co-occurring mental health and substance misuse symptoms; however, effective treatments are lacking. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of the Integrated Intervention for Dual Problems and Early Action (IIDEA) program compared with enhanced usual care. Design, Setting, and Participants: This effectiveness randomized clinical trial was conducted from September 2, 2014, to February 2, 2017, in 17 clinics or emergency departments and 24 community sites in Boston, Massachusetts, as well as in Madrid and Barcelona, Spain. Equal randomization (1:1) in 2-person blocks was used, assigning participants to either the IIDEA treatment group (n = 172) or the enhanced usual care control group (n = 169). Intent-to-treat analyses assessed effectiveness, and post hoc analyses examined whether results varied by symptom severity or treatment dose. Eligible participants were between 18 and 70 years of age, self-identified as Latino, screened positive for co-occurring symptoms, and were not receiving specialty behavioral health services. Interventions: Participants were randomized to a 10-session IIDEA treatment or to enhanced usual care. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes were changes in alcohol and drug misuse and results of a urine test for drug metabolites but not for alcohol misuse. Secondary outcomes were symptoms of depression, generalized anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and overall mental health. Results: In total, 341 participants were randomized to either the IIDEA treatment group (n = 172; 94 [54.7%] female, mean [SD] age, 33.5 [11.6] years) or the enhanced usual care control group (n = 169; 80 [47.3%] female, mean [SD] age, 34.3 [11.8] years). No statistically significant effects of IIDEA were found for primary drug and alcohol outcomes (ASI Lite–drug score: β = −0.02 [SE, 0.69; P =.88; Cohen d, 0.00; 95% CI, −0.17 to 0.17]; ASI Lite–alcohol score: β = −0.01 [SE, 1.19; P =.66; Cohen d, 0.00; 95% CI, −0.12 to 0.12]; urine drug test result: β = −0.36 [SE, 0.43; P =.50; OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.30-1.61]), but statistically significant effects were observed for secondary mental health outcomes. The IIDEA treatment was effective in reducing depressive symptoms per the Public Health Questionnaire-9 score (β = −1.14; SE, 0.47; P =.02; Cohen d, 0.20 [95% CI, 0.04-0.36]), posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms per the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-5 score (β = −3.23; SE, 1.59; P =.04; Cohen d, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.01-0.37]), and overall mental health symptoms per the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-20 (β = −0.20; SE, 0.07; P =.01; Cohen d, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.08-0.42]) and composite mental health (β = −3.70; SE, 1.75; P =.04; Cohen d, 0.19 [95% CI, 0.01-0.36]) scores at the 6-month follow-up. Exploratory analyses suggested that 6-month treatment effects occurred for patients whose drug misuse was moderate to severe at the baseline assessment. Among patients with moderate to severe substance misuse, IIDEA substantially reduced substance use per the urine test results (odds ratio, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.09-0.67]; P =.01). Treatment dose showed small to large effect sizes by outcome. Conclusions and Relevance: The IIDEA treatment did not change drug misuse but did improve secondary mental health and substance misuse outcomes for a heterogeneous population with moderate to severe symptoms; this finding provides a path for treating Latino immigrants with co-occurring mental health and substance misuse symptoms. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02038855 This randomized clinical trial evaluates the effectiveness of an integrated, multiyear cognitive behavior therapy, the Integrated Intervention for Dual Problems and Early Action (IIDEA), compared with enhanced usual care among Latino immigrants with dual mental health and substance misuse symptoms.

AB  - This study examined the feasibility and effectiveness of prize-based contingency management (CM) when incentives for attendance were administered in group therapy and incentives for abstinence were administered in individual meetings. Three community substance abuse treatment programs participated in this two-phase, crossover design study. Outpatients (N = 103) entering treatment who met diagnostic criteria for cocaine, opiate, and alcohol abuse or dependence were recruited. During the standard condition, participants received standard treatment and submitted breath and urine samples that were tested for alcohol, cocaine, and opiates twice weekly during Weeks 1-6 and once weekly during Weeks 7-12. During the CM condition, participants received the same standard treatment and sample and attendance monitoring, plus the opportunity to win prizes for negative samples and treatment attendance. Demographic information and substance abuse history were evaluated at intake, and posttreatment substance use (toxicology results and self-report) was evaluated at Month 6 and Month 9 follow-up interviews. Primary outcomes were weeks retained in treatment and longest duration of sustained abstinence (LDA). LDA was significantly greater in CM-condition participants, but weeks retained did not differ between groups. Rates of substance use were lower in CM participants at Month 9 but not at Month 6. This study suggests that it is feasible to deliver incentives for attendance in group therapy, but that further research is needed to understand the modest effects on attendance. Strengths and limitations of this study are discussed. Copyright (c) 2007 APA, all rights reserved

AB  - This study examined the effectiveness of a domestic violence shelter and tested the impact of a self-compassion support group curriculum on outcomes valued by shelters such as autonomy, emotional restoration, and safety. Data were collected from 251 women staying in a domestic violence shelter who had the opportunity to attend a self-compassion support group during their stay. Women completed a pre- and posttest survey assessing self-compassion, empowerment, positive emotion, and perceptions of safety. First, women experienced a positive change (N = 36) from pretest to posttest across all four outcome variables, suggesting the domestic violence shelter was effective at improving survivors' well-being. Second, participants who attended a self-compassion support group at least once reported more positive posttest scores compared with those who did not attend a group (N = 79); however, this effect was limited to participants who stayed in shelter a short time. Women who stayed in shelter a longer amount of time experienced more positive posttest scores regardless of group attendance. Although the sample size was limited, analyses directly comparing the traditional shelter support group with the self-compassion support group show that both were equally effective. These findings provide support for shelter effectiveness in terms of improving well-being. They also suggest women who stay in shelter a short period of time may not experience as many shelter benefits unless they attend a support group. Therefore, shelters should consider offering support groups to women very soon after shelter entry. Furthermore, more research is needed to disentangle the benefits of self-compassion interventions over and above a general support group curriculum.

AB  - To examine the effectiveness of group cognitive processing therapy (CPT) relative to trauma-focused group treatment as usual (TAU) in the context of a Veterans Health Administration (VHA) posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) residential rehabilitation program. Participants were 2 cohorts of male patients in the same program treated with either CPT (n = 104) or TAU (n = 93; prior to the implementation of CPT). Cohorts were compared on changes from pre- to posttreatment using the PTSD Checklist (PCL; Weathers, Litz, Herman, Huska, & Keane, 1993) and other measures of symptoms and functioning. Minorities represented 41% of the sample, and the mean age was 52 years (SD = 9.22). The CPT group was significantly younger and less likely to receive disability benefits for PTSD; however, these variables were not related to outcome. Analyses of covariance controlling for intake symptom levels and cohort differences revealed that CPT participants evidenced more symptom improvement at discharge than TAU participants on the PCL, F(3, 193) = 15.32, p < .001, b = 6.25, 95% CI [3.06, 9.44], and other measures. In addition, significantly more patients treated with CPT were classified as "recovered" or "improved" at discharge, &chi;2(1, N = 197) = 4.93, p = .032. There is still room for improvement, as substantial numbers of veterans continue to experience significant symptoms even after treatment with CPT in a residential program. However, CPT appears to produce significantly more symptom improvement than treatment conducted before the implementation of CPT. The implementation of this empirically supported treatment in VHA settings is both feasible and sustainable and is likely to improve care for male veterans with military-related PTSD.

AB  - This article presents findings from a quasi-experimental, nonrandomized group design study that explored whether trauma-enhanced substance abuse treatment results in longer residential treatment stays and improved outcomes compared with treatment-as-usual. We used a subsample (N = 461) of participants in the Women, Co-Occurring Disorders and Violence Study, which was sponsored by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. The intervention group was 31% less likely to discontinue treatment within 4 months. Baseline mental health and trauma symptoms and alcohol and drug severity scores predicted neither overall length of time in treatment nor differences in retention between intervention and comparison groups. Substance abuse and mental health symptoms improved with increased duration of treatment, particularly for women with more severe baseline symptoms.

AB  - Vulnerability–stress models suggest that training in specific stress management techniques should yield benefits to those suffering from schizophrenia and related disorders. In this paper, we describe an evaluation of the impact of adding a stress management program to other medical and psychosocial interventions for such patients. Outcomes were compared for 121 patients randomly assigned to receive either a 12-week stress management program with follow-up sessions or participation in a social activities group. The two treatment conditions did not differ in levels of symptoms, perceived stress or life skills immediately after completion of treatment or at 1-year follow-up. Patients who received the stress management program did have fewer hospital admissions in the year following treatment. This effect of stress management was most apparent for those who showed high levels of attendance for treatment sessions. It was concluded that training in stress management may provide patients with skills for coping with acute stressors and reduce the likelihood of subsequent acute exacerbation of symptoms with need for hospitalization.

AB  - The purposes of this study were to examine the therapeutic efficacy of combined group cognitive behavioral therapy (CGCBT) and to explore the characteristics of the patients who failed to complete it. Our group cognitive behavioral therapy combined with assertiveness training for alexithymia and self-esteem enhancement therapy were attended over a 10-week period. Twenty-five participants were enrolled in the study. The clinical symptoms were assessed before and after treatment, using rating scales including the Eating Disorder Inventory-2, the Bulimic Investigatory Test, Edinburgh, the Toronto Alexithymia Scale, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and Global Assessment of Functioning. Sixteen participants (64%) completed the CGCBT program. Completion of the CGCBT resulted in significant improvements in reducing binge-eating behavior and improving social functioning. Eight patients (32%) significantly improved using the Clinical Global Impression Change (CGI-C). Stepwise logistic regression analysis of the results indicated that a lower age ( P = 0.04) and psychiatric comorbidity ( P = 0.06) were predictors of dropout from the CGCBT program. Our CGCBT program is a promising first-line treatment for bulimic outpatients. Lower age and the presence of comorbidity had effects on dropout rates.

AB  - This study was designed to determine if 12-Steps groups efficacy for substance abuse treatment significantly improve abstinence rates of heroin addicts in the short run and long run (1-year and 5-year period); and if abstinence rates are found to be lower for heroin addicts that have attended 12-Step groups at the 1-year mark, and if similar results would be expected at the 5-year mark. Secondary data from the Inter-University Consortium of Political and Social Research (ICPSR) was extracted and analyzed for the aforementioned hypothesis. Using SSPS to test the research hypothesis for the 1-Year Follow Up, the chi-square test shows a p-value below of .10, and the analysis determined that there was significant evidence to support the hypothesis that cases in a 12-Steps or self-help program have a higher success than cases not in a program for the 1-year follow up. For 5-Year Follow Up, the cases that attended a 12-Step program or a self-help program and about 27% went on to use heroin during the last 12 months compared to 34% cases that did not go to a program.

AB  - College students with ADHD are at increased risk for a number of functional impairments, the severity of which is of sufficient clinical significance to warrant intervention (DuPaul & Weyandt, 2009). Very little treatment research of this type has been conducted to date (Green & Rabiner, 2012). The need for such research is critical, given the increasing numbers of students with ADHD attending college (Pryor, Hurtado, DeAngelo, Blake, & Tran, 2010), their increased risk for dropping out of college, and the known negative life outcomes for which they may be at increased risk later as adults (Barkley, Murphy, & Fischer, 2008). To address this situation we recently developed and began testing Accessing Campus Connections and Empowering Student Success (ACCESS). The active phase of ACCESS provides group cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), accompanied by individual mentoring. Booster group CBT and mentoring sessions are provided during a maintenance phase. Preliminary findings have revealed significant increases in ADHD knowledge, use of organizational skills, and reductions in maladaptive thinking, all of which are presumed mechanisms of clinical change. Such changes have been accompanied by reductions in ADHD symptoms, improvements in executive functioning, educational benefits, improved emotional well-being, and increased use of disability services and other campus resources. Although promising, such findings are limited by the fact that ACCESS has thus far been tested in an open clinical trial. Thus, additional research is needed to determine its efficacy and effectiveness. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: College students with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are at increased risk for numerous educational and psychosocial difficulties. This study reports findings from a large, multisite randomized controlled trial examining the efficacy of a treatment for this population, known as ACCESS-Accessing Campus Connections and Empowering Student Success. Method: ACCESS is a cognitive–behavioral therapy program delivered via group treatment and individual mentoring across two semesters. A total of 250 students (18–30 years of age, 66% female, 6.8% Latino, 66.3% Caucasian) with rigorously defined ADHD and comorbidity status were recruited from two public universities and randomly assigned to receive ACCESS immediately or on a 1-year delayed basis. Treatment response was assessed on three occasions, addressing primary (i.e., ADHD, executive functioning, depression, anxiety) and secondary (i.e., clinical change mechanisms, service utilization) outcomes. Results: Latent growth curve modeling (LGCM) revealed significantly greater improvements among immediate ACCESS participants in terms of ADHD symptoms, executive functioning, clinical change mechanisms, and use of disability accommodations, representing medium to large effects (Cohen's d, .39–1.21). Across these same outcomes, clinical significance analyses using reliable change indices (RCI; Jacobson & Truax, 1992) revealed significantly higher percentages of ACCESS participants showing improvement. Although treatment-induced improvements in depression and anxiety were not evident from LGCM, RCI analyses indicated that immediate ACCESS participants were less likely to report a worsening in depression/anxiety symptoms. Conclusions: Findings from this RCT provide strong evidence in support of the efficacy and feasibility of ACCESS as a treatment for young adults with ADHD attending college.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This controlled pilot study was designed, first, to examine the efficacy of two different group therapy formats for schizophrenia and schizoaffective patients: a patient‐centred, psychoeducative and coping‐orientated group therapy approach and a supportive therapy group. Secondly, it intended to establish preliminary hypotheses on the therapeutically relevant factors. METHOD: In a sample of 32 patients suffering from schizophrenia or a schizoaffective disorder the effect sizes of the coping‐orientated therapy approach and a supportive group therapy on several outcome variables were examined and the predictive power of different effect variables on outcome was analysed. RESULTS: The effect sizes show improvements in the cognizance of the disorder and the related pharmacotherapy, the psychopathology and the social functioning for both therapy conditions. Moreover, outcome as measured after 1 year was best predicted by the patient's mastery of active, problem‐focused coping strategies. CONCLUSION: The results corroborate the appropriateness of focusing on aspects of coping‐behaviour in psychological interventions.

AB  - Current literature on the dual diagnosis in cases of schizophrenia and alcohol dependence has reported how pharmacological treatment has positive effects on the reduction of both disorders. Nevertheless, patients have considerable difficulties in following the prescribed medication. This work aims to build an engagement stage and therapeutic relationship in seven patients with schizophrenic and alcohol-related disorder cases. This result was achieved through the use of the vignette technique and narrative psychodynamic approach during group counselling sessions. Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS) and Munich Alcoholism Test (MALT) were applied before and after treatment. A follow-up session was organized. The PANSS and MALT scores indicated there was no reduction of the psychiatric symptoms after treatment. The follow-up session showed positive outcomes in terms of increasing the level of socialisation as well as awareness of their own condition; at the same, an adherence to pharmacological treatment and psychotherapy for all the subjects.

AB  - Background: Chronic musculoskeletal pain and depression are very common in primary care patients. Furthermore, they often appear as comorbid conditions, resulting in additive effect on adverse health outcomes. On the basis of previous studies, we hypothesise that depression and chronic musculoskeletal pain may benefit from an integrated management programme at primary care level. We expect positive effects on both physical and psychological distress of patients. Methods: Objective: To determine whether a new programme for an integrated approach to chronic musculoskeletal pain and depression leads to better outcomes than usual care. Design: Cluster-randomised controlled trial involving two arms: a) control arm (usual care); and b) intervention arm, where patients participate in a programme for an integrated approach to the pain-depression dyad. Settings: Primary care centres in the province of Tarragona, Catalonia, Spain, Participants: We will recruit 330 patients aged 18-80 with moderate or severe musculoskeletal pain (Brief Pain Inventory, average pain subscale ≥5) for at least 3 months, and with criteria for major depression (DSM-IV). Intervention: A multicomponent programme according to the chronic care model. The main components are care management, optimised antidepressant treatment, and a psychoeducational group action. Blind measurements: The patients will be monitored through blind telephone interviews held at 0, 3, 6 and 12 months. Outcomes: Severity of pain and depressive symptoms, pain and depression treatment response rates, and depression remission rates. Analysis: The outcomes will be analysed on an intent-to-treat basis and the analysis units will be the individual patients. This analysis will consider the effect of the study design on any potential lack of independence between observations made within the same cluster. Ethics: The protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Jordi Gol Primary Care Research Institute (IDIAP), Barcelona, (P14/142). Discussion: This project strengthens and improves treatment approaches for a major comorbidity in primary care. The design of the intervention takes into account its applicability under typical primary care conditions, so that if the programme is found to be effective it will be feasible to apply it in a generalised manner.

AB  - Objective. To assess the quality of life (QoL) in an outpatient setting among male patients dually diagnosed with schizophrenia and substance use disorder (SUD), and non-substance-using male schizophrenia patients. Methods. The study was conducted in an outpatient setting with 52 male schizophrenia patients and 49 male schizophrenia patients with SUD comorbidity, who were admitted to Bakirkoy Research and Training Hospital between 1 May 2010 and 30 September 2010. The patients had been in remission for a minimum of 6 months. The subjects were re-evaluated for the persistence of the diagnosis by using the Structural Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I disorders (SCID I) socio-demographic data form, and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale Brief Version (WHOQOL-BREF) and positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) were administered to detect the factors affecting diagnostic stability and clinical course. Results. Schizophrenia patients with no SUD comorbidity had a significantly earlier age of disease onset than the comorbid group. SUD comorbidity in schizophrenia patients leads to increased rates of unemployment and homicidality. WHOQOL-Bref psychological health scores were significantly lower among patients in the comorbidity group. No statistically significant difference was identified between the groups with regard to the PANSS scores. Conclusions. It is necessary to focus on the treatment challenges for schizophrenia patients with SUD comorbidity, such as the provision of treatment in criminal justice settings, in which a high proportion of such patients are found.

AB  - Summary: Background: Depression in women is one of the commonest problems encountered in primary care. We aimed to compare the effectiveness of a stepped-care programme with usual care in primary-care management of depression in low-income women in Santiago, Chile. Methods: In a randomised controlled trial, in three primary-care clinics in Chile, 240 adult female primary-care patients with major depression were allocated stepped care or usual care. Stepped care was a 3-month, multicomponent intervention led by a non-medical health worker, which included a psychoeducational group intervention, structured and systematic follow-up, and drug treatment for patients with severe depression. Data were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. The primary outcome measure was the Hamilton depression rating scale (HDRS) administered at baseline and at 3 and 6 months after randomisation. Findings: About 90% of randomised patients completed outcome assessments. There was a substantial between-group difference in all outcome measures in favour of the stepped-care programme. The adjusted difference in mean HDRS score between the groups was -8.89 (95% CI -11.15 to -6.76; p<0.0001). At 6-months' follow-up, 70% (60-79) of the stepped-care compared with 30% (21-40) of the usual-care group had recovered (HDRS score <8). Interpretation: Despite few resources and marked deprivation, women with major depression responded well to a structured, stepped-care treatment programme, which is being introduced across Chile. Socially disadvantaged patients might gain the most from systematic improvements in treatment of depression.

AB  - Objective: Identifying treatment moderators facilitates treatment matching and personalized medicine. No previous studies have investigated treatment moderators for a mindfulness-based versus traditional cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety disorders to determine for whom each is most effective. The current study examined three putative moderators of principal anxiety disorder severity outcomes for adapted mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) and group CBT baseline depression symptoms, anxiety sensitivity, and diagnostic severity. Method: Seventy-one patients with a DSM-IV anxiety disorder were randomized to adapted MBSR or group CBT and assessed at baseline, post-treatment, and 3-month follow up. Results: CBT outperformed adapted MBSR among those with no to mild depressive symptoms and, at post-treatment only, among those with very high anxiety sensitivity. At follow up, adapted MBSR outperformed CBT among those with moderate to severe depressive symptoms and among those with average anxiety sensitivity (for this sample). Baseline severity affected post-treatment outcomes differently in CBT than in adapted MBSR. Conclusion: Baseline levels of depression, anxiety sensitivity, and to some extent diagnostic severity, differentially moderated outcomes in CBT and adapted MBSR for anxiety disorders. Recommendations and clinical implications are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Transdiagnostic Cognitive Behavior Therapy (TCBT) manuals delivered in individual format have been reported to be just as effective as traditional diagnosis specific CBT manuals. We have translated and modified the "The Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders" (UP‐CBT) for group delivery in Mental Health Service (MHS), and shown effects comparable to traditional CBT in a naturalistic study. As the use of one manual instead of several diagnosis‐specific manuals could simplify logistics, reduce waiting time, and increase therapist expertise compared to diagnosis specific CBT, we aim to test the relative efficacy of group UP‐CBT and diagnosis specific group CBT. METHODS/DESIGN: The study is a partially blinded, pragmatic, non‐inferiority, parallel, multi‐center randomized controlled trial (RCT) of UP‐CBT vs diagnosis specific CBT for Unipolar Depression, Social Anxiety Disorder and Agoraphobia/Panic Disorder. In total, 248 patients are recruited from three regional MHS centers across Denmark and included in two intervention arms. The primary outcome is patient‐ratings of well‐being (WHO Well‐being Index, WHO‐5), secondary outcomes include level of depressive and anxious symptoms, personality variables, emotion regulation, reflective functioning, and social adjustment. Assessments are conducted before and after therapy and at 6 months follow‐up. Weekly patient‐rated outcomes and group evaluations are collected for every session. Outcome assessors, blind to treatment allocation, will perform the observer‐based symptom ratings, and fidelity assessors will monitor manual adherence. DISCUSSION: The current study will be the first RCT investigating the dissemination of the UP in a MHS setting, the UP delivered in groups, and with depressive patients included. Hence the results are expected to add substantially to the evidence base for rational group psychotherapy in MHS. The planned moderator and mediator analyses could spur new hypotheses about mechanisms of change in psychotherapy and the association between patient characteristics and treatment effect. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02954731 . Registered 25 October 2016.

AB  - Caregivers in the United States are often under supported and are at higher risk for mental and physical health issues including chronic stress, depression, and hypertension. The current study provided a horticultural therapy support group for a small group of caregivers and assessed its efficacy using many psychometric measures including those measuring gratitude, loneliness, mindfulness of mind and body, subjective vitality, burden, depression, anxiety, and stress. We found that the support group had large effects on subjective vitality and loneliness and medium effects on gratitude, depression, and burden. All of these effects were in such a direction that indicated an improved quality of life. These findings, while promising, must be taken in consideration of some limitations such as the small sample size and some clients' concurrent participation in individual therapy. Future research should aim to replicate these findings using control groups such as a wait-list group or a group of individuals not in individual therapy. Future studies should continue using psychometrically sound instruments to assess the impact of interventions.

AB  - Objective: Housing First is a groundbreaking approach to ending chronic homelessness among people with mental illness. This article presents one-year findings from a multi-site randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing Housing First with treatment as usual. Method(s): The study was a nonblind, parallel-group RCT conducted in five Canadian cities. A sample of 950 high-need participants with severe mental illness, who were either absolutely homeless or precariously housed, was randomly assigned to Housing First (N=469) or treatment as usual (N=481). Housing First participants received a rent supplement, assistance to find housing, and assertive community treatment. Treatment-as-usual participants had access to all other existing programs. Result(s): At one-year follow-up, 73% of Housing First participants and 31% of treatment-as-usual participants resided in stable housing (p<.001, odds ratio=6.35, covariate adjusted difference=42%, 95% confidence interval [CI]=36%248%). Improvement in overall quality of life was significantly greater among Housing First participants compared with treatment-as-usual participants (p<.001, d=.31, CI=.16-.46). Housing First participants also showed greater improvements in community functioning compared with treatment-as-usual participants (p=.003, d=.25, CI=.09-.41). Conclusion(s): Compared with treatment as usual, Housing First produced greater improvements in housing stability, quality of life, and community functioning after one year of enrollment. The study provides support for adopting Housing First as an approach for ending chronic homelessness among persons with severe mental illness, even if they are actively symptomatic or using substances.

AB  - To compare the outcomes of Seeking Safety (SS) and cognitive processing therapy (CPT) in veterans with PTSD in a specialty clinic of an urban VA medical center. Retrospective chart review of electronic medical records was conducted for 420 veterans with PTSD who received treatment with either CPT (n = 227) or SS (n = 193) in group setting. 1) treatment completion rate, 2) self-reported PTSD symptom severity measured by PTSD checklist (PCL), and 3) additional mental health services received within 12 months after treatment. Data were analyzed for the 160 who had both a pre and post PCL documented in their charts. The final analysis sample included n = 94 for CPT and n = 66 for SS veterans with a mean age of 49.71[SD = 14] years, 24 women [15%]; mean baseline PCL score was 68.41 [9]. Significantly more veterans completed SS treatment (SS, 59 [89%] than CPT, 47 [50%] (p = <.001). However, PCL score decreases were significantly greater for patients who completed CPT treatment than those in SS (treatment x time interaction, 9.60 vs.4.98, respectively; difference, 4.62; t84 = 2.16; p =.02). The patients who received SS used significantly more mental health services of the PTSD clinical team than patients who completed CPT treatment (p =.01). The results of this study demonstrate the need for alternative approaches where dually diagnosed patients would not be delayed in their receipt of trauma-focused care – i.e., where treatment is initiated concurrently rather than sequentially to substance abuse treatment.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to determine the effectiveness of group training in problem solving in improving mentally ill patients' problem solving self appraisal and performance on a specific problem solving task, and to determine whether training resulted in less frequent and less intense daily hassles. Subjects were 38 male patients ranging in age from twenty-three to seventy years old. All were involuntarily committed to the Department of Mental Health under Chapter 552 of the Missouri Revised Statutes (1986) as 'not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect' on a criminal charge. Patients resided in the Biggs and Cremer Forensic Centers of Fulton State Hospital, Fulton, Missouri. All had Axis I diagnoses (DSM III-R, APA, 1986) charactered by disordered thinking and/or disturbed mood. Diagnoses represented include Schizophrenia (N = 24), Affective Disorders (N = 10) and psychotic disorders not otherwise specified (N = 4). All patients were on medication and their symptoms were in partial or full remission. Following informed consent patients were administered the Problem Solving Inventory, the Means-Ends Problem Solving Procedure and the Daily Hassles Scale. They were randomly assigned to either the experimental or control group. Experimental group subjects attended ten bi-weekly, hour long, training sessions based on D'Zurilla and Goldfrieds' five stage prescriptive model of problem solving. Control group patients received no problem solving training. After training was completed all subjects took the three psychological measures as a post test, and repeated them as a follow up one month later. The research design employed was the Pretest-Post test Control Group Design (Campbell and Stanley, 1973.) The statistical method used was analysis of covariance, in which the post test means of the experimental and control group were compared using the pretest scores as a covariate. The major findings of the study were as follows: (1) The training did result in si (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The present study sought to replicate and extend a small pilot study conducted by Baker, Boggs&Lewin (2001) which demonstrated that brief interventions consisting of motivational interviewing and cognitive-behaviour therapy (CBT) were feasible and associated with better outcomes compared with a control condition.Randomized controlled trial (RCT).Greater Brisbane Region of Queensland and Newcastle, NSW, Australia.The study was conducted among 214 regular amphetamine users.Demographic characteristics, past and present alcohol and other drug use and mental health, treatment, amphetamine-related harms and severity of dependence.The main finding of this study was that there was a significant increase in the likelihood of abstinence from amphetamines among those receiving two or more treatment sessions. In addition, the number of treatment sessions attended had a significant short-term beneficial effect on level of depression. There were no intervention effects on any other variables (HIV risk-taking, crime, social functioning and health). Overall, there was a marked reduction in amphetamine use among this sample over time and, apart from abstinence rates and short-term effects on depression level, this was not differential by treatment group. Reduction in amphetamine use was accompanied by significant improvements in stage of change, benzodiazepine use, tobacco smoking, polydrug use, injecting risk-taking behaviour, criminal activity level, and psychiatric distress and depression level.A stepped-care approach is recommended. The first step in providing an effective intervention among many regular amphetamine users, particularly those attending non-treatment settings, may include provision of: a structured assessment of amphetamine use and related problems; self-help material; and regular monitoring of amphetamine use and related harms. Regular amphetamine users who present to treatment settings could be offered two sessions of CBT, while people with moderate to severe levels of depression may best be offered four sessions of CBT for amphetamine use from the outset, with further treatment for amphetamine use and/or depression depending on response. Pharmacotherapy and/or longer-term psychotherapy may be suitable for non-responders. An RCT of a stepped-care approach among regular amphetamine users is suggested.

AB  - This study evaluated the psychiatric symptoms, psychosocial problems, and treatment response of personality-disordered substance abusers receiving services within a homeless drop-in center. Fifty-two homeless clients were assessed after program admission and randomly assigned to receive either individual psychotherapy focused on personality disorder and substance abuse relapse prevention (dual-focus schema therapy [DFST]) or standard group substance abuse counseling (SAC). Client functioning was assessed using measures of personality disorder, psychiatric symptoms, early maladaptive schemas, interpersonal problems, and addiction-related psychosocial impairment. Therapy retention (total weeks in treatment) and utilization (number of weeks in which sessions were attended) were the primary outcomes. Although rates of cluster B personality disorders were comparable to other substance dependent samples, clusters A and C disorders were disproportionately more common. Clients reported significant psychiatric symptoms, criminality, and psychosocial impairment, yet made limited lifetime use of mental health services. Overall, there was greater utilization of individual DFST than group SAC. However, clients with more severe personality disorder symptoms demonstrated better utilization of SAC than DFST.

AB  - Objective: The study examined the effectiveness of the Recovery Workbook as a group intervention for facilitating recovery of persons with serious mental illness. Methods: The multicenter, prospective, single-blind, randomized controlled trial included 33 persons who were receiving assertive community treatment services. For 12 weeks, a control group (N=17) received treatment as usual and an intervention group (N=16) received Recovery Workbook training in addition to usual treatment. At study entry and within three days of completion of the intervention, participants' perceived level of hope, empowerment, recovery, and quality of life were measured with the Herth Hope Index, the Empowerment Scale, the Recovery Assessment Scale, and the Quality of Life Index, respectively. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to examine between-group differences. Results: Participation in the intervention group was associated with positive change in perceived level of hope, empowerment, and recovery but not in quality of life. The associations remained after analyses controlled for demographic variables. Conclusions: The study, which is one of the first randomized controlled trials of a recovery-based group intervention for persons with serious mental illness, showed that the Recovery Workbook group program was effective in increasing individuals' perceived sense of hope, empowerment, and recovery. In an era when recovery is the primary goal around which reformed mental health service delivery is organized, researchers should continue to study recovery-based interventions such as the Recovery Workbook to determine their potential as evidence-based treatment options.

THE 86 SUBJECTS WERE SELECTED FROM AN INITIAL POOL OF 125 VOLUNTEERS WHO HAD BEEN DIAGNOSED AS MENTALLY DISORDERED SEX OFFENDERS PRIOR TO THE INITIATION OF THE EXPERIMENT. TWELVE COMMUNITY VOLUNTEERS BETWEEN 24 AND 51 YEARS OF AGE WERE CHOSEN FROM A GROUP OF 19 INDIVIDUALS. TRAINING OF THESE VOLUNTEERS PRIMARILY CONSISTED OF PRESENTING ENCOUNTERTAPES (BERZON, 1968) WHICH INVOLVED 10 SESSIONS OF TRAINING, EACH LASTING 1.5 HOURS. A MALE-FEMALE PAIR OF VOLUNTEERS WAS RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO LEAD AN ENCOUNTER GROUP (EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT) FOR ONE GROUP OF SUBJECTS AND TO LEAD A HOBBY AND GAME SESSION (CONTROL TREATMENT) FOR A DIFFERENT GROUP OF SUBJECTS. EACH CITIZEN PAIR ADMINISTERED BOTH EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL TREATMENTS. THE PURPOSE OF USING THE SAME VOLUNTEERS FOR BOTH GROUPS WAS TO AVOID ANY EFFECTS RESULTING FROM DIFFERENCES IN PERSONALITIES, ABILITIES, OR CHARACTERISTICS OF VOLUNTEERS THAT MIGHT BIAS RESULTS. TEN CRIMINAL SUBJECTS COMPRISED EACH GROUP. A CRIMINAL ATTITUDE SCALE WAS CONSTRUCTED TO OBTAIN SUBJECTIVE AND SPECIFIC DATA ABOUT ATTITUDES OF OFFENDERS TOWARD FIVE FACTORS: CONCURRENCE (ATTITUDE TOWARD DETENTION, SENTENCING, POLICE, AND CRIME), RESTLESSNESS, APPROPINQUATION (REACHING OUT TOWARD OTHERS); DESPONDENCY; AND SELFFISHNESS. OTHER SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT TECHNIQUES WERE ALSO EMPLOYED TO EVALUATE OFFENDERS. RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION INDICATED A MODERATE DEGREE OF SUPPORT FOR THE EXPERIMENTAL HYPOTHESIS THAT NONPROFESSIONALS FUNCTION EFFECTIVELY AS LAY THERAPISTS TO MENTALLY DISORDERED SEX OFFENDERS. ON 74 DIFFERENCE AND POSTSCORE MEASURES, ENCOUNTER SUBJECTS WERE SLIGHTLY SUPERIOR IN 55 CASES. NINE INDIVIDUAL COMPARISONS WERE SIGNIFICANT. ENCOUNTER GROUP SUBJECTS WERE SLIGHTLY SUPERIOR ON ALL 16 QUESTIONS CONTAINED IN A BEHAVIOR RATING SCALE. CRIMINAL SUBJECTS RATED THE GROUP ENCOUNTER SESSIONS HIGHLY, WITH ATTENDANCE DATA DEMONSTRATING THEY PREFERRED A THERAPEUTIC EXPERIENCE OVER A HOBBY AND GAME EXPERIENCE. SUPPORTING DATA AND REFERENCES ARE PROVIDED. (DEP)

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of integrated motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy in addition to standard care for patients with psychosis and a comorbid substance use problem. Design: Two centre, open, rater blind randomized controlled trial. Setting: Secondary care in the United Kingdom. Participants: 327 patients with a clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, or schizoaffective disorder and a diagnosis of dependence on or misuse of drugs, alcohol, or both according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition. Intervention: The intervention was integrated motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy plus standard care, which was compared with standard care alone. Phase one of therapy—'motivation building'—concerns engaging the patient, then exploring and resolving ambivalence for change in substance use. Phase two—'action'—supports and facilitates change using cognitive behavioral approaches. Up to 26 therapy sessions were delivered over one year. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was death from any cause or admission to hospital in the 12 months after completion of therapy. Secondary outcomes were frequency and amount of substance use (assessed using the timeline followback method), readiness to change, perceived negative consequences of use, psychotic symptom ratings, number and duration of relapses, and global assessment of functioning and deliberate self harm at 12 and 24 months, with additional timeline followback assessments at 6 and 18 months. Analysis was by intention to treat and robust treatment effect estimates were produced. Results: 327 participants were randomly allocated to either the intervention (n = 164) or treatment as usual (n = 163). At 24 months, 326 (99.7%) were assessed on the primary outcome and 246 (75.2%) on the main secondary outcomes. Treatment had no beneficial effect on hospital admissions or death during follow-up, with 23.3% (38/163) of the therapy group and 20.2% (33/163) of controls deceased or admitted (adjusted odds ratio 1.16, 95% confidence interval 0.68 to 1.99; P = 0.579). Therapy had no effect on the frequency of substance use or the perceived negative consequences of misuse, but did have a statistically significant effect on amount used per substance using day (adjusted ORs for main substance 1.50, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.09; P = 0.016; and all substances 1.48, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.05; P = 0.017). Treatment had a statistically significant effect on readiness to change use at 12 months (adjusted OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.26 to 3.31; P = 0.004) that was not maintained at 24 months (0.78, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.28; P = 0.320). There were no effects of treatment on clinical outcomes such as relapses, psychotic symptoms, functioning, and self harm. Conclusions: Integrated motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy for people with psychosis and substance misuse do not improve outcome in terms of hospitalization, symptom outcomes, or functioning. This approach does reduce the amount of substance used for at least one year after completion of therapy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This randomized controlled trial tested the effectiveness of an 18-month mentalization-based treatment (MBT) approach in an outpatient context against a structured clinical management (SCM) outpatient approach for treatment of borderline personality disorder. METHOD: Patients (N=134) consecutively referred to a specialist personality disorder treatment center and meeting selection criteria were randomly allocated to MBT or SCM. Eleven mental health professionals equal in years of experience and training served as therapists. Independent evaluators blind to treatment allocation conducted assessments every 6 months. The primary outcome was the occurrence of crisis events, a composite of suicidal and severe self-injurious behaviors and hospitalization. Secondary outcomes included social and interpersonal functioning and self-reported symptoms. Outcome measures, assessed at 6-month intervals, were analyzed using mixed effects logistic regressions for binary data, Poisson regression models for count data, and mixed effects linear growth curve models for self-report variables. RESULTS: Substantial improvements were observed in both conditions across all outcome variables. Patients randomly assigned to MBT showed a steeper decline of both self-reported and clinically significant problems, including suicide attempts and hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Structured treatments improve outcomes for individuals with borderline personality disorder. A focus on specific psychological processes brings additional benefits to structured clinical support. Mentalization-based treatment is relatively undemanding in terms of training so it may be useful for implementation into general mental health services. Further evaluations by independent research groups are now required.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of the Flinders Program T of chronic condition management on alcohol use, psychosocial well-being and quality of life in Vietnam veterans with alcohol misuse. Method: This 9-month wait-list, randomised controlled trial used the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) score >= 8 as the entry criterion. Intervention veterans received the Flinders Program plus usual care and controls received usual care. The primary outcome measure was AUDIT score at baseline, 3, 6 and 9 months. Secondary measures included quality of life, alcohol dependence (DSM-IV), anxiety and depression. All measures were repeated at variable trial end dates between 9 and 18 months in the intervention group. Results: Randomisation resulted in 46 intervention and 31 control participants. Intent-to-treat analyses showed AUDIT scores improved significantly from baseline to 9-month follow-up (p = 0.039) in the intervention group compared to control group. The control group had 1.46 times the risk of alcohol dependence than the intervention group at 9 months (p = 0.027). There were no significant differences between groups for secondary measures. Within-group analyses showed that both groups significantly improved in AUDIT (p < 0.001), anxiety and depression (p < 0.01), anger (p < 0.001), and post-traumatic stress (p < 0.01). Improvements in AUDIT (p < 0.001) and alcohol dependence were maintained in the intervention group to 18 months. Conclusions: Use of the Flinders Program in addition to usual care resulted in reduced alcohol use, reduced alcohol dependence, and global clinical improvement in Vietnam veterans with risky alcohol behaviours and chronic mental health problems. The findings demonstrate that the Flinders Program provides a structured framework for delivering self-management support, case management and coordinated care for people with chronic conditions. This clinical approach has the potential to bridge the gap between physical and mental illness service delivery for people with long-term conditions in Australia.

AB  - <bold>Introduction: </bold>Black women are at heightened risk for trauma exposure, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and substance use disorders (SUDs), compared to White women and the general population. However, disparities in treatment engagement and retention persist, particularly for Black women with co-occurring PTSD+SUD. Although therapeutic alliance is an important predictor and mediator of treatment retention and outcomes, we know little about predictors of alliance and the mediating role of alliance for PTSD+SUD outcomes among Black women.<bold>Methods: </bold>This study utilized data previously collected for the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) Women and Trauma Study. Participants were 88 Black/African American women (Mage = 41.90, SD = 7.72) participating in a clinical trial comparing Seeking Safety (a cognitive-behavioral intervention for PTSD+SUD) to Women's Health Education (control). This study includes participants from both arms. Measures included the Helping Alliance Questionnaire, Addiction Severity Index-Lite, and Clinician Administered PTSD Scale. Women in the intervention arm also completed the Seeking Safety Feedback Questionnaire.<bold>Results: </bold>Stepwise, hierarchical linear regressions indicated that years of education and previous alcohol/drug treatment attempts significantly predicted early alliance in the second week of therapy (β = 0.411, p = .021 and β = 0.383, p = .011, respectively), but not late alliance in the last week of therapy (ps > .794). Greater education and more treatment attempts were associated with higher early alliance. Alliance did not mediate relationships between these significant predictors and treatment outcomes (e.g., attendance, post-treatment PTSD and SUD symptoms) or treatment feedback in the Seeking Safety group.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Education and prior treatment attempts predicted early alliance among Black/African American women in PTSD+SUD group treatment, and higher education level was associated with poorer Seeking Safety feedback topic ratings. Educational level and treatment history should be considered during alliance building in therapeutic interventions with Black women. Clinicians may consider the integration of pre-treatment alliance-building strategies with Black female patients who have lower levels of education. This study provides insight into the relative impact of several important factors that influence early alliance among Black women with co-occurring PTSD+SUD.

AB  - Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent and can cause serious functional impairment. Cognitive-behavioral treatments are effective but they are not always readily available. One factor contributing to this problem is the large number of disorder-specific treatments that require a high level of clinician training and resources, despite the similarity in the mechanisms underlying the various anxiety disorders and their treatments. Group-based, transdiagnostic cognitive-behavioral therapy (TCBT) has been shown to reduce the burden on clinicians while maintaining strong positive treatment outcomes. Furthermore, long courses of treatment may limit some individuals' ability to participate because of issues related to transportation, work, or childcare. Research has supported the efficacy of brief, intensive treatment for anxiety. The goal of the study presented here was to combine these 2 innovative treatment modalities by examining the feasibility and acceptability of TCBT provided in an intensive weekend format. The results of this pilot study indicated that this format was acceptable to a sample of Veterans (N=13) based on their feedback. This pilot study also demonstrated that the format was feasible, as all Veterans who initiated treatment completed the entire program (N=8). Preliminary outcome data suggested that TCBT delivered in an intensive weekend format may have positive effects for individuals with anxiety, including reduction in symptoms of anxiety and depression as well as improved overall functioning. Clinical implications and directions for future research are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - There is evidence that Cognitive Behaviour Therapy for Psychosis (CBTp) is an effective intervention for reducing psychotic symptoms. The recently updated Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists clinical practice guidelines (RANZCP CPG) recommend CBTp for the therapeutic management of schizophrenia and related disorders. Translational research is required to examine how well CBTp can be applied into public mental health services. This feasibility study aimed to provide preliminary evidence on how acceptable, implementable, and adaptable individual or group CBTp may be within a public mental health service in Australia. Twenty-seven participants initially agreed to participate in the study with 16 participants being randomised to either group or individual therapy, 11 starting therapy and 7 completing therapy. The intervention involved approximately 20 h of manualised CBTp. Attendance was higher in the individual therapy. Subjective reports indicated that the therapy was acceptable to all completers. Participants who engaged in individual or group CBTp experienced a similar level of reduction in the severity of hallucinations and delusions. Individual CBTp may be a feasible, acceptable, and effective intervention to include in Australian public mental health services. A pilot trial is now required to provide further evidence for and guidance of how best to translate CBTp protocols to Australian mental health services.

AB  - Context: Drug abuse by people with severe mental disorder is a significant public health problem for which there is no empirically validated treatment. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of a new behavioral treatment for drug abuse in this population: Behavioral Treatment for Substance Abuse in Severe and Persistent Mental Illness ( BTSAS). Design: Participants were randomly assigned to 6 months of treatment in either BTSAS or a manualized control condition: Supportive Treatment for Addiction Recovery( STAR). Setting: Treatment was conducted in community-based outpatient clinics and a Veterans Affairs medical center in Baltimore, Md. Participants: Participants were 129 stabilized outpatients meeting DSM criteria for drug dependence (cocaine, heroin, or cannabis) and serious mental illness: 39.5% met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder; 55.8%, for major affective disorders; and the remainder met criteria for severe and persistent mental illness and other Axis I disorders. Interventions: Both treatments were administered by trained health care professionals in small groups, twice a week for 6 months. The BTSAS program is a social learning intervention that includes motivational interviewing, a urinalysis contingency, and social skills training. The control condition, STAR, is a supportive group discussion treatment. Main Outcome Measure: The primary outcome measure was urinalysis results from twice-weekly treatment sessions. Results: The BTSAS program was significantly more effective than STAR in percentage of clean urine test results, survival in treatment, and attendance at sessions. The BTSAS program also had significant effects on important community-functioning variables, including hospitalization; money available for living expenses; and quality of life. Conclusions: The BTSAS program is an efficacious treatment. Further work needs to be done to increase the proportion of eligible patients who are able to become engaged in treatment.

AB  - Abstract: Clinical effectiveness of group cognitive-behavioral therapy (GCBT) versus fluoxetine in obsessive-compulsive disorder outpatients that could present additional psychiatric comorbidities was assessed. Patients (18–65 years; baseline Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive-Scale [Y-BOCS] scores≥16; potentially presenting additional psychiatric comorbidities) were sequentially allocated for treatment with GCBT (n =70) or fluoxetine (n =88). Mean Y-BOCS scores decreased by 23.13% in the GCBT and 21.54% in the SSRI groups (p =0.875). Patients presented a mean of 2.7 psychiatric comorbidities, and 81.4% showed at least one additional disorder. A reduction of at least 35% in baseline Y-BOCS scores and CGI ratings of 1 (much better) or 2 (better) was achieved by 33.3% of GCBT patients and 27.7% in the SSRI group (p =0.463). The Y-BOCS reduction was significantly lower in patients with one or more psychiatric comorbidities (21.15%, and 18.73%, respectively) than in those with pure OCD (34.62%; p =0.034). Being male, having comorbidity of Major Depression, Social Phobia, or Dysthymia predicted a worse response to both treatments. Response rates to both treatments were similar and lower than reported in the literature, probably due to the broad inclusion criteria and the resulting sample more similar to the real world population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence indicates that 12-step mutual-help organizations (MHOs), such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA), can play an important role in extending and potentiating the recovery benefits of professionally delivered addiction treatment among young adults with substance use disorders (SUD). However, concerns have lingered regarding the suitability of 12-step organizations for certain clinical subgroups, such as those with dual diagnosis (DD). This study examined the influence of diagnostic status (DD vs. SUD-only) on both attendance and active involvement (e.g., having a sponsor, verbal participation during meetings) in, and derived benefits from, 12-step MHOs following residential treatment., METHODS: Young adults (N = 296; 18 to 24 years old; 26% female; 95% Caucasian; 47% DD [based on structured diagnostic interview]), enrolled in a prospective naturalistic study of SUD treatment effectiveness, were assessed at intake and 3, 6, and 12 months posttreatment on 12-step attendance/active involvement and percent days abstinent (PDA). t-Tests and lagged, hierarchical linear models (HLM) examined the extent to which diagnostic status influenced 12-step participation and any derived benefits, respectively., RESULTS: For DD and SUD-only patients, posttreatment attendance and active involvement in 12-step organizations were similarly high. Overall, DD patients had significantly lower PDA relative to SUD-only patients. All patients appeared to benefit significantly from attendance and active involvement on a combined 8-item index. Regarding the primary effects of interest, significant differences did not emerge in derived benefit between DD and SUD-only patients for either attendance (p = 0.436) or active involvement (p = 0.062). Subsidiary analyses showed, however, that DD patients experienced significantly greater abstinence-related benefit from having a 12-step sponsor., CONCLUSIONS: Despite concerns regarding the clinical utility of 12-step MHOs for DD patients, findings indicate that DD young adults participate and benefit as much as SUD-only patients, and may benefit more from high levels of active involvement, particularly having a 12-step sponsor. Future work is needed to clarify how active 12-step involvement might offset the additional recovery burden of a comorbid mental illness on substance use outcomes.

AB  - Recent research supports the efficacy of Strength at Home‐Men's Program (SAH‐M), a trauma‐informed group intervention designed to reduce use of intimate partner violence (IPV) in veterans (Taft, Macdonald, Creech, Monson, & Murphy, 2016). However, change‐processes facilitating the effectiveness of SAH‐M have yet to be specified. Alexithymia, a deficit in the cognitive processing of emotional experience characterized by difficulty identifying and distinguishing between feelings, difficulty describing feelings, and use of an externally oriented thinking style, has been shown to predict PTSD severity and impulsive aggression; however, no studies have investigated the relationship between alexithymia and IPV. As such, the current study examined the role of improvements in alexithymia as a potential facilitator of treatment efficacy among 135 male veterans/service members, in a randomized control trial SAH‐M. After an initial assessment including measures of IPV and alexithymia, participants were randomized to an Enhanced Treatment as Usual (ETAU) condition or SAH‐M. Participants were assessed three and six months after baseline. Results demonstrated a statistically significant association between alexithymia and use of psychological IPV at baseline. Moreover, participants in the SAH‐M condition self‐reported significantly greater reductions in alexithymia over time relative to ETAU participants. Findings suggest that a trauma‐informed intervention may optimize outcomes, helping men who use IPV both limit their use of violence and improve deficits in emotion processing.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Executive functioning impairment is common in substance use disorder and is a major risk factor for poor treatment outcomes, including treatment drop-out and relapse. Cognitive remediation interventions seek to improve executive functioning and offer a promising approach to increase the efficacy of alcohol and other drug (AOD) treatments and improve long-term therapeutic outcomes. This protocol describes a study funded by the NSW Agency for Clinical Innovation that assesses the effectiveness of delivering a six-week group-based intervention of cognitive remediation in an ecologically valid sample of people attending residential AOD treatment services. We primarily aim to investigate whether cognitive remediation will be effective in improving executive functioning and treatment retention rates. We will also evaluate if cognitive remediation may reduce long-term AOD use and rates of health service utilisation, as well as improve personal goal attainment, quality of life, and client satisfaction with treatment. In addition, the study will involve an economic analysis of the cost of delivering cognitive remediation., METHODS/DESIGN: The study uses a stepped wedge cluster randomised design, where randomisation will occur at the cluster level. Participants will be recruited from ten residential AOD treatment services provided by the non-government sector. The intervention will be delivered in 12 one-hour group-based sessions over a period of six weeks. All participants who are expected to receive treatment for the duration of the six-week intervention will be asked to participate in the study. The clusters of participants who are randomly assigned to the treatment condition will complete cognitive remediation in addition to treatment as usual (TAU). Primary and secondary outcome assessments will be conducted at pre-cognitive remediation/TAU phase, post-cognitive remediation/TAU phase, two-month follow-up, four-month follow-up, six-month follow-up, and eight-month follow-up intervals., DISCUSSION: This study will provide comprehensive data on the effect of delivering a cognitive remediation intervention within residential AOD treatment services. If shown to be effective, cognitive remediation may be incorporated as an adjunctive intervention in current treatment programs., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Register (ANZCTR): ACTRN12618001190291 .

AB  - <bold>Background: </bold>Since deinstitutionalization in the 1950s-1970s, public mental health care has changed its focus from asylums to general hospitals, outpatient clinics and specialized community-based programs addressing both clinical and social determinants of mental health. Analysis of the place of community-based programs within a comprehensive health system such as the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) may illuminate the role of social forces in shaping contemporary public mental health systems.<bold>Methods: </bold>National VHA administrative data were used to compare veterans who exclusively received outpatient clinic care to those receiving four types of specialized community-based services, addressing: 1) functional disabilities from severe mental illness (SMI), 2) justice system involvement, 3) homelessness, and 4) vocational rehabilitation. Bivariate comparisons and multinomial logistic regression analyses compared groups on demographics, diagnoses, service use, and psychiatric prescription fills.<bold>Results: </bold>An hierarchical classification of 1,386,487 Veterans who received specialty mental health services from VHA in Fiscal Year 2012, showed 1,134,977 (81.8%) were seen exclusively in outpatient clinics; 27,931 (2.0%) received intensive SMI-related services; 42,985 (3.1%) criminal justice services; 160,273 (11.6%) specialized homelessness services; and 20,921 (1.5%) vocational services. Compared to those seen only in clinics, veterans in the four community treatment groups were more likely to be black, diagnosed with HIV and hepatitis, had more numerous substance use diagnoses and made far more extensive use of mental health outpatient and inpatient care.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Almost one-fifth of VHA mental health patients receive community-based services prominently addressing major social determinants of health and multimorbid substance use disorders.

AB  - Background: The CARe methodology aims to improve the quality of life of people with severe mental illness by supporting them in realizing their goals, handling their vulnerability and improving the quality of their social environment. This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of the CARe methodology for people with severe mental illness on their quality of life, personal recovery, participation, hope, empowerment, self-efficacy beliefs and unmet needs. Methods: A cluster Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) was conducted in 14 teams of three organizations for sheltered and supported housing in the Netherlands. Teams in the intervention group received training in the CARe methodology. Teams in the control group continued working according to care as usual. Questionnaires were filled out at baseline, after 10 months and after 20 months. A total of 263 clients participated in the study. Results: Quality of life increased in both groups, however, no differences between the intervention and control group were found. Recovery and social functioning did not change over time. Regarding the secondary outcomes, the number of unmet needs decreased in both groups. All intervention teams received the complete training program. The model fidelity at T1 was 53.4% for the intervention group and 33.4% for the control group. At T2 this was 50.6% for the intervention group and 37.2% for the control group. Conclusion: All clients improved in quality of life. However we did not find significant differences between the clients of the both conditions on any outcome measure. Possible explanations of these results are: the difficulty to implement rehabilitation-supporting practice, the content of the methodology and the difficulty to improve the lives of a group of people with longstanding and severe impairments in a relatively short period. More research is needed on how to improve effects of rehabilitation trainings in practice and on outcome level.

AB  - Systems Training for Emotional Predictability and Problem Solving (STEPPS) is a manual-based group treatment of persons with borderline personality disorder (BPD). We report results from a study of offenders supervised by the Iowa Department of Corrections. Seventy-seven offenders participated in STEPPS groups. The offenders experienced clinically significant improvement in BPD-related symptoms (d = 1.30), mood, and negative affectivity. Suicidal behaviors and disciplinary infractions were reduced. Baseline severity was inversely associated with improvement. The offenders indicated satisfaction with STEPPS. We conclude that STEPPS can be successfully integrated into the care of offenders with BPD in prison and community corrections settings.

AB  - Background: Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability evidence significant anxiety. This study aimed to adapt a group cognitive behaviour therapies (CBT) programme designed for youth with ASD and anxiety to meet the cognitive, communication, and behavioural needs of adolescents with intellectual disability, and assess initial feasibility and efficacy of the intervention. Methods: Structural, content and procedural adaptations were made to a 14‐week family‐focused CBT intervention. Twenty‐three adolescents with ASD, intellectual disability and anxiety were included. Treatment acceptability along with adolescent anxiety symptoms was assessed via parent report measures. Results: Of the 23 participants, 19 completed treatment and attended 94% of sessions. Parent acceptability was high. Significant reductions were noted on anxiety symptoms post‐intervention. Conclusions: Results indicate that the CBT group was feasible and acceptable. Preliminary outcomes suggest that adolescent anxiety improved, although replication with a larger sample and comparison to a control group is needed.

AB  - Over 2 million soldiers have been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan since 2001. Evidence suggests that they confront significant difficulties postdeployment, including psychosocial problems such as depression, PTSD, substance abuse, and family distress. Few programs to promote healthy reintegration exist that are evidence-based and designed for those not in formal mental health care. In response to this need, a 2-hour workshop, Life Guard, was developed for the Arkansas National Guard. The workshop is based upon Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT; Hayes & Strosahl, 2004) and emphasizes skill development to promote resiliency and successful postdeployment reintegration. The purposes of this pilot study were to describe the deployment experiences of OIF/OEF veterans and evaluate the effectiveness of the workshop. The sample included 144 veterans (63 intervention and 81 control) in a quasi-experimental, pre-post design (interim 2 months) with a delayed intervention control group. Both groups were largely young, male, Caucasian, and married. Control participants were significantly older, and more educated. Symptoms of a variety of psychological disorders and social adjustment were assessed at baseline and follow-up. Participants reported high levels of exposure to traumatic events, physical injury, and symptoms of psychosocial distress. In contrast to control participants, intervention participants reported significant declines in symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSD, and increases in relationship satisfaction. Only effects for depression and relationship satisfaction remained significant in between-group comparisons. Further work is needed to evaluate Life Guard, but results suggest it is a promising workshop to assist with reintegration and resiliency.

AB  - This study is a process-oriented program evaluation of the Critical Time Intervention (CTI) (Susser, Valencia, Conover, Felix, Tsai, & Wyatt 1997), an approach to prevent recurrent homelessness in a group of mentally ill men. CTI was designed to prevent homelessness by improving the continuity of care for individuals being discharged from institutional to community living (CTI group n = 48, control group n = 48). CTI workers provided services based on both clinical judgment and clients' assessments of their service needs. Although many interventions with this group fail because of disagreements between clients and service providers, CTI bridges this gap by allowing a collaborative alliance between the two. The results of this controlled study showed that CTI was effective in reducing homeless nights. However, although this major outcome assessment was completed, it was still not clear what about the program was effective with which clients under what circumstances (Paul, 1967). The specific aims of this study are to examine several other process and outcome variables of the CTI intervention, such as type and frequency of services accessed by men in the CTI group, the types of housing CTI clients gravitated to, and their quality of life ratings as compared to men in the control group. The relationship between schizophrenic symptomatology and nights homeless is explored, and substance abuse is examined as a possible modifier of CTI's effect. Qualitative narratives by CTI workers about the course of intervention for each of the subjects in the CTI group are also reviewed to understand the mechanisms through which CTI operated. Results revealed that there were no differences in patterns of service utilization between the CTI and control groups. Subjects accessed medical, mental health, and substance abuse services at roughly the same rates. Nor were there significant differences in the use of psychiatric emergency room visits, or medical emergency room visits. Men in both CTI and control groups stayed in the same types of housing for roughly equal amounts of time, and rates of hospitalization and jail time were similar. Finally, there were no differences in quality of life ratings or satisfaction with current housing ratings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - ABSTRACT Aims To determine whether substituting Seeking Safety (SS), a manualized therapy for comorbid substance use disorders (SUD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) for part of treatment-as-usual (TAU) improves substance use outcomes. Design Randomized controlled effectiveness trial. Settings Out-patient Veterans Administration Health Care System SUD clinic. Participants Ninety-eight male military Veterans with a SUD and co-occurring PTSD symptomatology. Measurements Drug and alcohol use and PTSD severity, measured on the first day of treatment, and 3 (i.e. the planned end of SS sessions) and 6 months following the baseline assessment. Treatment attendance and patient satisfaction were measured following treatment (3-month follow-up). Active coping was measured at treatment intake and following treatment. Findings SS compared to TAU was associated with better drug use outcomes ( P < 0.05), but alcohol use and PTSD severity decreased equally under both treatments ( P's < 0.01). SS versus TAU was associated with increased treatment attendance, client satisfaction and active coping (all P's < 0.01). However, neither these factors nor decreases in PTSD severity mediated the effect of treatment on drug use. Conclusions The manualized treatment approach for substance use disorder, Seeking Safety, is well received and associated with better drug use outcomes than 'treatment as usual' in male veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder. However, the mechanism of its effect is unclear.

AB  - There are few clinical trials of 12-step treatments for individuals with serious mental illness and alcohol or drug dependence. This randomized trial assessed the effects of adding a 12-session 12-step facilitation therapy (TSF), adapted from that used in Project MATCH, to treatment as usual in an outpatient dual diagnosis program. Participants were 121 individuals dually diagnosed with alcohol dependence and a serious mental disorder, followed during 12 weeks of treatment and 36 weeks post-treatment. Participants receiving TSF had greater participation in 12-step programs, but did not demonstrate greater improvement in alcohol and drug use. However, considered dimensionally, greater participation in TSF was associated with greater improvement in substance use, and greater 12-step participation predicted decreases in frequency and intensity of drinking. Findings suggest that future work with TSF in this population should focus on maximizing exposure to TSF, and maximizing the effect of TSF on 12-step participation.

AB  - This study examined outcomes for 97 clients diagnosed with mental illness and substance abuse (MISA) during 18 months of treatment. Clients were assigned to an experimental or control group at each of three community mental health centers (CMHCs). Two different experimental treatment approaches were used: assertive community treatment (ACT) and reference groups (RG). Controls received usual CMHC services. Substance abuse involved primarily alcohol; at study admission the sample members were assessed to be similar in their severity of alcohol abuse to a sample of persons hospitalized for chronic alcohol use. After 18 months, 65% of ACT clients and 83% of RG, compared to 40% of controls, were still engaged in treatment. Few differences were found between the experimental groups and controls in client outcomes. RG clients reported a reduction in alcohol and marijuana use during the treatment period. During follow-up, ACT and controls reduced hospital days compared to the prior year, whereas RG and controls decreased number of hospital admissions.

AB  - The authors compared 2 approaches to vocational rehabilitation for individuals with severe mental illness: the individual placement and support (IPS) model of supported employment and the diversified placement approach (DPA), which emphasizes work readiness and offers a range of vocational options, including agency-run businesses and agency-contracted placements with community employers. In all, 187 unemployed participants with severe mental illness were randomly assigned to IPS or DPA. Over 2 years, IPS had significantly better competitive employment outcomes than DPA. Competitive employment rates over the 2-year follow-up were 75.0% for IPS and 33.7% for DPA. However, IPS and DPA did not differ on paid employment outcomes. The authors conclude that IPS is more effective than DPA in achieving competitive employment, but not paid employment. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Objective: Employment is a key to participation in community life for people with severe mental illness, especially those who have been involved in the criminal justice system. Although the Individual Placement and Support (IPS) model of supported employment has been established as an evidence-based practice for helping people with severe mental illness attain competitive employment, little is known about whether IPS is effective for people with severe mental illness who have a history of arrest or incarceration. This study examined this question. Methods: A randomized controlled trial examined competitive employment outcomes for 85 participants with severe mental illness and justice involvement who were assigned to IPS or to a comparison group that offered a job club approach with peer support. Results: At one-year follow-up, a greater proportion of participants in the IPS group than in the comparison group had obtained competitive employment (31% versus 7%; p < .01). The IPS and comparison groups did not differ significantly during follow-up in rates of hospitalization (51% versus 40%) or justice involvement-either arrests (24% versus 19%) or incarceration (2% for both groups). Conclusions: Although IPS was shown to be an effective model for helping justice-involved clients with severe mental illness achieve employment, the outcomes were modest compared with those in prior IPS studies. The IPS model provided a useful framework for employment services for this population, but augmentations may be needed.

AB  - Aims: Increasing concerns about the specific needs and rates of mental illness among young adults have spurred the development of youth mental health services. Yet few outcome studies exist. This study aims to evaluate a young adult service in an independent mental health sector in Ireland. Method(s): This is a service evaluation using a retrospective, descriptive and naturalistic study design. Routine demographic, diagnostic and service usage data were collected at entry into the service. Outcomes were recorded at discharge from the service using the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) improvement scores. Factors associated with better or worse outcomes were analyzed. Result(s): Five hundred and sixty-seven young adults were assessed and managed during a 3-year period by the Young Adult Service. Their characteristics fell midway between adolescent and adult mental health service populations. They had high levels of Axis I & II co-morbidities reflecting the complex and fluid nature of emerging conditions in this age group. The majority (62.8%) had clinically improved by the end of follow-up. Outcomes were significantly better in those who were hospitalized, prescribed psychotropic medication, received 1:1 psychology sessions and attended a group-based psychology program or group program for specific disorders. One hundred and sixty-six patients (29.3%) dropped out of follow-up. Drop out was associated with longer time spent in the service, being treated solely in the community, without medication, not having a developmental disorder and not transferring from CAMHS. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates that it is possible to establish an effective youth mental health service with favourable outcomes within a broader mental health system. It provides a benchmark for similar services, bridging the gap between adolescent and adult mental health services.Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd

AB  - BACKGROUND: Individuals with psychosis are known to have a lower self‐esteem compared to the general population, in part because of social stigma, paternalistic care, long periods of institutionalization and negative family interactions. This study aimed at assessing the efficacy of a self‐esteem enhancement program for individuals with severe mental illness and at analyzing the results in their European context. METHOD: A randomized cross‐over study including 54 outpatients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia from Geneva, Switzerland, was conducted. Twenty‐four were recruited from an outpatient facility receiving traditional psychiatric care whereas 30 came from an outpatient facility with case‐management care. Psychosocial, diagnostic and symptom measures were taken for all the subjects before treatment, after treatment, and at 3‐months' follow‐up. RESULTS: Results indicated significant positive self‐esteem module effects on self‐esteem, self‐assertion, active coping strategies and symptom for the participants receiving case‐management care. Results were not significant for those receiving traditional care. However, 71% of all participants expressed satisfaction with the module. CONCLUSION: Individuals with schizophrenia appear to be benefit from the effects of the self‐esteem module, particularly when they are involved in a rehabilitation program and followed by a case manager who liaises with the other partners of the multidisciplinary team. This encourages reconsidering the interventions' format and setting in order to ensure lasting effects on the environment and in turn on coping, self‐esteem and overall empowerment.

AB  - The effects of housing instability and homelessness on child and adult health are well documented. However, few studies have explored health and housing interventions for families with children with the objective of health improvement. Housing Prescriptions as Health Care is a randomized controlled trial that is investigating the impact on physical and mental health of integrating priority placement in affordable housing and the provision of services (case management, financial, and legal), compared to the standard of care (providing resource guides and hospital-based social work or care navigation services). In 2016-19 seventy-eight homeless or housing-unstable families defined as "medically complex"--with a child or adult member who used more health services than usual or had a chronic disease or disability--were enrolled in the trial, and sixty-seven completed a six-month followup. A difference-in-differences analysis at six months showed decreases in the share of children in fair or poor health and in average anxiety and depression scores among parents in the intervention group, relative to the control group. Findings suggest that a population-specific model that integrates health, housing, legal, and social services can improve healthrelated outcomes at the household level.

AB  - Importance: Relapse is highly prevalent following substance abuse treatments, highlighting the need for improved aftercare interventions. Mindfulness-based relapse prevention (MBRP), a group-based psychosocial aftercare, integrates evidence-based practices from mindfulness-based interventions and cognitive-behavioral relapse prevention (RP) approaches.Objective: To evaluate the long-term efficacy of MBRP in reducing relapse compared with RP and treatment as usual (TAU [12-step programming and psychoeducation]) during a 12-month follow-up period.Design, Setting, and Participants: Between October 2009 and July 2012, a total of 286 eligible individuals who successfully completed initial treatment for substance use disorders at a private, nonprofit treatment facility were randomized to MBRP, RP, or TAU aftercare and monitored for 12 months. Participants medically cleared for continuing care were aged 18 to 70 years; 71.5% were male and 42.1% were of ethnic/racial minority.Interventions: Participants were randomly assigned to 8 weekly group sessions of MBRP, cognitive-behavioral RP, or TAU.Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes included relapse to drug use and heavy drinking as well as frequency of substance use in the past 90 days. Variables were assessed at baseline and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up points. Measures used included self-report of relapse and urinalysis drug and alcohol screenings.Results: Compared with TAU, participants assigned to MBRP and RP reported significantly lower risk of relapse to substance use and heavy drinking and, among those who used substances, significantly fewer days of substance use and heavy drinking at the 6-month follow-up. Cognitive-behavioral RP showed an advantage over MBRP in time to first drug use. At the 12-month follow-up, MBRP participants reported significantly fewer days of substance use and significantly decreased heavy drinking compared with RP and TAU.Conclusions and Relevance: For individuals in aftercare following initial treatment for substance use disorders, RP and MBRP, compared with TAU, produced significantly reduced relapse risk to drug use and heavy drinking. Relapse prevention delayed time to first drug use at 6-month follow-up, with MBRP and RP participants who used alcohol also reporting significantly fewer heavy drinking days compared with TAU participants. At 12-month follow-up, MBRP offered added benefit over RP and TAU in reducing drug use and heavy drinking. Targeted mindfulness practices may support long-term outcomes by strengthening the ability to monitor and skillfully cope with discomfort associated with craving or negative affect, thus supporting long-term outcomes.Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01159535

AB  - The purpose of this research is to examine the effectiveness of a project aimed at the vocational rehabilitation of individuals suffering from chronic psychiatric disabilities. Gastown Vocational Services (GVS) is a specialized vocational rehabilitation program, under the auspices of Greater Vancouver Mental Health Service Society. The project consisted of three distinct phases and utilized a gradual, step-by-step rehabilitative approach to achieve vocational success. The first phase of the GVS project included comprehensive vocational assessment and work-readiness skill training. Participants in this phase met in small groups for three hours, three times a week for a 12-week period. The second phase involved supported work-experience placements in the community. These placements were two to five months in duration. The final phase included assistance in seeking employment, job re-training, or educational programs. Assessment measures were taken before participants began the program, immediately after the 12-week job preparation program, and at six-month follow-up. Seventy-three individuals participated in the training program over a two-year period. Their progress was compared to 18 individuals comprising a Waiting List Control group. The results showed significant improvement in the Intervention group on measures of assertiveness, work behaviour, depression, income, and employment status. No changes were evident in the Waiting List Control group.

AB  - Mindfulness based interventions have been shown to be efficacious in treating depression, anxiety, pain and substance use disorders (SUDs). Mindfulness-Based Relapse Prevention (MBRP) is an intervention that integrates cognitive-behavioral relapse prevention and mindfulness meditation practices, in an 8-week, manualized group intervention designed to treat SUDs by helping patients regulate negative emotional states and reactive behavior. This paper describes the rationale, study design and methodology of a two-site, randomized controlled trial comparing MBRP to 12-Step Facilitation (TSF) in military Veterans following completion of intensive outpatient treatment for SUDs. The 8 weeks of 90-min, group-based MBRP or TSF sessions are followed by 3-, 6- and 10-month follow-up period with assessments of alcohol/drug use, quality of life, depression, anxiety, mindfulness and other functional outcomes, such as employment. The primary hypothesis is that MBRP will be significantly better than TSF in promoting recovery and prevention of relapse to substance use in a military Veteran population. The secondary hypothesis is that MBRP will lead to greater improvements in quality of life, depression/anxiety, and functional outcomes, such as employment. This study is designed to provide information about the use of group-based MBRP as a relapse prevention strategy for military Veterans who have completed an intensive SUD clinical treatment program.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of 12-step and cognitive-behavioral (Self-Management and Recovery Training [SMART]) approaches for persons with a dual diagnosis of serious mental illness and substance use disorder in an intensive outpatient/partial hospitalization setting. Participants (n = 112) were alternately assigned to the two treatment conditions, with 50 participants completing the 6-month treatment program. Assessments occurred at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months during treatment, and at 3- and 12-month follow-ups. Analyses were conducted on participants who had completed 3 months of treatment (n = 70). The 12-step intervention was more effective in decreasing alcohol use and increasing social interactions. However, a worsening of medical problems, health status, employment status, and psychiatric hospitalization were associated with the 12-step intervention. SMART was more effective in improving health and employment status, but marijuana use was greater for SMART participants. Improvements in alcohol use and life satisfaction occurred in both approaches. Covariates associated with treatment outcome were identified, with greater attendance being positively related to outcome. Involvement with the criminal justice system was positively related to treatment completion but negatively associated with medical problems. Less alcohol use, fewer medical problems, and better financial well-being at baseline were associated with better attendance.

AB  - An open prospective controlled study was designed to compare the efficacy of short‐term dynamic group psychotherapy with the standard treatment in patients with depressive symptoms attended in the primary care setting. A total of 115 patients with depressive symptoms were assigned to receive psychotherapy (75min) over 9months (37 to 39 sessions) (n=70) or the standard care (n=45). Outcome measures were the differences between baseline and post‐treatment in the 17‐item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM‐A) and the Short‐Form Health Survey (SF‐12) questionnaire in the two study groups. At the end of dynamic group psychotherapy, statistically significant improvements in the mean scores of all questionnaires were observed, whereas in control patients, significant improvements were only observed in the HDRS‐17 scale and in the Mental Component Summary score of the SF‐12. The mean changes after treatment were also higher in the psychotherapy group than in controls in all outcome measures, with statistically significant differences in the mean differences in favour of the psychotherapy group. In summary, implementation of short‐term dynamic group psychotherapy run by experienced psychotherapists for patients with depressive symptoms attended in routine primary care centres is feasible and effective. © 2016 The Authors.

KEY PRACTITIONER MESSAGE: Short‐term dynamic group psychotherapy was delivered as a non‐pharmacological intervention to improve depressive symptoms. Statistically significant differences as compared with a control group were observed in 17‐item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM‐A) and the Short‐Form Health Survey (SF‐12) questionnaire. Implementation of short‐term dynamic group psychotherapy run by experienced psychotherapists for patients with depressive symptoms attended in routine primary care centres is feasible and effective.

AB  - Objective: To retrospectively determine whether race differentially influences treatment adherence and clinical outcomes among 68 African Americans and 92 whites treated for major depression in four urban, primary care settings. Method: Study participants were randomly assigned to standardized interpersonal psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy with nortriptyline, and were assessed at baseline, and successive time points up to 8 months for severity of depression, and mental and physical health-related functioning. Results: Intent-to-treat analyses revealed no treatment or race-specific differences in symptomatic recovery when both groups were provided standardized psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy. However, African Americans had poorer functional outcomes than whites. Conclusions: African American and white primary medical care patients are effectively treated with standardized psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy. Future research should assess the impact of cultural context on symptom presentation, psychosocial functioning, and treatment adherence and response. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science BN.

AB  - This study investigated matching client attributes to different aftercare treatments. A naturalistic sample of adults entering substance abuse treatment was randomized into either Structured Relapse Prevention (RP, n=61) or a 12-Step Facilitation (TSF, n=72) aftercare program. Four patient attributes were matched to treatment: age, gender, substance abuse profile, and psychological status. Substance use outcomes were assessed 3 and 6 months posttreatment. At 6 months, four significant matches were uncovered. Females and individuals with a multiple substance abuse profile reported better alcohol outcomes with TSF aftercare than their cohorts exposed to RP aftercare. Individuals with high psychological distress at treatment entry were able to maintain longer periods of posttreatment abstinence with TSF aftercare compared to their cohorts exposed to RP. Inversely, RP was found to maintain abstinence significantly longer for individuals reporting low distress compared to those with high distress. Finally, better outcomes were achieved when random assignment to aftercare was consistent with participant preference. Overall, an Alcoholics Anonymous approach to aftercare appears to provide the most favorable substance use outcomes for most groups of substance abusers. RP may be most suitable for clients whose psychological distress is low, especially where maintenance of abstinence is targeted. Where choice in aftercare program is possible, matching client preference with type of aftercare program can improve outcome.

AB  - In a randomized trial, this study compared the longitudinal outcome patterns of veterans (N = 66) with substance use disorders and major depressive disorder receiving standard pharmacotherapy and either 12-Step Facilitation Therapy (TSF) or disorder-specific Integrated Cognitive Behavioral Treatment (ICBT). Depression and substance use were assessed at intake, during and after treatment using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Time Line Follow Back. Reductions in depression during treatment were comparable between the two treatment groups; however, their posttreatment patterns were distinct. While ICBT participants evidenced a steady linear decline in depression through six months posttreatment, a quadratic trend characterized TSF participants, for whom depression declined during treatment, but increased throughout posttreatment follow-up. During treatment, TSF participants used substances less frequently relative to those in ICBT; however, reductions in substance use were more stable through six months posttreatment among those in ICBT relative to TSF. While both interventions produced improvement in depression and substance use during treatment, ICBT may yield more stable clinical outcomes once treatment ceases.

AB  - Context: Recent trauma survivors with acute stress disorder (ASD) are likely to subsequently develop chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Cognitive behavioral therapy for ASD may prevent PTSD, but trauma survivors may not tolerate exposure-based therapy in the acute phase. There is a need to compare nonexposure therapy techniques with prolonged exposure for ASD. Objective: To determine the efficacy of exposure therapy or trauma-focused cognitive restructuring in preventing chronic PTSD relative to a wait-list control group. Design, Setting, and Participants: A randomized controlled trial of civilians who experienced trauma and who met the diagnostic criteria for ASD (N = 90) seen at an outpatient clinic between March 1, 2002, and June 30, 2006. Intervention: Patients were randomly assigned to receive 5 weekly 90-minute sessions of either imaginal and in vivo exposure (n=30) or cognitive restructuring (n = 30), or assessment at baseline and after 6 weeks (wait-list group; n = 30). Main Outcome Measures: Measures of PTSD at the 6-month follow-up visit by clinical interview and self-report assessments of PTSD, depression, anxiety, and trauma-related cognition. Results: Intent-to-treat analyses indicated that at posttreatment, fewer patients in the exposure group had PTSD than those in the cognitive restructuring or wait-list groups (33% vs 63% vs 77%; P=.002). At follow-up, patients who underwent exposure therapy were more likely to not meet diagnostic criteria for PTSD than those who under-went cognitive restructuring (37% vs 63%; odds ratio, 2.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-3.94;P=.05) and to achieve full remission (47% vs 13%; odds ratio, 2.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.14-6.83; P =.005). On assessments of PTSD, depression, and anxiety, exposure resulted in markedly larger effect sizes at posttreatment and follow-up than cognitive restructuring. Conclusions: Exposure-based therapy leads to greater reduction in subsequent PTSD symptoms in patients with ASD when compared with cognitive restructuring. Exposure should be used in early intervention for people who are at high risk for developing PTSD.

AB  - Compared the effectiveness of time-limited group and individual psychotherapy for 98 nonpsychotic psychiatric patients in a 1-yr follow-up. Ss completed the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory, the UCLA Loneliness Scale, and the SCL-90. Ss were also evaluated by therapists and significant others. While both treatments led to significant improvements and similar outcomes on most objective measures, Ss indicated a preference for individual therapy. It is suggested that therapists convey to their patients that they do not need to rely on only one course of therapy. Flexibility on the therapist's part and good communication with the group may improve individual patients' views of group therapy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Homeless adults with both a serious mental illness and substance dependence (n=276) were randomly assigned to: (1) a social model residential program providing integrated mental health and substance abuse treatment (n=67; 81% male; mean age = 36 years); (2) a community based nonresidential program using the same social model approach (n=144; 83% male; mean age = 37 years); or (3) a control group receiving no intervention but free to access other community services (n=65; 89% male; mean age = 37 years). Interventions were designed to provide 3 months of intensive treatment, followed by 3 months of nonresidential maintenance. Subjects completed baseline interviews prior to randomization and reinterviews 3, 6, and 9 months later. Results showed that, while substance use, mental health, and housing outcomes improved from baseline, subjects assigned to treatment conditions differed little from control subjects. Examination of the relationship between length of treatment exposure and outcomes suggested that residential treatment had positive effects on outcomes at 3 months, but that these effects were eroded by 6 months.

AB  - Outpatient alcoholism treatment programs are widespread especially in the United States and in Great Britain. However, there still exist only a few experimental studies investigating the numerous questions arising from this field. In this still ongoing project 120 patients were randomly assigned to 3 different outpatient group therapy programs: unspecific supportive therapy and 2 forms of behavioural therapy - coping skills training [17] and cognitive therapy according to Beck [2]. The main hypotheses to be tested are that both forms of behavioural therapy will prove superior to supportive treatment and that patients with a comorbidity of personality disorders will profit in a different way from these differentiated intervention strategies. Treatment lasted 6 months; first results obtained after the termination of this period demonstrate the feasibility of the study design; patients undergoing behavioural therapy showed good compliance with few drop-outs and significantly higher rates of abstinence compared with supportive therapy. 60% of the patients suffer from a concomitant personality disorder (mostly of the dependent, insecure, and masochistic type). Nevertheless, statistically significant differences between the 2 behavioural therapy techniques could not be established; a positive correlation between personality disorders and relapse or attrition could be confirmed only for relapses occurring within the first 3 months of treatment.

AB  - An attempt was made to assess the effectiveness of marital therapy on drinking behavior. After hospitalization for treatment of alcoholism, 40 alcoholics (5 F's), & their spouses, volunteered for marital group therapy on an outpatient basis; 20 couples participated while 20 were placed on a waiting list. Emphasis in therapy was placed on problem-solving techniques. The groups did not differ with respect to age, occupation, mean number of prior hospitalizations for alcoholism, or in mean scores on the Primary Communication Inventory or the Conjugal Life questionnaire (both from A. Ely, "Efficacy of Training in Confugal Therapy," Rutgers U, 1970). At 6-month follow-up, 9 of the therapy group & 2 of the waiting-list group were abstinent. The spouses of the drinking patients who were in therapy had significantly lower scores on the Conjugal Life questionnaire than the spouses of abstinent patients in therapy, indicating that they had more difficulty with acceptance & trust. Relapses tended to occur within the first 3 months following hospital discharge; those patients in therapy & abstinent at 3 months were also abstinent at 6 months. Case histories are presented to illustrate which type of alcoholics benefit from marital group therapy. The findings suggest that marital group therapy is an effective form of important follow-up treatment. 1 Table. Modified HA.

AB  - Introduction: In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of occupational therapy and psychosocial interventions on the interpersonal functioning and individual and social performance levels of corresponding patients under the heading of psychosocial treatment approaches in psychiatry clinics as well as the attitudes of the patients in regard to those interventions. Methods: In 2013, out of psychotic (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder/mania) and nonpsychotic (depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, alcohol dependence) inpatients in our clinic, 48 patients who participated in occupational activities were included in the study group and 43 patients who did not participate in these activities were included in the control group. We prepared and implemented a 3-item questionnaire constructed by our team, which probed the patients' thoughts on these occupational activities. The Interpersonal Functioning Scale (IFS) and Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP) were applied to both groups on hospital admission and discharge; variations in scale scores were evaluated on par with sociodemographic variables, and the study and control groups were compared. Results: In total, 91% of the study group provided positive feedback regarding the aforementioned interventions. When comparing the study and control groups, the IFS variance score of the study group did not show a significant difference with respect to that of the control group. A statistically significant difference (p<0.0001) was observed in the PSP scores. Evaluation of the PSP of the occupational activities, focusing on sociodemographics and diagnostic labels, revealed a significant improvement in nonpsychotic patients (p=0.002) compared with psychotic patients, in females (p=0.001) compared with males, in unemployed patients (p=0.0001) compared with employed patients, in single patients (p=0.002) compared with married patients, in less-educated patients (p=0.004) compared with high school graduates, and in patients younger than 45 years (p=0.002) compared with those older than 45 years. Conclusion: The findings of our study showed coherence with the literature regarding similar studies conducted on psychotic subgroups. The results demonstrated significantly positive repercussions, specifically in the treatment of nonpsychotic patients; both groups benefited from occupational activities, as shown by improvements in all psychiatric inpatients' PSP scores in comparison with scores of the control group. We concluded that the recruitment of psychosocial treatment approaches enhanced personal and social performance in the patient groups, thereby leading to additional clinical benefits.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bipolar disorder (BD) costs the English economy an estimated £5.2billion/year, largely through incomplete recovery. This analysis estimated the cost‐effectiveness of group psychoeducation (PEd), versus group peer support (PS), for treating BD. METHODS: A 96‐week pragmatic randomised controlled trial (RCT), conducted in NHS primary care. The primary analysis compared PEd with PS, using multiple imputed datasets for missing values. An economic model was used to compare PEd with treatment as usual (TAU). The perspective was Health and Personal Social Services. RESULTS: Participants receiving PEd (n=153) used more (costly) health‐related resources than PS (n=151) (net cost per person £1098 (95% CI, £252‐£1943)), with a quality‐adjusted life year (QALY) gain of 0.023 (95% CI, 0.001‐0.056). The cost per QALY gained was £47,739. PEd may be cost‐effective (versus PS) if decision makers are willing to pay at least £37,500 per QALY gained. PEd costs £10,765 more than PS to avoid one relapse. The economic model indicates that PEd may be cost‐effective versus TAU if it reduces the probability of relapse (by 15%) or reduces the probability of and increases time to relapse (by 10%). LIMITATIONS: Participants were generally inconsistent in attending treatment sessions and low numbers had complete cost/QALY data. Factors contributing to pervasive uncertainty of the results are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first economic evaluation of PEd versus PS in a pragmatic trial. PEd is associated with a modest improvement in health status and higher costs than PS. There is a high level of uncertainty in the data and results.

AB  - Purpose – The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of introducing clinical case management into a youth alcohol and other drug treatment setting. Design/methodology/approach – Case management as usual (CMAU), the current brokerage model operating as a control group was compared to clinical case management (CCM). Individual client outcomes were compared with the site as the grouping variable. Findings – Although alcohol and drug outcomes were similar, arguably slightly favouring the intervention group, results suggest that young people receiving clinical case management showed potentially greater improvement across a range of other health outcomes including mental health, treatment utilisation and social outcomes than the CMAU brokerage model. Practical implications – The study examined the feasibility of training clinicians in a youth alcohol and drug treatment agency in a clinical case management model and examined whether this more intensive case management approach could improve substance use and mental health outcomes for young people. Originality/value – Although widely used, much less is known about the efficacy of case management within substance use treatment settings, where case management tends to be loosely defined and encompasses a broad range of activities. The originality of this study is that little is known about the effectiveness of case management in youth services, where it tends to be the primary service offered.

AB  - Background: Recent reviews of evidence-based guidelines for the clinical management of Bipolar Disorders (BD) have recommended that “all patients with BD should be offered group or individual psychoeducation” to prevent relapse, improve treatment adherence, quality of life and functioning. The present study aimed at evaluating the psychoeducation in routine mental health. Methods: One hundred and two outpatients were recruited from two Italian DMHs. Inclusion criteria were a lifetime diagnosis of BD type I or II assessed by SCID-I, being euthymic for at least 3 months. Exclusion criteria were a DSM-IV Axis I comorbidity, mental retardation (IQ <70), organic brain damage. All subjects received standard psychiatric care, with standard pharmacological treatment; one group received additional 21 weekly sessions of psychoeducation group, according to Colom and Vieta model. Results: Data show that the number of patients hospitalized during the 1-year follow-up, the mean number of hospitalizations per patient and the mean number of days in hospital were significantly lower for psychoeducated patients. Conclusion: Our study supports the view that group psychoeducation is an efficacious intervention to prevent patients’ hospitalization and decrease hospital days in pharmacologically treated patients with bipolar disorder, also in routine clinical settings. The results seem to confirm that the psychoeducation promotes an improvement in the course of illness, avoiding acute phases, and producing a greater stabilization of the disease and consequently an improvement in quality of life in people with BD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Emotional disorders are highly prevalent in primary care. We aimed to determine whether a transdiagnostic psychological therapy plus treatment‐as‐usual (TAU) is more efficacious than TAU alone in primary care adult patients. METHODS: A randomized, two‐arm, single‐blind clinical trial was conducted in 22 primary care centres in Spain. A total of 1061 adult patients with emotional disorders were enrolled. The transdiagnostic protocol (n = 527) consisted of seven 90‐min sessions (8‐10 patients) delivered over a 12‐14‐week period. TAU (n = 534) consisted of regular consultations with a general practitioner. Primary outcome measures were self‐reported symptoms of anxiety, depression, and somatizations. Secondary outcome measures were functioning and quality of life. Patients were assessed at baseline, post‐treatment, and at 3, 6, and 12 months. Intention‐to‐treat and per‐protocol analyses were performed. RESULTS: Post‐treatment primary outcomes were significantly better in the transdiagnostic group compared to TAU (anxiety: p < 0.001; Morris's d = ‐0.65; depression: p < 0.001; d = ‐0.58, and somatic symptoms: p < 0.001; d = ‐0.40). These effects were sustained at the 12‐month follow‐up (anxiety: p < 0.001; d = ‐0.44; depression: p < 0.001; d = ‐0.36 and somatic symptoms: p < 0.001; d = ‐0.32). The transdiagnostic group also had significantly better outcomes on functioning (d = 0.16‐0.33) and quality of life domains (d = 0.24‐0.42), with sustained improvement at the 12‐month follow‐up in functioning (d = 0.25‐0.39) and quality of life (d = 0.58‐0.72). Reliable recovery rates showed large between‐group effect sizes (d > 0.80) in favour of the transdiagnostic group after treatment and at the 12‐month follow‐up. CONCLUSIONS: Adding a brief transdiagnostic psychological intervention to TAU may significantly improve outcomes in emotional disorders treated in primary care.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the influence of an interdisciplinary re-employment programme on labour force participation and perceived health among unemployed persons with common mental health problems. In addition, the influence of entering paid employment on self-rated physical health and mental health was investigated. Methods: In this quasi-experimental study with 2 years follow up, 869 persons were enrolled after referral to an interdisciplinary re-employment programme (n = 380) or regular re-employment programme (n = 489). The propensity score technique was used to account for observed differences between the intervention and control group. The intervention programme was provided by an interdisciplinary team, consisting of mental health care professionals as well as employment specialists. Mental health problems were addressed through cognitive counselling and individual tailored job-search support was provided by an employment professional. Primary outcome measures were paid employment and voluntary work. Secondary outcome measures were self-rated mental and physical health, measured by the Short Form 12 Health Survey, and anxiety and depressive symptoms, measured by the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale. Changes in labour force participation and health were examined with repeated-measures logistic regression analyses by the generalized estimating equations method. Results: The interdisciplinary re-employment programme did not have a positive influence on entering employment or physical or mental health among unemployed persons with mental health problems. After 2 years, 10% of the participants of the intervention programme worked fulltime, compared to 4% of the participants of the usual programmes (adjusted OR 1.65). The observed differences in labour force participation were not statistically significant. However, among persons who entered paid employment, physical health improved (+16%) and anxiety and depressive symptoms decreased (−15%), whereas health remained unchanged among persons who continued to be unemployed. Conclusions: Policies to improve population health should take into account that promoting paid employment may be an effective intervention to improve health. It is recommended to invest in interdisciplinary re-employment programmes with a first place and train approach. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: This Stage 1b controlled trial sought a preliminary test of the relative efficacy of Behavioral Therapy for Depression in Drug Dependence (BTDD) against a structured relaxation intervention (REL) for treating DSM-IV depressive disorders and substance abuse. Method: Thirty-eight methadone maintained opiate dependent participants, who met criteria for a DSM-IV depressive disorder, were randomized to one of two, 24-week treatment conditions (BTDD or REL). Results: Depression response, defined as at least a 50% reduction in Hamilton Depression Scale score from baseline to the end of study, was high and similar in both BTDD (61%) and REL (65%). Rates of drug use were low overall, both at baseline and at the end of study, and did not differ between treatment groups at study endpoint. Conclusions: The findings suggest that both behavioral- and relaxation-based approaches show promise for treating comorbid depression in drug dependent populations. Future work should examine combining or modifying these interventions to target substance use more directly and include values based methods for increasing more adaptive behavioral patterns.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the effectiveness of multiple group family treatment for Schizophrenia. Method Relatives were randomly provided with an informative programme (n = 50), or allocated to receive an additional support programme (n = 26). Patients did not attend the programme to overcome cultural and organizational implementation barriers. The 12 and 24 months clinical and family outcomes were assessed. Results Patients' compliance with standard care was greater at 12 months in the more intensive behavioural management group over a control group receiving treatment as usual (TAU) (n = 25). A reduction in levels of expressed emotion (EE), significantly more frequent in those receiving the additional support programme than just the informative, occurred after treatment completion. Other clinical and family outcomes did not differ. However, treatment benefits declined at 24 months, when baseline high EE was again predictive of patient's admission and relatives were more vulnerable to objective burden. Baseline illness severity variables predicted a number of medium and long-term poor clinical outcomes. Conclusions Although family psychoeducation has been tested in a wide range of Anglo-Saxon settings, there remains need to assess outcomes more internationally. Effective family interventions for people with schizophrenia probably require continued administration of key-elements or ongoing informal support to deal with the vicissitudes of illnesses.

AB  - Objectives: To compare the effectiveness of a psychoeducational group program and conventional treatment versus individual conventional care in patients with a mild/moderate depression disorder in urban primary healthcare centers (PHCC). Methods: Design: randomized controlled trial of two groups. Sample: patients aged 20 years attended in 13 PHCC, identified by general practitioners and nurses with diagnosis of mid/moderate depression disorder (BDI scale) between December 2008 and April 2009. The intervention group received a psycoeducational group program (12 weeks, two nurses). The program provided health education about the illness, pharmacological treatment, diet, physical exercise, problem solving, and cognitive‐behavioral therapy. The control group received conventional care. The evolution of patients is monitoring up to 1 year after the inclusion by an individual interview (baseline and 3, 6, 9 months). The battery of assessment included: Sociodemographic, BDI and EuroQol‐5D questionnaires. Results: 241 patients (126 intervention Group (IG); 115 control Group (CG)), 217 women (53% IG and 47%CG) with a mean age of 54, 11 (SD=12,656). 92% Spanish. 45% married. Academic level: 76, 5 % study and 13,5% non‐study. The mean BDI in the baseline GI 21, 66 (SD=6,87) and CG 19.62(SD=6.85), follow up 3 months, GI 13,91(SD=8.22) and CG 17,07(SD=7,930). The mean of EuroQoL in the baseline IG 48, 29 (SD= 17,77) and CG 53,0 (SD= 19,06), follow up 3m, GI 56,57(SD=22,12) and CG 45,28(SD=23,74). Conclusions: The two groups are comparable for all variables analyzed. There is an improvement in the IG versus CG on depressive symptoms and quality of life.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this article is to examine two evidence-based models of case management for people with co-occurring disorders and histories of chronic homelessness and to better understand their roles in permanent supported housing. Critical Time Intervention and Assertive Community Treatment are examined in terms of key elements, how they assist in ending homelessness, as well as the role they play in an individual's recovery from co-occurring disorders.Methods: Participants in two supported housing programs were interviewed at baseline and 6 months. One program used Critical Time Intervention (n= 144) and the other used Assertive Community Treatment (n= 90). Staff in both programs were interviewed about their experiences and fidelity assessments were conducted for each program.Results: Both programs operated at high levels of fidelity. Despite similar criteria for participation, there were significant differences between groups. Critical Time Intervention participants were older, were more likely to be male, were more likely to be homeless, and reported greater psychiatric symptoms and higher levels of substance use (allp's < .001). Separate outcome analyses suggested that each program was successful in supporting people to transition from homelessness to stable housing; 88.6% of Assertive Community Treatment participants were homeless at baseline, while at 6 months 30% were homeless (p< .001), and 91.3% of those in the Critical Time Intervention were homeless at baseline, while 44.3% were homeless at 6 months (p< .001). Participants in the Critical Time Intervention program also showed significant decreases in alcohol use, drug use, and psychiatric symptoms (allp's < .01). The preliminary results suggest that each case management model is helpful in assisting people with complex behavioral health needs and chronic homelessness to move to stable housing.Conclusions: Permanent supported housing seems to be an effective way to end homelessness among people with co-occurring disorders. Further research is needed to determine which case management models work most effectively with supported housing to help policy makers and program directors make informed decisions in developing these programs.

AB  - Research on the merits of long-term group residences is inconclusive. The purpose of the present paper was to investigate the effects of supported group residence on the symptoms, social function, quality of life, general health quality, and the medical/psychiatric cost in Japan of a large number of psychiatric beds and long average length of stay. Patients were assessed every 6 months for 2 years using Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Katz Adjustment Scale, World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHO-QOL) and General Health Questionnaire 12-item version. Patients discharged to the supported group residence (SGR) significantly improved with regard to positive symptoms, the level of socially expected activities and free-time activities. The QOL physical domain of the inpatients was significantly more deteriorated compared to the SGR group. The total psychiatric/medical cost of the SGR group was approximately one-third that of the inpatient group, while the cost of the SGR to treat physical comorbidity was much higher. The present findings indicate that SGR has advantages for mental and social function but not for physical health. A major limitation of the present study was the high mean age (> 60 years) of the subjects who had been hospitalized for a long period (mean, 24 years).

AB  - Compared 2 types of treatment modalities in treating 723 homeless, mentally ill, chemical abusing men (mean age 33.4 yrs). Ss were interviewed on their childhood and family background and their psychiatric and substance abuse disorders, and then randomly assigned into either therapeutic community (TC) or community residence (CR) programs. The TC and CRs differed from one another in their intake and admission procedures, their preadmission and postadmission dropout rates, and the effects of treatment on psychological status. The TC appears to be more effective than CRs in reducing depressive, psychotic, and functional symptoms for Ss who stayed in treatment 1 yr or longer. Ss' childhood and family backgrounds reveal severe parental deprivations and high prevalence of alcohol and other drug abuse, mental illness, and criminal behavior among the Ss' parents.

AB  - Context: The World Health Organization (WHO) places major depressive disorder (MDD), or depression, as the fourth leading cause of disability worldwide. Some studies have found that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) represents the most superior approach in treating mild to severe symptoms. Recent literature has indicated a number of limitations to this therapeutic approach. An approach that has received increasing attention within the literature is the emotional freedom technique (EFT). Objective: The current pilot study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of CBT and EFT in the treatment of depression and comorbid anxiety. Design: The research team designed a pilot study structured as a randomized, controlled trial with 2 intervention arms. Setting: The study took place at Bond University in Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. Participants: Participants (n= 10) were local community members who had screened positive for a primary diagnosis of MDD. Intervention: Participants were randomly assigned to an 8-wk CBT or EFT treatment program, the intervention groups. A sample of individuals from the community was assessed for comparative purposes (control group) (n = 57). Outcome Measures: Pre- and postintervention, all participants were interviewed using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) 6.0, and they completed the following validated questionnaires: (1) the Beck Depression Inventory, second edition (BDI-2) and (2) the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales (DASS-21). Results: Findings revealed that both treatment approaches produced significant reductions in depressive symptoms, with the CBT group reporting a significant reduction postintervention, which was not maintained with time. The EFT group reported a delayed effect involving a significant reduction in symptoms at the 3- and 6-mo follow-ups only. Examination of the individual cases revealed clinically significant improvements in anxiety across both interventions. Conclusions: Overall, the findings provide evidence to suggest that EFT might be an effective treatment strategy worthy of further investigation.

AB  - Background: The total cost of mental health disorders to Canada’s economy is estimated to be more than $50 billion annually. Although evidence supports the use of cognitive-behavioral therapy for depression and anxiety disorders, access to therapy is limited. This is especially the case in the Vancouver Island community of Victoria, where depression and anxiety are prevalent but treatment is difficult to obtain. In 2015 the Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) Skills Group program was initiated to provide early, destigmatizing, equitable, and timely intervention on a large scale and to enhance collaborative care between psychiatrists and family physicians. Funding was provided by the Shared Care Committee with contributions from the Victoria Division of Family Practice and Island Health. Family physicians were trained by psychiatrists to facilitate the CBT-based training to be delivered in 90-minute group medical visits over 8 consecutive weeks. A referral centre was established and participants were asked to sign up online to join a skills group of 15 members. Methods: Four psychometric scales were used to measure participant depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and functional disability: the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale, the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS), and the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS). Participants used these scales to provide preintervention and postintervention self-reports. As well, participants rated the impact of the program and provided qualitative feedback. All participant responses were converted into non-nominal data and analyzed by an external agency (Reichert and Associates). A wait-time analysis was also conducted partway through the project period. Results: From September 2015 to April 2018, a total of 2352 participants registered in 149 CBT skills groups. The majority of participants were female (1820) and their average age was 46 years. More than half of participants attended most sessions. Self-reports were collected from 874 of 1403 participants attending six or more of the eight sessions for a response rate of 62%. Mean symptom scores on psychometric scales for anxiety, depression, and functional disability indicated improvement, with many participants demonstrating a shift from moderate to mild levels of symptom severity (n = 802). The average participant satisfaction rating for the program on a 5-point Likert scale was 4.66. The wait-time analysis showed that approximately three-quarters of participants referred had entered a group within 3 months of referral (628 of 832), and approximately one-quarter entered a group within 1 month of referral (204 of 832). Conclusions: The self-report data analyzed during the project suggest participants in the CBT Skills Group program experienced a reduction in symptoms of depression and anxiety. However, these results must be interpreted cautiously because data were not collected for research purposes but for program quality improvement. A particular challenge encountered during the project was the lack of resources to individually screen and prepare each patient. Consequently, patients who were not a good fit for group CBT delivery (e.g., patients with personality disorder or active trauma symptoms) were occasionally referred. While it may seem costly to use family physicians to facilitate CBT skills groups, the cost of usual care wherein family physicians provide four 20-minute individual appointments ($209.80) was comparable to the per-person cost of the intervention ($197.52), where patients receive 12 hours of physician-led group time, making the skills groups a cost-effective and equitable way to deliver early intervention services. Current limitations in mental health care also make physicians the only viable service providers. Furthermore, having family physicians deliver mental health services may reduce stigma by showing that mental health affects general health and is valued as a vital part of primary care.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the quality of life, efficacy and safety of Warm-Supplementing Kidney Yang (WSKY) added to risperidone in patients with schizophrenia. DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial. SETTING: The outpatient and inpatient departments of three hospitals. SUBJECTS: One hundred and twenty patients with clinically diagnosed schizophrenia with predominantly negative symptoms were included in the study. INTERVENTION: All 120 patients were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with WSKY group (n = 60) or placebo group (n = 60) added to risperidone for eight weeks. MAIN MEASURE: The efficacy measures included the World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale (WHOQOL-100), the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Social Disability Screening Schedule and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Safety and tolerability were assessed throughout the trial. RESULTS: The scores of quality of life in the WSKY group showed statistically significant improvement at the end-point of treatment compared with those in the placebo group (WSKY, increasing 40.5 (29.4); placebo, increasing 14.4 (27.1); F =24.900, P<0.001), while the scores of social function and depression symptoms also showed statistically significant improvement. The response rates for the WHOQOL-100 total scores were 50.0% for the WSKY group versus 31.7% for placebo group (chi( 2) = 4.172, P=0.041). There were no significant differences in the safety/tolerability measures between the WSKY group and the placebo group during treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that WSKY added to risperidone significantly improved the quality of life, social function, depression symptom compared with placebo added to risperidone.

AB  - Objectives: This study explores the two-year housing- and non-housing-related outcomes for adults who are homeless with problematic substance use who received scattered-site housing and intensive case management services from a Housing First program in Ottawa, Canada, in comparison with a group of adults who are homeless with problematic substance use who had access to standard care in the community. Methods: Housing First clients (n = 89) and members of a comparison group (n = 89) completed structured interviews at baseline and were followed for two years. Results: Housing First clients moved into housing more quickly, reported a greater proportion of time housed, were more likely to spend the final six months housed, and had longer housing tenure at 24months. There was a group by time interaction on problematic alcohol use with more rapid improvement for the comparison group; however, both groups improved over time. The comparison group had a greater decrease on problematic drug use by 24months. There was no change in physical health and only the comparison group had improvements in mental health by 24months. The groups had similar improvement on community functioning by 24months. The comparison group had a greater increase in total quality of life. More specifically, the comparison group had an increase in the family relations-related quality of life, whereas the clients did not. There was a significant interaction for safety-related quality of life, but both groups experienced improvements over time and had comparable levels of satisfaction with safety at each time point. The Housing First clients reported higher levels of satisfaction with living conditions than the comparison group at baseline and 12months, but not at 24months. There was significant improvement over time and no main effect of group for finances, leisure, and social relations. Conclusions: Adults who are homeless with problematic substance use can successfully be housed using a Housing First approach. However, further targeted services might be required to address other areas of functioning, such as health, substance use, and quality of life.

AB  - Historically, U.S. Veterans Affairs (VA) residential programs offered treatment for particular diagnoses in separate programs. Although increasing emphasis is being placed on integrated treatment, little research has examined varying models of providing effective residential PTSD treatment. The current evaluation assessed potential differences in the effectiveness of group Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) under two different program models. The first offered CPT as part of a formal PTSD residential treatment program only. The second model offered CPT as a component of care regardless of an individual's core treatment program (e.g., substance abuse, general mental health). Patients included 247 Veterans enrolled in residential group CPT at a large Midwest VA (93.1% male, 67.6% Caucasian, average age 43.96). Comparisons showed that veterans in all models showed significant PTSD symptom improvement, with no significant differences between those enrolled in different treatment models. Our results indicated that there was no detriment to opening CPT groups to those outside the PTSD residential program, even when Veterans had comorbidities to their trauma diagnosis. Length of stay in residential treatment was also significantly reduced for Veterans in the more integrated model. Our results support the move toward treatment integration.

AB  - The current study evaluated the effectiveness and acceptability of a nine-week group-based drama therapy program with a public performance component for individuals with dual-diagnosis. It examined the impact of drama therapy on the growth and recovery of the participants and perspectives of community members in adults with SMI (schizophrenia spectrum disorder, major depressive disorder, or bipolar disorder) and co-occurring substance use disorder participated in the program. The drama therapy program was well-tolerated by the participants. The focus group results showed participants' general acceptance and enjoyment of drama therapy. Among the benefits of the drama therapy process, the group interaction appeared to help the participants build a new supportive sober community and to develop a positive network of friends. Although no significant changes in quantitative measures were observed due to the small sample size, the modest improvement in the BPRS total score is suggestive of the therapeutic value of drama therapy in alleviating psychiatric symptoms. Subject recruitment proved the most difficult aspect of the program. Participants' lack of familiarity with the concept and process of drama therapy likely contributed to their hesitance to join the program. Introductory information sessions were held during the recruitment phase of the program, but recruitment for future drama therapy groups may benefit from the use of past drama therapy participant testimonials.

AB  - Accessible summary Depression is considered a factor that interferes with HIV prevention., Depression may reach 41% among low-income Chilean women., The current study analyzed the impact of Mano a Mano-Mujer, an HIV prevention intervention, on depressive symptoms among low-income Chilean women., Mano a Mano-Mujer provided significant benefits for women's depression symptoms., Abstract Worldwide, and in Chile, the number of women living with HIV is increasing. Depression is considered a factor that interferes with HIV prevention. Depression may reach 41% among low-income Chilean women. Depressed people are less willing to participate in behaviours that protect them against HIV. The aim of this study is to analyze the impact of Mano a Mano-Mujer ( MM-M), and HIV prevention intervention, on depressive symptoms among Chilean women. A quasi-experimental design was used for this study. The research was conducted in Santiago, Chile; a total of 400 women participated in the study (intervention group, n = 182; control group, n = 218). The intervention was guided by the social-cognitive model and the primary health care model. The intervention consists of six 2-h sessions delivered in small groups. Sessions covered: HIV prevention, depression, partner's communication, and substance abuse. Face-to-face interviews were conducted at baseline and at 3-month follow-up. Chilean women who participated in MM-M significantly decreased, at 3 months follow up, their reported depressive symptoms. MM-M provided significant benefits for women's depression symptoms. In this study nurses participated as leaders for the screening of depressive symptoms and as facilitators of community interventions.

AB  - This study assessed the effectiveness of an intervention based on a theoretical framework of citizenship on reducing psychiatric symptoms, alcohol use, and drug use, and increasing quality of life for persons with serious mental illness (SMI) and criminal justice involvement. One-hundred fourteen adults with SMI and a history of criminal justice involvement participated in a 2 x 3 longitudinal randomized controlled trial of a four-month citizenship intervention versus usual services. Linear mixed model analyses were used to assess the intervention's impact on quality of life, symptoms, and substance use. After controlling for baseline covariates, participants in the experimental condition reported significantly increased quality of life, greater satisfaction with and amount of activity, higher satisfaction with work, and reduced alcohol and drug use over time. However, individuals in the experimental condition also reported increased anxiety/depression and agitation at 6 months (but not 12 months) and significantly increased negative symptoms at 12 months. Findings suggest that community-oriented, citizenship interventions for persons with SMI and criminal justice histories may facilitate improved clinical and community outcomes in some domains, but some negative clinical findings suggest the need for post-intervention support for intervention participants. Implications for practice and future research are discussed.

AB  - The goal of this effectiveness study was to investigate the role of pre-treatment interpersonal relationship functioning in two forms of group cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) for veterans with PTSD. Analysis of data from 45 veterans who completed either trauma- or skills-focused CBT indicated no overall differences between the two treatments in PTSD symptomatology, alcohol abuse, or violence perpetration at four months post-treatment. However, there was a stronger inverse relationship between intimate relationship functioning and violence outcomes in the trauma-focused group versus the skills-focused group. While no differences in violence outcomes were found between the treatments at poorer levels of pre-treatment intimate relationship functioning, those receiving trauma-focused treatment with better pre-treatment intimate relationships reported less violence. Extended relationship functioning and violence outcomes were less strongly associated in the trauma-focused group versus the skills-focused group. The theoretical implications of these results, as well as the clinical opportunities to improve CBT for PTSD by capitalizing on patients' relationships, are discussed. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Objective: The aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness of cognitive-behavior group therapy in a sample of patients with co-morbid depression and psychotic disorders. Method: Participants in this study were referred from either the psychiatric in- or outpatient clinic at the psychiatric university hospital in Trondheim. Self-report assessments of depressive symptoms, hopelessness, self-esteem, maladaptive schemas and personality traits/schemas, and an interview measuring depression, were administered at the start of therapy, after termination of therapy (eight weeks) and at six months follow-up. Psychosocial functioning was also assessed at pre-treatment and at six months follow-up. Seventeen subjects completed eight weeks of therapy. Results: The results showed that an eight week program of CBGT had a significant effect on depression in schizophrenic patients both at post-treatment and at six months follow-up, with no incidents of relapse. The psychosocial functioning measured by GAP also showed a significant increase from pre-treatment to six months follow-up for the participants. Conclusion: The present study suggests that cognitive-behavioral group therapy might be useful in treating co-morbid states of depression in patients with schizophrenic disorders.

AB  - Objective: This study assessed the effect of cognitive-behavioral therapy on a range of problems associated with complex trauma in a sample of women with comorbid substance use disorders and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).Methods: A total of 107 women with current or subthreshold PTSD and a current substance use disorder from an urban, low-income area were recruited from both community and clinical populations. Participants were recruited between 1997 and 2000. A quasi-experimental design was used, and participants who received cognitive-behavioral therapy (N=75) were compared with those in a control group who received no active study treatment (N=32). All participants were given the same list of community treatment resources and told that they could pursue services while participating in the study if they wished.Results: At the end of treatment (three months postbaseline), compared with participants in the control group, those in the active treatment group showed significant reductions in symptoms of PTSD and alcohol use disorders, with a trend toward reductions in symptoms of drug use disorders. No significant differences were found between the groups on depression, dissociation, and social and sexual functioning outcomes.Conclusions: These findings underscore the challenge and necessity of addressing the unique and wide-ranging needs of women with substance use disorder who have been exposed to early and multiple interpersonal traumas.

AB  - This study compares the effectiveness of a segregative and an integrative psychosocial recreational program for persons with psychiatric disabilities in Israel. Comparison of changes in 97 members of a segregated social club with those of 89 participants in an integrative program in their local community center shows that both reported significantly greater satisfaction with their social life, having more friends than previously, increased support from friends, less loneliness, greater social support, and engaging in more leisure activities. The only significant differences were that the participants in the segregative program reported making more new friends, while those in the integrative program reported a greater increase in the number of leisure activities in which they engaged. With this, the findings also show that the participants in the integrative program were generally stronger and in better clinical condition than those in the segregative program. These findings point to the need for different types of recreational programs to meet the needs of persons with different levels of disability.

AB  - Objective: This quality improvement program evaluation investigated the effectiveness of contingency management for improving retention in treatment and positive outcomes among patients with dual disorders in intensive outpatient treatment for addiction. Methods: The effect of contingency management was explored among a group of 160 patients exposed to contingency management (n = 88) and not exposed to contingency management (no contingency management, n = 72) in a six-week partial hospitalization program. Patients referred to the partial hospitalization program for treatment of substance use and comorbid psychiatric disorders received diagnoses from psychiatrists and specialist clinicians according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association. A unique application of the contingency management "fishbowl" method was used to improve the consistency of attendance at treatment sessions, which patients attended 5 days a week. Days attending treatment and drug-free days were the main outcome variables. Other outcomes of interest were depression, anxiety and psychological stress, coping ability, and intensity of drug cravings. Results: Patients in the contingency management group attended more treatment days compared to patients in the no contingency management group; M = 16.2 days (SD = 10.0) versus M = 9.9 days (SD = 8.5), respectively; t = 4.2, df = 158, p <.001. No difference was found between the treatment groups on number of drug-free days. Psychological stress and drug craving were inversely associated with drug-free days in bivariate testing (r = −.18, p <.02; r = −.31, p <.001, respectively). Treatment days attended and drug craving were associated with drug-free days in multivariate testing (B =.05, SE =.01, β =.39, t = 4.9, p <.001; B = −.47; SE =.12, β = −.30, t = −3.9, p <.001, respectively; Adj. R2 =.21). Days attending treatment partially mediated the relationship between exposure to contingency management and self-reported drug-free days. Conclusions: Contingency management is a valuable adjunct for increasing retention in treatment among patients with dual disorders in partial hospitalization treatment. Exposure to contingency management increases retention in treatment, which in turn contributes to increased drug-free days. Interventions for coping with psychological stress and drug cravings should be emphasized in intensive dual diagnosis group therapy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study examined the impact of a peer navigator program (PNP) developed by a community‐based participatory research team and used with a group of African Americans with serious mental illness who were homeless. METHODS: Sixty‐seven research participants were randomly assigned to receive PNP or treatment as usual (control) for one year. Data on general health and mental health, recovery, and quality of life were collected at baseline and at four, eight, and 12 months. RESULTS: Findings from group × trial analyses of variance of omnibus measures of the four constructs showed significant impact over the year for participants in PNP compared with those in the control group, with analyses showing small to moderate effect sizes: general health status (η2=.24), psychological experience of physical health (η2=.42), recovery (η2=.36), and quality of life (η2=.14). These differences emerged even though both groups showed significant reductions in homelessness and increases in insurance coverage. CONCLUSIONS: Implications for improving in‐the‐field health care for this population are discussed. Whether these results occurred because navigators were peers per se needs to be examined in future research.

AB  - Background: Continuing care following inpatient addiction treatment is an important component in the continuum of clinical services. Mutual help, including 12-step groups like Alcoholics Anonymous, is often recommended as a form of continuing care. However, the effectiveness of 12-step groups is difficult to establish using observational studies due to the risks of selection bias (or confounding). Objective(s): To address this limitation, we used both conventional and machine learning-based propensity score (PS) methods to examine the effectiveness of 12-step group involvement following inpatient treatment on substance use over a 12-month period. Method(s): Using data from the Recovery Journey Project - a longitudinal, observational study - we followed an inpatient sample over 12-months post-treatment to assess the effect of 12-step involvement on substance use at 12-months (n = 254). Specifically, PS models were constructed based on 34 unbalanced confounders and four PS-based methods were applied: matching, inverse probability weighting (IPW), doubly robust (DR) with matching, and DR with IPW. Result(s): Each PS-based method minimized the potential of confounding from unbalanced variables and demonstrated a significant effect (p < 0.001) between high 12-step involvement (i.e., defined as having a home group; having a sponsor; attending at least one meeting per week; and, being involved in service work) and a reduced likelihood of using substances over the 12-month period (odds ratios 0.11 to 0.32). Conclusion(s): PS-based methods effectively reduced potential confounding influences and provided robust evidence of a significant effect. Nonetheless, results should be considered in light of the relatively high attrition rate, potentially limiting their generalizability.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study investigated the association of personality disorder complexity to treatment outcome for depression following time-limited group-based cognitive-behavioral therapy. One hundred fifteen outpatients with a primary diagnosis of depression participated in the study. In this study, personality disorder complexity was determined by the degree of personality disorder comorbidity identified by the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-III (T. Millon, 1994). As predicted, analyses revealed that increasing personality disorder complexity was related to increasing baseline symptom severity and slightly poorer end-state functioning at posttreatment. However, results regarding clinically significant improvement and mean improvement in depression symptoms were less supportive of an association between personality disorder complexity and poorer treatment outcome. The implications of these findings for treatment planning are discussed. (C) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Controlled trials have established the efficacy of cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) for depression. However, the relative effectiveness of individual versus group treatment formats in real-world settings is less well established. The current study evaluated the effectiveness of group CBT (n=157) compared to individual CBT (n=77) for depressed outpatients in a naturalistic setting. Symptom improvements for depression, anxiety, and quality of life were compared between treatment formats in intent-to-treat and completer analyses. Effect sizes and rates of recovery were examined. Results showed that both individual and group CBT were effective, even in the presence of high levels of comorbidity. Whereas individual CBT was associated with larger effect sizes and significantly higher rates of recovery, group CBT compared favorably to outcomes established by past research. A broad-spectrum group CBT program may be a viable treatment option when depression symptoms are less severe and when this format of treatment delivery is desirable.

AB  - Background: Group Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) may provide a means of improving mental health among people with depression but few studies have explored its effectiveness. Our aim was to examine the feasibility and acceptability of a randomised controlled trial of a group intervention based on CBT principles for women with depression in primary care. Methods: Women aged 30 to 55 years were recruited and randomly assigned to either 12 weeks of the group intervention or usual care (control). The group intervention was based on a manual and used CBT and problem solving principles with weekly topics including raising activity levels, spotting and catching negative thoughts, problem solving and relaxation. Women were recruited from deprived areas of Bristol. The groups were run by facilitators with some experience and background in group work and one weeks training in use of the course manual. Assessments of mental health were made using measures including the PHQ-9. Follow-up was at 3 and 6 months after the intervention. Qualitative methods were used to support the design of the intervention and to help understand issues of acceptability and feasibility. Interviews were conducted with all participants at baseline and at 3 and 6 months although detailed qualitative analysis was based on a purposive sample of 20 participants at the 3 time points. Results: Of the 86 participants assessed for eligibility, 52 were allocated to the intervention arm and 21 to the control group. The intervention was delivered according to the manual despite the limited training of the facilitators. The intervention was received favourably by participants and facilitators, with good attendance at sessions for those who engaged with the intervention. Follow up rates at 3 and 6 months for women in both the intervention and control arms were also good. The trial methodology used was appropriate and feasible. Conclusions: This study showed that a randomised controlled trial of group CBT for women with depression is feasible and the intervention is acceptable, and may possibly prove to be effective in a larger trial. The cost effectiveness of group CBT for depression should be explored further in a full trial.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the clinical effectiveness of group art therapy for people with schizophrenia and to test whether any benefits exceed those of an active control treatment. Design: Three arm, rater blinded, pragmatic, randomised controlled trial. Setting: Secondary care services across 15 sites in the United Kingdom. Participants: 417 people aged 18 or over, who had a diagnosis of schizophrenia and provided written informed consent to take part in the study. Interventions: Participants, stratified by site, were randomised to 12 months of weekly group art therapy plus standard care, 12 months of weekly activity groups plus standard care, or standard care alone. Art therapy and activity groups had up to eight members and lasted for 90 minutes. In art therapy, members were given access to a range of art materials and encouraged to use these to express themselves freely. Members of activity groups were offered various activities that did not involve use of art or craft materials and were encouraged to collectively select those they wanted to pursue. Main outcome measures: The primary outcomes were global functioning, measured using the global assessment of functioning scale, and mental health symptoms, measured using the positive and negative syndrome scale, 24 months after randomisation. Main secondary outcomes were levels of group attendance, social functioning, and satisfaction with care at 12 and 24 months. Results: 417 participants were assigned to either art therapy (n=140), activity groups (n=140), or standard care alone (n=137). Primary outcomes between the three study arms did not differ. The adjusted mean difference between art therapy and standard care at 24 months on the global assessment of functioning scale was ‐0.9 (95% confidence interval ‐3.8 to 2.1), and on the positive and negative syndrome scale was 0.7 (‐3.1 to 4.6). Secondary outcomes did not differ between those referred to art therapy or those referred to standard care at 12 or 24 months. Conclusions: Referring people with established schizophrenia to group art therapy as delivered in this trial did not improve global functioning, mental health, or other health related outcomes.

AB  - Describes the main aims of the National Institute on Drug Abuse Collaborative Cocaine Treatment Study, a multisite psychotherapy clinical trial for outpatients who meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV) criteria for cocaine dependence. The outcomes of 4 manual-guided treatments for 480 randomized patients (aged 18–60 yrs) are compared for an 18-mo period. All treatments include group drug counseling (GDC). One treatment also adds cognitive therapy, one adds supportive-expressive psychodynamic therapy, and one adds individual drug counseling; one consists of group drug counseling alone. In addition, 2 hypotheses are tested: (1) patients with higher levels of psychiatric severity will show a better response to psychotherapies (e.g., cognitive therapy plus GDC) compared with drug counseling treatments (e.g., GDC alone), and (2) patients with more antisocial personality traits will have a better response to cognitive therapy plus GDC compared with psychodynamic therapy plus GDC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This was a multicenter investigation examining the efficacy of 4 psychosocial treatments for cocaine-dependent patients., METHODS: Four hundred eighty-seven patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 manual-guided treatments: individual drug counseling plus group drug counseling (GDC), cognitive therapy plus GDC, supportive-expressive therapy plus GDC, or GDC alone. Treatment was intensive, including 36 possible individual sessions and 24 group sessions for 6 months. Patients were assessed monthly during active treatment and at 9 and 12 months after baseline. Primary outcome measures were the Addiction Severity Index-Drug Use Composite score and the number of days of cocaine use in the past month., RESULTS: Compared with the 2 psychotherapies and with GDC alone, individual drug counseling plus GDC showed the greatest improvement on the Addiction Severity Index-Drug Use Composite score. Individual group counseling plus GDC was also superior to the 2 psychotherapies on the number of days of cocaine use in the past month. Hypotheses regarding the superiority of psychotherapy to GDC for patients with greater psychiatric severity and the superiority of cognitive therapy plus GDC compared with supportive-expressive therapy plus GDC for patients with antisocial personality traits or external coping style were not confirmed., CONCLUSION: Compared with professional psychotherapy, a manual-guided combination of intensive individual drug counseling and GDC has promise for the treatment of cocaine dependence.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine whether patient education programs were effective at improving knowledge of substance abuse among dual-diagnosis patients. Adult patients at a general psychiatry hospital were identified for a history of substance abuse. Of the 51 patients included in the study, 25 were on forensic units, 7 were in a private ward, and 19 were on the public unit. Patients were given a pretest at the beginning of the study and received an identical posttest prior to discharge or at the end of the study. The patients on the public unit received up to 16 h per week of Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, alcohol/drug education meetings, group therapy, and other forms of intervention. These patients demonstrated statistically significant improvements between pretest and posttest scores, while those on the forensic units who received only 2 h of intervention per week did not show improvements in substance abuse knowledge. These and other findings have been used to improve education programs for our dual-diagnosis patients across the institute.

AB  - Maladaptive schemas are stable cognitive working models of the world, learnt early in life, that interfere with effective functioning and underlie chronic mental illness. A major challenge for cognitive therapy has been how to modify schemas when they are so enduring and stable. We propose that because maladaptive schemas are formed through social experiences (typically abusive or neglectful ones), they might best be corrected through positive social experiences that directly challenge the schema. Design: Two longitudinal studies were conducted, one with patients undergoing group cognitive-behavioural therapy (N = 92) and one with homeless individuals residing in temporary accommodation (N = 76). Method: In each study, social isolation schema was measured at Time 1 and again at Time 2 following a group-based social experience (group psychotherapy or temporary residence at a community organization). A positive experience of group life was operationalized as social identification with the therapy group in Study 1 or the community organization in Study 2. Results: In both studies, social identification led to a significant reduction in social isolation schema. Study 2 indicated that these effects were fully mediated by the formation of ties to new social groups, such that social identification scaffolded the development of new group memberships, which in turn decreased the endorsement of maladaptive schema. Conclusions: Social identification facilitates the correction of socially situated schema such as social isolation. Reprinted by permission of the British Psychological Society

AB  - We propose a controlled study of Critical Time Intervention (CTI) for men and women with severe mental illness (SMI) during the transition from psychiatric hospital to community care. The primary objective of CTI is to reduce adverse outcomes during this transition and thereby improve community integration for mentally ill persons. Homelessness is the primary adverse outcome we hope to diminish. Other adverse outcomes include: suicidal ideation and behavior; violence toward others; and psychiatric re-hospitalization. CTI is a time-limited intervention designed specifically to enhance the continuity and focus of care during such transitions. It does not replace community treatment and supports, but instead is meant to complement available services. CTI has previously been demonstrated to be effective with severely mentally ill men following discharge from psychiatric care in a shelter institution to community care. It consists of in vivo training in community living skills and team-managed transfer of caregiving to services and supports in the community. A key aspect of CTI is that the post-discharge phase of the intervention is delivered by staff who have established relationships with patients during their institutional stay. Effective outreach and support are greatly enhanced by staff knowledge of the population and the strength of the individual relationships that have been previously developed. A sample of 250 individuals (175 men and 75 women) will be enrolled into the study during their hospital stay. Subjects will receive a thorough baseline assessment, including research diagnoses of major mental disorders. After this assessment, subjects will be randomized into control (n=125) and experimental (n=125) treatment groups. Following hospital discharge, the control group will receive usual aftercare and community care services; aftercare services from this hospital are considered among the best in the region. Those in the experimental group will receive these services as well as nine months of CTI. Both groups will be followed for eighteen months.

AB  - Objective: Low attendance in psychotherapy, particularly among individuals with comorbid disorders, is a pervasive challenge. The present study examined predictors of treatment attendance in a sample of veterans with depression, substance use disorder, and trauma. Methods: This is an analysis of data collected as part of a larger clinical trial involving outpatients at a Veterans Administration dual diagnosis clinic. Individuals were excluded if they had significant memory deficits, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or substantial travel constraints. Participants (N = 146) received 12weeks of group-delivered integrated cognitive behavioral therapy for depression and substance use, followed by randomization to 12 additional weeks of individually delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (n = 62) or cognitive processing therapy (n = 61) modified to address substance use and trauma. Participants, therapists, and researchers were not blinded to group assignment. For this study, we included only the 123 participants who were randomized into the second phase, analyzing predictors of treatment attendance categorized into predisposing factors, enabling factors, and need factors. Results: Participants were primarily male (89%) and Caucasian (76%) and averaged 47years old (SD = 12). Forty-four percent had alcohol use disorder, 16% had drug use disorder, and 40% had polysubstance use disorder. Most met criteria for PTSD (82%), with 44% having combat-related trauma, 33% sexual trauma, and 28% other trauma. Treatment attendance did not differ between groups. More education was associated with increased group (r = .19, p = .04) and individual session attendance (r = .28, p = .002). Individuals with chronic housing problems attended fewer group sessions (r = -.19, p = .04), while individuals with sexual trauma, compared to those with other traumas, attended more individual sessions (r = .23, p = .01). Number of group sessions attended was positively associated with individual session attendance. Conclusions: Few variables were significantly predictive of treatment attendance, possibly due to the complex nature of comorbid disorders. Including a focus on trauma was not associated with lower attendance. Special consideration may need to be given to education level, homelessness, and trauma when trying to engage and retain patients with comorbid disorders in treatment.

AB  - Background: Depression impacts the lives of millions of people worldwide. Behavioral activation (BA), derived from cognitive behavioral therapy, has the potential for improving depressive symptoms in patients with depression. Studies evaluating the effectiveness of BA specifically in the context of group therapy programs in a hospital setting for patients with depression are limited. In this study, we report findings from a pilot trial evaluating group BA for major depressive disorder. Objective(s): The objectives of this pilot trial are to assess the potential of a full trial of BA group therapy in a large-scale tertiary care setting and to provide preliminary information about possible results regarding mood symptoms and quality of life in adults with depression. Method(s): Using a parallel single-cohort pragmatic pilot randomized controlled trial design, we evaluated the potential of conducting a large trial of BA effectiveness among adults with depression. Participants were randomized to the intervention (BA in addition to usual care) or control (support group in addition to usual care) groups and were assessed weekly for 18 consecutive weeks. Participants randomized to intervention underwent 28 2-h group BA therapy visits administered by trained therapists and completed assessments to examine treatment outcomes. Feasibility was measured in terms of enrollment rates (min. 20%), completion rates of study (min. 80%), and completion rates of weekly measurement scales (min. 80%). The reporting of this pilot trial is in accordance with the CONSORT extension for randomized pilot and feasibility trials. Result(s): We randomized 20 individuals of mean age of 48.8 years (standard deviation = 9.7) with a DSM-5 diagnosis of major depressive disorder to intervention (n = 10) or control (n = 10) groups. Based on our feasibility criteria, our recruitment rate was excellent (20/27; 74%), study completion was found to be a moderate (80% of the total participants in both arms completed the study; BA = 100%, control = 60%), and completeness of measurements on a weekly basis was adequate overall (82%; BA = 86%, control = 79%). Conclusion(s): The study has demonstrated the potential feasibility to perform a larger scale trial upon modifications to the control group to avoid the low rate of study completion (60%) in this group.

AB  - The facilitation of relationships between group members who are engaged with one another should create models of social interactions. It appears then that a process-focused approach to social skills training would enhance the effectiveness of current cognitive-behavioral social skills training models inasmuch as the therapeutic group itself provides individuals with an opportunity to apply the skills learned in training with numerous social situations. This orientation to social skills training may provide an environment in which group members are more likely to enhance social competence as a function and outcome of group therapeutic process factors (such as altruism, affiliation, and universality). A preliminary study of the relative effectiveness of a traditional cognitive-behavioral approach to social skills training (SST) as compared to a combined cognitive-behavioral and process-oriented training format known as interactive behavioral training (IBT) was undertaken at a Community Residential Program for people with mental illness. Pre- and post-test mean scores on clinical rating scales do not allow any firm conclusions to be drawn regarding the treatment effects of IBT compared to standard SST. However, positive results on measures of psychiatric symptoms and social functioning, as well as clinical observations, provide encouragement for further examination of this promising model.

AB  - Background: Overweight and obesity are epidemic among persons with serious mental illness, yet weight-loss trials systematically exclude this vulnerable population. Lifestyle interventions require adaptation in this group because psychiatric symptoms and cognitive impairment are highly prevalent. Our objective was to determine the effectiveness of an 18-month tailored behavioral weight-loss intervention in adults with serious mental illness.Methods: We recruited overweight or obese adults from 10 community psychiatric rehabilitation outpatient programs and randomly assigned them to an intervention or a control group. Participants in the intervention group received tailored group and individual weight-management sessions and group exercise sessions. Weight change was assessed at 6, 12, and 18 months.Results: Of 291 participants who underwent randomization, 58.1% had schizophrenia or a schizoaffective disorder, 22.0% had bipolar disorder, and 12.0% had major depression. At baseline, the mean body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 36.3, and the mean weight was 102.7 kg (225.9 lb). Data on weight at 18 months were obtained from 279 participants. Weight loss in the intervention group increased progressively over the 18-month study period and differed significantly from the control group at each follow-up visit. At 18 months, the mean between-group difference in weight (change in intervention group minus change in control group) was -3.2 kg (-7.0 lb, P=0.002); 37.8% of the participants in the intervention group lost 5% or more of their initial weight, as compared with 22.7% of those in the control group (P=0.009). There were no significant between-group differences in adverse events.Conclusions: A behavioral weight-loss intervention significantly reduced weight over a period of 18 months in overweight and obese adults with serious mental illness. Given the epidemic of obesity and weight-related disease among persons with serious mental illness, our findings support implementation of targeted behavioral weight-loss interventions in this high-risk population.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the effect of client feedback in group psychotherapy on attendance and treatment outcome for patients with eating disorders. Method: We conducted a randomized clinical trial with central randomization stratified for diagnosis and treatment type according to a computer-generated allocation sequence concealed to the investigators. One-hundred and 59 adult participants, diagnosed with bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, or eating disorder not otherwise specified according to DSM-IV, were included. Eighty participants were allocated to the experimental group, and 79 participants to the control group. Both groups received 20-25 weekly group psychotherapy sessions. In the experimental group, participants gave and received feedback about therapy progress and alliance, measured before and after each session using the Outcome Rating Scale and the Group Session Rating Scale. The primary outcome was rate of attendance to treatment sessions; the secondary outcome was severity of eating disorder symptoms measured with the Eating Disorder Examination interview. Exploratory outcomes were psychological distress measured with the Symptom Checklist-90-R and the Outcome Rating Scale, social functioning measured with the Sheehan Disability Scale, and episodes of self-harm and suicide measured with a modified version of the Self-Harm Inventory. Results: Feedback compared with control did not affect the rate of attendance (0.59 vs. 0.58; p = .96), the severity of symptoms (2.03 vs. 2.02; p = .46), or any of the exploratory outcomes (p values from 0.06 to 0.67). Conclusions: Feedback neither increased attendance nor improved outcomes for outpatients in group psychotherapy for eating disorders. The results are discussed from different perspectives.

AB  - Question: How effective is the STEPPS programme for people with a borderline personality disorder?Patients: 165 people with DSM-IV borderline personality disorder (>=18 years; 83% female). Main exclusions: psychotic or primary neurological disorder; cognitive impairment; substance abuse or dependence; recent suicidal thoughts or self-harm behaviour.Setting: Outpatient setting, Iowa, USA; recruitment 2002-2006. Intervention: Systems Training for Emotional Predictability and Problem Solving (STEPPS) plus usual care or usual care alone (including medication, individual psychotherapy and case management). STEPPS is a manual-based group treatment programme involving psychoeducation, and emotion and behaviour management skills training, delivered in once weekly 2-hour sessions over 20 weeks, which includes education for a friend or relative. Outcomes: Primary outcome: symptoms (Zanarini Rating Scale for Borderline Personality Disorder Affective (ZRS-BPD), a scale which assesses cognitive disturbance, disturbed relationships, and impulsivity). Secondary outcomes: thoughts, feelings and behaviour (Borderline Evaluation of Severity Over Time scale (BESOT)); positive and negative disposition (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)); Beck Depression Inventory (BDI); Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL90R); Social Adjustment Scale (SAS); Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS); use of medication or other therapies; physician or crisis contact; suicide or self-harm. Outcomes were assessed every 4 weeks during treatment, and every 3 months post-intervention.Patient follow-up:58.2% at 20 weeks, 75.2% included in post-treatment 20 week intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis; 49.7% assessed at least once during 1 year follow-up.METHODSDesign: Randomised controlled trial.Allocation: Unconcealed.Blinding: Unclear.Follow-up period: One year (post-intervention).MAIN RESULTSThe STEPPS intervention plus usual care improved total symptoms at the end of 20 weeks' treatment compared to usual care alone (mean decrease in ZRS-BPD score from baseline: 9.1 with STEPPS vs 3.9 with control; p = 0.001). For secondary outcomes at 20 weeks, the STEPPS group showed significantly greater improvement than controls on global functioning and depression measures (CGI-S and CGI-I, GAS, BDI, SCL90R Global Severity Index), impulsiveness (BIS), negative affect (PANAS), and thoughts and feelings (BESOT). The primary outcome (ZRS-BPD) was not reported over post-intervention follow-up; there were no significant differences between treatment groups in changes in any of the secondary outcome scales from the end of treatment to one year follow-up. Emergency department visits were significantly less frequent with STEPPS compared to control (visits in an average of: 0.97 months per year with STEPPS vs 1.53 months per year with control, p = 0.04).CONCLUSIONSSTEPPS plus treatment as usual for people with borderline personality disorder, can improve symptoms, behaviour and global functioning across a range of scales. Outcomes remain relatively stable after 1 year.

AB  - Background: Cognitive behaviour therapy with mindfulness (CBTm) classes are a group-based, psychoeducational, clinical service. Early research has suggested they are a promising low-intensity intervention for reducing psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety and depression (Palay in, Eur J Person Centered Healthcare 62:274, 2018; Thakur in BMC Psychiatry 19:132, 2019). Rural community members may benefit from these classes given the barriers they face in terms of available, accessible, and acceptable psychological treatment (Smalley in J Clin Psychol 66:479-385, 2010). Group-based telepsychology is one potential avenue for increasing access to psychological services in remote rural communities. Methods: This investigation evaluated the effectiveness of four-session weekly group CBTm classes taking place in rural Canada from November 2015 to December 2017, the impact of attendance via telepsychology (group-based videoconferencing at remote health centres closer to their homes) compared to in-person, and factors associated with class dropout. 376 CBTm class participants completed questionnaires during each class, providing a measure of their symptoms over time. Results: Anxious, depressive, and general psychiatric symptoms were reduced over the course of CBTm classes. Telepsychology attendance did not diminish class effectiveness. Predictors of class dropout were difficult to identify, except higher baseline anxiety, which predicted lower dropout rates. Conclusions: Group-based CBTm classes, whether delivered in person or via telepsychology, appear to be an effective avenue for improving mental well-being and service access among rural community members. Although encouraging, results also suggested a need for research on predictors of and reducing antecedents to class dropout in this population.

AB  - Objective: Economic evaluations of interventions for dual diagnosis patients are scarce. A recent randomized controlled trial has supported the effectiveness of the Self-wise, Otherwise, Streetwise (SOS) training to reduce victimization in dual diagnosis patients. The purpose of the current study was to analyze the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of the SOS training as an add-on to care as usual (CAU). Method(s): We performed an economic evaluation from a societal perspective alongside the SOS trial. Participants were 250 dual diagnosis patients recruited at three locations from a large urban psychiatric service in the Netherlands. The main outcomes were treatment response for victimization and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Both costs and effects were measured across a 14-month follow-up. Result(s): There was no significant difference between CAU + SOS and CAU in total costs (mean difference 4,859; 95% CI [-4,795 to 14,513]) and QALY gains (mean difference 0.0012; 95% CI [-0.05 to 0.05]). Significantly more participants in CAU + SOS achieved treatment response for victimization compared to CAU (68% vs. 54%; mean difference 0.14; 95% CI [0.02 to 0.26]). The cost-effectiveness analysis indicated an 83% likelihood that CAU + SOS resulted in a higher treatment response rate for victimization at higher costs compared to CAU. The cost-utility analysis indicated that adding SOS-training to CAU is probably not cost-effective at conventional willingness-to-pay levels for QALYs. Conclusion(s): At a societal willingness-to-pay of 38,000 or more per extra treatment responder, adding SOS-training to usual care is probably more attractive than usual care alone with regard to cost-effectiveness. This is a considerable willingness to pay. However, the direct costs of offering the SOS training are expected to be minor. Our findings should be interpreted with caution due to the short follow-up period and absence of data on potential reductions in police and judicial costs other than prison costs.Copyright © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Objective: The study examined patterns of mental health service use among 112 formerly homeless mentally ill adults to determine whether clients in a staffed group living situation would need fewer types of services or lesser amounts of some services than those living independently in single apartments, Methods: Clients in the Boston McKinney demonstration project were randomly assigned to two housing types: individual apartments or a group living situation designed to teach residents to manage the house and their own affairs with minimal staff presence. The types and amounts of services these clients used during an 18-month period were documented and compared. Results: Service use by all clients was heavy, especially use of inpatient psychiatric services, It did not differ by housing type. The large majority of clients in both housing types were able to remain housed and avoid homelessness. Clients who did not stay in assigned housing for the duration of the study had higher levels of inpatient service use, including detoxification and substance abuse treatment. Conclusions: When homeless mentally ill adults are provided permanent housing and accessible mental health treatment and specialized social services, they are likely to avoid unstable housing patterns, which are associated with higher use of inpatient services.

AB  - Objective: A randomized experiment tested the effectiveness of adding a psychoeducationally oriented group therapy intervention, Good Chemistry Groups, to standard inpatient chemical dependency services for clients dually diagnosed with mental and substance dependence disorders. Method: Ninety-seven clients were randomly assigned to an experimental group (n = 48) and a control group (n =49). Outcome variables included drug and alcohol use, participation in self-help support group meetings, incarceration days, psychiatric symptoms, psychiatric inpatient admissions, compliance with prescribed psychotropic medication plans, and composite scores on the Addiction Severity Index. Results: No significant treatment effects were found on any of the outcome variables. The findings were generally consistent with those of prior controlled studies. Conclusion: Good Chemistry Groups did not add to the effects of standard treatments for dually diagnosed clients. Practitioners should continue to develop and evaluate alternative integrated treatment approaches that might prove to be more effective than this one.

AB  - Objectives: Use of patient‐centered approaches that utilize principles of shared decision making have been shown to improve the quality of health care decisions and outcomes. Despite demonstrated effectiveness, family involvement in the mental health care of individuals with serious mental illness (SMI) has been minimal. A mismatch in consumer and family preferences for involvement and clinical offering may drive this gap. We tested an innovative, preference‐driven manualized program to increase recovery of individuals with SMI and to engage and their families in care. Methods: A total of 232 Veterans with a psychotic disorder were randomly assigned to the patient centered approach, Family Member Provider Outreach (FMPO), or to enhanced treatment as usual at 2 VA medical centers. Participants completed baseline and 6‐month follow up interviews. FMPO consisted of up to 3 sessions with the Veteran and then up to 3 sessions with the family. Results: Patients were 51.6 years old (SD=9.1) and had 13 years of education (SD=2). The majority were male (84%), and 45% lived with family members. 70% of Veteran wanted their family to be able to contact the treatment team, 61% wanted their family to receive educational materials, 54% wanted their family to attend an educational or support group, and 50% wanted their family to attend a conjoint treatment session. 85% (92/108) of Veterans participated in at least one FMPO session (mean session number 1.80 (SD=.36); mode 2). Of the Veterans who had a session 54/92 (59%) had at least one family FMPO session (mean session number 2.24 (SD=.12); mode 3). Between groups comparisons revealed that individuals in FMPO had an improved measure of recovery (p<.05) and reduced paranoid ideation (p<.01). Conclusions: The study findings suggest that the majority of consumers want their family involved, but demonstrate a wide range of preferences. Engagement with the Veteran, using a shared decision making process and motivational interviewing, produced family engagement in FMPO. Further, this approach was able to improve an indicator of recovery and reduce symptoms. The study contributes to an emerging body of research suggesting that patient centered approaches can improve quality and outcomes of care.

AB  - Objective: To determine whether the addition of cognitive behaviour therapy and motivational interviewing (CBT/MI) to standard alcohol and other drug (AOD) care improves outcomes for young people with comorbid depression and substance misuse.Participants and Setting: Participants were young people with comorbid depression (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale score ≥ 17) and substance misuse (mainly alcohol and/or cannabis) seeking treatment at two youth AOD services in Melbourne, Australia. The study was conducted between September 2006 and September 2008. Sixty young people received CBT/MI in addition to standard care (SC) (the SC+CBT/MI group) and 28 received SC only (the SC group).Main Outcome Measures: Depressive symptoms and AOD use in the previous 30 days, measured at baseline and at 3-month and 6-month follow-up.Results: Compared with participants in the SC group, those in the SC+CBT/MI group showed significant reductions in depression and cannabis use and increased social contact and motivation to change substance use at 3-month follow-up. However, at 6-month follow-up, the SC group had achieved similar improvements to the CBT/MI group on these variables. All young people achieved significant improvements in functioning and quality of life variables over time, regardless of treatment group. No changes in AOD use were found in either group at 6-month follow-up.Conclusion: The delivery of CBT/MI in addition to SC may achieve accelerated treatment gains in the short term.

AB  - Objectives: Adverse life events are associated with increased likelihood of depression and poorer prognosis. Trauma‐focused treatments (TFT) appear to be effective in decreasing comorbid depressive symptoms. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a TFT on the memories of aversive events for individuals with a primary diagnosis of depression. Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 49 participants recruited from a 10‐day outpatient group programme. All participants showed symptoms of depression with a subgroup (80%) meeting the DSM‐5 criteria for a major depressive episode. Participants received treatment as usual (TAU); three additional individual trauma‐focused sessions; or three additional individual assertiveness training sessions. Participants were assessed with regards to depression diagnosis and related symptoms. Results: For participants with a major depressive episode, the addition of trauma‐focused sessions significantly increased the likelihood of remission when compared to TAU, or additional assertiveness training. While no significant treatment difference was noted in depressive symptom change post‐treatment, six weeks after treatment those who received an adjunct treatment were more likely to maintain treatment gains than those who received TAU. Furthermore, at 12‐week follow‐up, participants who received a TFT reported significantly fewer depressive symptoms than those who received assertiveness training. Conclusions: While differences in outcomes were minimal immediately post‐treatment, differences among treatment groups increased over time. Thus, as few as three additional TFT sessions may impact positively on symptom change for people completing a group programme for the treatment of depression. Practitioner points: Depression is the greatest cause of disability worldwide.Adverse experiences are linked with an increased likelihood of depression, more severe symptoms and poor treatment outcomes following evidence‐based interventions.As few as three trauma‐focused sessions can improve treatment outcomes in terms of depression diagnosis and related symptoms for individuals receiving group cognitive behavioural therapy.

AB  - Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol use disorder are frequently comorbid and present significant treatment challenges. Unfortunately, since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States, the rates of PTSD and hazardous drinking among active duty service members have increased significantly. Previous research on PTSD has typically excluded participants with current substance abuse. However, there is some research examining independent treatments for PTSD and substance abuse provided consecutively, concurrently, or as enhancements to other treatment. The current study examined the association between current hazardous drinking and PTSD treatment among 108 active duty service members with PTSD in a randomized controlled trial of group cognitive processing therapy and group present-centered therapy. Total scores above 8 on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test defined hazardous alcohol use. At baseline, 25.0% of the sample was categorized as hazardous drinkers, and the hazardous and nonhazardous drinking groups did not differ in PTSD symptom severity, F(1, 106) = 0.08, p = .777, d = 0.06. Over the course of treatment, the two groups also did not differ significantly in PTSD symptom severity change on the PTSD Checklist, F(1, 106) = 1.20, p = .280, d = 0.33. Treatment for PTSD did not exacerbate hazardous drinking, and the hazardous drinking group showed significant reductions in drinking following PTSD treatment. Limitations and implications for treatment considerations are discussed. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Resumen: Spanish Abstracts by Asociación Chilena de Estrés Traumático (ACET) Examen de los efectos del tratamiento en el consumo problemático de alcohol entre miembros en servicio con trastorno de estrés postraumático CONSUMO PROBLEMÁTICO DE ALCOHOL DURANTE EL TRATAMIENTO DE TEPT El Trastorno de Estrés Postraumático (TEPT) y trastorno por uso de Alcohol son frecuentemente comórbidos y presentan desafíos significativos para el tratamiento. Desafortunadamente, desde el ataque terrorista del 11 de Septiembre del 2001 en los Estados Unidos, las tasas de TEPT y consumo problemático de alcohol han aumentado significativamente entre los miembros en servicio activo. Las investigaciones previas en TEPT clásicamente han excluido a los participantes con abuso de sustancias actual. Sin embargo, existen algunas investigaciones que examinan los tratamientos en forma independiente para TEPT y abuso de sustancias de forma consecutiva, concurrente o como potenciador de los tratamientos. Este estudio examinó la asociación entre consumo problemático de alcohol actual y tratamiento para TEPT entre 108 miembros en servicio activo con TEPT en un estudio aleatorizado controlado de terapia de procesamiento cognitivo grupal y terapia grupal centrada en el presente. Un puntaje total sobre 8 en el Test de Identificación de Trastornos por Uso de Alcohol definió el uso problemático de alcohol. A nivel basal, 25% de la muestra fue categorizada como bebedores problemáticos y los grupos de bebedores problemáticos y no problemáticos no difirieron en la severidad de los síntomas de TEPT, F(1, 106) = 0.08, p =.777.En el curso del tratamiento, los dos grupos tampoco difirieron significativamente en el cambio en la severidad de los síntomas de TEPT según la Lista de Chequeo para TEPT, F(1, 106) = 1.20, p =.280. El tratamiento para TEPT no aumentó el consumo problemático y el grupo del consumo problemático mostró reducciones significativas en el consumo de alcohol después del tratamiento del TEPT. Se discuten las limitaciones e implicancias para las consideraciones del tratamiento.

AB  - This paper describes the development of a comprehensive treatment program for combat veterans diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance abuse (SA). Outcome data are presented on 46 male patients who completed treatment between 1996 and 1998. The treatment approach, defined by a detailed manual, integrates elements of cognitive–behavioral skills training, constructivist theory approaches, SA relapse prevention strategies, and peer social support into a group-focused program. The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and the Addiction Severity Index (ASI) were used to assess treatment effectiveness at discharge and 6- and 12-month follow-up. Significant symptom changes revealed on CAPS and ASI scores at discharge and follow-up are analyzed. Discussion focuses on hypotheses regarding treatment effectiveness, study limitations, and suggestions for further research.

AB  - OBJECTIVE People with psychiatric impairments (primarily schizophrenia or a mood disorder) are the largest and fastest-growing group of Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) beneficiaries. The authors investigated whether evidence-based supported employment and mental health treatments can improve vocational and mental health recovery for this population. METHOD Using a randomized controlled trial design, the authors tested a multifaceted intervention: team-based supported employment, systematic medication management, and other behavioral health services, along with elimination of barriers by providing complete health insurance coverage (with no out-of-pocket expenses) and suspending disability reviews. The control group received usual services. Paid employment was the primary outcome measure, and overall mental health and quality of life were secondary outcome measures. RESULTS Overall, 2,059 SSDI beneficiaries with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or depression in 23 cities participated in the 2-year intervention. The teams implemented the intervention package with acceptable fidelity. The intervention group experienced more paid employment (60.3% compared with 40.2%) and reported better mental health and quality of life than the control group. CONCLUSIONS Implementation of the complex intervention in routine mental health treatment settings was feasible, and the intervention was effective in assisting individuals disabled by schizophrenia or depression to return to work and improve their mental health and quality of life.

AB  - Interventions for alcohol- and substance-dependent adults with comorbid depressive disorders are needed, but few have been empirically tested. In a randomized clinical trial of two psychotherapy interventions for these disorders, we examined whether initial focus of treatment was related to retention, substance use, and depression outcomes. Both interventions, integrated cognitive-behavioral therapy (ICBT; n = 105) and twelve-step facilitation (n = 92), were delivered in group formats with entry points every 4 weeks at the beginning of three content-distinct modules. Entry module (i.e., initial treatment focus) was not related to percentage days abstinent, proportion of the sample abstinent, or depression symptoms for either intervention. This was true at both 12 and 24 weeks postbaseline. Furthermore, attendance was similar for both treatments, regardless of initial treatment focus, with a single exception in the ICBT condition. Our findings support the use of modular formats with multiple or rotating entry points for psychotherapy group interventions.

AB  - Objectives: Persons with serious mental illnesses (SMI) have elevated rates of comorbid medical conditions, but may also face challenges in effectively managing those conditions.Methods: The study team developed and pilot-tested the Health and Recovery Program (HARP), an adaptation of the Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (CDSMP) for mental health consumers. A manualized, six-session intervention, delivered by mental health peer leaders, helps participants become more effective managers of their chronic illnesses. A pilot trial randomized 80 consumers with one or more chronic medical illness to either the HARP program or usual care.Results: At six month follow-up, participants in the HARP program had a significantly greater improvement in patient activation than those in usual care (7.7% relative improvement vs. 5.7% decline, p=0.03 for group *time interaction), and in rates of having one or more primary care visit (68.4% vs. 51.9% with one or more visit, p=0.046 for group *time interaction). Intervention advantages were observed for physical health related quality of life (HRQOL), physical activity, medication adherence, and, and though not statistically significant, had similar effect sizes as those seen for the CDSMP in general medical populations. Improvements in HRQOL were largest among medically and socially vulnerable subpopulations.Conclusions: This peer-led, medical self-management program was feasible and showed promise for improving a range of health outcomes among mental health consumers with chronic medical comorbidities. The HARP intervention may provide a vehicle for the mental health peer workforce to actively engage in efforts to reduce morbidity and mortality among mental health consumers.

AB  - Objective: Individuals with serious mental illnesses have high rates of general medical comorbidity and challenges in managing these conditions. A growing workforce of certified peer specialists is available to help these individuals more effectively manage their health and health care. However, few studies have examined the effectiveness of peer-led programs for self-management of general medical conditions for this population.Methods: This randomized study enrolled 400 participants with a serious mental illness and one or more chronic general medical conditions across three community mental health clinics. Participants were randomly assigned to the Health and Recovery Peer (HARP) program, a self-management program for general medical conditions led by certified peer specialists (N=198), or to usual care (N=202). Assessments were conducted at baseline and three and six months.Results: At six months, participants in the intervention group demonstrated a significant differential improvement in the primary study outcome, health-related quality of life. Specifically, compared with the usual care group, intervention participants had greater improvement in the Short-Form Health Survey physical component summary (an increase of 2.7 versus 1.4 points, p=.046) and mental component summary (4.6 versus 2.5 points, p=.039). Significantly greater six-month improvements in mental health recovery were seen for the intervention group (p=.02), but no other between-group differences in secondary outcome measures were significant.Conclusions: The HARP program was associated with improved physical health- and mental health-related quality of life among individuals with serious mental illness and comorbid general medical conditions, suggesting the potential benefits of more widespread dissemination of peer-led disease self-management in this population.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objective To evaluate the effectiveness of cognitive therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder related to terrorism and other civil conflict in Northern Ireland. Design Randomised controlled trial. Setting Community treatment centre, Northern Ireland. Participants 58 consecutive patients with chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (median 5.2 years, range 3 months to 32 years) mostly resulting from multiple traumas linked to terrorism and other civil conflict. Interventions Immediate cognitive therapy compared with a waiting list control condition for 12 weeks followed by treatment. Treatment comprised a mean of 5.9 sessions during 12 weeks and 2.0 sessions thereafter. Main outcome measures Primary outcome measures were patients' scores for post-traumatic stress disorder (post-traumatic stress diagnostic scale) and depression (Beck depression inventory). The secondary outcome measure was scores for occupational and social functioning (work related disability, social disability, and home life) on the Sheehan disability scale. Results At 12 weeks after randomisation, immediate cognitive therapy was associated with significantly greater improvement than the waiting list control group in the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (mean difference 9.6, 95% confidence interval 3.6 to 15.6), depression (mean difference 10.1, 4.8 to 15.3), and self reported occupational and social functioning (mean difference 1.3,0.3 to 2.5). Effect sizes from before to after treatment were large: post-traumatic stress disorder 1.25, depression 1.05, and occupational and social functioning 1.17. No change was observed in the control group. Conclusion Cognitive therapy is an effective treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder related to terrorism and other civil conflict. Trial registration Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN16228473.

AB  - The authors randomized 101 male veterans with chronic combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depressive disorder to an evidence-based depression treatment (self-management therapy; n = 51) or active-control therapy (n = 50). Main outcome measures for efficacy, using intention-to-treat analyses, were subjective and objective PTSD and depression scales at pretest, posttest, and 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up. Other measures included treatment compliance, satisfaction, treatment-targeted constructs, functioning, service utilization, and costs. Self-management therapy's modestly greater improvement on depression symptoms at treatment completion disappeared on follow-up. No other differences on symptoms or functioning appeared, although psychiatric outpatient utilization and overall outpatient costs were lower with self-management therapy. Despite success in other depressed populations, self-management therapy produced no clinically significant effect in depression with chronic PTSD.

AB  - QUESTIONQuestion: What is the effect of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and family intervention on relapse rates and symptoms in people with recently relapsed non-affective psychosis?Patients: 301 people aged 18-65 years (218 without carers, 83 with carers) with non-affective psychosis (lCD-I0 category F2 and DSM-IV) and a second or subsequent psychotic episode not more than 3 months before the trial began, plus a rating of at least 4 for one or more positive symptoms on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Exclusion criteria: primary diagnosis of alcohol or substance dependency; intellectual disability or organic syndrome; unreliable residential arrangements; or limited spoken English.Setting: Five local mental health services, UK; recruitment 2002-2004 .Intervention: People with carers randomly allocated to: CBT for psychosis (12-20 sessions over 9 months, targeting key aspects of relapse prevention) plus treatment as usual (TAU), family intervention plus TAU or TAU only. People without carers randomly allocated to: the same CBT regimen plus TAU or TAU only. Ouality of and adherence to the CBT protocol was assessed.Outcomes: Primary outcomes: relapse (re-emergence of, or significant deterioration in, positive psychotic symptoms of at least moderate severity, persisting for > or = 2 weeks) and total days in hospital. Secondary outcomes: psychotic symptom measures (PANSS); delusions (Psychotic Symptom Rating Scale (PSYRATS)); hallucinations (PSYRATS); depression (Beck Depression Inventory Second Edition (BDI-II)), and social functioning (SOFAS score). Assessments took place at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months.Patient follow-up: At 24 months, 96% of participants were analysed for primary and 80% for secondary outcomes.METHODSDesign: Randomised controlled trial (stratified by carer, centre and inpatient or outpatient status at time of relapse). Allocation: Concealed. Blinding: All treatments were single blind (assessors blind). Follow-up period: 24 months.MAIN RESULTSThere were no differences in remission, relapse or total days spent in hospitals among the treatment groups at 12 or 24 months (see online table) At 24 months, CBT improved depression compared with TAU (mean difference in BDI-II score -3.07, 95% CI -604 to -0.11; p<0.05; results pooled for those with and without carers).CONCLUSIONSNeither CBT nor family therapy improve relapse rates or reduces the number of days in hospital for people with psychosis who have recently relapsedNOTESAs only a low proportion (less than 50%) of participants showed full remission (absence of positive symptoms) from their initial episode, months in full or partial remission (improvement in or absence of positive symptoms) was used as an additional indicator of the primary outcome. Authors suggest treating significant results in secondary outcomes with caution because of the risk of type I errors from multiple significance testing.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Outcomes for negative symptoms over a one-year period were examined in two groups of patients, one receiving psychoeducational multiple-family group treatment and one receiving standard care. METHODS: A total of 63 outpatients, ages 18 to 45 years, with DSM-IV diagnoses of schizophrenic disorders were randomly assigned to standard care or multiple-family group psychoeducation treatment at a large mental health center in Spokane, Washington. Treatment assignment was stratified by whether patients were taking typical or atypical antipsychotic medications. Negative symptom status was monitored monthly for one year by raters blind to group assignment and measured as a composite of five symptoms using the Modified Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms. RESULTS: When the analysis controlled for baseline negative symptoms, participants in the multiple-family group experienced significantly reduced negative symptoms compared with those receiving standard care. Taking atypical antipsychotic medication or having a diagnosis of substance abuse was not associated with the severity of negative symptoms. An additional analysis of the five individual negative symptoms indicated small but consistent group differences on all dimensions except inattention. Negative symptoms were significantly correlated with relapse to acute illness but not with outpatient or inpatient service use. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated that a psychoeducational multiple-family group intervention was more effective than standard care in managing negative symptoms over a 12-month period. The results are particularly relevant because negative symptoms are associated with relapse, poor social and occupational functioning, cognitive impairment, and lower subjective quality of life.

AB  - The current study aimed to test the clinical effectiveness of a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) program for battered women in a community setting and to find out whether effectiveness of individual therapy can be improved in conjunction with group therapy. One hundred sixteen treatment-seeking battered women were assigned either to CBT on an individual basis or an individual and group basis. Psychological treatment, focused on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), emotional discomfort, and impaired functioning, comprised a 17-session program, including emotional expression, psychoeducation, trauma re-exposure, coping skills, and problem-solving training. Although most treated patients in both groups improved in all variables (PTSD, emotional discomfort, and impaired functioning) at all assessments, the combined individual and group therapy did better than the individual therapy regarding PTSD symptoms and impaired functioning at follow-up assessments. These findings partially support the beneficial effects of group CBT as adjunctive therapy to individual CBT. Implications of this study for clinical practice and future research in this field are commented on. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

AB  - Objective: To determine whether schizophrenic outpatients receiving low-dose neuroleptic therapy could learn and retain complex information and skills related to self-management of their illness, a novel technique of teaching, using cognitive and behavioral methods, was designed to compensate for the patients' learning disabilities. Method: The subjects were 41 patients with DSM-III-R schizophrenia who were receiving constant maintenance neuroleptic drug therapy. They were randomly assigned to structured, modularized skills training or to supportive group psychotherapy. Results: The patients who received skills training made significant gains in each of the areas taught, while those participating in group therapy did not. The skills learned during training were retained without significant erosion over a 1-year follow-up period. Conclusions: The effectiveness of modularized teaching of illness self-management skills to schizophrenic patients appears to be largely independent of baseline psychopathology and symptom improvement. Such an approach is useful for overcoming or compensating for the enduring cognitive and information processing deficits commonly found in schizophrenia.

AB  - Introduction. Psychiatric disorders have a chronic course, fluctuating and disabling, with functional impairment and disability. The current treatment approaches aimed at improving the quality of life of patients and their families. Evaluate the effectiveness of the quality of life of a psychoeducation program, integrating the patient and family in the treatment of mental illness, transforming them into active participants, as part of routine clinical practice with outpatients. Material and methods. We invited to participate to 39 volunteers, male and female adults under 60 years, all with mental illness, diagnosed and treated at the Unit of Medical Specialties in the Outpatient Psychiatry, regardless of their diagnosis, standard treatment or the course of the disease. Once accepted to study entry were randomized into two groups (A and B). Group A was added to the usual treatment psychoeducation program, according to the guides. The second group kept their usual treatment without receiving psychoeducation. Results. Questionnaires were applied and clinimetría the two groups to evaluate the quality of life. Baseline recording was obtained (top) and two weeks later. Both records were analyzed and compared between groups (t test for dependent groups). Conclusion. We found statistically significant difference between groups, concluding that the application of psychoeducation program affects the quality of life of patients with mental illness.

Los enfoques actuales en los tratamientos buscan mejorar la calidad de vida de los pacientes y de sus familiares. Evaluamos la efectividad en la calidad de vida de un programa de psicoeducación, integrando al paciente y a sus familiares en el tratamiento de la enfermedad mental, transformándolos en participantes activos, en el marco de la práctica clínica habitual, con pacientes ambulatorios. Material y método. Se invitó a participar a 39 voluntarios, masculinos y femeninos, adultos menores de 60 años, todos con enfermedad mental, diagnosticados y tratados en la Unidad de Especialidades Médicas, en la Consulta Externa de Psiquiatría, sin considerar su diagnóstico, su tratamiento habitual o el curso de la enfermedad. Una vez que aceptaron ingresar al estudio, se aleatorizaron en dos grupos (A y B). Al grupo A se le agregó a su tratamiento habitual un programa de psicoeducación, según las guías correspondientes. El segundo grupo conservó su tratamiento habitual, sin recibir psicoeducación. Resultados. Se aplicaron cuestionarios y clinimetría a los dos grupos para evaluar la calidad de vida. Se obtuvo registro basal (inicio) y dos semanas después. Se analizan ambos registros y se compararon entre ambos grupos (t de Student para grupos dependientes). Conclusión. Se encontró diferencia estadísticamente significativa entre ambos grupos, concluyendo que la aplicación del programa de psicoeducación influye en la calidad de vida de los pacientes con enfermedad mental.

AB  - Background: Depression causes significant burden both to the individual and to society, and its treatment by antidepressants has various disadvantages. There is preliminary evidence that adds on yoga therapy improves depression by impacting the neurotransmitters involved in the regulation of mood, motivation, and pleasure. Our study aimed to find the effect of adjunctive yoga therapy on outcome of depression and comorbid anxiety. Materials and Methods: A randomized controlled study involving patients with major depressive disorder (n = 80) were allocated to two groups, one received standard therapy (antidepressants and counseling) and the other received adjunct yoga therapy along with standard therapy. Ratings of depression and anxiety were done using Montgomery–Asberg Depression Rating Scale and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale at baseline, 10th and 30th day. Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Scale was applied at baseline and 30th day to view the severity of illness and clinical improvement. Results: By the 30th day, individuals in the yoga group had significantly lower scores of depression, anxiety, and CGI scores, in comparison to the control group. The individuals in the yoga group had a significant fall in depression scores and significant clinical improvement, compared to the control group, from baseline to 30th day and 10th to 30th day. In addition, the individuals in the yoga group had a significant fall in anxiety scores from baseline to 10th day. Conclusion: Anxiety starts to improve with short-term yoga sessions, while long-term yoga therapy is likely to be beneficial in the treatment of depression.

AB  - Today, addiction is a major problem in human society, threatens health of the community, family, and individual, and leads to loss of personal, occupational, family and social achievements. This experimental pretest-posttest study with control group aimed to determine the effect of group logotherapy in reducing depression and increasing hope in drug addicts. From a total of 70 addicts, 60 were selected by random sampling method, and finally 20 were selected with the highest scores in Beck's depression inventory and the lowest scores in Snyder's adult hope scale, who were then randomly divided into control and trial groups. The trial group received 10 sessions of group logotherapy, and the control group received no intervention at all. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential (covariance analysis) statistics. Results showed significantly lower mean depression scores, and significantly higher mean hope scores in posttest in trial group compared to control group. According to results, it can be concluded that group logotherapy is effective in reducing depression and increasing hope in drug addicts.

AB  - Various treatments aimed for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been developed for Veterans, but many are not formatted for use in groups, do not address common psychiatric comorbidities, and include inherent barriers (e.g., substantial time commitment). This program evaluation study aimed to examine the effectiveness of a five-session treatment, a Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT)- Informed Group focused on changing irrational beliefs to address comorbid depression and anxiety (as well as anger and guilt) among post-9/11 Veterans with PTSD. Participants (n = 47) completing the REBTInformed Group demonstrated significant reductions at posttreatment in depression and PTSD symptoms. Compared to Veterans in a ten-session treatment-as-usual group (n = 47), there was no significant difference in PTSD symptom improvement despite the reduction in number of sessions. The study demonstrates that a five-week group treatment for PTSD comorbid with depression or anxiety in post-9/11 Veterans -- a therapy that may be uniquely suited to a military or Veteran population, but potentially generalizable to civilians as well -- can lead to significant reductions in depression and PTSD symptoms. Future directions include development of a manual for dissemination and replication of findings of the REBT-Informed Group to other military or Veterans Affairs medical centers.

AB  - The effectiveness of group psychotherapy in decreasing PTSD symptoms and psychiatric distress (e.g., depression, anxiety, and hostility) and increasing adequate coping strategies was examined among women exposed to severe violence and multiple trauma. The gender- and culture-sensitive group therapy was tailored to increase self-awareness, violence protection, empowerment, and coping capacity and to create support networks. Participants were 33 women from the Southeast Anatolian region diagnosed with PTSD. Women completed the Post Traumatic Stress Scale, the Impact of Event Scale Revised, the Brief Symptom Inventory, and the Scale of Coping With Stress at pretherapy, posttherapy, and at 3 and 6 months' follow-up. The group psychotherapy sessions involved a 2-day meeting once a month for 5 months. Results showed significant decreases in PTSD symptoms and depressiveness, anxiety, hostility, interpersonal problems, and paranoid ideation during the group therapy, and the improvement sustained across the follow-ups. Inadequate coping strategies (submissive approach and helpless withdrawal) decreased and seeking social support increased during the therapy, and the change was sustained across follow-ups. Group psychotherapy tailored specially for multitraumatized women and sensitive to their culture proved to be effective in decreasing psychological suffering and increasing resources.

AB  - The authors assessed social-evaluative anxiety in 50 cocaine abusers attending an outpatient therapeutic-community (TC)-oriented clinic. This group-based modality presumes that the ability of clients to self-disclose is key to recovery. Fully half of the clients tested, some of whom had been attending treatment for a number of months, showed an elevation of social withdrawal and distress. Newcomers with higher social anxiety scores were less likely to drop out of treatment over the first 3 months, and self-reported level of social anxiety decreased over this time interval. These findings suggest that social anxiety may be an important consideration in treatment for cocaine abuse and that the rigors of a modified TC with intense focus on group involvement may reduce social anxiety.

AB  - Objective: Psychological treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are usually delivered once or twice a week over several months. It is unclear whether they can be successfully delivered over a shorter period of time. This clinical trial had two goals: to investigate the acceptability and efficacy of a 7-day intensive version of cognitive therapy for PTSD and to investigate whether cognitive therapy has specific treatment effects by comparing intensive and standard weekly cognitive therapy with an equally credible alternative treatment. Method: Patients with chronic PTSD (N=121) were randomly allocated to 7- day intensive cognitive therapy for PTSD, 3 months of standard weekly cognitive therapy, 3 months of weekly emotion-focused supportive therapy, or a 14-week waiting list condition. The primary outcomes were change in PTSD symptoms and diagnosis as measured by independent assessor ratings and self-report. The secondary outcomes were change in disability, anxiety, depression, and quality of life. Evaluations were conducted at the baseline assessment and at 6 and 14 weeks (the posttreatment/ wait assessment). For groups receiving treatment, evaluations were also conducted at 3 weeks and follow-up assessments at 27 and 40 weeks after randomization. All analyses were intent-to-treat. Results: At the posttreatment/wait assessment, 73% of the intensive cognitive therapy group, 77% of the standard cognitive therapy group, 43% of the supportive therapy group, and 7% of the waiting list group had recovered from PTSD. All treatments were well tolerated and were superior to waiting list on nearly all outcome measures; no difference was-observed between supportive therapy and waiting list on quality of life. For primary outcomes, disability, and general anxiety, intensive and standard cognitive therapy were superior to supportive therapy. Intensive cognitive therapy achieved faster symptom reduction and comparable over-all outcomes to standard cognitive therapy. Conclusions: Cognitive therapy for PTSD delivered intensively over little more than a week was as effective as cognitive therapy delivered over 3 months. Both had specific effects and were superior to supportive therapy. Intensive cognitive therapy for PTSD is a feasible and promising alternative to traditional weekly treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose was to test the effectiveness of two transdiagnostic group interventions compared to care as usual (CAU) for patients with anxiety, depressive or stress‐related disorders within a primary health care context. OBJECTIVES: To compare the effects of cognitive‐based‐behavioural therapy (CBT) and multimodal intervention (MMI) on the quality of life and relief of psychological symptoms of patients with common mental disorders or problems attending primary health care centre. METHODS: Patients (n = 278), aged 18‐65 years, were referred to the study by the GPs and 245 were randomized to CAU or one of two group interventions in addition to CAU: (i) group CBT administered by psychologists and (ii) group MMI administered by assistant nurses. The primary outcome measure was the Mental Component Summary score of short form 36. Secondary outcome measures were Perceived Stress Scale and Self‐Rating Scale for Affective Syndromes. The data were analysed using intention‐to‐treat with a linear mixed model. RESULTS: On the primary outcome measure, the mean improvement based on mixed model analyses across post‐ and follow‐up assessment was significantly larger for the MMI group than for the CBT (4.0; P = 0.020) and CAU (7.5; P = .001) groups. Participants receiving CBT were significantly more improved than those in the CAU group. On four of the secondary outcome measures, the MMI group was significantly more improved than the CBT and CAU groups. The course of improvement did not differ between the CBT group and the CAU group on these measures. CONCLUSIONS: Transdiagnostic group treatment can be effective for patients with common mental disorders when delivered in a primary care setting. The group format and transdiagnostic approach fit well with the requirements of primary care.

AB  - Background: Many with a mental illness have an impoverished everyday life with few meaningful activities and a sedentary lifestyle. The study aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of the 16-week Balancing Everyday Life (BEL) program, compared to care as usual (CAU), for people with mental illness in specialized and community-based psychiatric services. The main outcomes concerned different aspects of subjectively evaluated everyday activities, in terms of the engagement and satisfaction they bring, balance among activities, and activity level. Secondary outcomes pertained to various facets of well-being and functioning. It was hypothesized that those who received the BEL intervention would improve more than the comparison group regarding activity, well-being and functioning outcomes. Methods: BEL is a group and activity-based lifestyle intervention. CAU entailed active support, mainly standard occupational therapy. The BEL group included 133 participants and the CAU group 93. They completed self-report questionnaires targeting activity and well-being on three occasions - at baseline, after completed intervention (at 16 weeks) and at a six-month follow-up. A research assistant rated the participants' level of functioning and symptom severity on the same occasions. Non-parametric statistics were used since these instruments produced ordinal data. Results: The BEL group improved more than the CAU group from baseline to 16 weeks on primary outcomes in terms of activity engagement (p < 0.001), activity level (p = 0.036) and activity balance (p < 0.042). The BEL group also improved more on the secondary outcomes of symptom severity (p < 0.018) and level of functioning (p < 0. 046) from baseline to 16 weeks, but not on well-being. High intra-class correlations (0.12-0.22) indicated clustering effects for symptom severity and level of functioning. The group differences on activity engagement (p = 0.001) and activity level (p = 0.007) remained at the follow-up. The BEL group also improved their well-being (quality of life) more than the CAU group from baseline to the follow-up (p = 0.049). No differences were found at that time for activity balance, level of functioning and symptom severity. Conclusion: The BEL program was effective compared to CAU in terms of activity engagement. Their improvements were not, however, greater concerning other subjective perceptions, such as satisfaction with daily activities and self-rated health, and clustering effects lowered the dependability regarding findings of improvements on symptoms and functioning. Although the CAU group had "caught up" at the follow-up, the BEL group had improved more on general quality of life. BEL appeared to be important in shortening the time required for participants to develop their engagement in activity and in attaining improved quality of life in a follow-up perspective.

AB  - Background: The risk of cardiovascular disease is increased in patients with severe mental illness (SMI) dramatically reducing life expectancy. Method(s): A real world pragmatic service evaluation of a Well-Being Support Program (WSP) was conducted. This was a four-session package delivered over a one-year period by mental health practitioners that had received additional training in providing physical health assessment and intervention. Patients' physical health was screened and appropriate one-to-one and group intervention was offered. Result(s): 212 mental health practitioners were trained in the WSP and 782 patients were enrolled on the program. The majority of our sample was overweight or obese; 66% had a Body Mass Index (BMI) >25. Lifestyle risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) were common and the patients had low self esteem. The average number of formally recorded well-being sessions attended was 2.10. Just under a quarter of those patients enrolled in the program completed. The only cardiovascular risk factor that significantly altered in patients that completed the program was BMI. The qualitative feedback about the program was largely positive. Conclusion(s): The need to intervene to enhance the physical health of people with SMI is beyond doubt. Maintaining patient engagement in a physical health improvement program is challenging. Regular comprehensive physical health monitoring is necessary to establish the benefit of intervention and increase life expectancy and well-being in this population. © 2011 Eldridge et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Background: Childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is a significant trauma that may have lifelong impact. Due to the long-term negative personal and societal consequences of CSA, it is crucial to find treatments with enduring outcomes. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the relative long-term efficacy of psychodynamic and systemic group therapy for adult women exposed to CSA. Method: A prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted with outcomes assessed at pre- and post-treatment, and 1 and 5 years post-treatment. All analyses were intention-to-treat. One hundred and six women with sequelae from childhood sexual abuse were treated with psychodynamic or systemic group therapy. Primary outcome was Global Severity Index (GSI) of SCL-90-R. Secondary outcomes included symptoms of PTSD and depression and psycho-social functioning. Results: Treatment was completed by 81% of participants; 64% completed the 1-year follow-up and 60% completed the 5-year follow-up. Completion rates did not differ between treatments. Significant reduction in symptoms measured on GSI and improvement of psychosocial functioning was found for both interventions at all measurement points after treatment (ES range = 0.68–1.19). However, different trajectories were observed: while outcome at end of treatment was significantly better in the systemic group, no differences in gains were observed at the 1- and 5-year follow-ups when controlling for baseline differences. Conclusions: The findings add to the evidence base for psychodynamic and systemic group therapy, but the result also underscores the importance of taking post-treatment trajectories into account in evidence-based research, in the continued efforts to improve treatment for this population. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) 背景:童年期性虐待 (CSA) 是一种可能有终身影响的严重创伤。由于CSA对个人和社会的长期负面影响, 找到持续效果高的治疗方法至关重要。 目的:本研究旨在确定心理动力学和系统团体治疗对遭受CSA的成年女性的相对长期疗效。 方法:进行了一项前瞻性随机对照试验, 在治疗前, 后以及治疗后一年和五年对结果进行评估。所有分析均为意向性分析。 166名有童年期性虐待后遗症的女性接受了心理动力学或系统团体治疗。主要结果是SCL-90-R测量的整体严重程度指数 (GSI) 。次要结果包括PTSD, 抑郁症状以及心理社会功能。 结果:参与者中81%完成了治疗 64%完成了1年后的随访, 60%完成了5年后的随访。治疗间的完成率无差异。在治疗后的所有测量点, 两种干预措施的GSI症状均显著减轻, 心理社会功能得到改善 (ES范围= 0.68-1.19) 。但是, 观察到了不同轨迹:尽管治疗结束时系统组的结果明显更好, 但控制基线差异时, 在1年和5年随访中未观察到获益的差异。 结论:这些发现增加了心理动力学和系统团体治疗的证据基础, 但结果也强调了在循证研究中考虑治疗后轨迹, 持续努力提高针对此群体治疗的重要性。 (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Antecedentes: El abuso sexual en la infancia (ASI) es un trauma significativo que puede tener un impacto para toda la vida. Dadas las consecuencias negativas personales y sociales del ASI, es crucial encontrar tratamientos con resultados sostenidamente positivos. Objetivo: El objetivo de este estudio fue determinar la eficacia relativa a largo plazo de la terapia grupal psicodinámica y sistémica para mujeres adultas expuestas a ASI. Método: Se realizó un ensayo controlado aleatorizado prospectivo, con evaluaciones pre y post tratamiento, y luego de 1 y 5 años post-tratamiento. Todos los análisis fueron por intención de tratar. Ciento seis mujeres con secuelas derivadas de abuso sexual en la infancia fueron tratadas con terapia grupal psicodinámica o sistémica. El resultado principal fue el índice global de severidad (IGS) del SCL-90-R. Los resultados secundarios incluyeron síntomas de TEPT y depresión, y funcionamiento psicosocial. Resultados: El tratamiento fue completado por 81% de los participantes; 64% de ellos completó el seguimiento luego de un año, y 60% completó el seguimiento luego de cinco años. Se encontró una reducción significativa de síntomas medidos a través del IGS, además de un mejoramiento del funcionamiento psicosocial, en ambas intervenciones y en todo momento de evaluación post-tratamiento (ES rango = 0.68-1.19). No obstante, se observaron diferentes trayectorias: aunque el resultado al final del tratamiento era significativamente mejor en el grupo sistémico, no se observaron diferencias de ganancias en los seguimientos de 1 y 5 años, controlando las diferencias base. Conclusiones: Los hallazgos contribuyen a la evidencia basal para terapia grupal psicodinámica y sistémica, pero los resultados también resaltan la relevancia de considerar las trayectorias post-tratamiento en la investigación basada en evidencia, como parte de los esfuerzos para mejorar los tratamientos para esta población.

AB  - Objective: There have been few comparisons of the effectiveness of collaborative depression care between older versus younger adults with comorbid illness, particularly among low-income populations. Design: Intent-to-treat analyses are conducted on pooled data from three randomized controlled trials that tested collaborative care aimed at improving depression, quality of life, and treatment receipt. Settings: Trials were conducted in oncology and primary care safety net clinics and diverse home healthcare programs. Participants: Thousand eighty-one patients with major depressive symptoms and cancer, diabetes, or other comorbid illness. Intervention: Similar intervention protocols included patient, provider, sociocultural, and organizational adaptations. Measurements: The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 depression, Short-Form Health Survey-12/20 quality of life, self-reported hospitalization, ER, intensive care unit utilization, and antidepressant, psychotherapy treatment receipt are assessed at baseline, 6, and 12 months. Results: There are no significant differences in reducing depression symptoms (p ranged 0.18-0.58), improving quality of life (t = 1.86, df = 669, p = 0.07 for physical functioning at 12 months, and p ranged 0.23-0.99 for all others) patients aged between >= 60 years versus 18-59 years. Both age group intervention patients have significantly higher rates of a 50% PHQ-9 reduction (older: Wald chi(2)[df = 1] = 4.82, p = 0.03; younger: Wald chi(2)[df = 1] = 6.47, p = 0.02), greater reduction in major depression rates (older: Wald chi(2)[df = 1] = 7.72, p = 0.01; younger: Wald chi(2)[df = 1] = 4.0, p = 0.05) than enhanced-usual-care patients at 6 months and no significant age group differences in treatment type or intensity. Conclusion: Collaborative depression care in individuals with comorbid illness is as effective in reducing depression in older patients as younger patients, including among low-income, minority patients. Patient, provider, and organizational adaptations of depression care management models may contribute to positive outcomes. (Am J Geriatr Psychiatry 2010; 18:520-530)

AB  - <bold>Background: </bold>Comorbid anxiety in bipolar disorder (BD) is associated with greater illness severity, reduced treatment response, and greater impairment. Treating anxiety in the context of BD is crucial for improving illness course and outcomes. The current study examined the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of the Unified Protocol (UP), a transdiagnostic cognitive behavioral therapy, as an adjunctive treatment to pharmacotherapy for BD and comorbid anxiety disorders.<bold>Methods: </bold>Twenty-nine patients with BD and at least one comorbid anxiety disorder were randomized to pharmacotherapy treatment-as-usual (TAU) or TAU with 18 sessions of the UP (UP+TAU). All patients completed assessments every four weeks to track symptoms, functioning, emotion regulation and temperament. Linear mixed-model regressions were conducted to track symptom changes over time and to examine the relationship between emotion-related variables and treatment response.<bold>Results: </bold>Satisfaction ratings were equivalent for both treatment groups. Patients in the UP+TAU group evidenced significantly greater reductions over time in anxiety and depression symptoms (Cohen's d's>0.80). Baseline levels of neuroticism, perceived affective control, and emotion regulation ability predicted magnitude of symptom change for the UP+TAU group only. Greater change in perceived control of emotions and emotion regulation skills predicted greater change in anxiety related symptoms.<bold>Limitations: </bold>This was a pilot feasibility and acceptability trial; results should be interpreted with caution.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Treatment with the UP+TAU was rated high in patient satisfaction, and resulted in significantly greater improvement on indices of anxiety and depression relative to TAU. This suggests that the UP may be a feasible treatment approach for BD with comorbid anxiety.

AB  - Objectives: This study tested the impacts of peer specialists on housing stability, substance abuse, and mental health status for previously homeless Veterans with cooccurring mental health issues and substance abuse.Methods: Veterans living in the US Housing and Urban Development-Veterans Administration Supported Housing (HUD-VASH) program were randomized to peer specialist services that worked independently from HUD-VASH case managers (ie, not part of a case manager/peer specialist dyad) and to treatment as usual that included case management services. Peer specialist services were community-based, using a structured curriculum for recovery with up to 40 weekly sessions. Standardized self-report measures were collected at 3 timepoints. The intent-to-treat analysis tested treatment effects using a generalized additive mixed-effects model that allows for different nonlinear relationships between outcomes and time for treatment and control groups. A secondary analysis was conducted for Veterans who received services from peer specialists that were adherent to the intervention protocol.Results: Treated Veterans did not spend more days in housing compared with control Veterans during any part of the study at the 95% level of confidence. Veterans assigned to protocol adherent peer specialists showed greater housing stability between about 400 and 800 days postbaseline. Neither analysis detected significant effects for the behavioral health measures.Conclusions: Some impact of peer specialist services was found for housing stability but not for behavioral health problems. Future studies may need more sensitive measures for early steps in recovery and may need longer time frames to effectively impact this highly challenged population.

AB  - Objectives: To test group-based Female-Specific Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (G-FS-CBT) for women with Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) against an individual Female-Specific Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (I-FS-CBT). This aims of this paper are to describe G-FS-CBT development, content, feasibility, acceptability, group process, engagement in treatment, and within- and post-treatment outcomes.Methods: Women with AUD (n=155) were randomly assigned to 12 manual-guided sessions of G-FS-CBT or I-FS-CBT; 138 women attended at least one treatment session.Results: Women in G-FS-CBT attended fewer sessions (M=7.6) than women in I-FS-CBT (M=9.7; p<.001). Women in both conditions reported high satisfaction with the treatments. Independent coders rated high fidelity of delivery of both G-FS-CBT and I-FS-CBT. Therapeutic alliance with the therapist was high in both conditions, with I-FS-CBT being slightly but significantly higher than G-FS-CBT. In the first six weeks of treatment, women in both treatment conditions significantly reduced their percent drinking days (PDD) and percent heavy days drinking (PHD) by equivalent amounts, maintained through the rest of treatment and the 12month follow up with no treatment condition effects. Women reported significant improvement in all but one of the secondary outcomes during treatment; gains made during treatment in depression, anxiety, autonomy, and interpersonal problems were maintained during the follow-up period, while gains made during treatment in use of coping skills, self-efficacy for abstinence, self-care, and sociotropy deteriorated over follow up but remained improved compared to baseline.Conclusions: Findings support the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of a group format for female-specific CBT for AUD, a new 12-session, single gender, community friendly, group therapy with programming specifically for women. Similar, positive outcomes for individual and group treatment formats were found for drinking, mood, coping skills, self-confidence, interpersonal functioning, and self-care.

This randomized controlled trial will follow the principles of a collaborative, stepped care, group treatment with a transdiagnotic approach. It will test how well a psychological treatment programme for anxiety, depression, and somatisation disorders works in Primary Care in seven 90‐minute group sessions (experimental group) in comparison with the usual treatment offered in Spanish Primary Care services (control group). Primary end point(s): If it starts by July 2013, all the data (N = 1126) could be collected in approximately 12 months. Secondary Objective: The experimental but not the control group will report a greater decrease (including pre‐post‐treatment differences and follow‐up at 3, 6 and 12 months) in emotional symptoms (total scores of anxiety, depressive and somatic symptoms as measured by the PHQ), cognitive‐emotional factors, and percentage of cases with probable emotional disorders. The former but not the latter will also report an increase in its levels of work, family and social impairment (Sheehan Disability Scale), and physical, psychological, social, and environmental quality of life (as measured by the different WHOQOL‐BREF scales). The experimental group but not the control group will have reduced the frequency of Primary Care visits and psychoactive drug use (as well as other health care costs) at 6 month follow‐up. In addition, the experimental group will report higher treatment satisfaction than the control group. Timepoint(s) of evaluation of this end point: Evaluation and analyses of the post‐treatment results will be carried out in the months following July 2014. SECONDARY OUTCOME: Secondary end point(s): Since there will be a follow‐up at 3, 6 and 12 months, another 12 more months would be necessary (from January 2014 to January 2015). Timepoint(s) of evaluation of this end point: Evaluation and analyses of follow‐up results will be carried out in the months following January 2015. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Any adult patient seeking Primary Care treatment at any of the selected sites, regardless of his/her age and sex, with a probable anxiety, mood and/or somatisation disorder (diagnosed with the Patient Health Questionnaire). Are the trial subjects under 18? no Number of subjects for this age range: F.1.2 Adults (18‐64 years) yes F.1.2.1 Number of subjects for this age range 1026 F.1.3 Elderly (>=65 years) yes F.1.3.1 Number of subjects for this age range 100

AB  - Background: Employment is an important part of recovery for individuals with schizophrenia. The employment rate for this group is as low as 10% in Norway, and major system related barriers to employment are evident. Aims: This study reports the competitive employment outcome at 2-year follow-up of a vocational rehabilitation study augmented with cognitive remediation (CR) or elements from cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. It also investigates if global functioning, self-esteem, and depression at baseline predicts employment outcome, and if change in these variables during the intervention period is associated with employment outcome. Method: One hundred and forty-eight participants with schizophrenia spectrum disorders in six Norwegian counties received 10 months vocational rehabilitation augmented with either CBT (n = 84) or CR (n = 64). Both competitive and sheltered workplaces were used. Participants were assessed at baseline, at the end of the intervention period, and at 2-year follow-up. Results: At 2-year follow-up, 21.2% had obtained competitive employment. A further 25.3% had work placements in competitive workplaces. Significant improvements were found in global functioning, self-esteem, and depression during the intervention period, but no significant differences between the two intervention groups. High baseline global functioning and self-esteem, as well as positive change in these variables during the intervention period, were significantly associated with higher competitive employment outcome at 2-year follow-up. Conclusion: The results add to existing evidence that competitive employment is attainable for individuals with schizophrenia. High global functioning and self-esteem were strongly associated with competitive employment outcome.

AB  - The present study examined whether female patients diagnosed with PTSD and comorbid panic attacks evidenced improvement in functioning following treatment with Multiple Channel Exposure Therapy (MCET). Based on several reviews, Sheehan and colleagues (1996) argue that, at minimum, three domains of functioning should be included when assessing disability: work impairment, social impairment, and family life/home responsibilities. Thus, participants treated with MCET and control participants were compared on measures of satisfaction with, resources for and quality of work, social life and, family at baseline and at 12 weeks (posttreatment for, the treatment condition). In addition, the treatment group was followed and assessed at 3 months and 6 months to examine further changes in functioning. It was expected that the treatment group would exhibit greater improvement in social functioning and material and emotional resources than control participants. It was also expected that the treatment group would evidence continued improvement in these areas at follow-up assessments. The treatment and control conditions evidenced improvement in work, marital, economic, and overall adjustment from pretreatment to posttreatment, and did not differ. In addition, the treatment group evidenced continued improvement in work, marital, economic, and overall adjustment from pretreatment to 3-month follow-up and from pretreatment to 6-month follow-up. The treatment group evidenced the most consistent amount of change on parental functioning, evidencing improvement among all assessment points. The treatment and control conditions reported having fewer overall family resources than did a normative sample; however, there was a trend for the treatment group to evidence improvement in time for self between the pretreatment and the 6-month follow-up assessment. Otherwise, neither group reported change in basic needs, money, time for self, time for family, or overall family resources at any assessment point.

AB  - Substance use disorders (SUD) in persons with severe mental illness (SMI) are common and have a profound effect on the course of psychiatric illness. Despite the prominence of 'dual disorders' among the SMI, no manualized, empirically validated treatments exist. There is a particular need for family work in this area because most dually diagnosed clients maintain contact with relatives, and the loss of family support is associated with housing instability and homelessness in this population. The proposed research will be a controlled evaluation of a new family intervention for dual disorders (FIDD) program, described in a treatment manual and supported by a pilot study. The study will take place at two typical public mental health centers, the North Suffolk Mental Health Association in Massachusetts and the San Fernando Mental Health Center in California. The research will be conducted by the joint effort of two well-established centers for mental health services and clinical trials research, the New Hampshire-Dartmouth Psychiatric Research Center and the UCLA Intervention Research Center. A total of 140 clients and their families (N=70 at each site) will be randomly assigned to either the FIDD program for 2 years (N=70), which includes both single family and multiple-family group formats, or family psychoeducation including 6 weekly sessions (N=70). Fidelity of clinicians to the FIDD program will be monitored with standardized measures. Routine assessments will be conducted over 2 years on all clients and relatives to evaluate a wide range of outcomes, including substance abuse, hospitalizations, psychiatric symptoms, legal problems, aggression, housing and homelessness, family burden, social support, and quality of life. Process measures of the FIDD program will include family knowledge of dual disorders and problem-solving skill. The results of the proposed research have important implications for improving the long-term outcomes of clients with dual disorders and lessening the impact of SUD on relatives. Enhancing the skills of families for coping with dual disorders is expected to be an effective strategy for treating SUD, decreasing hospitalizations, and decreasing caregiver burden. Improvements in these areas may the have long-term benefit of maintaining family involvement with dually diagnosed clients, thereby reducing housing instability and homelessness.

AB  - This study tests the effectiveness of adding an eight‐month, thirty‐session schema‐focused therapy (SFT) group to treatment‐as‐usual (TAU) individual psychotherapy for borderline personality disorder (BPD). Patients (N=32) were randomly assigned to SFT‐TAU and TAU alone. Dropout was 0% SFT, 25% TAU. Significant reductions in BPD symptoms and global severity of psychiatric symptoms, and improved global functioning with large treatment effect sizes were found in the SFT‐TAU group. At the end of treatment, 94% of SFT‐TAU compared to 16% of TAU no longer met BPD diagnosis criteria (p<.001). This study supports group SFT as an effective treatment for BPD that leads to recovery and improved overall functioning.

AB  - Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a severe, challenging to treat mental disorder. Schema therapy (ST) as an individual therapy has been proven to be an effective psychological treatment for BPD. A group format of ST (GST) has been developed and evaluated in a randomized controlled trial in the United States and piloted in The Netherlands. These results suggest that GST speeds up and amplifies treatment effects of ST and might reduce delivery costs. However, feasibility in the German health care system and with BPD patients with high BPD severity and comorbidity, and frequent hospitalization, has not been tested to date. We investigated GST in 10 severely impaired, highly comorbid female patients with BPD, that needed frequent hospital admission. Patients received an outpatient ST-treatment program with weekly group and individual sessions for 1 year. Outcome measures including BPD severity, general psychopathology, psychosocial functioning, quality of life, happiness, schemas, and modes, and days of hospitalization were assessed at the start of treatment and 6, 12, and 36 months later with semi-structured interviews and self-report measures. We observed significant decreases in severity of BPD symptoms, general symptom severity, dysfunctional BPD-specific modes and schemas, and days of hospitalization. Functional modes, quality of live and happiness improved. The results of this feasibility study are promising and encourage further implementation of ST outpatient treatment programs even for patients with severe BPD and high hospitalization risk. However, small sample size and the missing of a control group do not allow the generalizability of these findings.

AB  - Background Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is aimed to counteract cognitions and behaviours that are considered as dysfunctional. The aim of the study is to test whether the inclusion of a non‐counteractive approach (dilemma‐focused intervention, DFI) in combination with CBT group therapy will yield better short‐ and long‐term outcomes than an intervention conducted entirely using CBT. Method A total of 128 patients with depression and at least one cognitive conflict, of six health community centres in Barcelona, participated from November of 2011 to December of 2014 in seven weekly group CBT sessions and were then randomly allocated to either DFI or CBT (eight individual sessions each) by an independent researcher. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory‐II at baseline, at the end of therapy and threeand twelve‐month follow‐ups. Therapists did not participate in any of the assessments nor in the randomisation of patients and evaluators were masked to group assignment. Both intention to treat and complete case analyses were performed using linear mixed models with random effects. Findings According to intention‐to‐treat analysis (F2, 179 = 0.69) and complete case analysis (F2, 146 = 0.88), both conditions similarly reduced the severity of symptoms across posttreatment assessments. For the 77 participants (CBTgroup +CBTindividual = 40; CBTgroup+DFIindividual = 37) that completed allocated treatment and one‐year follow‐up assessment, response and remission rates were relative higher for the DFI condition, however no significant differences were found between treatment conditions. The relapse rates were similar between treatment conditions (CBTgroup +CBTindividual = 7/20; CBTgroup+DFIindividual = 8/22). Interpretation Although using a counteractive approach across all the treatment sessions is quite effective, it does not seem to be necessary to produce significant improvement. DFI may be considered as an alternative, which could be included in a wider treatment for depression.

AB  - The current unblinded, randomized controlled trial analyzed psychiatric symptoms, substance use, and life skills outcomes in participants after 21 months in the Housing First (HF) program. The HF group (intervention) comprised 46 participants and the treatment-as-usual (TAU) group (control) comprised 41 participants. Quantitative outcome measures were collected at baseline and 8 and 21 months. Primary outcomes were mental health and substance use. Secondary outcomes were everyday life skills. Descriptive and comparative analyses and linear regression models are presented. At 21 months, the HF group presented significantly better outcomes regarding alcohol and cannabis use than the TAU group. Moreover, the subgroup of HF participants with severe mental illness had significant improvements in psychotic symptoms, anxiety, depression, social relations, and cannabis use compared to TAU participants.

AB  - Objective: Psychotherapy is recommended concomitantly with pharmacotherapy to treat functional deterioration in patients with early‐phase schizophrenia. This study aims to investigate and compare the impact of interpersonal group psychotherapy on functionality in patients with early‐phase schizophrenia compared to painting therapy and waiting list groups. Methods: Prospective, single‐blind, controlled study was carried out in Bolu Community Mental Health Center. The sample consists of 60 patients who had received neither rehabilitation nor psychotherapy before and who were eligible for the study. Participants were distributed consecutively to group psychotherapy, painting and waiting list groups each consisting 20 patients based on their order of admission. Therapeutic intervention was composed of 24 sessions of interpersonal group psychotherapy for 6 months. Sociodemographic Data Forms; positive and negative syndrome scales and brief functionality assessment scale were used at beginning and at the end of therapy. Results: Three groups did not differ in age, education, disease duration, number of hospitalizations, gender, working, socioeconomic and marital status, social support, pharmacological treatment’s type and dose. At the end of the study, patients in group psychotherapy had much more improvement in functionality compared to the painting therapy and waiting lists groups. Discussion: Interpersonal group psychotherapy may aid as an adjunctive to treatment as usual in community mental health centers to improve functioning of patients with early‐phase schizophrenia.

AB  - Over 3,000 patients from 15 VA inpatient, substance abuse treatment programs showed considerable improvement from intake to a one-year follow-up. Patients in 12-step programs, as opposed to cognitive-behavioral (CB) or eclectic programs, and those with more extended continuing outpatient mental health care and 12-step self-help group involvement, were more likely to be abstinent and free of substance use problems at follow-up. Consistent with their better one-year outcomes, patients in 12-step programs improved more between intake and discharge than CB patients on proximal outcomes assumed to be specific to 12-step treatment (e.g., disease model beliefs) and as much or more on CB proximal outcomes. Proximal outcomes assessed at treatment discharge and follow-up were, at best, modestly related to one-year substance use and other outcomes. No evidence was found that CB or 12-step treatment is more beneficial for certain types of patients.

AB  - Although participation in 12-step programs is now widely utilized as a treatment aftercare resource by individuals with drug and alcohol problems, little is known about the effectiveness of such a practice. This paper identifies gaps in the existing literature and articulates methodological concerns that may compromise investigations of 12-step programs. It highlights the need for additional after-treatment studies, and it presents findings from a 24-month longitudinal after-treatment study that suggests the effectiveness of 12-step programs. Rather than a behavioral indicator of recovery motivation or a spurious relationship confounded by additional treatment, aftercare, or alumni activities that occur simultaneously with 12-step participation, the findings suggest that weekly or more frequent 12-step participation is associated with drug and alcohol abstinence. Less-than-weekly participation is not associated with favorable drug and alcohol use outcomes, and participation in 12-step programs seems to be equally useful in maintaining abstinence from both illicit drug and alcohol use. These findings point to the wisdom of a general policy that recommends weekly or more frequent participation in a 12-step program as a useful and inexpensive aftercare resource for many clients.

AB  - Objective: The relative effectiveness of two types of group therapy-the disease-and-recovery model and the cognitive-behavioral model-was examined in a public inpatient and outpatient setting with consumers who had a dual diagnosis of a personality disorder and a substance use disorder, Outcomes in four areas of problem severity were measured: alcohol use, drug use, social and family relations, and psychological functioning, Methods: Using a quasiexperimental group design, 19 subjects in an inpatient mental health facility and 19 in a public outpatient facility were randomly assigned to the two experimental groups, The groups met three times a week for 12 weeks, and specific group leadership protocols were used, A third group at each setting received usual group treatment, Diagnoses of all subjects were verified using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R. The Addiction Severity Index measured changes in problem severity. Results: In the inpatient setting, subjects in both experimental groups had significantly improved social and family relations compared with the usual-treatment group; no posttest changes in the other three areas were noted. In the outpatient setting, cognitive-behavioral group therapy was significantly more effective than the other two group approaches in reducing alcohol use, improving social and family relations, and enhancing psychological functioning. Conclusions: Results suggest that the severity of mental health consumers' substance abuse problems can be substantially decreased in several areas in an outpatient public setting, In an inpatient setting, the use of either group therapy model was more effect ive in reducing problem severity than using no specific model.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a difficult-to-treat sequel of combat. Data on effectiveness of alternate treatment structures are important for planning veterans' psychiatric services. The present study compared clinical presentations and treatment outcomes for Australian veterans with PTSD who participated in a range of models of group-based treatment. METHOD: Participants consisted of 4339 veterans with combat-related PTSD who participated in one of five types of group-based cognitive behavioural programmes of different intensities and settings. Data were gathered at baseline (intake), as well as at 3 and 9 month follow up, on measures of PTSD, anxiety, depression and alcohol misuse. Analyses of variance and effect size analyses were used to investigate differences at intake and over time by programme type. RESULTS: Small baseline differences by programme intensity were identified. Although significant improvements in symptoms were evident over time for each programme type, no significant differences in outcome were evident between programmes. When PTSD severity was considered, veterans with severe PTSD performed less well in the low-intensity programmes than in the moderate- or high-intensity programmes. Veterans with mild PTSD improved less in high-intensity programmes than in moderate- or low-intensity programmes. CONCLUSION: Comparable outcomes are evident across programme types. Outcomes may be maximized when veterans participate in programme intensity types that match their level of PTSD severity. When such matching is not feasible, moderate-intensity programmes appear to offer the most consistent outcomes. For regionally based veterans, delivering treatment in their local environment does not detract from, and may even enhance, outcomes. These findings have implications for the planning and purchasing of mental health services for sufferers of PTSD, particularly for veterans of more recent combat or peacekeeping deployments.

AB  - Shelter data in a recent study revealed discharges from psychiatric facilities to shelters or the street occurred at least 194 times in 2002 in London, Ontario, Canada. This problem must be addressed to reduce the disastrous effects of such discharge, including re-hospitalization and prolonged homelessness. An intervention was developed and tested to prevent homelessness associated with discharge directly to no fixed address. A total of 14 participants at-risk of being discharged without housing were enrolled, with half randomized into the intervention group. The intervention group was provided with immediate assistance in accessing housing and assistance in paying their first and last month's rent. The control group received usual care. Data was collected from participants prior to discharge, at 31 and 6-months post-discharge. All the individuals in the intervention group maintained housing after 3 and 6 months. All but one individual in the control group remained homeless after 3 and 6 months. The exception joined the sex trade to avoid homelessness. The results of this pilot were so dramatic that randomizing to the control group was discontinued. Discussions are underway to routinely implement the intervention. Systemic improvements can prevent homelessness for individuals being discharged from psychiatric wards.

AB  - Traumatic victimization and associated problems with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and affect dysregulation are prevalent among incarcerated women, but there is limited evidence to support psychotherapeutic interventions for these problems in this underserved population. A group psychotherapy designed to enhance affect regulation without trauma memory processing-Trauma Affect Regulation: Guide for Education and Therapy (TARGET)-was compared to a supportive group therapy (SGT) in a randomized clinical trial with 72 incarcerated women with full or partial PTSD. Both interventions achieved statistically significant reductions in PTSD and associated symptom severity and increased self-efficacy. Dropout rates for both interventions were low (<5%). TARGET was more effective than SGT in increasing sense of forgiveness toward others who have caused harm in the past. Group therapy that teaches affect regulation may enhance incarcerated women's ability to achieve affective resolution (forgiveness) while also reducing their victimization-related PTSD and associated symptoms. Experiential-focused supportive group therapy also may reduce victimization-related PTSD and associated symptoms. Both group therapy approaches warrant further study with this vulnerable population.

AB  - Aims and objectives. The aim of this study was to investigate how a lifestyle intervention programme influences psychiatric and psychosocial factors among persons with psychiatric disabilities.Background. Persons with psychiatric disabilities often suffer from a simultaneous physical health problem, where circulatory disorder, hyperlipideamia, digestive disease, diabetes mellitus and obesity are prevalent. Studies have also shown a relationship between physical activity and mental health. But few randomised controlled trails have been aimed specifically at lifestyle interventions and their effect on psychiatric health and quality of life among persons with psychiatric disabilities.Design. A cluster randomised controlled trail.Methods. Forty-one persons with a DSM-IV diagnosis in eight supported housing facilities and two housing support programmes and their carers were on cluster level randomly assigned to a 12-month health intervention programme in the form of study circles with diet sessions and physical activities or a control programme. The changes in the mean of quality of life, level of functioning, psychiatric symptoms and sense of coherence was investigated and its relationship to physical health and attendance.Results. A significant increase in the sense of coherence was seen in both programmes but also significant improvements in the intervention group compared to controls at the follow-up.Conclusions. Structured activities in the form of lifestyle intervention programmes with a sufficient level of challenge that encourage persons with psychiatric disabilities to participate in activities in a social context may contribute to a significant increase in the sense of coherence.Relevance to clinical practice. Improving physical health with lifestyle programmes in the form of study circles and when involving their cares will in addition to increased physical health end in improved sense of coherence.

AB  - There is a paucity of literature on direct treatment outcomes for impoverished minority populations. The current study supports the feasibility of successfully treating women for depressive symptoms in community settings where they typically seek care, adding to the small but growing direct knowledge base in this area. The sample of the 2-site study consisted of 91 women seeking treatment for depressive complaints at a homeless shelter program and a municipal hospital psychiatric clinic for Latino patients. Participants were randomly assigned to either a 16-week cognitive-behavioral group or a 16-week supportive/exploratory group for depression. Best-practice features with this population were integrated throughout. Findings showed that both treatment conditions were equally effective in decreasing depressive symptoms (BDI, CES-D) up to 4 months after treatment termination. These changes were paralleled by improvements in self-reported physical health (Duke Physical Profile). No significant differences between treatment conditions were found. Directives for next steps in the current research agenda are offered in efforts to broaden the direct evidence base for treating vulnerable urban women at high risk for depression and other forms of mental illness.

AB  - In a randomized trial of a group intervention for co-occurring substance abuse and traumatic stress disorders "Trauma Adaptive Recovery Group Education and Therapy" (TARGET) was compared to trauma-sensitive usual care (TSU) with 213 clients in three adult outpatient clinics. improvement at 6- and 12-month assessments occurred across conditions. TARGET was superior to TSU in maintaining sobriety self-efficacy. However, ethnic differences emerged. White TARGET participants reported more improvement than non-White participants on post-traumatic cognitions, and fewer non-White men reported relapses in TSU than in TARGET. TARGET appears to enhance sustained sobriety, but may require culturally specific adaptations.

AB  - Mental illness stigma has detrimental effects on health and wellbeing. Approaches to address stigma in racialized populations in Western nations need to emphasize inclusivity, social justice, and sociocultural intersectionality of determinants of health. The current paper evaluates three intervention approaches to reduce stigma of mental illness among Asian men in Toronto, Canada. Participants received one of four group interventions: psychoeducation, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Contact-based Empowerment Education (CEE), and a combination of ACT+CEE. Self-report measures on stigma (CAMI, ISMI) and social change (SJS) were administered before and after the intervention. A total of 535 Asian men completed the interventions. Overall analyses found that all intervention approaches were successful in reducing stigma and promoting social change. Subscale differences suggest that CEE may be more broadly effective in reducing mental illness stigmatizing attitudes while ACT may be more specifically effective in reducing internalized stigma. More work needs to be done to elucidate mechanisms that contribute to socioculturally-informed mental illness stigma interventions for racialized communities and traditionally marginalized populations.

AB  - In many clinical settings, there is a high comorbidity between substance use disorders, psychiatric disorders, and traumatic stress. Novel therapies are needed to address these co-occurring issues efficiently. The aim of the present study was to conduct a pragmatic randomized controlled trial comparing Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE) to group Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and treatment-as-usual (TAU) for previously homeless men residing in a therapeutic community. Men with co-occurring substance use and psychiatric disorders, as well as extensive trauma histories, were randomly assigned to 10 weeks of group treatment with MORE (n = 64), CBT (n = 64), or TAU (n = 52). Study findings indicated that from pre-to post-treatment MORE was associated with modest yet significantly greater improvements in substance craving, post-traumatic stress, and negative affect than CBT, and greater improvements in post-traumatic stress and positive affect than TAU. A significant indirect effect of MORE on decreasing craving and post-traumatic stress by increasing dispositional mindfulness was observed, suggesting that MORE may target these issues via enhancing mindful awareness in everyday life. This pragmatic trial represents the first head-to-head comparison of MORE against an empirically-supported treatment for co-occurring disorders. Results suggest that MORE, as an integrative therapy designed to bolster self-regulatory capacity, may hold promise as a treatment for intersecting clinical conditions.

AB  - Objective: Integrated treatment services are the gold stan-dard for addressing co-occurring mental and substance use disorders, yet they are not readily available. The Network for the Improvement of Addiction Treatment (NIATx) was hypothesized to be an effective strategy to implement and sustain integrated mental health and substance use care in addiction treatment programs. This study examined sustainment of integrated services for up to 2 years after the active implementation phase. Methods: The effectiveness of NIATx strategies to imple-ment and sustain integrated services was evaluated by using a cluster-randomized, waitlist control group design. Forty-nine addiction treatment organizations were randomly assigned to either NIATx1 (active implementation strategy) or NIATx2 (waitlist control). The Dual Diagnosis Capability in Addiction Treatment Index was used to evaluate organi-zations' capability to provide integrated care. The NIATx Stages of Implementation Completion scale was used to assess participation in and adherence to the NIATx imple-mentation process. Linear mixed-effects modeling was used to evaluate changes from baseline to end of the sus-tainment period. Results: Both cohorts sustained their capability to provide integrated treatment services. Both groups achieved suc-cessful implementation and sustained integrated services to a similar degree, regardless of sustainment year. Sustain-ment did not vary as a function of NIATx adherence. Conclusions: The delivery of integrated treatment services was sustained for 2 years after receipt of active implemen-tation support. Future research should consider how contextual factors may predict, mediate, and moderate sus-tainment outcomes.

AB  - Due to the growing evidence base supporting the hypothesis of common processes across different mental health problems, transdiagnostic interventions are receiving increased research attention. Transdiagnostic approaches have the potential to produce better outcomes, to reduce waiting times and to increase cost-effectiveness in stretched mental health services. Research into transdiagnostic cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) in group format has demonstrated positive results in participants with anxiety disorders, with some studies extending the inclusion criteria to secondary and comorbid symptoms. This study evaluates a transdiagnostic CBT-based intervention, delivered by a secondary-care mental health team and includes participants with a range of diagnoses typical of this population. The real-world setting and lack of exclusion criteria based upon diagnosis provides an ecologically valid evaluation of a transdiagnostic CBT-based intervention. The results suggest that the intervention was associated with reductions in self-reported symptomatology and improvements in social functioning of individuals who attended in a secondary-care mental health service.

AB  - In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of multi-family therapy at reducing the addiction severity and at improving the psychological and family dynamics of opiate addicts receiving methadone treatment at a public treatment center. The study compares multi-family therapy with a reflecting team (MFT-RT) and a standard treatment following a methadone maintenance treatment program. The results show that multi-family therapy with a reflecting team effectively reduces the addiction severity in several of the areas evaluated and noted that this effect is superior to standard treatment. The psychotherapy patients showed improvement in the areas of employment and social support; their drug use diminished and their psychiatric condition improved. At the same time, they needed a lower daily dose of methadone. In addition, the group undergoing standard treatment showed a noteworthy deterioration in their medical condition. Both groups showed a significant increase in their alcohol use. When applied to family treatments, the systemic-constructivist approach by the reflecting team offers combined techniques that can help improve care for the families of patients with addiction problems.

AB  - Effectiveness of an integrated trauma-informed approach to treating women with co-occurring disorders and histories of trauma was evaluated. Baseline and 12-month assessments were completed by 136 intervention-and 177 comparison-group women. The intervention group received Seeking Safety, a trauma-specific group treatment focusing on safety and coping skills, in the context of integrated substance abuse and mental health services. The comparison group received similar services but not trauma-specific group treatment. Intervention women showed significantly better treatment retention over three months and greater improvement on post-traumatic stress symptoms and coping skills. On most outcomes, those who completed treatment improved more than those who discontinued. Improvements on symptoms of distress and drug problem severity were partially mediated by gains in coping skills.

AB  - Higher Education is a period of transition. Students try out identities, develop skills, and explore their shifting sense-of-self. Recent evidence suggests an increase in mental distress in this population, pressurising in-house support schemes. Therapeutic songwriting is a music therapy technique, which can reduce mental distress and improve social engagement in a range of clinical populations; yet it is also an accessible art form, possibly an ideal vehicle for supporting students in distress. This paper examines whether participation in a weekly songwriting program could make a suitable RCT to support wellbeing within the HE environment. We used a methodologically rigorous pre-registered parallel wait-list pilot RCT design. Trial registration: ISRCTN11180007. Participants self-identifying as stressed, anxious, or depressed, or with a pre-existing mental health condition, were randomly allocated to the experimental group (5 weeks, songwriting) (n = 6) or to the wait-list control group (5 weeks, no intervention) (n = 6). Measures were taken at baseline and at the start (Time 1) and end (Time 2) of the intervention. Measures included: depression and anxiety scales, social identification, loneliness, and friendship. Change scores were calculated and a Mann–Whitney U revealed that depression levels in songwriters (Mdn = -1.0) differed significantly from wait-list controls (Mdn = 8.5) at T2, U = 5.00, z = -2.085, p < 0.041, r = 2.66. Songwriters’ levels of social connection (Mdn = 2.50) also differed significantly from wait-list controls (Mdn = 3.00) at T2 U = 3.00, z = -2.441, p < 0.015, r = 0.524. There were no other significant differences between control and intervention groups. A therapeutic songwriting intervention may have individual and group level benefits for a student population, alongside possible institutional benefits in student retention. Effects may be seen within depression and social connection metrics, and future RCTs should consider expanding measures for self-efficacy, social isolation, and wellbeing. This type of program illustrates a space for cost-effective, group, face to face additions institutional mental health support provision as part of a package of support for students.

AB  - Background: Following traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries, maximising community participation leads to better physical and mental health outcomes. Objectives: To determine the effectiveness and health system resource use of a group intervention (CarFreeMe TI) on community participation in people with complex trauma injuries. Method: Randomised crossover trial of 54 participants, recruited from rehabilitation services in Adelaide, Australia. Inclusion criteria is a trauma injury, unable to return to full driving, aged over 18 years of age, adequate cognition/behavioural/communication abilities to participate in sessions and mobile. Exclusion criterion is living in setting where alternative transport is provided. Participants will be randomly assigned on a 1:1 allocation basis, to receiving Phase 1 CarFreeMe TI-group-based intervention or Phase 2 information related to transport options. Then, crossover to Phase 1 or 2 will occur. Primary outcome measure is community participation using a Global Positioning System. Secondary outcome measures include Community Mobility Self-efficacy Scale; CarFreeMe TI Transport Questionnaire, AQOL, EQ-5D-5L; Carer's Community Mobility Self-efficacy Scale and Modified Carer Strain Index for carers of participants. Outcome assessors will be blinded to group allocation. All analyses will be on an intention to treat basis with difference in community participation between the groups determined via a GLM ANOVA and the significance between groups on other measures using independent sample t-tests. It is hypothesised that the community mobility intervention (CarFreeMeTI) will result in increased community participation. Discussion: The results will provide proof of concept information on the feasibility and inform allocation of resources for people with complex trauma injuries.

Men in substance use treatment are more likely to perpetrate IPA than men from the general population. Despite this, referral pathways are lacking for this group. This trial will assess the feasibility of conducting an evaluation trial of a tailored integrated intervention to address substance use and IPA perpetration to men in substance use treatment. Methods/design: ADVANCE is a multicentre, parallel-group individually randomised controlled feasibility trial, with a nested formative evaluation, comparing an integrated intervention to reduce IPA + substance use treatment as usual (TAU) to TAU only. One hundred and eight men who have perpetrated IPA in the past 12 months from community substance use treatment in London, the West Midlands, and the South West will be recruited. ADVANCE is a manualised intervention comprising 2–4 individual sessions (2 compulsory) with a keyworker to set goals, develop a personal safety plan and increase motivation and readiness, followed by a 12-session weekly group intervention delivered in substance use services. Men will be randomly allocated (ratio 1:1) to receive the ADVANCE intervention + TAU or TAU only. Men's female (ex) partners will be invited to provide outcome data and offered support from integrated safety services (ISS). Regular case management meetings between substance use and ISS will manage risk. Outcome measures will be obtained at the end of the intervention (approximately 4 months post-randomisation) for all male and female participants. The main objective of this feasibility trial is to estimate parameters required for planning a definitive trial including rates of consent, recruitment, and follow-up by site and group allocation. Nested formative evaluation including focus groups and in-depth interviews will explore the intervention's acceptability to participants, group facilitators, keyworkers and ISS workers. Secondary outcomes include substance use, IPA, mental health, self-management, health and social care service use, criminal justice contacts, and quality of life. Discussion: Findings from this feasibility trial will inform the design of a multicentre randomised controlled trial evaluating the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the ADVANCE intervention for reducing IPA and improving the well-being of female (ex)partners.

AB  - Context: Chronically homeless adults with severe mental illness are heavy users of costly inpatient and emergency psychiatric services. Full-service partnerships (FSPs) provide housing and engage clients in treatment. Objective: To examine changes in recovery outcomes, mental health service use and costs, and quality of life associated with participation in FSPs. Design: A quasi-experimental, difference-in-difference design with a propensity score matched control group was used to compare mental health service use and costs of FSP with public mental health services. Recovery outcomes were compared before and after services use, and quality of life was compared cross-sectionally. Setting: San Diego County, California, from October 2005 through June 2008. Participants: Two hundred nine FSP clients and 154 clients receiving public mental health services. Main Outcome Measures: Recovery outcomes (housing, financial support, and employment), mental health service use (use of outpatient, inpatient, emergency, and justice system services), and mental health services and housing costs from the perspective of the public mental health system. Results: Among FSP participants, the mean number of days spent homeless per year declined 129 days from 191 to 62 days; the probability of receiving inpatient, emergency, and justice system services declined by 14, 32, and 17 percentage points, respectively; and outpatient mental health visits increased by 78 visits (P<.001 each). Outpatient costs increased by $9180; inpatient costs declined by $6882; emergency service costs declined by $1721; jail mental health services costs declined by $1641; and housing costs increased by $3180 (P<.003 each). Quality of life was greater among FSP clients than among homeless clients receiving services in outpatient programs. Conclusions: Participation in an FSP was associated with substantial increases in outpatient services and days spent in housing. Reductions in costs of inpatient/emergency and justice system services offset 82% of the cost of the FSP.

AB  - Objective: California's full-service partnerships (FSPs) provide a combination of subsidized permanent housing and multidisciplinary team based services with a focus on rehabilitation and recovery. The goal of the study was to examine whether participation in FSPs is associated with changes in health service use and costs compared with usual care. Methods: A quasi-experimental, pre-post, intent-to-treat design with a propensity score matched contemporaneous control group was used to compare health service use and costs among 10,231 FSP clients and 10,231 matched clients with serious mental illness who were receiving public mental health services in California from January 1, 2004, through June 30, 2010. Results: Among FSP participants, the mean annual number of mental health outpatient visits increased by 55.5, and annual mental health costs increased by $11,725 relative to the matched control group. Total service costs increased by $12,056. Conclusions: Participation in an FSP was associated with increases in outpatient visits and their associated costs. As supportive housing programs are implemented nationally and on a large scale, these programs will likely need to be more effectively designed and targeted in order to achieve reductions in costly inpatient services.

AB  - Objective: Severe mental disorders (SMD), as Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder, affects approximately 2.5-3% of the general adult population (OMS 2000). They are characterised by clinical severity, disability and dependency (Slade et al. 1997), higher morbidity and mortality (Newcomer et al. 2007). Psychosocial interventions improve SMD outcome but the fragmentation of mental health services is a handicap for the continuity of the treatment. Thus our objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of an Integrated Care Program for SMD, that should ensure a better outcome for these patients and their families and an improvement in the use of health system budgets. Method(s): 40 outpatients from Area 5 in Valencia (Spain), with Schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder or Schizoaffective disorder diagnosis (DSM IV-TR) were randomly included in a control or an intervention group. Age range comprised 19-58 years old (Mean age = 38.21) and GAF\45. The 20 subjects intervention group consisted on an individualised care program (group or individual CBT, family therapy and psychoeducation on healthy habits, social or practitioner intervention). Coordination between care givers (psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses, social worker and practitioners) and follow up of the patient were permanent, ensuring the program fulfilling and detecting any adverse event. Clinical, functional and physical evaluations were performed to every subject and their families before the intervention, after it and 3 months later. chi2, T-tests and correlation analysis were performed. Result(s): Intervention group showed a clinical and functional significant improvement in comparison to the control group (P<0.05). Family coping strategies improved in the intervention group (P<0.05). Intervention group subjects and families expressed more satisfaction with the mental health service. Conclusion(s): Thus the effectiveness of the Intervention Care program was demonstrated.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate alcohol abstinence in alcoholics and their family relationships after a year of treatment. The 100 alcoholics recruited were divided into two groups: ALC, where treatment consisted of clinical control and meetings of with the family consulting together with their relatives at the Centre for Study and Treatment of Alcoholism and CAT, where treatment consisted of clinical control and weekly attendance together with their relatives at Alcoholics-in-Treatment-Clubs (CAT). The clinical condition of the sample was assessed by laboratory data. The subjects were given an MQ-Quant questionnaire, based on an artificial neural network (ANN) model, which analyses the communicative fatigue of their interactions. The same examination was applied after 1 year excluding patients relapsed and their relatives. Psycho-medical-social treatment by the attendance of alcoholics and their families into a Multifamily Community induces alcohol abstinence of about 79%. This percentage is greater than psycho-medical treatment carried out in the Centre of Alcoholism for ALC group (50%). We observed a significant difference between the communicative fatigue of the ALC group compared to the CAT group.

AB  - Background: Cognitive deficits are a distinct feature among people at ultra‐high risk (UHR) for psychosis and pose a barrier to functional recovery. Insufficient evidence exists on how to ameliorate these cognitive deficits in patients at UHR for psychosis and hence improve daily living and quality of life. The aim of the trial is to investigate whether cognitive remediation can improve cognitive and psychosocial function in patients at UHR for psychosis. Methods: The FOCUS trial (Function and Overall Cognition in Ultra‐high risk States) is a randomised, parallel group, observer‐blinded clinical trial enrolling 126 patients meeting the standardised criteria of being at UHR for psychosis. Patients are recruited from psychiatric in‐ and outpatient facilities in the Copenhagen catchment area. Patients are randomised to one of the two treatment arms: cognitive remediation plus standard treatment versus standard treatment. The cognitive remediation consists of 24 weekly group‐based and manualised sessions targeting neurocognition and social cognition. In addition to the group sessions, the patients will be offered 12 individual sessions aiming at maximising the transfer of the effects of the cognitive training to their everyday lives. Follow‐up assessments will be conducted at 6 and 12 months after randomisation. The primary outcome is the composite score on the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia at cessation of treatment after 6 months. Secondary outcomes are social and daily functioning, psychosis‐like symptoms, negative symptomatology, and depressive symptomatology as measured with the Personal and Social Performance Scale, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale‐Expanded Version, Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms, and the Montgomery‐Åsberg Depression Rating Scale. Discussion: This is the first trial to evaluate the effects of neurocognitive and social cognitive remediation in UHR patients. The FOCUS trial results will provide evidence on the effect of targeted and comprehensive cognitive rehabilitation on cognition, daily living, and symptomatology as well as long‐term outcome in preventing transition to psychosis in UHR patients.

AB  - Due to the symptom diversity and pervasive function impairments (e.g. in perception, cognition, language, affect, behavior, daily and social functioning and sense of self), recurrent relapses, elevated disability, high rates of (co)morbidity, heightened premature mortality and high burden of care of psychotic disorders, psychosocial interventions are part of patients' standard care. There is growing evidence on the relevance of self-efficacy for well-being and functioning among these patients, but specific coping with stress self-efficacy has rarely been investigated. This study explored the outcomes of an intervention for the improvement of coping resources based on training in coping skills and coping with stress self-efficacy. Fourteen adult volunteers with schizophrenia (n = 12) or schizoaffective disorder (n = 2) were matched in clinical and sociodemographic characteristics and randomly assigned to the study groups. The intervention group received the training—with 15 twice per week sessions (8 weeks)—along with their pharmacological therapy; the control group received their prescribed drug therapy. Participants completed self-reports on coping with stress self-efficacy, perceived successful daily functioning based on coping skills and clinical status (Expanded Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale). Trained patients showed a significant increase in coping with stress self-efficacy and reported greater successful functioning status, and significant improvements in their clinical status were also observed. All these enhancements remained at 3-month and 6-month follow-ups. The intervention condition interacted with coping with stress self-efficacy and perceived coping functioning in explaining improvements in clinical status: in the treatment group, greater coping with stress self-efficacy translated into enhanced daily functioning, and this improvement predicted better clinical status. These findings stress the relevance of promoting coping resources in psychotic disorders and provide preliminary evidence for the potential benefits of coping with stress self-efficacy.

AB  - Mental health problems are common among prison inmates. Music therapy has been shown to reduce mental health problems. It may also be beneficial in the rehabilitation of prisoners, but rigorous outcome research is lacking. We compared group music therapy with standard care for prisoners in a pilot randomised controlled trial that started with the establishment of music therapy services in a prison near Bergen in 2008. In all, 113 prisoners agreed to participate. Anxiety (STAI-State [State-Trait Anxiety Inventory], STAI-Trait), depression (HADS-D [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale]), and social relationships (Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire [Q-LES-Q]) were assessed at baseline; every 2 weeks in the experimental group; after 1, 3, and 6 months in the control group; and at release. No restrictions were placed on the frequency, duration, or contents of music therapy. Duration of stay in the institution was short (62% stayed less than 1 month). Only a minority reached clinical cutoffs for anxiety and depression at baseline. Between-group analyses of effects were not possible. Music therapy was well accepted and attractive among the prisoners. Post hoc analysis of within-group changes suggested a reduction of state anxiety after 2 weeks of music therapy (d = 0.33, p = .025). Short sentences and low baseline levels of psychological disturbance impeded the examination of effects in this study. Recommendations for planning future studies are given, concerning the careful choice of participants, interventions and settings, comparison condition and design aspects, choice of outcomes, and integration of research approaches. Thus, the present study has important implications for future studies evaluating interventions for improving prisoners' mental health. Trial registration: ISRCTN22518605.

AB  - In order to analyse efficacy, effectiveness and efficiency of several depression secondary prevention programs, three group interventions were developed in Primary Care Centres: cognitive‐behavioral therapy, promotion of one's coping resources therapy (just paying attention to abilities, without training) and social support. The sample was composed by 60 people with from‐mild‐to‐moderate depressive symptoms, who were randomly assigned either to any of the treatments or to a control group (waiting list). Psychopathology, quality of life and attendance to mental health services variables were assessed at pretest, posttest and two follow‐up evaluations, 6 and 12 months afterwards. OUTCOMES: both therapies had more efficacy, effectiveness and efficiency compared to the social support group, and this one was better than the waiting list.

AB  - Background: This study examines the effectiveness of long-term outpatient psychodynamic group psychotherapy for individuals with bipolar disorder who may have psychiatric comorbidity. Method: The Integrative Outpatient Model (IOM) includes psychoeducation regarding illness, illness management, and exploration of dynamic and interpersonal issues. Results: At one-year follow up, group members had significantly less depressive symptomatology and were less likely to be in a mood episode, compared to controls. There were no between-group differences in manic symptoms or global assessments of functioning. For group-treated patients, the number of days well per week improved significantly; there were no significant improvements in the control group. Conclusions: This pilot study indicates that psychodynamic group psychotherapy is feasible as a component of treatment for bipolar disorder diagnoses. The results suggest benefits on depressive, but not manic symptoms. The 73% retention rate suggests that further study of this treatment is warranted, especially in the cases of patients for whom pharmacotherapy alone is not sufficient.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Despite advances in suicide prevention implemented throughout the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) including the hiring of Suicide Prevention Coordinators (SPCs) at every VA hospital, enhanced monitoring, and the availability of 24-hour crisis hotline services, suicide by veterans remains a critical problem affecting 20 veterans daily. Few empirically based treatment strategies for suicide prevention for postdeployment military personnel exist. This study aimed to test whether dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), one of the few psychosocial treatments with proven efficacy in diminishing suicidal behavior in individuals with personality disorder, can be applied to veterans irrespective of personality diagnosis., METHODS: From January 2010 to December 2014, 91 nonpsychotic veterans at high risk for suicide (61 men, 30 women) were randomly assigned to a 6-month treatment trial at a veterans' medical center comparing standard DBT to treatment as usual (TAU) and followed for 6 months after trial completion. Primary outcome was suicide attempts, measured with the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale, and secondary outcomes were suicide ideation, depression, hopelessness, and anxiety. There were no exclusions pertaining to substance abuse, homelessness, or medical comorbidity., RESULTS: Both DBT and TAU resulted in improvements in suicidal ideation, depression, and anxiety during the course of the 6-month treatment trial that did not differ between treatment arms. Survival analyses for suicide attempts and hospitalizations did not differ between treatment arms. However, DBT subjects utilized significantly more individual mental health services than TAU subjects (28.5 +/- 19.6 vs 14.7 +/- 10.9, F1,77 = 11.60, P = .001)., CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to examine 6-month DBT in a mostly male, veteran population. Increased mental health treatment service delivery, which included enhanced monitoring, outreach, and availability of a designated SPC, did not yield statistically significant differences in outcome for veterans at risk for suicide in TAU as compared to the DBT treatment arm. However, both treatments had difficulty with initial engagement post-hospitalization. Future studies examining possible sex differences and strategies to boost retention in difficult-to-engage, homeless, and substance-abusing populations are indicated., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02462694. © Copyright 2016 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

AB  - Personal construct theory (PCP) may provide a way for people who are violent and have schizophrenia to understand and modify their behavior. The ability to reconstrue personal relationships may lead to greater acceptance of perceived or real stresses and increased tolerance. A year-long pilot study tested the feasibility of PCP- oriented psychotherapy among long-term male residents with schizophrenia in a hospital for mentally ill offenders, all of whom had committed violent acts. A matched group completed the same instruments, but did not receive group psychotherapy. Six of the 8 Ss from the index group completed the therapy, but instrument compliance varied. An individual case report is offered, demonstrating the changes in construing that occurred over the year. These included elaboration accompanied by changes in mood, and the formation of a more appropriate construct system for managing personal relationships. The model for therapy is feasible within a secure environment, although there are ethical issues. The evaluation of outcome requires substantial modification, and the issue of S cooperation needs further attention. The pilot does, however, suggest that such work is then worth more substantial study, including randomization between treatment and non-treatment groups.

AB  - ObjectiveSocial Cognition and Interaction Training (SCIT) has demonstrated effectiveness in improving social cognition and functioning of people with schizophrenia. This pilot study examines the acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness of SCIT with individuals who have schizophrenia-spectrum disorders and are receiving care through a public mental health service. MethodIn a pragmatic randomized waitlist controlled trial, 36 participants (aged 19-55years) with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder were randomly allocated to SCIT or treatment as usual (TAU). Measures of theory of mind, emotion perception, attributional bias, social skills, quality of life, life skills, depression, anxiety, and stress were administered pre- and post-intervention with follow-up conducted 4months later. All wait-list controls subsequently received the intervention and a secondary within-group analysis was conducted including these participants. ResultsWhile no significant differences were found between groups on any outcomes, there was strong engagement with the SCIT intervention. Of the 21 participants in the intervention group, the completion rate was 85.71% with a median attendance rate of 17 sessions. Within subject analyses of SCIT participants over time showed significant improvements in quality of life, emotion recognition, social skills, and a trend towards better life skills from pre- to post-intervention. These gains were sustained at the 4-month follow-up time. Conclusions and implications for practiceAlthough this study showed limited benefits in outcomes associated with SCIT compared with TAU, it demonstrated the acceptability of SCIT to participants in a real world public health setting shown by high retention, attendance, and positive feedback. This pilot shows SCIT can be implemented in routine clinical practice and lays the foundation for a larger pragmatic study.

AB  - Adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have low employment rates; even those who are employed have low wages and limited hours. This study evaluated the effectiveness of the Job-Based Social Skills (JOBSS) curriculum, a manualized, 15-week, group-delivered intervention for adults with ASD. The intervention aimed to increase social-pragmatic skills necessary to obtain and maintain employment. Twenty-two adults were randomly assigned to either JOBSS intervention or wait-list control groups. Results showed significant improvement in social cognition, as reported by caregivers, among JOBSS group participants compared to wait-list control participants. Forty-five percent of intervention participants gained employment in the six months following participation. This curriculum has potential to improve social skills of adults with ASD, thereby increasing successful employment.

AB  - Objective: A randomized controlled study design was used to compare the effectiveness of intensive outpatient treatment with individual outpatient counseling and a combination of individual and group outpatient counseling for cocaine-dependent patients. Methods: Volunteers for this study were recruited from among first admissions to an inner-city, public-sector outpatient substance abuse clinic. In-treatment, end-of-treatment, and nine-month follow-up assessments were compared for participants randomly assigned for 12 weeks to one of three treatment modalities-weekly individual outpatient counseling, weekly individual counseling plus one weekly group session, or a newly designed intensive group treatment program consisting of three hours of group treatment three days a week. Results and conclusions: Patients who completed the intensive program showed significant improvement from intake to end-of-treatment scores on the Addiction Severity Index, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Symptom Checklist. At nine-month follow-up, patients who had remained in treatment longer had fewer drug problems, a smaller proportion of positive urine drug screening tests, a better employment status, and fewer psychological problems compared with patients who left treatment earlier. Patients who remained in treatment were also more likely to be attending self-help meetings, continuing in outpatient treatment, or attending school. However, for the 447 patients randomly assigned to the three conditions, there were no significant differences between treatment modalities on any of the variables at nine-month follow-up. The new intensive treatment program was not shown to be superior to more traditional treatment programs.

AB  - Cognitive Behavioral Social Skills Training (CBSST) is a 24-session weekly group therapy intervention to improve functioning in people with schizophrenia. In our prior randomized clinical trial comparing treatment as usual (TAU) with TAU plus group CBSST (Granholm, E., McQuaid, J.R., McClure, F.S., Auslander, L., Perivoliotis, D., Pedrelli, P., Patterson, T., Jeste, D.V., 2005. A randomized controlled trial of cognitive behavioral social skills training for middle-aged and older outpatients with chronic schizophrenia. Am. J. Psychiatry 162, 520-529.), participants with schizophrenia in CBSST showed significantly better functional outcome than participants in TAU. The present study was a secondary analysis of neuropsychological predictors of functional outcome in our prior CBSST trial. We examined (1) whether neuropsychological impairment at baseline moderated functional outcome in CBSST relative to TAU, and (2) whether improvement in neuropsychological abilities mediated improvement in functional outcome in CBSST. Attention, verbal learning/memory, speed of processing, and executive functions were assessed at baseline, end of treatment, and 12-month follow-up. Greater severity of neuropsychological impairment at baseline predicted poorer functional outcome for both treatment groups (nonspecific predictor), but the interaction between severity of neuropsychological impairment and treatment group was not significant (no moderation). Effect sizes for the difference between treatment groups on functional outcome measures at 12-month follow-up were similar for participants with relatively mild (d=.44-.64) and severe (d=.29-.60) neuropsychological impairment. Results also did not support the hypothesis that improvement in neuropsychological abilities mediated improvement in functioning in CBSST. Adding CBSST to standard pharmacologic care, therefore, improved functioning relative to standard care alone, even for participants with severe neuropsychological impairment, and this improvement in functioning was not related to improvement in neuropsychological abilities in CBSST.

AB  - Background: We previously published findings from our clinical trial comparing treatment outcomes for substance-dependent veterans with co-occurring depression who received Integrated Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (ICBT) or Twelve-Step Facilitation (TSF) Therapy. Objectives: This study is a secondary analysis that examined whether neuropsychological functioning at baseline moderated substance use and depression outcomes in ICBT relative to TSF. Methods: This study was a randomized clinical trial in which 164 veterans with major depressive disorder and comorbid alcohol, cannabinol, and//or stimulant dependence were randomly assigned to either ICBT or TSF group therapy. A comprehensive neuropsychological test battery was administered at baseline. Results: Contrary to our hypothesis, participants with poor neuropsychological functioning had better substance use outcome in ICBT than in TSF, whereas participants with good neuropsychological functioning had comparable substance use outcomes in TSF and ICBT by 18-month follow-up. Depression outcomes, in contrast, were not moderated by neuropsychological functioning by 18-month follow-up. Conclusions and Scientific Significance: The substance use outcomes may suggest that substance-dependent depressed adults with poorer neuropsychological functioning should be offered ICBT over TSF. These individuals may be less able to develop and use novel coping skills for managing substance use and depressive symptoms on their own without formal structured training in cognitive and behavioral skills provided in ICBT.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine whether cognitive behavioral social skills training (CBSST) is an effective psychosocial intervention to improve functioning in older consumers with schizophrenia, and whether defeatist performance attitudes are associated with change in functioning in CBSST. DESIGN: An 18‐month, single‐blind, randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Outpatient clinic at a university‐affiliated Veterans Affairs hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Veteran and nonveteran consumers with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (N = 79) age 45‐78. INTERVENTIONS: CBSST was a 36‐session, weekly group therapy that combined cognitive behavior therapy with social skills training and problem solving training to improve functioning. The comparison intervention, goal‐focused supportive contact (GFSC), was supportive group therapy focused on achieving functioning goals. MEASUREMENTS: Blind raters assessed functioning (primary outcome: Independent Living Skills Survey), CBSST skill mastery, positive and negative symptoms, depression, anxiety, defeatist attitudes, self‐esteem, and life satisfaction. RESULTS: Functioning trajectories over time were significantly more positive in CBSST than in GFSC, especially for participants with more severe defeatist performance attitudes. Greater improvement in defeatist attitudes was also associated with better functioning in CBSST, but not GFSC. Both treatments showed comparable significant improvements in amotivation, depression, anxiety, positive self‐esteem, and life satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: CBSST is an effective treatment to improve functioning in older consumers with schizophrenia, and both CBSST and other supportive goal‐focused interventions can reduce symptom distress, increase motivation and self esteem, and improve life satisfaction. Participants with more severe defeatist performance attitudes may benefit most from cognitive behavioral interventions that target functioning.

AB  - Objective: Identifying treatments to improve functioning and reduce negative symptoms in consumers with schizophrenia is of high public health significance. Method: In this randomized clinical trial, participants with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (N = 149) were randomly assigned to cognitive behavioral social skills training (CBSST) or an active goal‐focused supportive contact (GFSC) control condition. CBSST combined cognitive behavior therapy with social skills training and problemsolving training to improve functioning and negative symptoms. GFSC was weekly supportive group therapy focused on setting and achieving functioning goals. Blind raters assessed functioning (primary outcome: Independent Living Skills Survey [ILSS]), CBSST skill knowledge, positive and negative symptoms, depression, and defeatist performance attitudes. Results: In mixed‐effects regression models in intent‐to‐treat analyses, CBSST skill knowledge, functioning, amotivation/asociality negative symptoms, and defeatist performance attitudes improved significantly more in CBSST relative to GFSC. In both treatment groups, comparable improvements were also found for positive symptoms and a performance‐based measure of social competence. Conclusions: The results suggest CBSST is an effective treatment to improve functioning and experiential negative symptoms in consumers with schizophrenia, and both CBSST and supportive group therapy actively focused on setting and achieving functioning goals can improve social competence and reduce positive symptoms.

AB  - Deliberate self-harm (DSH) is a clinically important behavior commonly associated with borderline personality disorder (BPD). Despite the clinical relevance and associated negative consequences of this behavior, however, there are few empirically supported treatments for DSH among individuals with BPD, and those that exist are difficult to implement in many clinical settings (due to their duration and intensity). To address this limitation, Gratz and Gunderson (2006) examined the efficacy of a 14-week, adjunctive emotion regulation group therapy (ERGT) for DSH among women with BPD. Although the results of this initial trial were promising (indicating positive effects of this treatment on DSH, emotion dysregulation, experiential avoidance, and psychiatric symptoms), they require replication and extension. Thus, the purpose of this study was to further develop this ERGT by examining its utility across other settings, a more diverse group of patients, a wider range of outcomes, and group leaders other than the principal investigator. Twenty-three women received this ERGT in addition to their ongoing treatment in the community. Self-report and interview-based measures of DSH and other self-destructive behaviors, psychiatric symptoms, adaptive functioning (including social and vocational impairment and quality of life), and the proposed mechanisms of change (emotion dysregulation and experiential avoidance) were administered pre- and posttreatment. Results indicate significant changes over time (accompanied by large effect sizes) on all outcome measures except quality of life and self-destructive behaviors (although the latter was a large-sized effect). Further, 55% of participants reported abstinence from DSH during the last two months of the group. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Despite evidence for the efficacy of several treatments for deliberate self-harm (DSH) within borderline personality disorder (BPD), predictors of response to these treatments remain unknown. This study examined baseline demographic, clinical, and diagnostic predictors of treatment response to an adjunctive emotion regulation group therapy (ERGT) for DSH among women with BPD. A recent RCT provided evidence for the efficacy of this ERGT (relative to a treatment-as-usual only waitlist condition). Participants in this study include the full intent-to-treat sample who began ERGT (across treatment and waitlist conditions; n = 51). Baseline diagnostic and clinical data were collected at the initial assessment, and outcome measures of DSH and self-destructive behaviors, emotion dysregulation/avoidance, and BPD symptoms (among others) were administered at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 3- and 9-months posttreatment. Notably, both demographic variables and characteristics of participants' ongoing therapy in the community had minimal impact on treatment response. However, several indicators of greater severity in domains relevant to this ERGT (i.e., baseline emotion dysregulation and BPD criteria, lifetime and recent DSH, and past-year hospitalization and suicide attempts) predicted better responses during treatment and follow-up across the primary targets of treatment. Likewise, several co-occurring disorders (i.e., social phobia, panic disorder, and a cluster B personality disorder) predicted greater improvements in BPD symptoms during treatment or follow-up. Finally, although co-occurring generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and cluster A and C personality disorders were associated with poorer treatment response during follow-up, most of these effects reflected a lack of continued improvements during this period (vs. worsening of symptoms).

AB  - Objective: The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a lowcost, strengths‐based group intervention led jointly by peer counselors and professional counselors to foster recovery among adults with serious mental illnesses. Methods: Cohort 1 included development of materials and a feasibility pilot, with participants recruited from community mental health centers (CMHCs). Cohorts 2 and 3 included a small randomized controlled trial with participants recruited from members of a not‐for‐profit, integrated health plan. Cohorts 4 and 5 involved evaluation of the most appropriate length for the intervention with a pre‐post design that allowed intervention length to vary between 12 and 18 sessions; participants and peer leaders were recruited from two CMHCs (N=82). Results: Participants were very satisfied with the recoveryfocused group intervention, preferred a greater number of weekly sessions (17 or 18 sessions), and reported improved outcomes across multiple domains. Conclusions: Using peer‐developed materials and a combination of peer and professional counselors as group leaders is feasible to offer and valuable to participants. Outcomesmeasures suggest that the intervention has potential to facilitate recovery in multiple domains.

AB  - The model of group treatment presented combines interpersonal approaches with cognitive-behavioral strategies. it differs from traditional interpersonal treatment by adopting an initially directive therapeutic style with clearly defined limits and norms; introducing psychoeducational material on addictions, relapse prevention, and recovery; and by incrementally advancing a more exploratory and open-ended approach once sobriety and group cohesion have developed. Structuring the boundaries of the group and establishing behavioral limits for group members are essential to effective group treatment with personality disordered and chemically dependent male clients. Self constructs are maintained through feedback loops that require therapeutic interruption and analysis if clients are to benefit from or even remain in group treatment, increase in awareness of their interpersonal behavior, and fortify their commitment to recovery. Interventions focus on anger, group cohesion, dependency/counterdependency, and expanding schemata and strategies. 41 references

AB  - Background: This Stage II trial builds on a Stage I trial comparing the single-gender Women's Recovery Group (WRG) to mixed-gender Group Drug Counseling (GDC) that demonstrated preliminary support for the WRG in treating women with substance use disorders. The Stage II trial aims were to (1) investigate effectiveness of the WRG relative to GDC in a sample of women heterogeneous with respect to substance of abuse and co-occurring psychiatric disorders, and (2) demonstrate the feasibility of implementing WRG in an open-enrollment group format at two sites. Method: In this randomized clinical trial, participants were included if they were substance dependent and had used substances within the past 60 days (n = 158). Women were randomized to WRG (n = 52) or GDC (n = 48); men were assigned to GDC (n = 58). Substance use outcomes were assessed at months 1-6 and 9. Results: Women in both the WRG and GDC had reductions in mean number of substance use days during treatment (12.7 vs 13.7 day reductions for WRG and GDC, respectively) and 6 months post-treatment (10.3 vs 12.7 day reductions); however, there were no significant differences between groups. Conclusions: The WRG demonstrated comparable effectiveness to standard mixed-gender treatment (i.e., GDC) and is feasibly delivered in an open-group format typical of community treatment. It provides a manual-based group therapy with women-focused content that can be implemented in a variety of clinical settings for women who are heterogeneous with respect to their substance of abuse, other co-occurring psychiatric disorders, and life-stage.

AB  - Background: Transdiagnostic psychotherapies are designed to apply the same underlying treatment principles across a set of psychiatric disorders, without significant tailoring to specific diagnoses. Several transdiagnostic psychotherapy protocols have been developed recently, each of which has its own strengths and weaknesses. One promising treatment is Transdiagnostic Behaviour Therapy (TBT), in that it is one of the few transdiagnostic treatments to date shown to be effective in patients with depressive and anxiety disorders. However, TBT has only been investigated via individual psychotherapy. Aims: The present study investigated the effectiveness of a group protocol for TBT, compared with disorder-specific group psychotherapies, in a naturalistic setting. Method: 109 participants with various diagnoses of affective disorders completed either group TBT (n = 37) or a disorder-specific group psychotherapy (n = 72). Measures included assessments of psychiatric symptomatology and transdiagnostic impairment at baseline and post-treatment. Results: Overall, participants in the TBT group demonstrated significant improvements across all measures. When compared with disorder-specific groups, no statistical differences were observed between groups across symptoms; however, participants in the TBT group demonstrated roughly twice the treatment effect sizes in transdiagnostic impairment compared with participants in the disorder-specific groups. In addition, when participants from the most well-represented diagnosis and disorder-specific treatment (social anxiety disorder) were investigated separately, participants in the TBT group demonstrated significantly larger improvements in comorbid depressive symptoms than participants in the disorder-specific treatment. Conclusions: Pending replication and additional comparison studies, group TBT may provide an effective group treatment option for patients with affective disorders.

AB  - The Turó Primary Care Centre in Barcelona has started a programme of group therapy as a therapeutic intervention in women presenting anxiety-depressive disorder and/or stress situations. A nursing professional trained in mental health, group dynamics and seitai meditation has conducted the intervention. Once the initial sessions are completed, the intervention will be continued in a civic centre of the area. As a result of this experience, a decreased consumption of drugs as well as a decreased number in consultations, have been observed. A noticeable improvement in the quality of life of the group participants has also been noted.

AB  - We evaluated 3-month outcomes for reinforcement-based intensive outpatient treatment (RBT), a new relapse prevention behavior therapy for inner city opiate abusers. The therapy provides abstinence-contingent partial support of housing, food and recreational activities, abstinence-contingent access to social skills and job finding group therapy and non-contingent individual counseling, all in the context of a day treatment program. Heroin abusers (n = 52), contacted at a 3-day detoxification unit, were randomly assigned to RBT (n = 28) or referred to community treatment resources (n = 24) after a staff escort from the detoxification unit. For RBT patients, treatment began on the day of discharge; 61% received partial rent support in a recovery house based on the need for drug-free housing; the remainder were eligible for partial support of utility payments where they lived. Abstinence-based contingencies were in effect for 1 month with three times per week counseling available for an additional 2 months. One month after detoxification, 61% of RBT versus 17% of referral patients were enrolled in outpatient treatment (P < 0.01); RBT patients were significantly less likely than controls to have returned to any drug use; and 50% of RBT versus 21% of controls reported 30 days of abstinence from heroin and cocaine with confirmatory negative urine (P < 0.05). RBT patients had significantly lower scores on the Beck Depression Inventory at 1 month (M = 9.0 versus 17.6 for controls; P < 0.05) and showed evidence of less alcohol use and higher rates of employment. These results establish the short-term efficacy for RBT and support continued development and evaluation of this new outpatient behavioral treatment.

AB  - Objective: The present study investigated predictors of treatment attendance among 226 women with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance use disorder (SUD). Participants received either an integrated intervention for PTSD and SUD (“Seeking Safety”) or a relapse prevention training (RPT) as part of a multicenter randomized controlled trial. Method: Beta-binomial regression was conducted to investigate baseline sociodemographic, motivational, mental health and substance use predictors of session attendance. Treatment by predictor interactions were included to identify treatment-specific predictors. Results: Session attendance was predicted by employment status, drug use severity and abstinence status. Higher drug use severity and unemployment were associated with less session attendance. The effect of abstinence status was treatment-specific, with abstinent participants in RPT attending most sessions. Conclusions: Considering individual characteristics could enhance session attendance in outpatient treatment for women with PTSD and SUD. This might include matching treatment concepts to abstinence status, the identification of attendance barriers in unemployed women and more intensive treatment settings for those with severe drug use.

AB  - Objective: This double-blind, parallel randomized controlled trial aimed to evaluate the effect of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) focused on stigma and shame as opposed to standard treatment (ST) in substance use disorder. Method(s): Participants with the main diagnosis of SUD were allocated through simple randomization to an ACT intervention or standard treatment. Primary measures, Substance Use Stigma Mechanism Scale and Other As Shamer Scale were employed to assess stigma and shame. Secondary measures assessed general health, quality of life, psychological flexibility, and multidimensional social support at pre, post, and 3 months follow up period. Result(s): Result of linear mixed-effects models showed that the intervention was efficacious in reducing stigma pre (M = 49.42 SD = 7.48) post (M = 23.97 SD = 6.52) and follow-up (M = 24.97 SD = 7.06). Significant decline in shame were also shown at pre (M = 26.17 SD = 5.72) post (M = 9.48 SD = 5.90) and follow-up (M = 10.62 SD = 6.93).Whereas slight differences were shown at secondary measures. Conclusion(s): It suggests that combined treatment with ACT was more effective than standard treatment for suds. This study could serve as a model for designing future RCTs with ACT-related interventions.Copyright © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Introduction: The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a housing transition program for homeless shelter residents with chronic mental illness and substance use. Method: A two-group controlled study design was used to assess the program, with 10 participants in an intervention group and 10 in a control group. Goal attainment scaling and quality of life ratings were used pre- and post-intervention to determine if a statistically significant difference existed between groups at post-intervention. Results: A statistically significant difference existed between intervention and control group goal attainment scaling scores (U = 9.50, p < .03, d = 1.34), and on quality of life scores (U = 10.50, p < .04, d = 1.30) at post-intervention. At a 6-month follow-up, 57.14% of intervention group participants had transitioned into supportive housing, while only 25% of control group participants had transitioned. Conclusion: Findings suggest that intervention participants made greater progress toward desired housing goals and reported higher quality of life ratings than controls at post-intervention. This study provides support for the effectiveness of a housing program for homeless adults with chronic mental illness and substance use histories to achieve housing goals and higher quality of life ratings.

AB  - This study examined the effectiveness of a stress management intervention for sheltered homeless adults with mental illness. Twelve intervention participants received a 6-week, 1-hour psychoeducation group combined with a 20-minute meditation. Eleven matched pairs did not receive intervention and served as controls. At 1 week post study, intervention participants reported a statistically significant reduction in perceived stress (Z= −2.285, p <.02, d= −1.176) compared to controls. No differences were found at 1 week post study between intervention and control participants on reported quality of life. This study provides pilot data on the effectiveness of an occupation-based stress management program for sheltered homeless adults and warrants further study.

AB  - Extending an earlier report of 6-month outcomes, this study reports 12- and 18-month follow-up data for clients (N = 188) entering a therapeutic community drug treatment program who were randomly assigned to day or residential treatment conditions. Outcomes included Addiction Severity Index composite scores and measures of depression, psychiatric symptoms, and social support, Both groups showed significant change over time. The pattern of change indicated decreased problem severity in the 1st 6 months and then maintenance of lowered problem severity. Comparisons between groups indicated greater improvement for residential treatment clients on social problems and psychiatric symptoms but no differences on the remaining outcomes. Although residential treatment may offer some specific advantages, the conclusion here is that improvement among day treatment clients was not significantly different from that of residential treatment clients.

AB  - Background: Comorbid substance misuse in people with schizophrenia is associated with poor clinical and social outcomes. There are few studies of psychological treatments for this population and little long-term follow-up of their benefits. Aims: To investigate symptom, substance use, functioning and health economy outcomes for patients with schizophrenia and their carers 18 months after a cognitive-behavioural treatment (CBT) programme. Method: Patients with dual diagnosis from a randomised controlled trial of motivational intervention, individual CBT and family intervention were assessed on multiple outcomes at 18-month follow-up. Carers were assessed on symptom, functioning and needs over 12 months. Health economy data were collected over 18 months. Results: There were significant improvements in patient functioning compared with routine care over 18 months. No significant differences between treatment groups were found in carer or cost outcomes. Conclusions: The treatment programme was superior to routine care on outcomes relating to illness and service use, and the cost was comparable to the control treatment.

AB  - The aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness of cognitive group therapy compared to a waiting list in a sample of patients with heterogeneous non-psychotic disorders. Participants in this study were referred from either the psychiatric in- or outpatient clinic at the psychiatric university hospital in Trondheim, Norway. The patients were assessed with SCID I and SCID II, and randomized either to cognitive group therapy (n=15) or to a waiting list (n=17). Self-report assessments of symptoms and interpersonal difficulties were administered at the start of therapy, after termination of therapy (8 weeks), and at 6 months and 12 months follow-up. Thirty-two patients completed 8 weeks of therapy. Results showed that an 8-week program of CBGT performed better than the waiting list controls, on symptom relief at post-treatment for all patients. The effects of therapy were still upheld at 6 and 12 months follow-up. Cognitive therapy seems to be useful and effective in a group format in naturalistic clinical settings, with patients suffering from various forms of non-psychotic co-morbid psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Most U.S. healthcare professionals encourage mutual-help group involvement as an adjunct to treatment or aftercare for individuals with substance use disorders, yet there are multiple challenges in engaging in these community groups. Dually diagnosed individuals (DDIs) may face additional challenges in affiliating with mutual-help groups. Twelve-step facilitation for DDIs (TSF-DD), a manualized treatment to facilitate mutual-help group involvement, was developed to help patients engage in Double Trouble in Recovery (DTR), a mutual-help group tailored to DDIs. Given the promising role that TSF-DD and DTR may have for increasing abstinence while managing psychiatric symptoms, the aim of the current study was to systematically examine reasons for TSF-DD and DTR attendance from the perspective of DDIs using focus group data. Participants were a subset (n = 15) of individuals diagnosed with an alcohol use disorder as well as a major depressive, bipolar, or psychotic disorder who participated in a parent study testing the efficacy of TSF-DD for increasing mutual-help group involvement and reducing alcohol use. Analyses of focus group data revealed that participants construed DTR and TSF-DD as helpful tools in the understanding and management of their disorders. Relative to other mutual-help groups in which participants reported feeling ostracized because of their dual diagnoses, participants reported that it was beneficial to learn about dual disorders in a safe and accepting environment. Participants also expressed aspects that they disliked. Results from this study yield helpful empirical recommendations to healthcare professionals seeking to increase DDIs' participation in DTR or other mutual-help groups.

AB  - The comorbidity of substance use disorder (SUD), depression, and PTSD is common among veterans. Prior research has shown that among veterans with SUD and depression, those with PTSD did not maintain cognitive-behavioral treatment gains as well as those without PTSD. Thus, the current study was designed to evaluate whether adding trauma-focused treatment following an initial group-based integrated cognitive behavioral treatment (ICBT) for SUD and depression improved treatment outcomes. Participants were 123 veterans (89% male) recruited from the VA San Diego Healthcare System. All participants received ICBT in twice weekly, group-delivered sessions for 12 weeks (Phase 1). Participants were then randomized to receive 12 sessions of individual follow-up sessions (Phase 2) utilizing either ICBT or cognitive processing therapy that was modified to integrate SUD treatment (CPT-M). Results indicated that PTSD and depression symptoms slightly improved at the end of Phase 1 group ICBT and further improved through Phase 2 individual treatment (except for participants without PTSD who received CPT-M), with treatment gains maintained one year later. Substance use significantly improved at the end of Phase 1 group ICBT and these improvements were maintained through Phase 2 and the one year follow-up. Participants in the trauma-focused Phase 2 treatment (CPT-M) exhibited similar levels of symptom reduction and maintenance of treatment gains as those in the non-trauma-focused Phase 2 treatment (ICBT). However, there was a slight advantage for Phase 2 CPT-M over Phase 2 ICBT with respect to heavy drinking outcomes for individuals with PTSD. Overall, the combination of group ICBT followed by either CPT-M or ICBT individual therapy appears to be effective for veterans with depression, SUD, and trauma history.

AB  - Investigated the efficacy of group-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for social anxiety in schizophrenia. 20 19–67 yr old patients with schizophrenia with comorbid social anxiety were assigned to the group-based CBT or wait-list control condition. Pre-, post- and-6-wk followup ratings included measures of social anxiety and avoidance, mood and quality of life. Results show that the intervention group improved on all outcome measures and the control group showed no change in symptomatology. It is concluded that group-based CBT is effective in treating social anxiety in schizophrenia. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The present study evaluated the efficacy of an Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) program for the seriously mentally ill. Outcomes of the program were assessed at baseline and 12-month follow-lip and were compared with that of a control group, which received standard community care. Thirty-six subjects with serious mental disorders participated in the study. Dependent measures included number of hospital admissions and hospital bed days per year, life skills, quality of life, and psychiatric symptoms. Results of 2 x 2 (treatment/control group x baseline / Ii-month follow-up) repeated measures ANOVAs indicated that, after 1 year, both treatments lead to a significant reduction in hospital admissions and bed days, and to improvement in life skills. ACT subjects evidenced a greater decrease in psychiatric symptoms compared to control group subjects. In general, markedly more ACT subjects showed reliable clinical change in life skills, quality of life, and psychiatric symptoms than control subjects. Although the ACT did produce greater clinical change than standard case management, it did not produce statistically greater improvement across most domains of functioning in the short term.

AB  - Depression and anxiety are the most common mental health disorders seen in clinical practice and they are highly comorbid. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been demonstrated as an effective treatment for both depression and anxiety but is often not available to all individuals who could benefit from it. This paper investigates the effectiveness of a mixed-diagnosis group CBT intervention that incorporates mindfulness meditation for individuals presenting with depression and/or anxiety: CBT Basics II. This intervention was evaluated across two distinct mental health programs to determine both if it can demonstrate positive results and if it is feasible to implement in these types of programs. Sample 1 (n = 42 completers) consisted of higher-functioning individuals in a general mental health program. Sample 2 (n = 53 completers) consisted of individuals with more chronic and severe mental health diagnoses. Overall,intent-to-treat analyses revealed improvements in psychiatric symptoms, and increases in CBT knowledge and mindfulness skill across both programs. This indicates that CBT Basics II is effective across diverse mental health populations and shows promise for improving access to CBT. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Perfectionism is associated with symptoms of anxiety disorders, eating disorders and mood disorders. Treatments targeting perfectionism may reduce the symptoms of these disorders (Egan, Wade,. & Shafran, 2011). This study is the first randomised controlled trial to investigate the efficacy of group cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for perfectionism. Forty-two participants with elevated perfectionism and a range of anxiety, eating and mood disorders were randomised to group CBT for perfectionism or a waitlist control. The treatment group reported significantly greater pre-post reductions in perfectionism, symptoms of depression, eating disorders, social anxiety, anxiety sensitivity and rumination, as well as significantly greater pre-post increases in self-esteem and quality of life compared to the waitlist control group. The impact of treatment on most of these outcomes was mediated by pre-post change in perfectionism (Concern over Mistakes). Treatment gains were reliable and clinically significant, and were maintained at 6-month follow-up. Findings support group CBT for perfectionism being an effcacious treatment for perfectionism and related psychopathology, as well as increasing self-esteem and quality of life. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study evaluated whether dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) was mOre efficacious than treatment by nonbehavioral psychotherapy experts in reducing co-occurring Axis I disorders among suicidal individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD). Women with BPD and recent and repeated suicidal and/or self-injurious behavior (n = 101) were randomly assigned to 1 year of DBT or community treatment by experts (CTBE), plus 1 year of follow-up assessment. For substance dependence disorders (SDD), DBT patients were more likely to achieve full remission, spent more time in partial remission, spent less time meeting full criteria, and reported more drug- and alcohol-abstinent days than did CTBE patients. These findings suggest that improvements in co-occurring SDD among suicidal BPD patients are specific to DBT and cannot be attributed to general factors associated with nonbehavioral expert psychotherapy. Further, group differences in SDD remission were not explained by either psychotropic medication usage or changes in BPD criterion behaviors. DBT and CTBE did not significantly differ in the reduction of anxiety disorders, eating disorders, or major depressive disorder.

AB  - Limited evidence shows that time-limited residential treatment (RT) is beneficial for homeless people with serious mental illness. The Department of Veterans Affairs has established 11 specialty programs for homeless female veterans. We present data comparing 1-year clinical outcomes in a group of veterans who did and did not receive at least 30 days of RT. Clients of the Homeless Women Veterans Programs were invited to participate in a follow-up study. They were interviewed every 3 months for 1 year. Those who received at least 30 days of RI in the 3 months after program entry (RI group) were compared with other program participants (no or <30 days RT [NRT] group) on measures of community functioning, psychiatric symptoms, and drug and alcohol use during the follow-up. The RI group had better outcomes on employment, social support, housing status, and psychiatric symptoms. They also had significantly increased use of drugs and alcohol compared with the NRT group. Data suggest that RI may have a beneficial effect on mental health outcomes in homeless women. This study, in conjunction with others, suggests that provision of stable housing may be an important element of recovery for homeless women with psychiatric problems, excluding substance use.

AB  - Research into effective interventions for the negative psychological impacts of long-term unemployment has been sparse. One intervention, based on cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), has been successfully implemented in two studies with long-term unemployed professionals and youth. Can these findings be generalized to disadvantaged job-seekers who are long-term unemployed? Local support services for unemployed people located within disadvantaged areas in Sydney were approached to recruit volunteer participants. Participants were assigned in random blocks to a brief group CBT training programme or a non-CBT skills-based comparison programme. Telephone administered questionnaires completed before each course and 12 weeks later assessed psychological health variables (general mental health, self-esteem, hopelessness, optimism, self-efficacy) and success in job finding. Analyses are based on the 57 CBT group participants and 43 comparison group participants who completed 12-week follow-up assessments. Both groups reported improvements in psychological health variables at 12 weeks. Improvements in optimism and hopelessness were greater for the comparison group than the CBT group. This study was unable to replicate the benefits of CBT-based programmes for disadvantaged long-term unemployed job-seekers. The difficulties and limitations of disseminating effective interventions to unemployed groups who are most disadvantaged using existing support services are discussed.

AB  - Building Spiritual Strength (BSS) is an 8-session, spiritually integrated group intervention designed to address religious strain and enhance religious meaning making for military trauma survivors. It is based upon empirical research on the relationship between spirituality and adjustment to trauma. To assess the intervention's effectiveness, veterans with histories of trauma who volunteered for the study were randomly assigned to a BSS group (n = 26) or a wait-list control group (n = 28). BSS participants showed statistically significant reductions in PTSD symptoms based on self-report measures as compared with those in a wait-list control condition. Further research on spiritually integrated interventions for trauma survivors is warranted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

In this pilot study, we explored the efficacy of a group CBT treatment that involved a caregiver component in adults with mild ID with a depressive disorder. Sixteen adults with mild ID and a depressive disorder participated in a 10-week group CBT treatment and eight adults with mild ID with a depressive disorder served as a treatment as usual (TAU) control group. Adults with mild ID and caregivers completed measures of depressive symptoms, behavior problems, and social skills at pretreatment, posttreatment, and a 3-month follow-up. Adults with mild ID also completed a series of tasks to measure their understanding of the principles of cognitive therapy pre- and posttreatment. The CBT group demonstrated significant decreases in depressive symptoms and behavior problems from pretreatment to posttreatment and these effects were maintained at a 3-month follow-up. The CBT group demonstrated significant improvements in their ability to infer emotions and thoughts based on various situation-thought-emotion pairings from pretreatment to posttreatment. Findings indicate that adults with mild ID with a depressive disorder benefitted from a group CBT treatment with a caregiver component. Moreover, adults with mild ID appeared to benefit, at least in part, from the cognitive therapy components of the treatment, in addition to the behavior therapy components.

AB  - Objective: Loneliness is a key public health issue for which various interventions have been trialed. However, few directly target the core feature of loneliness-lack of belonging. This is the focus of GROUPS 4 HEALTH (G4H), a recently developed intervention that targets the development and maintenance of social group memberships to support health. Method: To investigate the efficacy of this intervention, a randomized controlled trial was conducted with participants (N = 120) assigned to G4H or treatment-as-usual (TAU) by computer software. Assessment of primary (loneliness) and secondary (depression, social anxiety, general practitioner visits, multiple group membership) outcomes was conducted at baseline and 2-month follow-up using mixed-model repeated-measures analyses. Results: G4H produced a greater reduction in loneliness (d = &minus;1.04) and social anxiety (d = &minus;0.46) than TAU (d = &minus;0.33 and d = 0.03, respectively). G4H was also associated with fewer general practitioner visits at follow-up (d = &minus;0.33) and a stronger sense of belonging to multiple groups (d = 0.52) relative to TAU (d = 0.30 and d = 0.33, respectively). Depression declined significantly in both G4H (d = &minus;0.63) and TAU (d = &minus;0.34), but follow-up analyses showed this was greater in G4H among those not receiving adjunct psychopharmacological treatment and whose symptoms were milder. Conclusions: Findings suggest that G4H can be a useful way to treat loneliness and highlight the importance of attending to group memberships when tackling this important social challenge.

AB  - Objective.The objective of this studywas to test the efficacy of theHealing Pathways (HP) programin reducing clinically significantly depressive symptoms in women with physical disabilities (WPD). Healing Pathways is a peer-implemented group mental health treatment program targeting WPD who have clinically significant cooccurring depressive symptoms. Participants. Eighty women were randomized in this trial. Design. This study used a community-based participatory intervention research design. Using community-based recruiting methods, participants were recruited from Centers for Independent Living, local disability service organizations, via Craig's list as well as other community locations such as grocery stores and bus stops.Women participated in the HP program for 14 weeks. Results.The primary outcome variable for this study was reduction in depressive symptoms as measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Depression Scale (CES-D). We found that there was a significant interaction effect of treatment by time on depression scores, F(3,210) = 9.51, P < 0.0001, partial η2 = 0.101. Investigation of the predicted mean profile over time in the intervention group demonstrated that depression scores decreased greatly from baseline to the first posttest and remained stable in the two followups, whereas there was a little change in the mean profile over time in the control group. Conclusion. The HP program has demonstrated initial efficacy in reducing depressive symptoms in women with physical disabilities.

AB  - Background:Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) has been shown to be effective, yet there is a paucity of research on the differential effectiveness of individual and group CBT for adults with treatment-resistant depression with psychiatric comorbidity. Aims:To investigate the effectiveness of individual and group CBT for inpatients, in an interdisciplinary rehabilitation setting; the extent of psychiatric comorbidity; and who benefits the most from group CBT. Methods:All patients (n = 181) received 6 weeks of rehabilitation (treatment as usual, TAU). In addition, they were randomly allocated to group CBT (n = 86) or individual CBT (n = 59) combined with TAU, or TAU only (n = 36). All CBT therapists were part of an interdisciplinary team, had at least 1-year CBT training, and attended weekly supervision. The same CBT manual was used for individual and group therapy, providing 12 sessions, two per week. Groups had 12–15 participants and two therapists in each session. Results:Individual CBT was superior in efficacy to group CBT and TAU, with a large within-subject effect size (ES = 2.10). Group CBT was not superior to TAU. The benefits of treatment decreased over time, but remained large at 18-month follow-up for individual CBT (ES = 1.02), and medium for group CBT (ES = 0.46) and TAU (ES = 0.60). Conclusions:Individual CBT was an effective addition to TAU and showed significant improvements in symptom severity post-treatment and at 18-month follow-up. Disorder severity and comorbidity may have decreased effectiveness of group therapy primarily aimed at depression.

AB  - Through December 2003, more than 55,300 persons were living in small towns and rural areas of the United States at the time of their AIDS diagnosis. Many HIV‐infected rural persons experience elevated levels of depression, suicidal ideation, and anxiety. This research tested if two telephone‐delivered, mental health interventions could facilitate the adjustment efforts of persons living with HIV/AIDS in rural areas of the United States. Participants (N=299) were recruited through AIDS service organizations in 13 states and assigned to a Usual Care Condition (n=107), an 8‐session Information Support Group Intervention (n=84), or an 8‐session Coping Improvement Group Intervention (n=108). Participants completed self‐administered surveys at pre‐intervention, post‐intervention, and 4‐ and 8‐month follow‐ups. ANCOVA revealed that no treatment condition produced reductions in the main outcome measures of depressive and psychological symptoms; however, Information Support participants received significantly more support from friends at 4‐ and 8‐month follow‐ups and reported fewer barriers to health care and social services at 4‐month follow‐up compared to participants in the other two conditions. Telephone‐delivered, information‐support groups have potential to increase perceptions of support and reduce barriers to health care and social services in this population, but the practical significance of these intervention‐related changes is limited.

AB  - Background: This article presents results of the acute treatment phase of a 2-site study comparing cognitive behavioral group therapy (CBGT) and treatment with the monoamine oxidase inhibitor phenelzine sulfate for social phobia. Methods: One hundred thirty-three patients from 2 sites received 12 weeks of CBGT, phenelzine therapy, pill placebo administration, or educational-supportive group therapy (an attention-placebo treatment of equal credibility to CBGT). The "allegiance effect," ie, the tendency for treatments to seem most efficacious in settings of similar theoretical orientation and less efficacious in theoretically divergent settings, was also examined by comparing responses to the treatment conditions at both sites: 1 known for pharmacological treatment of anxiety disorders and the other for cognitive behavioral treatment. Results: After 12 weeks, phenelzine therapy and CBGT led to superior response rates and greater change on dimensional measures than did either control condition. However, response to phenelzine therapy was more evident after 6 weeks, and phenelzine therapy was also superior to CBGT after 12 weeks on some measures. There were few differences between sites, suggesting that these treatments can be efficacious at facilities with differing theoretical allegiances. Conclusions: After 12 weeks, both phenelzine therapy and CBGT were associated with marked positive response. Although phenelzine therapy was superior to CBGT on some measures, both were more efficacious than the control conditions. More extended cognitive behavioral treatment and the combination of modalities may enhance treatment effect.

AB  - Over the past decade, several studies have attempted to determine whether integrating psychiatric and substance abuse treatment leads to better outcome for patients with comorbid schizophrenia and substance use disorders. A recent (1999) Cochrane Review (1) analyzed the effectiveness of prospective randomized studies of integrated treatment approaches, and concluded that there was no clear evidence for superiority of integrated treatment. This paper describes one such integrated treatment approach, in Beth Israel Medical Center's COPAD (Combined Psychiatric and Addictive Disorders) program. We summarize findings from an initial outcome study and a recent replication study; and describe clinical and research issues relevant to this population. Our data suggests the benefits of integrated treatment for patients with addictive disorders and schizophrenia, at least with regard to treatment retention. Clinical issues for such patients include identification of patients at risk, proper assessment and treatment planning, decision-making about mainstreaming vs. referral to specialized programs, and the importance of initial engagement and ongoing reengagement in successful treatment.

AB  - Objective: This study assessed the effectiveness of a previously tested model, critical time intervention (CTI), in producing an enduring reduction in the risk of homelessness for persons with severe mental illness who were discharged from inpatient psychiatric treatment facilities. Methods: A total of 150 previously homeless men and women with severe mental illness and who were discharged from inpatient psychiatric hospitalization to transitional residences on the hospital grounds were randomly assigned to receive usual care or usual care plus CTI at the point of discharge to the community. The nine-month intervention aims to gradually pass responsibility to community sources for providing ongoing support after the intervention ends, thereby leading to a durable reduction in risk of future homelessness. After participants were discharged from the transitional residence (length of stay six to 937 days), their housing status was assessed every six weeks for 18 months via participant self-report collected by interviewers blind to study condition. Results: In an intent-to-treat analysis, participants assigned to the CTI group had significantly less homelessness at the end of the follow-up period (the final three six-week intervals) than those assigned to the control group (odds ratio=.22, 95% confidence interval=.06-.88). Conclusions: A relatively brief, focused intervention for persons with severe mental illness led to a reduction in the risk of homelessness that was evident nine months after the intervention ended. This work suggests that targeted, relatively short interventions applied at critical transition points may enhance the efficacy of long-term supports for persons with severe mental illness who are living in the community.

AB  - The psychological literature reveals the frequent coexistence of severe mental illness and substance abuse problems. No existing substance abuse treatment has demonstrated efficacy with all subgroups of the heterogeneous population of substance abusers. There are few empirical studies to identify effective alcohol abuse treatments for people who have both alcohol abuse problems and severe mental disorders. The psychological literature indicates that traditional alcohol treatment programs are not well suited to mentally ill alcohol abusers. Miller's Motivational Enhancement Therapy differs from traditional alcohol treatments in using methods which are similar to methods recommended as effective strategies for providing treatment to mentally ill adults. The current study specifically investigates the effects of Miller's personalized assessment feedback in treating alcohol abuse with mentally ill adults. A pretest-posttest experimental design was used to study the effects of Miller's personal feedback treatment on mentally ill chemical abusers. Thirty adult clients of a community mental health center's program for adults with severe mental illness were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. A brief one-time treatment intervention presented assessment feedback derived from the Alcohol Use Inventory ( AUI) (Horn, Wanberg, & Foster, 1987; Wanberg, Horn, & Foster, 1990), the Substance Abuse Subtle Screening Inventory ( SASSI) (Miller, G., 1985), and the Symptom Check List-90-R (SCL-90-R) (Deorgatis, 1983). Results on AUI and SCL-90-R also comprised the pretest and posttest for both groups, with the Volume scale on the AUI defining the dependent variable. Data was analyzed with a one-way Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA). Other variables from the AUI and SCL-90-R were assessed for exploratory purposes. With covariate control for pretest results, mentally ill adults who received Millers personal assessment feedback had lower volume of alcohol consumption than did the control group. This result indicates that Millers assessment feedback was an effective treatment for the subject population. Future studies should further isolate effective treatment factors by focusing on within group differences obvious at the pretest stage of the current experiment.

AB  - There is substantial room for improvement in the outcomes of youth substance use treatment. Interventions that simultaneously target risk factors and build protective factors for youth substance use may improve outcomes. This cohort-controlled trial examined whether the Grit strengths-based self-regulation group program, enhanced the substance use, mental ill-health and wellbeing outcomes of young people accessing residential treatment for substance use disorders. Participants were 251 young people (18-35 years) accessing two residential rehabilitation services in Queensland, Australia. Participants received either 6-weeks of standard treatment, or standard treatment + Grit (2 sessions each week for 6 weeks). Grit uses a strengths-based focuses on improving substance use, mental ill-health and wellbeing outcomes by building self-regulation skills and social connections. Participants substance use, depression/anxiety and wellbeing outcomes were assessed at baseline, 6 weeks, 3, 6 and 2 months post-program enrolment. There were 251 (64% male, Mage = 27.36) young people included in the study. The main drug of concern was methamphetamine (47.6%) followed by alcohol (27.1%). Comorbid mental health concerns were high. Preliminary results revealed that both groups showed a significant improvement in wellbeing and depressive symptoms, and decreases in alcohol use and methamphetamine use at 3 months. The Grit group showed greater reductions in tobacco use, and fewer problems associated with their methamphetamine use at the 3 month follow-up. These preliminary results suggest that the Grit program resulted in reductions in methamphetamine and tobacco use concerns, over and above the effects of the standard 6-week residential treatment program. The 6-week program itself, which is brief in comparison to other residential programs, resulted in reductions in substance use and improvements in wellbeing and depression at 3 months. The 6 and 12 month outcomes of the trial will be presented. Targeting protective factors as well as the underlying risk factors for substance use, not just substance use, may improve the outcomes of youth residential treatment.

AB  - The authors compared the effectiveness of the Seeking Safety group, cognitive-behavioral treatment for substance use disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), to an active comparison health education group (Women's Health Education [WHE]) within the National Institute on Drug Abuse's Clinical Trials Network. The authors randomized 353 women to receive 12 sessions of Seeking Safety (M = 6.2 sessions) or WHE (M = 6.0 sessions) with follow-up assessment 1 week and 3, 6, and 12 months posttreatment. Primary outcomes were the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), the PTSD Symptom Scale-Self Report (PSS-SR), and a substance use inventory (self-reported abstinence and percentage of days of use over 7 days). Intention-to-treat analysis showed large, clinically significant reductions in CAPS and PSS-SR symptoms (d = 1.94 and 1.12, respectively) but no reliable difference between conditions. Substance use outcomes were not significantly different over time between the two treatments and at follow-up showed no significant change from baseline. Study results do not favor Seeking Safety over WHE as an adjunct to substance use disorder treatment for women with PTSD and reflect considerable opportunity to improve clinical outcomes in community-based treatments for these co-occurring conditions.

AB  - Background: Individuals with comorbid substance use and posttraumatic stress disorder may differentially benefit from integrated trauma-focused interventions based on specific presenting characteristics such as substance use type and PTSD severity. The current study is a secondary analysis of a NIDA Clinical Trials Network study exploring the effectiveness of two interventions for women with comorbid PTSD and substance use disorders. Method: Generalized estimating equations were used to examine the association of baseline alcohol misuse with PTSD outcome measures over time for all randomized participants. Results: Women entering treatment with baseline alcohol misuse had higher Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Symptom Scale (PSS-SR) total scores (t = 2.43, p < .05), cluster C (avoidance/numbing) scores (t = 2.63, p < .01), and cluster D (hyper-arousal) scores (t = 2.31, p < .05). For women with alcohol misuse, after treatment week 1, PSS-SR scores were significantly lower in the Seeking Safety intervention during treatment (chi(2)(1) = 4.00, p < .05) and follow-up (chi(2)(1) = 4.87, p < .05) compared to those in the health education intervention. Alcohol misusers in the Seeking Safety group who had higher baseline hyper-arousal severity improved more quickly than those with lower baseline hyper-arousal severity during treatment (chi(2)(1)= 4.06, p < .05). Conclusions: These findings suggest that the type of substance abuse at treatment entry may inform treatment selection, predict treatment response among those with co-occurring PTSD and substance use disorders, and indicate a more severe clinical picture.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of the analysis was to examine the temporal course of improvement in symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance use disorder among women in outpatient substance abuse treatment.Method: Participants were 353 women randomly assigned to 12 sessions of either trauma-focused or health education group treatment. PTSD and substance use assessments were conducted during treatment and posttreatment at 1 week and after 3, 6, and 12 months. A continuous Markov model was fit on four defined response categories (nonresponse, substance use response, PTSD response, or global response [improvement in both PTSD and substance use]) to investigate the temporal association between improvement in PTSD and substance use symptom severity during the study's treatment phase. A generalized linear model was applied to test this relationship over the follow-up period.Results: Subjects exhibiting nonresponse, substance use response, or global response tended to maintain original classification; subjects exhibiting PTSD response were significantly more likely to transition to global response over time, indicating maintained PTSD improvement was associated with subsequent substance use improvement. Trauma-focused treatment was significantly more effective than health education in achieving substance use improvement, but only among those who were heavy substance users at baseline and had achieved significant PTSD reductions.Conclusions: PTSD severity reductions were more likely to be associated with substance use improvement, with minimal evidence of substance use symptom reduction improving PTSD symptoms. Results support the self-medication model of coping with PTSD symptoms and an empirical basis for integrated interventions for improved substance use outcomes in patients with severe symptoms.

AB  - Background and objectives: Schema group therapy is a potentially cost-effective treatment for borderline personality disorder (BPD). We piloted the feasibility and effectiveness of a 20-session schema group therapy without individual therapy among psychiatric BPD outpatients in a randomized pilot study registered as a clinical trial (ISRCTN76381242). Method(s): Altogether 42 psychiatric outpatients diagnosed with BPD were randomized 2:1 to a 20-session weekly schema group therapy plus treatment as usual (TAU) (n = 28) vs. a control group with TAU alone (n = 14). The primary outcome was decline of BPD symptoms in the short Borderline Symptom List (BSL-23) score. Secondary outcomes were decline in symptoms of anxiety, depression, alcohol use, and improvement in functioning and schema modes. Two external experts evaluated validity of the intervention based on videotaped sessions. Result(s): Overall, 23 schema group therapy patients (82%) and 12 controls (86%) completed their treatment. Treatment validity good or very good. However, no significant differences emerged in the primary outcome mean BSL-23 decline (6.95 [SE 5.91] in group schema therapy vs. 12.55 [4.85] in TAU) or in any of the secondary outcome measures. Limitation(s): Despite randomization, the TAU subgroup had non-significantly higher baseline scores in most measures. Small sample size predisposing to type II errors; reliance on self-reported outcomes. Conclusion(s): Schema group therapy was feasible for psychiatric outpatients with BPD. However, in this small pilot study we did not find it more effective than TAU. Effectiveness of this short intervention remains open.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - We designed and pilot-tested a group-based, w ork-related c ognitive- b ehavioral t herapy (WCBT) for unemployed individuals with social anxiety disorder (SAD). WCBT, delivered in a vocational service setting by vocational service professionals, aims to reduce social anxiety and enable individuals to seek, obtain, and retain employment. We compared WCBT to a v ocational s ervices a s u sual control condition (VSAU). Participants were unemployed, homeless, largely African American, vocational service-seeking adults with SAD ( N = 58), randomized to receive either eight sessions of WCBT plus VSAU or VSAU alone and followed three months post-treatment. Multilevel modeling revealed significantly greater reductions in social anxiety, general anxiety, depression, and functional impairment for WCBT compared to VSAU. Coefficients for job search activity and self-efficacy indicated greater increases for WCBT. Hours worked per week in the follow-up period did not differ between the groups, but small sample size and challenges associated with measuring work hours may have contributed to this finding. Overall, the results of this study suggest that unemployed persons with SAD can be effectively treated with specialized work-related CBT administered by vocational service professionals. Future testing of WCBT with a larger sample, a longer follow-up period, and adequate power to assess employment outcomes is warranted.

AB  - Background: A number of studies indicate a link between cannabis-use and psychosis as well as more severe psychosis in those with existing psychotic disorders. There is currently insufficient evidence to decide the optimal way to treat cannabis abuse among patients with psychosis. Objectives: The major objective for the CapOpus trial is to evaluate the additional effect on cannabis abuse of a specialized addiction treatment program adding group treatment and motivational interviewing to treatment as usual. Design: The trial is designed as a randomized, parallel-group, observer-blinded clinical trial. Patients are primarily recruited through early-psychosis detection teams, community mental health centers, and assertive community treatment teams. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms, both lasting six months: 1) specialized addiction treatment plus treatment as usual or 2) treatment as usual. The specialized addiction treatment is manualized and consists of both individual and group-based motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy, and incorporates both the family and the case manager of the patient. The primary outcome measure will be changes in amount of cannabis consumption over time. Other outcome measures will be psychosis symptoms, cognitive functioning, quality of life, social functioning, and cost-benefit analyses. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00484302.

AB  - BackgroundCannabis abuse in psychotic patients is associated with rehospitalizations, reduced adherence and increased symptom severity. Previous psychosocial interventions have been ineffective in cannabis use, possibly because of low sample sizes and short interventions. We investigated whether adding CapOpus to treatment as usual (TAU) reduces cannabis use in patients with cannabis use disorder and psychosis.MethodA total of 103 patients with psychosis and cannabis use disorder were centrally randomized to 6 months of CapOpus plus TAU (n = 52) or TAU (n = 51). CapOpus consisted mainly of motivational interviewing and cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT). TAU was targeted primarily at the psychotic disorder. The primary outcome was self-reported days with cannabis use in the preceding month.ResultsPre-randomization cannabis use frequency was 14.9 [95% confidence interval (CI) 12.7–17.1] days/month. Post-treatment, the ratio of days/month with cannabis use in CapOpus versus TAU was 0.76 (95% CI 0.38–1.50) (p = 0.42), and 0.80 (95% CI 0.21–3.10) (p = 0.75) at the 4-month follow-up. From 46.4 (95% CI 36.4–56.3) monthly joints pre-randomization, consumption fell to 27.3 (95% CI 12.6–41.9) joints in CapOpus and 48.2 (95% CI 31.8–64.6) in TAU (p = 0.06). Follow-up amounts were 28.4 (95% CI 13.5–43.2) and 41.6 (95% CI 25.2–58.0) joints (p = 0.23). Several subgroup analyses suggested benefits of CapOpus.ConclusionsCapOpus did not reduce the frequency, but possibly the amount, of cannabis use. This is similar to the findings of previous trials in this population. Implementation of CapOpus-type interventions is thus not warranted at present but subgroup analyses call for further trials.

AB  - Abstract: Background: Randomized trials targeting cannabis use disorders in patients with psychosis have generally been unsuccessful. One of the largest such trials was the CapOpus trial, which had an impact on the number of monthly joints used, but not on the number of days with cannabis use or positive or negative symptoms. Objective: To investigate the effects of CapOpus on psychiatric treatment. Methods: Six-month randomized trial on participants meeting ICD-10 criteria for cannabis use disorder and schizophrenia-spectrum psychosis. Participants were randomized to treatment as usual (TAU, n=51) alone versus TAU plus CapOpus (n=52) consisting of motivational interviewing and cognitive behavior therapy. Data regarding psychiatric treatment was obtained from complete nationwide registers. Analyses were intention-to-treat. Cox and poisson regression were used as appropriate. Results: Compared with treatment as usual, participants in the CapOpus group had an overall higher risk of having a psychiatric emergency room contact (hazard ratio 2.02, 95% confidence interval 1.22–3.34). Participants in CapOpus also had more contacts with psychiatric emergency rooms (incidence rate ratio 3.47 (2.64–4.57)) and more admissions to psychiatric hospitals (incidence rate ratio 2.24 (1.65–3.03)); conversely, CapOpus-participants spent fewer days admitted to psychiatric hospitals than treatment-as-usual participants (incidence rate ratio 0.72 (0.68–0.75)). Conclusions: CapOpus led to earlier and more psychiatric emergency room contacts and admissions that, however, were of fewer days. This pattern could indicate that participants receiving treatment as usual were inadequately treated. However, it cannot be excluded that the differences might be an adverse reaction to the psychosocial intervention.

AB  - Background: Deficits in social cognition and neurocognition are believed to underlie schizophrenia disability. Attempts at rehabilitation have had circumscribed effects on cognition, without concurrent improvement in broad aspects of behavior and adjustment. objective: To determine the differential effects of cognitive enhancement therapy (a recovery-phase intervention) on cognition and behavior compared with state-of-the-art enriched supportive therapy. Design: A 2-year, randomized controlled trial with neuropsychological and behavioral assessments completed at baseline and at 12 and 24 months. Setting: An outpatient research clinic housed in a medical center's comprehensive care service for patients with severe mental illness. Patients: A total of 121 symptomatically stable, nonsubstance-abusing but cognitively disabled and chronically ill patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Interventions: Cognitive enhancement therapy is a multidimensional, developmental approach that integrates computer-assisted training in neurocognition with social cognitive group exercises. Enriched supportive therapy fosters illness management through applied coping strategies and education. Main Outcome Measures: Six highly reliable summary measures-Processing Speed, Neurocognition, Cognitive Style, Social Cognition, Social Adjustment and Symptoms-were tested using analysis of covariance and linear trend analysis. Results: At 12 months, robust cognitive enhancement therapy effects were observed on the Neurocognition and Processing Speed composites (P<.003), with marginal effects observed on the behavioral composites. By 24 months, differential cognitive enhancement therapy effects were again observed for the 2 neuropsychological composites and for Cognitive Style (P=.001), Social Cognition (P=.001), and Social Adjustment (P=.01). As expected, no differences were observed on the residual Symptoms composite. Effects were unrelated to the type of antipsychotic medication received. Enriched supportive therapy also demonstrated statistically significant within-group effect sizes, suggesting that supportive psychotherapy can also have positive, although more modest, effects on cognitive deficits. Conclusion: Many cognitive deficits and related behaviors of patients with stable schizophrenia are improved when sufficient exposure to relevant rehabilitation is provided.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to determine if interpersonal counselling (IPC) was effective in reducing psychological morbidity after major physical trauma. METHODS: One hundred and seventeen subjects were recruited from two major trauma centres and randomized to treatment as usual or IPC in the first 3 months following trauma. Measures of depressive, anxiety and post-traumatic symptoms were taken at baseline, 3 months and 6 months. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM IV diagnoses was conducted at baseline and at 6 months to assess for psychiatric disorder. RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients completed the study. Only half the patients randomized to IPC completed the therapy. At 6 months the level of depressive, anxiety and post-traumatic symptoms and the prevalence of psychiatric disorder did not differ significantly between the intervention and treatment-as-usual groups. Subjects with a past history of major depression who received IPC had significantly higher levels of depressive symptoms at 6 months. CONCLUSION: IPC was not effective as a universal intervention to reduce psychiatric morbidity after major physical trauma and may increase morbidity in vulnerable individuals. Patient dropout is likely to be a major problem in universal multi-session preventative interventions.

AB  - Few integrated substance use and depression treatments have been developed for delivery in outpatient substance abuse treatment settings. To meet the call for more "transportable" interventions, we conducted a pilot study to test a group cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for depression and substance use that was designed for delivery by outpatient substance abuse treatment counselors. Seventy-three outpatient clients were randomized to usual care enhanced with group CBT or usual care alone and assessed at three time points (baseline and 3 and 6 months postbaseline). Our results demonstrated that the treatment was acceptable and feasible for delivery by substance abuse treatment staff despite challenges with recruiting clients. Both depressive symptoms and substance use were reduced by the intervention but were not significantly different from the control group. These results suggest that further research is warranted to enhance the effectiveness of treatment for co-occurring disorders in these settings. [Copyright Elsevier Inc.]

AB  - The study goal was to determine whether client attributes were associated with outcomes from group cognitive behavioral therapy for depression (GCBT-D) as delivered in community-based addiction treatment settings. Data from 299 depressed residential clients assigned to receive either usual care (N = 159) or usual care plus GCBT-D (N = 140) were examined. Potential moderators included gender, race/ethnicity, education, referral status, and problem substance use. Study outcomes at 6 months post-baseline included changes in depressive symptoms, mental health functioning, negative consequences from substance use, and percentage of days abstinent. Initial examination indicated that non-Hispanic Whites had significantly better outcomes than other racial/ethnic groups on two of the four outcomes. After correcting for multiple testing, none of the examined client attributes moderated the treatment effect. GCBT-D appears effective; however, the magnitude and consistency of treatment effects indicate that it may be less helpful among members of racial/ethnic minority groups and is worthy of future study.

AB  - Background Mindfulness-based interventions have been shown to be effective in the treatment of a range of health and psychological disorders in adults and young people without intellectual disabilities ( ID). Clinical studies are emerging reporting on the efficacy of mindfulness-based interventions as a stand-alone treatment for common clinical disorders in adults with ID. Method This paper aims to evaluate the efficacy of an innovative structured mindfulness-based cognitive therapy ( MBCT) group programme adapted for adults with ID with a diagnosis of either recurrent depression, anxiety or both clinical conditions and a history of deliberate self-harm behaviour. Two groups ran consecutively consisting of a total of fifteen participants and seven carers. All participants were recorded as having either a borderline, mild, or moderate ID. The group programme ran over a period of 9 weeks with a follow-up session at 6 weeks post group intervention. Outcome measures included the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and two sub-scales from the Self- Compassion Scale administered at baseline, post therapy and at 6-week follow-up. Results The evaluation showed that participants reported an improvement in their experience of depression, anxiety, self-compassion and compassion for others. The most significant impact was in the reduced levels of anxiety reported. Improvements across all outcomes were maintained at 6-week follow-up. Conclusion The results of the evaluation suggest that people with intellectual disabilities benefit from a structured MBCT group intervention and the results are maintained at 6-week follow-up.

AB  - Introduction: Postural instability is a serious concern in patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders since it is expected to increase the risk of falls that may lead to fractures. The impact of yoga therapy on postural stability has not been investigated. Method(s): In this eight-week single-blind randomized controlled study with an eight-week follow-up, outpatients with schizophrenia or related psychotic disorder (ICD-10) were randomly assigned to either yoga therapy or a control group. In the yoga therapy group, the subjects received weekly sessions of 60-minyoga therapy for eight weeks in addition to their ongoing treatment. In the control group, the subjects received a weekly regular day-care program. The assessments that were performed at the baseline and endpoint included the Clinical Stabilometric Platform (CSP), anteflexion in standing. Result(s): Forty-nine patients participated in this study (32 men; mean+/-SD age, 53.1+/-12.3 years): yoga therapy group (n=25) and control group (n=24). In the yoga group, significant improvements were observed in a total length of trunk motion, the Romberg ratio, and anteflexion in standing at week 8 (mean+/-SD: 63.9+/-40.7-53.4+/-26.2cm, 1.6+/-0.9-1.1+/-0.6, and-8.7+/-9.5 to-3.8+/-12.4cm, respectively) while there were no significant changes in the control group. However, those clinical gains returned to the baseline level at week 16. Conclusion(s): The results confirmed the beneficial effects of the yoga therapy on postural stability in patients with schizophrenia. However, the therapeutic effects seemed transient, which warrants further investigations on strategies to sustain the improvements. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Psychotherapeutic treatments of borderline personality disorder (BPD) often focus on severe behavioral problems. Until now, few techniques have been developed to specifically address low self-esteem in BPD. We developed a 6-session psychoeducative group therapy module to treat low self-esteem in BPD patients. After developing and piloting the therapy module, a controlled outpatient pilot study was performed. Nineteen female BPD patients participated in the group module after discharge from an inpatient DBT program. Twenty-four female BPD patients served as controls. Outcome was assessed by different self-esteem measures. Results showed a greater improvement in self-esteem in the intervention group. The findings suggest that the therapy module is an effective adjunctive treatment in increasing self-esteem in BPD. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: To study the vocational, service use and relative cost impact for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder of an innovative community-based vocational rehabilitation program. Method(s): Participants were consecutive enrollees in a community-based vocational rehabilitation program who had remained in the program for at least 1 year. Lifetime vocational history and mental health service utilization for 2 years prior and up to 4 years subsequent to program enrolment were studied. Retrospective data were collected using a questionnaire completed by the patient and available family and case workers, patient interview and chart review. Result(s): Months in paid work increased after enrolment, while earned income did not (most work was low wage and/or part-time). Annual inpatient days decreased precipitously, a change which could not be explained by hospitalization trends during the same period. Average relative cost units, based on charges for mental health services used, dropped over 70% following nrolment. Conclusion(s): Community-based vocational rehabilitation may be cost-effective in this population, largely as a result of its impact on hospitalizations and utilization of the most costly services. Such programs represent an important alternative to supported employment that may be particularly suited to cognitively or functionally impaired patients unwilling or unable to work in a competitive environment. © 2006 The Authors; Journal compilation © 2006 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists.

AB  - This randomized controlled trial assessed the efficacy of a five-session version of Skills Training in Affective and Interpersonal Regulation (STAIR) among veterans obtaining treatment in primary care. Veterans who screened positive for either posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or depression (N = 26) were enrolled and randomized into either five-session STAIR or treatment as usual (TAU). Assessments of PTSD symptoms (PTSD Checklist for DSM-5; PCL-5), depression (Beck Depression Inventory-II; BDI-II), emotion regulation (Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale; DERS), and social engagement difficulties (World Health Organization Disability Assessment 2.0; WHODAS-2) were assessed at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 3-month follow-up assessments. Participants assigned to the five-session STAIR condition reported significant improvements on all measures, whereas those assigned to TAU showed no change. Group × Treatment interactions were significant for all outcomes, and effect sizes for the interactions ranged from moderate to large, Hedge's gs = 0.81 for the PCL-5, 1.15 for the BDI-II, 0.75 for the DERS, and 0.81 for the WHODAS-2. The results indicate that five-session STAIR, a brief, skills-focused treatment, may be effective in reducing a range of symptoms and in improving social functioning among veterans treated in primary care settings.

AB  - Background. There is a well-recognized association between substance use and psychotic disorders, sometimes described as 'dual diagnosis'. The use of substances by people with psychosis has a negative impact in terms of symptoms, longitudinal course of illness and psychosocial adjustment. There are few validated treatments for such individuals, and those that do exist are usually impracticable in routine clinical settings. The present study employs a randomized controlled experimental design to examine the effectiveness of a manualized group-based intervention in helping patients with dual diagnosis reduce their substance use. Method. The active intervention consisted of weekly 90-min sessions over 6 weeks. The manualized intervention was tailored to participants' stage of change and motivations for drug use. The control condition was a single educational session. Results. Sixty-three subjects participated, of whom 58 (92%) completed a 3-month follow-up assessment of psychopathology, medication and substance use. Significant reductions in favour of the treatment condition were observed for psychopathology, chlorpromazine equivalent dose of antipsychotics, alcohol and illicit substance use, severity of dependence and hospitalization. Conclusions. It is possible to reduce substance use in individuals with psychotic disorders, using a targeted group-based approach. This has important implications for clinicians who wish to improve the long-term outcome of their patients.

AB  - Background: Illness Management and Recovery (IMR) is a curriculum‐based rehabilitation program for people with severe mental illness with the short‐term aim of improving illness self‐management and the long‐term aim of helping people achieve clinical and personal recovery. Method: Participants with schizophrenia or bipolar disorders were recruited from three community mental health centers in the Capital Region of Denmark and randomized to receive group‐based IMR and treatment as usual or only the usual intervention. All outcomes were assessed at baseline, postintervention, and the one‐year follow‐up. Long‐term outcomes were categorized according to clinical recovery (i.e., symptoms, global functioning, and hospitalization) and personal recovery (i.e., hope and personal agency). Generalized linear mixed model regression analyses were used in the intent‐to‐treat analysis. Results: A total of 198 participants were included. No significant differences were found between the IMR and control groups in the Global Assessment of Functioning one year after the intervention, nor were there significant differences in symptoms, number of hospital admissions, emergency room visits, or outpatient treatment. Conclusion: The present IMR trial showed no significant effect on clinical and personal recovery at the one‐year follow‐up. Together with the results of other IMR studies, the present study indicates that the effect of IMR on symptom severity is unclear, which raises questions regarding the impact of IMR on functioning. Additionally, IMR did not affect personal recovery. Although more research is needed, the results indicate that the development of other interventions should be considered to help people with severe mental illness achieve a better level of functioning and personal recovery. Trial registration: Trial registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01361698).

AB  - Background: Addiction is a multidimensional phenomenon that causes irreparable damages to an individual as well as community structure. Despite enormous efforts made, this phenomenon has not diminished. Therefore, the present study aimed to compare the effectiveness of mindfulness-based group therapy and methadone maintenance therapy in improving the psychological symptoms among opioid-dependent patients. Materials: This was a quasi-experimental study. The sample of this study included 57 patients (each group included 19 individuals) using the convenience sampling method among all those who referred to addiction treatment centers. The tools applied were the clinical interview and the symptom checklist for mental disorders. The obtained data was analyzed using the repeated measures analysis of variance (mixed). Result(s): The results indicated that although both mindfulness-based group therapy and commonly used treatments improved the psychological symptoms among the opioid-dependent patients, the mindfulness-based group therapy was more effective in this regard and it significantly led to an increase in the level of mental health among the opioid-dependent patients after coming off the drugs. Moreover, the results revealed that the effectiveness of these methods could also be observed in the follow-up period. Conclusion(s): According to the results, the mindfulness-based group therapy, compared to the methadone maintenance therapy, was more effective in decreasing risk behaviors among the opioid-dependent patients.Copyright © 2017, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences.

AB  - This study examines the rationale for and relative effectiveness of three intervention models for treating people with severe mental illness and substance abuse disorders: Twelve Step recovery, behavioral skills training, and intensive case management. Using clinical trial methods, 132 dually diagnosed clients were assigned to three service approaches. Changes in client psychosocial outcomes, and psychiatric and substance abuse symptomatology were tracked over a 24-month period. Differential effectiveness was evident, with clients in the behavioral skills group demonstrating the most positive and significant differences in psychosocial functioning and symptomatology, compared with the Twelve Step recovery approach. However, the case management intervention also resulted in several positive and important differences compared with the Twelve Step recovery approach. We also found significant changes over time, not only at 6 months but increasingly positive changes in psychosocial functioning at 12 and 18 months as well. These results underscore the need for clinical trials to further examine the relative cost effectiveness of treatment approaches for dually disordered clients and to incorporate means of assessing subgroup differences so that the interventions being tested can be further refined and targeted to a broad set of needs among the dually diagnosed.

AB  - Family psychoeducation (FPE) is one of six evidence-based practices endorsed by the Center for Mental Health Services for individuals suffering from chronic mental illnesses. Multiple family group psychoeducation (MFG) has been shown to be an effective component of FPE in reducing symptom relapses and rehospitalizations for individuals with schizophrenia. It is especially effective when family members participate on a consistent basis, which allows them to increase their understanding of the biology of the disorder, learn ways to be supportive, reduce stress in the environment and in their own lives, and develop a broader social network. When used in conjunction with medication, MFG can help an individual with schizophrenia progress towards the rehabilitation phase of recovery. A case illustration describes the engagement of a chronically ill, mid-thirties male in MFG and how his family's participation for 2 years benefits all members, in spite of the longevity of his illness. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - AIMS: The present study aimed to evaluate whether individual counselling for alcohol‐dependent patients in three sessions is as effective as a 2‐week group treatment programme as part of an in‐patient stay in a psychiatric hospital which was to foster motivation to seek further help and to strengthen the motivation to stay sober. Of particular importance was the external validity of the results, i.e. a 'normal' intake load of in‐patients in detoxification and a wide variety of motivation to stop drinking were to be investigated. METHODS: Subjects eligible for the study were all patients with alcohol problems admitted to a psychiatric hospital, but without psychosis, as the main diagnosis, and with a maximum of 10 detoxification treatments in the past. A randomized‐controlled trial was conducted with 161 alcohol‐dependent in‐patients who received three individual counselling sessions on their ward in addition to detoxification treatment and 161 in‐patients who received 2 weeks of in‐patient treatment and four out‐patient group sessions in addition to detoxification. Both interventions followed the principles and strategies of motivational interviewing. RESULTS: Six months after intervention, group‐treatment patients showed a higher rate of participation in self‐help groups; however, this difference had disappeared 12 months after treatment. The abstinence rate among the former patients did not differ between the two intervention groups. CONCLUSION: Group treatment may lead to a higher rate of participation in self‐help groups, but does not increase the abstinence rate 6 months after treatment.

AB  - This study examined the use of a brief (6-week) cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for African-American women who were injection drug users (IDU) and/or drug dependent and had the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This exploration addressed the void in research on African-American women who are drug dependent and HIV-positive. To date, such research has been conducted primarily on groups of caucasian gay men. More significantly, the psychotherapeutic community and mental health practitioners have few programs or interventions to meet the needs of HIV-infected women. A convenience sample of 50 women was divided into a control (N = 25) and an experimental (N = 25) group, designed to evaluate the impact of a brief CBT on levels of depression and hopelessness. The Beck-II Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS) were given to each group as pretest and posttest instruments for measuring the levels of depression and hopelessness. The data acquired from this study were analyzed by using the appropriate paired t tests and independent t tests, depending on the underlying data structure and hypothesis being tested. The pre- and post-score comparisons for the experimental and control groups were done using paired t tests, and then the differences for the experimental and control groups were compared using a standard t test. All tests were one-sided hypothesis tests. Results indicated a significant decrease in BDI-II and BHS scores among the experimental group. Further analysis of both test results suggested that brief group CBT decreased depression and hopelessness. Therefore, CBT intervention appeared to mitigate depression and hopelessness with IDU and/or drug dependent, HIV-positive, African-American women who were receiving drug addiction rehabilitative services and HIV medical attention. Based on the significant decrease in the BDI-II and BHS scores for the experimental group, the CBT intervention had a positive effect. These results suggest that African-American women who are drug dependent and HIV positive, often characterized by substance abuse, depression, and hopelessness, can gain the resources they need through CBT intervention, substance abuse treatment, and medication compliance to improve the quality of their lives.

AB  - This study examines self-criticism as a mechanism through which compassion meditation reduces depressive symptoms in low-income African American men and women (N = 59) who had recently attempted suicide. After completing several measures, including the Levels of Self-Criticism Scale and Beck Depression Inventory-II, participants were randomly assigned to receive either a six-session compassion meditation (CM) group (Grady Compassion and Meditation Program) or a six-session support group. As predicted, path analysis results showed that treatment condition led to changes in self-criticism from pre- to posttreatment, with those receiving CM showing greater reductions in levels of self-criticism than those randomized to the support group. Path analyses also revealed that changes in self-criticism fully mediated the link between condition and changes in depressive symptoms. These findings highlight the importance and value of targeting levels of self-criticism in compassion-based interventions to reduce the depressive symptoms of suicidal African Americans.

AB  - A Vet Center's group therapy treatment program for African-American veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has met regularly and expanded since it was established in 1984. Program attributes described by participants as particularly helpful include facilitating open communication of thoughts and feelings among African-American men; providing support for coping with the intrapsychic, social, and economic effects of racism; increasing knowledge about the causes, consequences, and treatment of PTSD; and decreasing emotional and social isolation. The program appears to be a useful treatment for African-American veterans with PTSD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Person‐based cognitive therapy (PBCT) was developed as a treatment for psychosis. The effectiveness of group PBCT was examined in the Mindfulness for Voices (M4V) randomized controlled trial and generated promising results. Group PBCT was implemented as a trans‐diagnostic treatment for distressing voices within the Sussex Voices Clinic (SVC), a specialist secondary care mental health service. AIM: To conduct a service evaluation of engagement, outcomes and cost of group PBCT within SVC, and to compare engagement and outcomes from routine practice with the M4V trial. Secondary aims were to explore predictors of levels of engagement and change in group PBCT. METHOD: Service level data from 95 SVC patients were evaluated. Descriptive statistics, hypothesis tests and linear regression models were used. The primary clinical outcome was voice‐related distress. Engagement levels and pre‐post effect sizes were estimated; associated predictors were explored. RESULTS: Fifty‐nine per cent of patients completed group PBCT within SVC, compared with 72% within M4V. Completers within SVC had lower baseline depression scores compared with non‐completers. There were significant improvements in voice‐related distress (Cohen's d = ‐0.47; p = 0.001), subjective recovery (Cohen's d = 0.35; p = 0.001) and depression (Cohen's d = ‐0.20; p = 0.044); these outcomes were comparable to M4V. Higher baseline subjective recovery and lower depression both predicted improvement in voice‐related distress. Therapy within SVC cost an average of £214 per patient. CONCLUSION: PBCT groups can be delivered trans‐diagnostically in routine clinical practice. Engagement was lower when compared with an RCT, but outcomes were comparable. The low level of resources involved suggests that group PBCT can offer value for money.

AB  - Introduction Preliminary evidence suggests dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) may be beneficial for persons with intellectual disabilities. This pilot randomized controlled trial aimed to determine the feasibility of adapted DBT for adults with intellectual disabilities and co-morbid psychiatric disorders in the community. Methods An adapted DBT programme (aDBT-ID) was delivered to adults with mild-to-moderate intellectual disability (n = 20) and their caregivers (n = 20). A single-blind, mixed-methods design was employed with treatment (n = 10) and control (n = 10). In addition to feasibility, pre-post-measures of emotional regulation, anger and mental health were taken from clients and caregivers. Results Results suggest it was feasible and beneficial to deliver adapted DBT in the community. Qualitative findings found both participants and caregivers were satisfied with the treatment delivery. No differences between conditions were found. Conclusion This pilot study highlights the feasibility of adapted DBT for individuals with intellectual disabilities and the practicalities of delivering community-based inclusive research.

AB  - Objective: This study presents data from a randomized outcome study comparing mentalization‐based and supportive psychotherapy for patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD). Method: Eighty‐five SCID‐II diagnosed borderline patients were randomized to either i) 2years of intensive (twice weekly) combined (individual and group), mentalization‐based psychotherapy (MBT) or ii) 2years of less‐intensive (biweekly) supportive group therapy. Treatment outcome was assessed using a battery of self‐report questionnaires, SCID‐II interviews and therapist‐rated global assessment of functioning (GAF). Results: Fifty‐eight patients completed 2years of treatment. Significant changes in both treatment groups were identified for several outcome measures, including self‐reported measures of general functioning, depression, social functioning and number of diagnostic criteria met for BPD, as outlined by the SCID‐II interview. General linear modelling was used to compare treatment outcome in the two groups. Only GAF showed a significantly higher outcome in the MBT group. A trend was found for a higher rate of recovery from BPD in the MBT group. Pre‐post effect sizes were high (0.5‐2.1) and for the most part highly significant in both groups. Conclusion: The study indicates that both MBT and supportive treatment are highly effective in treating BPD when conducted by a well‐trained and experienced psychodynamic staff in a well‐organized clinic. 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB  - Background and objectives: Psychological and psychosocial interventions proved to be effective in treatment of depression. The main objective of this study is to examine the effects of psychosocial day care program on the quality of life and clinical symptoms of persons with depression. Methods: In a controlled trial, 114 participants aged 20 or older with ICD-10 major depression were recruited after they being discharged from in-patient treatment. The intervention group (n = 59) received a 4-month group psychosocial program consisting of psychoeducation, social skills training and therapeutic community, and the control group (n = 55) received the usual care. Participants were assessed three times: at baseline, at the end-of-treatment and at 6-months follow-up. The outcome measures were the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale and Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life. Results: The intervention group had significantly larger symptom reduction compared to control group (F (1,98) = 15.11, p < 0.01), at both second assessment (-8.31 +/- 0.78, p < 0.01) and third assessment (-10.7 +/- 0.69, p < 0.01). Both groups showed significant reduction in depressive symptoms over study time (F (1.53, 150.28) = 228.01, p < 0.01). The psychosocial intervention program had no statistically significant effect on subjective quality of life. Conclusion: The psychosocial intervention program led to significant reduction of depressive symptoms but had no effect on patients' subjective quality of life.

AB  - Background: In this effectiveness trial we compared the long-term effects on hospitalizations of group psychoeducation (GP) versus individual psychoeducation (IP) for a heterogeneous sample of patients with BD recruited from general clinical settings.Methods: Eighty-five patients with BD were randomized to receive 10 weekly sessions of GP followed by 8 booster-sessions over the next two years, or three sessions of IP. Time to first admission over the course of GP was the primary outcome measure, with additional outcomes examining the use of psychiatric services over about 8 years.Results: Patients allocated to GP had longer survival time compared to IP over 27 months (p<0.05). There were also group differences in survival time over 8 years, but treatment allocation alone was no longer a significant predictor of survival time (p=0.07). There was an interaction between group (GP/IP) and harmful substance use (HSU), such that GP cases with comorbid HSU had the shortest survival time, whilst GP cases without HSU survived the longest (p=0.02). Also, GP cases had a small but significant reduction in hospital use compared with IP (p=0.04).Limitations: We did not have a 'pure' treatment as usual group. Wide confidence intervals for some of the odds ratios suggest that the findings need to be treated with some caution. Insufficient sample size for more detailed subgroup analyses.Conclusions: GP is superior to IP in delaying hospitalizations in a clinically representative population. However, GP did not prevent or delay admissions in BD patients with HSU.

AB  - Background: Schizophrenia is a disabling illness. Social cognition and interaction training (SCIT) seeks to improve patients' social functioning by alleviating deficits in social cognition. SCIT has shown promise in improving social cognition in patients with schizophrenia, but has not yet been studied in Japan. Design: An assessor-masked, randomized, parallel-group clinical trial was conducted to compare the feasibility and efficacy of SCIT with treatment as usual (TAU). Setting: Participants were recruited from outpatient clinics at the National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry and four other hospitals in Japan. Participants: Seventy-two patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder consented to participate in the trial. Procedure: Participants were randomly allocated to either a SCIT subgroup or a TAU subgroup. SCIT is a manual-based group intervention that is delivered in 20-24-h-long weekly sessions. Groups include two to three clinicians and four to eight patients. Hypotheses: We hypothesized that SCIT would be found to be feasible and that patients who were randomized to receive SCIT would exhibit improvements in social cognition. Results: Data from 32 participants in each subgroup were entered into analyses. The persistence rate in the SCIT subgroup was 88.9%, and the average attendance rate was 87.0%. Intrinsic motivation was significantly higher in the SCIT subgroup than the TAU group during the first half of the program. Mixed effects modeling of various outcome measures revealed no significant interaction between measurement timepoint and group any measures, including social cognition, neurocognition, symptom severity, and social functioning. In the case of the social cognition measure, significant change was observed only in the SCIT subgroup; however, the interaction between timepoint and group failed to reach significance. In an exploratory subgroup analysis, a shorter duration of illness was found to be associated with significantly better improvement on the social cognition measure in the SCIT subgroup compared with the TAU subgroup. Conclusions: In terms of the primary objective, the relatively low dropout rate observed in the present study suggests that SCIT is feasible and well tolerated by patients with schizophrenia in Japan. This view is also supported by participants' relatively high attendance and intrinsic motivation.

The study sample comprised 92 individuals (The current study was designed to assess the effect of a psychoeducation program on relapse rate, social functioning, perceived wellness, and ways of coping in individuals with substance use disorder (SUD). The study sample comprised 92 individuals (n = 46 intervention group, n = 46 control group) who received SUD treatment, had undergone detoxification, and agreed to participate in the study. A 10-session psychoeducation program was applied to individuals in the intervention group. Data collection included a urine sample and completion of the Personal Information Form, Social Functioning Scale, Perceived Wellness Scale, and Ways of Coping Scale. The relapse rate in the control group was found to be higher than in the intervention group; thus, it was determined that the relapse prevention psychoeducation program led to positive changes in relapse rate, social functioning, perceived wellness, and stress in individuals with SUD.

AB  - Objective: Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) has shown efficacy in randomized controlled trials. No reports exist on IPT for depressed patients with severe psychiatric comorbidities in public outpatient clinics. This pilot feasibility study assessed preliminary effectiveness and patient satisfaction with IPT for depressed patients with psychiatric comorbidities in municipal outpatient care in Turku, Finland. Because lengthy treatment strains mental healthcare resources, this trial also assessed the potential for IPT, a time-limited treatment, to discharge patients successfully. Method: Seven clinicians in two municipal clinics were briefly trained to deliver IPT, while clinicians in two other clinics provided treatment as usual (TAU). Twenty-six patients with moderate to severe major depressive disorder received IPT for 16 weeks, and a control group ( n == 20) received TAU. Seventy-six percent of patients had concurrent anxiety disorders, 73% personality disorders and 20% alcohol dependence. As 61% of patients received concurrent pharmacotherapy, the study lacked statistical power to find outcome differences between treatment groups. Results: Depressive symptoms, social functioning and self-perceived health improved notably in both groups. The mean Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) score decreased from 20 to 10. Using HAMD ≤ 7 as a cutoff, 28.3% of patients achieved remission. Patients receiving IPT reported significantly greater satisfaction with their treatment and were more often able to terminate treatment after 16 sessions. Conclusions: Both treatments were effective in this small, highly comorbid sample. Conducting IPT appeared feasible in municipal outpatient clinics and offered some advantages over TAU. It was possible to train staff quickly. These results warrant a further, larger randomized trial.

AB  - AimsTo test the efficacy of a brief intervention to reduce alcohol or drug use and to promote use of addiction services among patients seeking mental health treatment.Design and settingA multi‐centre, longitudinal, two‐group randomized controlled trial with randomization within each of two mental health treatment systems located in Ventura County and Los Angeles County in California, USA.ParticipantsA total of 718 patients (49.2% female) aged 18 and older with a mental health diagnosis and either a heavy drinking day or any use of cannabis or stimulants in the past 90 days.Intervention and comparatorA motivation‐based brief intervention with personalized feedback (screening, brief intervention and referral to treatment (SBIRT) condition) (n = 354) or a health education session (control condition) (n = 364).MeasurementsPrimary outcomes included frequency of heavy drinking days, days of cannabis use and days of stimulant use at the primary end‐point 3 months post‐baseline. Secondary outcomes included frequency and abstinence from substance use out to a 12‐month follow‐up and the use of addiction treatment services.FindingsParticipants in the SBIRT condition had fewer heavy drinking days [odds ratio (OR) = 0.53; 95% credible interval (CrI) = 0.48–0.6] and fewer days of stimulant use (OR = 0.58; 95% CrI = 0.50–0.66) at the 3‐month follow‐up compared with participants in the health education condition. Participants in the SBIRT condition did not comparatively reduce days of cannabis use at the 3‐month follow‐up (OR = 0.93; 95% CrI = 0.85–1.01). Secondary outcomes indicated sustained effects of SBIRT on reducing the frequency of heavy drinking days and days of stimulant use. No effects were observed on abstinence rates or use of addiction treatment services.ConclusionsScreening and brief intervention for unhealthy alcohol and drug use in mental health treatment settings were effective at reducing the frequency of heavy drinking and stimulant use.

AB  - Objective: We conducted a pilot study comparing problem solving therapy for primary care (PST-PC) to a dietary education control condition in middle-aged and older veterans with symptoms of emotional distress and subsyndromal depression.Methods: This was a two-site study at the VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System and Philadelphia VA Medical Center. Participants included veterans >50 years of age referred from primary care clinics who were eligible if they obtained a pre-screen score >11 on the Centers for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale. Exclusions were a DSM-IV Major Depressive Episode within the past year, active substance abuse/dependence within 1 month, current antidepressant therapy, and a Mini mental status exam score <24. Participants were randomized to receive one of two interventions--either PST-PC or an attention control condition consisting of dietary education (DIET)--each consisting of six to eight sessions within a 4-month period.Results: Of 45 individuals randomized, 23 (11 PST-PC and 12 DIET) completed treatment. Using regression models in completers that examined outcomes at end of treatment while controlling for baseline scores, there were significant differences between treatment groups in SF-36 mental health component scores but not in depressive symptoms (as assessed with either the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression or the Beck Depression Inventory), social problem solving skills, or physical health status (SF-36 physical health component score).Conclusions: These pilot study findings suggest that a six-to-eight session version of PST-PC may lead to improvements in mental health functioning in primary care veterans with subsyndromal depressive symptoms.

AB  - The use of the typical kinds of group therapy methods seemed to be becoming less effective with one group of patients making up the population of the Day Treatment Center. The ventilation & verbalization about past experiences normally done previously did not yield results for this group of long-term psychiatric patients. The group had reached a plateau where improvement in social skills & personal problem-solving ability were no longer evident. The number of absences increased, & there was an attitude of general disinterest in the purpose of the group. The experimental group was exposed to a period of very structured setting in group therapy. The members were verbal & displayed some evidence of insight & an ability to problem-solve. Originally there were 14 members of the group. Eight of them were diagnosed as schizophrenic reaction, 2 were diagnosed as psychoneurotic, 1 an active depressive, 1 a chronic brain syndrome, & 1 arteriosclerosis. One of the schizophrenic patients also had had 2 lobotomies. The structured techniques included the following therapy medias: simplified encounter & sensitivity training, self-improvement exploration, life enrichment experiences, tell-a-story, & weekly goal setting & reward. The therapist shared with the group methods for evaluating their progress, & they were encouraged to assist in the evaluation. An increase of interest was shown by the members wishing to continue the structured type of group therapy. There was an increase of 23% in attendance during the experimental period. In the self-evaluations, the members recorded that they had made improvement in from 1 to 17 areas. The therapist recorded improvement among the members in from 2 to 11 areas. The amount of awareness was increased; ie, awareness of others, objects, & their own needs. The therapist felt that the forward motion of the members was just beginning at the end of the experimental period, & it did indeed take a lot of time to develop awareness, break down barriers, & replace them with hopefulness & a desire to live for today instead of in the past. More body-image type sessions should be used since this was the most anxiety-producing area, & the area where the most help is needed for these people. The group was able to handle the evaluative process very well & showed a great deal of interest in that part of the experimental period. Patients are capable of self-evaluation if given encouragement & direction without criticism. AA.

AB  - Objectives. The aim of the Condition Management Programme (CMP) is to help Incapacity Benefit recipients manage their health conditions more effectively and return to work. This paper seeks to examine the clinical and employment outcomes from a group-based and mixed-condition CMP. Design. In a prospective cohort design, measures of employment status and psychological well-being were taken at three time points; pre-CMP, post-CMP, and at 3-month follow-up. Method. Participants (N = 2,064) with a variety of physical and mental health conditions voluntarily attended a seven session cognitive-behaviourally informed psychoeducational group intervention. The psychological measures used were the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation - Outcome Measure, Work and Social Adjustment Scale, Self-Efficacy Scale, and the Intrinsic Motivation Scale. The employment status of participants was also measured at the three time points of the evaluation. Results. Following CMP, 50% of participants experienced a reliable improvement in psychological well-being and 26% had either taken some steps towards work or returned to work at follow-up. Participants with a mental health condition were more likely to experience a reliable improvement in psychological well-being compared to those with physical health conditions. Conclusions. The results suggest that participation in CMP may be helpful in facilitating more effective self-management of the health conditions contributing to unemployment. The results have implications for whether formal employment assistance should be available in mental health services. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Objective: Although many studies have documented patterns of emotional distress in persons with HIV disease, there have been few controlled evaluations of therapy outcomes with these individuals. This research evaluated the effects of brief cognitive-bebavioral or social support group therapy with this population. Method: Sixty-eight depressed men with HIV infection were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: eight-session cognitive-bebavioral groups, eight-session social support groups, or a comparison condition. Before and after intervention and at 3-month follow-up, all participants were individually assessed by using measures of symptoms of distress as well as substance use and sexual practices. Results: Relative to the comparison group, both the cognitive-behavioral and social support group therapies produced reductions in depression, hostility, and somatization. The social support intervention also produced reductions in overall psychiatric symptoms and tended to reduce maladaptive interpersonal sensitivity, anxiety, and frequency of unprotected receptive anal intercourse, while the cognitive-bebavioral intervention resulted in less frequent illicit drug use during the follow-up period. Tests for clinical significance of change particularly underscored benefits of the social support group intervention both at postintervention and at long-term follow-up. Conclusions: Brief group therapy for depressed persons with HIV infection produced reductions in symptoms of distress. The two forms of therapy resulted in shared and unique improvements in functioning, although social support groups focused on emotional coping presented greater evidence of clinically significant change. As more persons contract HIV infection and live longer with HIV disease, further research is needed to evaluate outcomes of mental health services with these individuals.

AB  - Background: A common clinical continuing care referral among alcohol/drug use disorder treatment programs for both adults and adolescents is to link patients to recovery supportive 12-step mutual-help organizations (MHOs) such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA) in order to help prevent relapse and promote long-term recovery. While numerous treatments designed to link patients with these free community peer recovery resources have been developed and tested among adults (i.e., "Twelve-Step Facilitation [TSF]"), none have been developed and tested among young people. Specific development and testing of youth-focused TSF is necessary because young people face more developmentally-specific barriers to 12-step MHO engagement. The lack of any experimental research represents a notable gap in the evidence-base regarding the efficacy of TSF for young people. This study is the first to develop and experimentally test using a randomized controlled design an integrated TSF (iTSF) treatment for outpatient youths with SUD. Design(s): Randomized controlled trial testing iTSF against Motivational enhancement therapy (MET)/Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). Treatments consisted of two individual and eight group therapy sessions delivered over approximately 10 weeks. Validated measures assessed percent days abstinent, longest period of abstinence, proportion abstinent/mostly abstinent, alcohol/drug consequences, and psychiatric symptoms, with follow-ups at mid-treatment, end of treatment and at 6 and 9 months later. Result(s): Adolescents assigned to iTSF were significantly more likely to attend 12-step meetings during treatment (58%vs. 18%, p < 0.001). Accounting for baseline differences, patients assigned to iTSF had significantly fewer substance-related consequences during the follow up period relative to MET/CBT patients (p < 0.003). Findings also suggested longer periods of continuous abstinence favoring iTSF over time, but did not reach statistical significance. Conclusion(s): This integrated Twelve-step Facilitation (iTSF) treatment appears promising in the treatment of adolescents with alcohol/drug use disorders. Relative to current state-of-the-science treatments such as MET/CBT, iTSF may be particularly useful at helping young people participate in 12-step mutual-help meetings, reduce negative consequences related to their substance use, and possibly achieve longer periods of sustained abstinence.

AB  - This study evaluated several statistical models for estimating treatment effects in a randomized, longitudinal experiment comparing assertive community treatment (ACT) versus brokered case management (BCM). In addition, mediator and moderator analyses were conducted. The ACT clients had improved outcomes in terms of housing and psychiatric symptoms than BCM clients. Case management housing assistance and financial assistance partially mediated housing outcomes. No reliable mediators were found for psychiatric symptoms, and no reliable moderators were found for either housing or psychiatric symptoms. The study also made several important methodological advances in the analysis of longitudinal data in randomized experiments. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Frequent emergency department (ED) users experiencing homelessness are associated with high costs for healthcare systems yet interventions for this group have been minimally investigated. This study used 24-month data from a multisite randomized controlled trial of Housing First (HF) to examine how effective the intervention is in helping frequent ED users with a mental illness to achieve housing stability, improve behavioural health and functioning, and reduce their ED use. Findings showed that HF is effective in stably housing frequent ED users despite their complex health needs. Reductions in ED use and substance use problems, and improvements in mental health symptoms and community functioning were found for frequent ED users in both the HF and treatment as usual conditions.

AB  - Objective: This study examined the effectiveness of solution-focused brief therapy (SFBT) intervention on substance abuse and trauma-related problems. Methods: A randomized controlled trial design was used to evaluate the effectiveness of SFBT in primary substance use treatment services for child welfare involved parents in outpatient treatment for substance use disorders. Mixed linear models were used to test within- and between-group changes using intent-to-treat analysis (N = 64). Hedges’s g effect sizes were also calculated to examine magnitude of treatment effects. Results: Both groups decreased on the Addiction Severity Index-Self-Report and the Trauma Symptom Checklist-40. The between group effect sizes were not statistically significant on either measures, thus SFBT produced similar results as the research supported treatments the control group received. Conclusion: Results support the use of SFBT in treating substance use and trauma and provide an alternative approach that is more strengths based and less problem focused.

AB  - Background: "Mindfulness-based" interventions show promise for stress reduction in general medical conditions, and initial evidence suggests that they are accepted in trauma-exposed individuals. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) shows substantial efficacy for prevention of depression relapse, but it has been less studied in anxiety disorders. This study investigated the feasibility, acceptability, and clinical outcomes of an MBCT group intervention adapted for combat posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).Methods: Consecutive patients seeking treatment for chronic PTSD at a VA outpatient clinic were enrolled in 8-week MBCT groups, modified for PTSD (four groups, n = 20) or brief treatment-as-usual (TAU) comparison group interventions (three groups, n = 17). Pre and posttherapy psychological assessments with clinician administered PTSD scale (CAPS) were performed with all patients, and self-report measures (PTSD diagnostic scale, PDS, and posttraumatic cognitions inventory, PTCI) were administered in the MBCT group.Results: Intent to treat analyses showed significant improvement in PTSD (CAPS (t(19) = 4.8, P < .001)) in the MBCT condition but not the TAU conditions, and a significant Condition × Time interaction (F[1,35] = 16.4, P < .005). MBCT completers (n = 15, 75%) showed good compliance with assigned homework exercises, and significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PTSD symptom severity on posttreatment assessment in CAPS and PDS (particularly in avoidance/numbing symptoms), and reduced PTSD-relevant cognitions in PTCI (self blame).Conclusions: These data suggest group MBCT as an acceptable brief intervention/adjunctive therapy for combat PTSD, with potential for reducing avoidance symptom cluster and PTSD cognitions. Further studies are needed to examine efficacy in a randomized controlled design and to identify factors influencing acceptability and efficacy.

AB  - Background: Interventions for offenders with mental illness have tended to be confined to treatment of illness, with the expectation that symptom reduction will be accompanied by reduced criminal recidivism, but recent evidence suggests that other treatment targets may be more effective against recidivism. Aim: The aim of this study was to examine the effect of a cognitive skills programme (Reasoning and Rehabilitation 2: Short Version for Adults [R&R2]) among offenders with mental illness. Our first hypothesis was that participation in this programme would result in significantly greater improvement in antisocial attitudes than among similar prisoners who did not participate; both groups received 'treatment as usual' (TAU). Our second hypothesis was that those receiving R&R2 would show less post‐treatment violent or general recidivism than those receiving TAU alone. Method: Incarcerated offenders with serious mental illness (N = 101) were randomly assigned to R&R2 or TAU alone. Criminal attitudes and mental state were examined before and after treatment. Violent and non‐violent recidivism was measured, on average, 18 months after release. Results: In both intervention and TAU alone trial arms, there were significant pre‐ to post‐treatment changes in criminal attitudes and symptoms or signs of mental disorder. There was no difference between groups in these respects. These pre/post changes were not associated with reductions in recidivism over time, whether or not controlling for baseline risk. Conclusions: Although there was no demonstrable advantage of R&R2 over TAU alone, non‐significant trends towards lower violent recidivism in the R&R2 group and general recidivism in the TAU group suggest that it may be worth repeating the trial in a larger sample with more differentiated control groups.

AB  - Background: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is prevalent in both homeless and nonhomeless veterans. Purpose: To examine unique characteristics of being homeless that may influence PTSD treatment completion and clinical success. Methods: Twenty-three veterans who were homeless and residing in a homeless shelter, along with 94 veterans from the community, were enrolled to receive one to five sessions of Accelerated Resolution Therapy (ART), an emerging trauma-focused therapy for symptoms of PTSD. Rates of treatment completion with ART and acute and 6-month change in symptoms of PTSD were compared in an observational (nonrandomized) manner by housing status. Findings: Compared to veterans recruited from the community, veterans residing in the homeless shelter were older and presented with more extensive psychopathology yet had less combat exposure while being more likely to have experienced sexual assault. Rates of treatment completion were 52.2% (12 of 23) among homeless veterans compared to 81.9% (77 of 94) among veterans from the community (p = .005). Among treatment completers, both groups received an average of four sessions of ART. Reduction of symptoms of PTSD was substantial and nonsignificantly greater among homeless veterans vs. those treated from the community (p = .14), as were comorbidity reductions in depression, anxiety, sleep quality, pain, and improved quality of life. Results at 6-month posttreatment follow-up were similar. Conclusions: Although limited by small sample size and a nonrandomized design, ART appears to be an effective, brief treatment for symptoms of PTSD among veterans residing in a homeless shelter. However, development of effective strategies to maximize treatment completion among homeless veterans is needed.

AB  - Background: There is strong evidence that Housing First interventions are effective in improving housing stability and quality of life among homeless people with mental illness and addictions. However, there is very little evidence on the effectiveness of Housing First in improving substance use-related outcomes in this population. This study uses a randomized control design to examine the effects of scatter-site Housing First on substance use outcomes in a large urban centre. Methods: Substance use outcomes were compared between a Housing First intervention and treatment as usual group in a sample of 575 individuals experiencing homelessness and mental illness, with or without a co-occurring substance use problem, in the At Home/Chez Soi trial in Toronto, Canada. Generalized linear models were used to compare study arms with respect to change in substance use outcomes over time (baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 month). Results: At 24 months, participants in the Housing First intervention had significantly greater reductions in number of days experiencing alcohol problems and amount of money spent on alcohol than participants in the Treatment as Usual group. No differences between the study arms in illicit drug outcomes were found at 24 months. Conclusions: These findings show that a Housing First intervention can contribute to reductions in alcohol problems over time. However, the lack of effect of the intervention on illicit drug problems suggests that individuals experiencing homelessness, mental illness and drug problems may need additional supports to reduce use.

AB  - Recent research has shown that social integration, involving community integration and social support, can be protective resources for the health of homeless individuals. However, it is not clear how social integration affects health in the transition from homelessness into housing, and subsequent housing retention. This paper examines, through mixed quantitative and qualitative methods, how social integration changes over time, and how these changes relate to housing stability, substance use and mental health outcomes among a sample of homeless individuals experiencing mental illness participating in the At Home/Chez Soi Housing First randomized controlled trial in Canada. Longitudinal quantitative data (baseline, 6, 12, 24 month) and qualitative data (18 month) from the five trial sites (Moncton, Montreal, Toronto, Winnipeg and Vancouver) were examined using mixed models, mediation analyses, and thematic analysis. Social integration (i.e., social network size, social interest, psychological integration) increased over time among study participants, with social network size increasing significantly more among Housing First participants than Treatment as Usual participants. Social network size mediated the effect of the intervention on the percentage of days in stable housing, indicating that the Housing First intervention may have increased participants' social network size, which in turn increased the percentage of days stably housed. No significant mediation of social integration on the effects of the intervention on mental health and substance use outcomes was found. Findings from the qualitative interviews support and expand upon these quantitative findings. • Social integration differed between Housing First (HF) and Treatment as Usual groups over time. • Social network size mediated the effect of HF on the percentage of days in stable housing. • HF programs should incorporate key service components that facilitate social integration.

AB  - The authors introduce an innovative group intervention for treating late-life depression—one based on C. R. Snyder's Hope Theory and the authors' goal-focused model of hope. The intervention was tailored to reduce functional disabilities and other symptoms of major depression among patients who had not achieved remission with medication or other types of psychotherapy, and special attention was paid to patients' persistent symptoms of hopelessness. The authors outline Synder's Hope Theory and describe how it was used in group therapy to help patients identify and achieve practical, individualized goals. Compared to equally depressed older outpatients in an alternative group-therapeutic (control) procedure known to be somewhat effective in reducing depressive symptomatology, outpatients in the new, hope-inspired Goal-Focused Group Psychotherapy (GFGP) displayed clear decreases in anxiety, hopelessness, and functional disability, as well as improvements in social-interactive behaviors. The success of this small-scale study of depressed community-dwelling elders prompts the authors to standardize their GFGP for use in clinical trials with a broader range of patients in a variety of treatment settings.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: There is little work demonstrating the effectiveness of cognitive behaviourally oriented interventions in routine service settings. This pragmatic trial is designed to test the impact of a group treatment service on relapse rates under the conditions of routine health care. METHOD: A total of 169 schizophrenia patients were randomly allocated either to a comprehensive cognitive behaviourally oriented service (CBOS) or to treatment as usual (TAU). The primary outcome is the time until the first relapse after discharge from hospital. Relapse was defined as an increase in positive or negative symptoms as assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Survival analysis has been conducted up to the 6‐month assessment. RESULTS: The mean time to relapse after discharge from hospital in the CBOS group was significantly longer than in the TAU group (log rank test, P = 0.033). This was due to less exacerbations regarding negative symptoms in the CBOS condition (log rank test, P = 0.014). The number of social contacts was improved in the CBOS group only. CONCLUSION: The CBOS intervention appears to be beneficial in reducing early negative symptom exacerbations.

AB  - Background: Traumatic experiences and, more specifically, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are highly prevalent among substance use disorder (SUD) patients. This comorbidity is associated with worse treatment outcomes in substance use treatment programs and more crisis interventions. International guidelines advise an integrated approach to the treatment of trauma related problems and SUD. Seeking Safety is an integrated treatment program that was developed in the United States. The aim of the current study is to test the efficacy of this program in the Netherlands in an outpatient SUD population. Methods/Design: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be used to test the efficacy of Seeking Safety compared to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) in a population of SUD outpatients. Each treatment will consist of 12 group sessions. The primary outcome measure will be substance use severity. Secondary outcome measures are PTSD and trauma symptoms, coping skills, functioning, and cognitions. Questionnaires will be administered at the start of treatment, at the end of treatment (three months after the start of treatment) and at follow-up (six months after the start of treatment). Discussion: This study protocol presents a RCT in which the efficacy of an integrated treatment for comorbid PTSD and SUD, Seeking Safety, is evaluated in a SUD outpatient population compared to CBT. It is expected that the intervention group will show significantly more improvement in substance use severity compared to the control group at end-of-treatment and at follow-up. Furthermore, a lower drop-out rate is expected for the intervention group. If the intervention proves to be effective, it can be implemented. A cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted to evaluate the two treatments [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of BMC Psychiatry is the property of BioMed Central and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

AB  - CONTEXT: Evidence‐based interventions to improve medication adherence among patients with schizophrenia are lacking. Although family psychoeducation has demonstrated efficacy in improving outcomes in schizophrenia, empirical support for its ability to enhance medication adherence is scarce. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a culturally adapted, multifamily group (MFG) therapy would increase medication adherence and decrease psychiatric hospitalizations for Spanish‐speaking Mexican Americans with schizophrenia. DESIGN: A total of 174 Mexican American adults with schizophrenia‐spectrum disorder and their key relatives were studied in a 3‐armed, randomized controlled trial of MFG therapy focused on improving medication adherence. Assessments occurred at baseline and at 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24 months. SETTING: Two community mental health centers in Los Angeles, California. PARTICIPANTS: Patients had a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder with a recent exacerbation of psychotic symptoms and nonadherence to medication before enrollment. Intervention Patients participated in 1 of 2 MFGs (MFG‐adherence or MFG‐standard) or treatment as usual. Groups convened twice monthly in 90‐minute sessions for 1 year. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Treatment Compliance Interview uses multiple sources of information to quantify medication adherence. Computerized records were used to collect information on the use of inpatient resources. RESULTS: At the end of the 1‐year treatment, MFG‐adherence was associated with higher medication adherence than MFG‐standard or treatment as usual only (F = 6.41; P = .003). The MFG‐adherence participants had a longer time to first hospitalization (χ(2) = 13.3; P = .001) and were less likely to be hospitalized than those in MFG‐standard (χ(2) = 8.2; P = .04) and treatment as usual alone (χ(2) = 11.3; P < .001). Increased adherence accounted for one‐third of the overall effect of treatment on the reduced risk for psychiatric hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Multifamily group therapy specifically tailored to improve medication adherence through a focus on the beliefs and attitudes of the target population is associated with improved outcome for Mexican American adults with schizophrenia‐spectrum disorders.

AB  - Introduction: The fight against discrimination and stigmatization of consumers of mental health services is a priority for the WHO and WPA. The purpose of the psychoeducation - destigmatisation of mental disorder and mental health care, an understanding of the society daily living of the consumers of psychiatric care and their families. Objective: Comprehensive survey of 97 patients with schizophrenia in a period of stabilization. The main group - 67 patients in whom therapy used psychopharmacotherapy, psychoeducation and training. Control - 30 patients receiving psychopharmacotherapy. Aims: To estimate the effectiveness of psychoeducational programs in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia. Methods: Trainings were conducted in closed groups, the number of participants from 6 to 12 people. Each cycle consisted of 12 psychoeducation sessions lasting 2.0 hours with a frequency of 2 times per week. In our work we used an integrative model of psychoeducation includes information modules, techniques of cognitive-behavioral therapy, problem-oriented discussion, family therapy. Results: Analysis of the dynamics of social functioning and quality of life of patients with schizophrenia before and after psychoeducation showed that they increased in the intervention group significantly greater and more sustained than in the control group, especially in areas such as the general welfare, health, performance, family relationships and social contacts. Conclusions: Psychoeducation not only increases the volume of knowledge increases confidence in combating the disease, but it solves the problem of social reintegration of the patient.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies have suggested that therapeutic climbing/bouldering may have positive effects on perceived self‐efficacy. Nevertheless, there is still an urgent need for high‐quality studies, as many existing studies have suffered from methodological problems. Therefore, the current work was aimed at investigating the effect of a manualized bouldering psychotherapy (BPT) on perceived self‐efficacy in people with depression, compared with a home‐based physical exercise program (EP) and state‐of‐the‐art cognitive behavioral group therapy (CBT). METHODS: In a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial, 233 people with depression were randomly assigned to one group (BPT, EP, or CBT). Perceived self‐efficacy was assessed at baseline (t0) and directly after the 10‐week intervention period (t1) with the GSE. In addition, depression was assessed with the PHQ‐9 and the MADRS. We computed t tests, analyses of variance (ANOVAs), confounder‐adjusted hierarchical regression analyses, mediation analyses, and several sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: BPT participants showed a significantly larger increase in perceived self‐efficacy on the GSE compared with the EP (an increase of 3.04 vs. 1.26 points, p = .016, Cohen's d = 0.39). In the confounder‐adjusted hierarchical multiple regression analysis, group allocation (BPT vs. EP) was found to be the only significant predictor of the postintervention GSE score (β = .16, p = .014) besides the baseline GSE score (β = .69, p < .001). No differences were found between BPT and CBT participants regarding the effect on perceived self‐efficacy. Only in the CBT group, the relationship between depression at baseline and postintervention was partially mediated (23%) by perceived self‐efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Participation in the manualized BPT in a group setting leads to a clinically relevant enhancement of perceived self‐efficacy in people with depression. This effect is superior to that of physical exercise alone. The results provide also initial indications that BPT is comparable to CBT in enhancing perceived self‐efficacy, suggesting a strong case for a broader use of BPT as a supplement to existing health services. Future studies should focus on the modes of action of BPT and its effect on perceived self‐efficacy in people with other mental or physical disorders.

AB  - Statement of Problem Or Question (One Sentence): Individuals with complex medical and social needs often have behavioral health (BH) problems that impair their ability for self-care, but rates of referrals for and attendance at BH specialists' appointments are low. Objectives of Program/Intervention (No More Than Three Objectives): 1. Develop a group therapy approach to BH integrated into and led by members of the primary care clinic. 2. Improve the rate of BH care through attendance at group therapy sessions, over conventional referrals to BH specialists outside of the clinic. Description of Program/Intervention, Including Organizational Context (E.G. Inpatient Vs. Outpatient, Practice or Community Characteristics): The Comprehensive Care Program (CCP) at the University of Chicago provides continuity care for Medicare patients at high risk for hospitalization in both outpatient and inpatient settings. The team includes a licensed clinical social worker with training in BH care. Multi-disciplinary rounds occur daily, allowing referral patients for BH care via warm hand-offs. Noting the common challenges among CCP patients in attending appointments, a BH group therapy progam was created due to several advantages over individual therapy: a safe space for those not comfortable with psychotherapy; support from peers with similar health and social problems; more efficiency for providers. Patients who expressed interest were enrolled and scheduled into a 5 week group therapy module. Participants are encouraged to establish personal goals and are taught skills of mindfulness, emotion regulation, distress tolerance, interpersonal effectiveness, and self-compassion. In order to accommodate barriers to attendance (e.g. illness, transportation) participants are allowed to drop in to the group throughout the year. Measures of Success (Discuss Qualitative And/Or Quantitative Metrics Which Will Be Used To Evaluate Program/Intervention): We compared the attendance rate of enrollees in the CCP group therapy program to the same enrollees' referral rate and attendance rate to BH specialists' appointments outside of the CCP program (psychiatry or psychology at Univ of Chicago or other institutions). We performed a retrospective chart review of those enrollees to investigate 1) who attended at least one CCP group session, 2) who had been referred to a BH specialist in the prior 12 months, and 3) who had attended at least one BH specialist appointment in the prior 12 months. Findings To Date (It Is Not Sufficient To State Findings Will Be Discussed): Twelve patients expressed interest and were scheduled into a 5-week group therapy program. Ten were female, the average age was 61, all were African-American. Of these, six (50%) attended at least one group session. Of the twelve, six had been previously referred to a BH specialist outside of CCP in the prior 12 months, but only two (33%) had attended an appointment. Of the six who attended a group session, only two had been previously referred for outside BH care (33%), and only one attended their appointment (17%). Among the six who enrolled in CCP group therapy but did not attend, four had been previously referred but only one actually attended an outside BH specialist (17%). Key Lessons For Dissemination (What Can Others Take Away For Implementation To Their Practice Or Community?): Integrating a group therapy approach to BH care into a program for high-risk patients with high rates of BH problems may improve attendance for at least their first experience with BH care.

AB  - Background. Treatment of drug addiction is complex; hence there is a debate in the field of what is the best approach. An honest desire to stop using drugs is the entry ticket into the self-help programmes Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA); these groups are a possible supplement to ordinary treatment. They employ the twelve-step programme and are found in most large cities in Norway and around the world. The usefulness of these groups has been disputed, and few Norwegian treatment facilities have developed a systematic cooperation with them. The purpose of this study was to examine whether the use of self-help groups is associated with higher rates of abstinence two years after participants started attending groups. Materials and methods. 114 patients, 59 with alcohol addiction and 55 with drug addiction, who started in self-help groups after a drug treatment, were approached two years later with a questionnaire. The response rate was 66%; 6 (5%) patients were dead. Results. Intention to treat analysis showed that 38% participated in self-help programmes two years after treatment. Of regular participants, 81% had been abstinent over the previous 6 months, compared with only 26% among non-participants. Logistic regression analysis showed odds ratio = 12.6, 95% CI (4.1-38.3), p < 0.001, for participation and abstinence. Conclusion. The study has several methodological problems; particularly that correlation does not necessarily indicate causality. These problems are discussed here; the conclusion is that the probability of a positive effect is strong enough to recommend participation in self-help groups as a supplement to drug addiction treatment.

AB  - This study assessed the impact of steady competitive or noncompetitive employment on nonvocational outcomes for clients with severe mental illness receiving employment services. We conducted a secondary analysis of 2-year data for 187 clients participating in a randomized controlled trial comparing two employment programs. Participants were classified according to 2-year employment outcomes into four groups: steady competitive work, steady noncompetitive work, minimal work, and no work. We compared these groups on 2-year outcomes including symptoms, hospitalizations, quality of life, and social networks. During follow-up, working clients had fewer days of hospitalization than the no-work group. The steady competitive group had greater reduction in negative symptoms than did the no-work group. The steady noncompetitive group showed greater improvement in social networks compared with the other groups. Extended periods of work are associated with improvements in nonvocational outcomes. Beneficial effects may vary according to the type of employment.

AB  - <bold>Background: </bold>Although cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective in the treatment of anxiety disorders, few evidence-based alternatives exist. Autonomy enhancing treatment (AET) aims to decrease the vulnerability for anxiety disorders by targeting underlying autonomy deficits and may therefore have similar effects on anxiety as CBT, but yield broader effects.<bold>Methods: </bold>A multicenter cluster-randomized clinical trial was conducted including 129 patients with DSM-5 anxiety disorders, on average 33.66 years of age (SD = 12.57), 91 (70.5%) female, and most (92.2%) born in the Netherlands. Participants were randomized over 15-week groupwise AET or groupwise CBT and completed questionnaires on anxiety, general psychopathology, depression, quality of life, autonomy-connectedness and self-esteem, pre-, mid-, and posttreatment, and after 3, 6, and 12 months (six measurements).<bold>Results: </bold>Contrary to the hypotheses, effects on the broader outcome measures did not differ between AET and CBT (d = .16 or smaller at post-test). Anxiety reduction was similar across conditions (d = .059 at post-test) and neither therapy was superior on long term.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>This was the first clinical randomized trial comparing AET to CBT. The added value of AET does not seem to lie in enhanced effectiveness on broader outcome measures or on long term compared to CBT. However, the study supports the effectiveness of AET and thereby contributes to extended treatment options for anxiety disorders.

AB  - Background: Day-hospital-based treatment programmes have been recommended for poorly functioning patients with personality disorders (PD). However, more research is needed to confirm the cost-effectiveness of such extensive programmes over other, presumably simpler, treatment formats. Methods: This study compared health service costs and psychosocial functioning for PD patients randomly allocated to either a day-hospital-based treatment programme combining individual and group psychotherapy in a step-down format, or outpatient individual psychotherapy at a specialist practice. It included 107 PD patients, 46% of whom had borderline PD, and 40% of whom had avoidant PD. Costs included the two treatment conditions and additional primary and secondary in-and outpatient services. Psychosocial functioning was assessed using measures of global (observer-rated GAF) and occupational (self-report) functioning. Repeated assessments over three years were analysed using mixed models. Results: The costs of step-down treatment were higher than those of outpatient treatment, but these high costs were compensated by considerably lower costs of other health services. However, costs and clinical gains depended on the type of PD. For borderline PD patients, cost-effectiveness did not differ by treatment condition. Health service costs declined during the trial, and functioning improved to mild impairment levels (GAF > 60). For avoidant PD patients, considerable adjuvant health services expanded the outpatient format. Clinical improvements were nevertheless superior to the step-down condition. Conclusion: Our results indicate that decisions on treatment format should differentiate between PD types. For borderline PD patients, the costs and gains of step-down and outpatient treatment conditions did not differ. For avoidant PD patients, the outpatient format was a better alternative, leaning, however, on costly additional health services in the early phase of treatment.

AB  - We assessed the effects of the Toronto Site Housing First (HF) intervention on hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits among homeless adults with mental illness over 7 years of follow-up. The Toronto Site is part of an unblinded multi-site randomized pragmatic trial of HF for homeless adults with mental illness in Canada, which followed participants up to 7 years. Five hundred seventy-five participants were recruited and classified as having high (HN) or moderate need (MN) for mental health support services. Each group was randomized into intervention (HF) and treatment as usual groups, and 567 (98.6%) consented to link their data to health administrative databases. HF participants received a monthly rent supplement of $600 (Canadian) and assertive community treatment (ACT) support or intensive care management (ICM) support based on need level. Treatment as usual (TAU) participants had access to social, housing, and health services generally available in the community. Outcomes included all-cause and mental health-specific hospitalization, number of days in hospital, and ED visit. We used GEE models to estimate ratio of rate ratios (RRR). The results showed HF with ACT had no significant effect on hospitalization rates among HN participants, but reduced the number of days in hospital (RRR = 0.32, 95% CI 0.16-0.63) and number of ED visits (RRR = 0.57, 95% CI 0.34-0.95). HF with ICM resulted in an increase in the number of hospitalizations (RRR = 1.69, 95% CI 1.09-2.60) and ED visit rates (RRR = 1.42, 95% CI 1.01-2.01) but had no effect in days in hospital for MN participants. Addressing the health needs of this population and reducing acute care utilization remain system priorities.

AB  - IMPORTANCE There is a paucity of controlled treatment trials for the treatment of conversion disorder, seizures type, also known as psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES). Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures, the most common conversion disorder, are as disabling as epilepsy and are not adequately addressed or treated by mental health clinicians. OBJECTIVE To evaluate different PNES treatments compared with standard medical care (treatment as usual). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Pilot randomized clinical trial at 3 academic medical centers with mental health clinicians trained to administer psychotherapy or psychopharmacology to outpatients with PNES. Thirty-eight participants were randomized in a blocked schedule among 3 sites to 1 of 4 treatment arms and were followed up for 16 weeks between September 2008 and February 2012; 34 were included in the analysis. INTERVENTIONS Medication (flexible-dose sertraline hydrochloride) only, cognitive behavioral therapy informed psychotherapy (CBT-ip) only, CBT-ip with medication (sertraline), or treatment as usual. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Seizure frequency was the primary outcome; psychosocial and functioning measures, including psychiatric symptoms, social interactions, quality of life, and global functioning, were secondary outcomes. Data were collected prospectively, weekly, and with baseline, week 2, midpoint (week 8), and exit (week 16) batteries. Within-group analyses for each arm were performed on primary (seizure frequency) and secondary outcomes from treatment-blinded raters using an intention-to-treat analysis. RESULTS The psychotherapy (CBT-ip) arm showed a 51.4% seizure reduction (P = .01) and significant improvement from baseline in secondary measures including depression, anxiety, quality of life, and global functioning (P < .001). The combined arm (CBT-ip with sertraline) showed 59.3% seizure reduction (P = .008) and significant improvements in some secondary measures, including global functioning (P = .007). The sertraline-only arm did not show a reduction in seizures (P = .08). The treatment as usual group showed no significant seizure reduction or improvement in secondary outcome measures (P = .19). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This pilot randomized clinical trial for PNES revealed significant seizure reduction and improved comorbid symptoms and global functioning with CBT-ip for PNES without and with sertraline. There were no improvements in the sertraline-only or treatment-as-usual arms. This study supports the use of manualized psychotherapy for PNES and successful training of mental health clinicians in the treatment. Future studies could assess larger-scale intervention dissemination.

AB  - Vertigo/dizziness (VD) ranks high in lifetime prevalence and clinical relevance. Nearly half of the complex VD disorders presenting at specialised units for vertigo or otoneurological disorders are not fully explained by an identifiable medical illness, but instead are related to anxiety, depressive, or somatoform disorders. Although there is some evidence that psychotherapy may be effective for these patients, therapeutic options remain unsatisfactory. This report describes the objectives, design and methods of a randomised, controlled clinical trial, evaluating the efficacy of manualised, multimodal group psychotherapy, based on integrative psychotherapy (IPT) and tailored to subgroups of mental disorders in medically unexplained VD. This psychotherapeutic approach will be compared to self-help groups ( n = 172; n = 86 per study arm). Improvements with regard to handicap due to VD at 12 months follow-up will serve as primary outcome. Additionally, measures of generic quality of life, severity of vertigo, depression, anxiety, somatisation as well as Head Impulse Test and Computerized Static Posturography will be applied. We will also analyse the cost-effectiveness of this trial. The study aims to improve treatment of this therapeutically underserved population who are often severely impaired in their working and daily lives. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02320851. Trial Status: This is an on-going study; recruitment for the study is about to start.

AB  - <bold>Background: </bold>Mental disorders are associated with high costs for productivity loss, sickness absence and unemployment. A participatory supportive return to work (RTW) program was developed in order to improve RTW among workers without an employment contract, sick-listed due to a common mental disorder. The program contained a participatory approach, integrated care and direct placement in a competitive job. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of this new program, compared to usual care. In addition, its return on investment was evaluated.<bold>Methods: </bold>An economic evaluation was conducted alongside a 12-month randomized controlled trial. A total of 186 participants was randomly allocated to the new program (n = 94) or to usual care (n = 92). Effect measures were the duration until sustainable RTW in competitive employment and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. Costs included intervention costs, medical costs and absenteeism costs. Registered data of the Dutch Social Security Agency were used to assess the duration until sustainable RTW, intervention costs and absenteeism costs. QALYs and medical costs were assessed using three- or six-monthly questionnaires. Missing data were imputed using multiple imputations. Cost-effectiveness analysis and cost-utility analysis were conducted from the societal perspective. A return on investment analysis was conducted from the social insurer's perspective. Various sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the results.<bold>Results: </bold>The new program had no significant effect on the duration until sustainable RTW and QALYs gained. Intervention costs and medical costs were significantly higher in the intervention group. From the societal perspective, the maximum probability of cost-effectiveness for duration until sustainable RTW was 0.64 at a willingness to pay of about €10 000/day, and 0.27 for QALYs gained, regardless of the willingness to pay. From the social insurer's perspective, the probability of financial return was 0.18.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>From the societal perspective, the new program was neither cost-effective in improving sustainable RTW nor in gaining QALYs. From the social insurer's perspective, the program did not result in a positive financial return. Therefore, the present study provided no evidence to support its implementation.<bold>Trial Registration: </bold>The trial was listed at the Dutch Trial Register (NTR) under NTR3563 on August 7, 2012.

AB  - Background: Although exposure-based therapy is a well-established, effective treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), some practitioners report reluctance to implement it due to concerns that it may exacerbate symptoms of PTSD and commonly comorbid disorders, such as substance use disorders (SUD). Aim: This study compared the exacerbation of psychological symptoms among participants with comorbid PTSD and SUD who received either SUD treatment alone or SUD treatment integrated with exposure therapy for PTSD. Method: Participants (N = 71) were treatment-seeking, military Veterans with comorbid PTSD and SUD who were randomized to 12 individual sessions of either (1) an integrated, exposure-based treatment (Concurrent Treatment of PTSD and Substance Use Disorders using Prolonged Exposure; COPE); or (2) a non-exposure-based, SUD-only treatment (Relapse Prevention; RP). We examined between-group differences in the frequency of statistically reliable exacerbations of PTSD, SUD and depression symptoms experienced during treatment. Results: At each of the 12 sessions, symptom exacerbation was minimal and generally equally likely in either treatment group. However, an analysis of treatment completers suggests that RP participants experienced slightly more exacerbations of PTSD symptoms during the course of treatment. Conclusions: This study is the first to investigate symptom exacerbation throughout trauma-focused exposure therapy for individuals with comorbid PTSD and SUD. Results add to a growing literature which suggests that trauma-focused, exposure-based therapy does not increase the risk of symptom exacerbation relative to non-exposure-based therapy.

AB  - Objectives: Peer co‐led education describes educators who are expert patients, user representatives or former patients, participating and teaching in educational interventions in cooperation with health care professionals. Peer co‐led education is included in the Norwegian national guidelines for treatment of mental disorders. Despite some promising results for the treatment of other conditions, little is known about the efficacy of peer co‐led educational group interventions for adults with ADHD. This study will present a peer co‐led educational group programme developed in cooperation with user representatives from ADHD‐user organisations and health personnel at a community mental health centre. The main objective is to investigate the preliminary effects of a two‐session educational group programme added to treatment as usual. The educational intervention was designed to address specific challenges faced by adults recently diagnosed with ADHD. Methods: Design: a randomized waitlist‐controlled trial at an outpatient clinic in mid‐Norway. Methods: All participants will receive standard treatment during the intervention period. Patient satisfaction, patient activation, general self‐efficacy, ADHD‐related quality of life and self‐reported symptoms were assessed at the time of recruitment prior to randomisation, during the waiting time, at pre‐ and postintervention, and at 10‐weeks follow‐up. Results: Preliminary results on patient satisfaction and secondary outcomes will be presented. Conclusions: This is the first RCT documenting an educational intervention for adults with ADHD where user representatives codevelop and co‐deliver the educational group interventions. The aim of the trial, evaluating patient satisfaction, will provide information about the beneficial effect for the patients, as a potential intervention to be used as an adjunct to treatment as usual.

AB  - Key Points: Question: Is a Housing First intervention with Intensive Case Management for homeless people with mental illness cost-effective compared with treatment as usual? Findings: In this economic evaluation study of data from the At Home/Chez Soi randomized clinical trial with 1198 initially homeless participants, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $56.08 per additional day of stable housing. At $67 per day of stable housing, there was an 80% chance that the Housing First intervention with Intensive Case Management was cost-effective compared with treatment as usual. Meaning: Expanding access to Housing First with Intensive Case Management appears to be warranted from an economic point of view. This economic evaluation study investigates the cost-effectiveness of the Housing First intervention with Intensive Case Management compared with treatment as usual among homeless adults with mental illness. Importance: In the At Home/Chez Soi trial for homeless individuals with mental illness, the scattered-site Housing First (HF) with Intensive Case Management (ICM) intervention proved more effective than treatment as usual (TAU). Objective: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the HF plus ICM intervention compared with TAU. Design, Setting, and Participants: This is an economic evaluation study of data from the At Home/Chez Soi randomized clinical trial. From October 2009 through July 2011, 1198 individuals were randomized to the intervention (n = 689) or TAU (n = 509) and followed up for as long as 24 months. Participants were recruited in the Canadian cities of Vancouver, Winnipeg, Toronto, and Montreal. Participants with a current mental disorder who were homeless and had a moderate level of need were included. Data were analyzed from 2013 through 2019, per protocol. Interventions: Scattered-site HF (using rent supplements) with off-site ICM services was compared with usual housing and support services in each city. Main Outcomes and Measures: The analysis was performed from the perspective of society, with days of stable housing as the outcome. Service use was ascertained using questionnaires. Unit costs were estimated in 2016 Canadian dollars. Results: Of 1198 randomized individuals, 795 (66.4%) were men and 696 (58.1%) were aged 30 to 49 years. Almost all (1160 participants, including 677 in the HF group and 483 in the TAU group) contributed data to the economic analysis. Days of stable housing were higher by 140.34 days (95% CI, 128.14-153.31 days) in the HF group. The intervention cost $14 496 per person per year; reductions in costs of other services brought the net cost down by 46% to $7868 (95% CI, $4409-$11 405). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $56.08 (95% CI, $29.55-$84.78) per additional day of stable housing. In sensitivity analyses, adjusting for baseline differences using a regression-based method, without altering the discount rate, caused the largest change in the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio with an increase to $60.18 (95% CI, $35.27-$86.95). At $67 per day of stable housing, there was an 80% chance that HF was cost-effective compared with TAU. The cost-effectiveness of HF appeared to be similar for all participants, although possibly less for those with a higher number of previous psychiatric hospitalizations. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, the cost per additional day of stable housing was similar to that of many interventions for homeless individuals. Based on these results, expanding access to HF with ICM appears to be warranted from an economic standpoint. Trial Registration: isrctn.org Identifier: ISRCTN42520374

AB  - Background Depressive and anxiety disorders share major risk factors and can often be effectively prevented or treated with similar interventions. However, less than half of young people with mental health problems seek professional help and hence innovative approaches to support this group are needed. To this end Coping with Anxiety and Depression shows promise. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the implementation of Coping with Anxiety and Depression for young people aged 15-25 years showing symptoms of anxiety and/or depression in a Danish community setting. Methods The programme was implemented in 39 Danish municipalities. To evaluate the implementation of the programme, we collected quantitative and qualitative data simultaneously and subsequently we triangulated it in the data analysis. The qualitative data collection comprised semi-structured interviews in seven case municipalities. In each municipality we conducted interviews with a local municipality coordinator of the program, a group interview with two voluntary instructors facilitating the program and a group interview with two to seven participants in the programme. In total, seven local coordinators, 14 voluntary instructors and 23 participants (8 men and 15 women) were interviewed. We also carried out a baseline and post-intervention survey. Interview data was coded via an inductive and deductive analysis approach. Survey data was analysed via descriptive statistics in the statistical software programme STATA 16. Results The evaluation showed that the implementation of the programme is feasible, and that most participants (83%) were satisfied with the programme to a high/very high extent. In total, 84% of the participants strongly agreed/agreed that it was advantageous that instructors themselves had experience with anxiety and depression. Qualitative data showed that the participants were very positive about the group format. It also showed that recruitment and retention of participants and especially young instructors were challenging but doable. Thus our findings suggest that the programme can be implemented in a way that is perceived as useful and satisfying to young people. Conclusions Coping with Anxiety and Depression constitutes a feasible peer-to-peer, group-based community programme that is well-received by its target group. Recruitment and retention of participants and instructors is challenging but doable.

AB  - Purpose: Depression is a highly prevalent and recurrent mental health disorder (Kessler, 2003). Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT; Segal, Williams, & Teasdale, 2013) is an evidence-based group treatment that utilizes eastern meditative practices and cognitive-behavioral principles to treat recurrent depression. The treatment aims to provide participants with the understanding and skills to recognize and free themselves from patterns of depression-related negative thinking. The treatment has been shown through multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to reduce depressive symptoms and risk for future depressive relapse (Kuyken et al., 2008) as well as symptoms of anxiety (Hofmann et al., 2010). Despite this, little research is being conducted at later stages of the translational journey, namely effectiveness in real-world healthcare settings. Real-world mental health services are normally designed to address the needs of patients experiencing more acute difficulties and may be unable to uphold the stringent exclusion criteria of RCTs. Method(s): The current analyses utilized pre- and posttreatment data from 5 cohorts of MBCT participants and aimed to examine the effectiveness of MBCT implemented in a large Mid-Western academic medical center. Patients with a history of depression and the absence of any comorbid disorders that would significantly interfere with treatment (eg, primary substance abuse, psychosis, or bipolar I) were referred from outpatient providers within a large academic medical center. Result(s): Repeated measures analyses of variance for treatment completers (N=29) revealed significant improvements in depression, anxiety, mindfulness, self-compassion, and flourishing over the 8 weeks of treatment (all P<.05). Furthermore, decreases in depression were related to proposed mechanisms of change of increased mindfulness (r=-.59, P<.001) and self-compassion (r=-.36, P<.001). Decreases in anxiety were unrelated to these constructs (all P>.05). Conclusion(s): These findings have important implications for implementation of MBCT within real-world health-care settings. Considerations related to comorbid anxiety and program development will be discussed.

AB  - Faced with many patients with comorbid severe mental illness and substance use disorders, a university-affiliated, inner-city community mental health center and a psychosocial rehabilitation center initiated this clinical trial assessing a program to care for these patients. Fifty-four patients, age 18 to 40, with either schizophrenia or major affective disorder and a substance use disorder were randomly assigned to usual community mental health center and rehabilitation services with or without an innovative group and intensive case management program. One-year follow-ups detected no significant advantages on patient outcomes for adding the innovative program to usual services. Failure to engage patients in the experimental program posed a major and enduring barrier to treatment, despite intensive case management. Future efforts must give greater consideration to effective engagement techniques and patients' readiness for active treatment.

AB  - Background: This experiment evaluated the effectiveness of an innovative program of assertive community treatment (ACT) for homeless persons with severe and persistent mental illnesses. Method(s): One hundred fifty-two homeless persons with severe and persistent mental illness were randomized to either the experimental ACT program or to usual community services. Baseline assessments included the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R, Quality-of-Life Interview, Colorado Symptom Index, and the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey. All assessments (except the Structured Clinical Interview) were repeated at the 2-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up evaluations. Result(s): Subjects in the ACT program used significantly fewer psychiatric inpatient days, fewer emergency department visits, and more psychiatric outpatient visits than the comparison subjects. The ACT subjects also spent significantly more days in stable community housing, and they experienced significantly greater improvements in symptoms, life satisfaction, and perceived health status. Conclusion(s): Relative to usual community care, the ACT program for homeless persons with severe and persistent mental illness shifts the locus of care from crisis-oriented services to ongoing outpatient care and produces better housing, clinical, and life satisfaction outcomes.

AB  - With the high number of incarcerated veterans with mental illness and substance dependence returning to the community annually, a significant need exists for technologies that will help them return to employment. This study evaluates three methods of assistance: (1) basic vocational services, (2) self-study of a vocational manual designed for formerly incarcerated veterans, and (3) a group led by vocational staff using the vocational manual. We evaluated 69 veterans to determine the number finding employment within 3 months after enrollment in the study. The group format was expected to be superior to self-study, and self-study was expected to be superior to basic services. Though the group format was found to be superior to both self-study and basic services, the results for self-study and basic services were statistically similar. Limitations and directions for future refinement are discussed.

AB  - Objective: This study compared two vocational programs: the About Face Vocational Program (AFVP), a traditional group-based vocational program created for formerly incarcerated veterans, and a hybrid program combining the AFVP with principles of individual placement and support-supported employment.Methods: The study evaluated 111 veterans with at least one felony conviction who had a mental illness, substance use disorder, or both. Veterans were randomly assigned to either vocational condition.Results: Veterans in the hybrid condition, compared with the AFVP alone, were more likely to find employment, had higher rates of full-time employment, and earned significantly more money over the course of the study. A comparison of only participants who found employment showed higher rates of full-time employment for veterans in the hybrid condition but similarities between the two groups in other measures of employment success.Conclusions: Blended models of vocational services for veterans with mental illness, substance use disorders, or both are effective at returning formerly incarcerated veterans to competitive employment.

AB  - The implementation of effective psychotherapies in community mental health care is challenging. This study aimed to create a well-structured and easily applicable treatment model for patients with severe borderline personality disorder (BPD). We integrated a schema therapy based psycho-educational group into an available individual therapy. Two groups were formed: (1) community treatment by experts (CTBE) patients (n = 24) receiving new treatment and (2) treatment as usual (TAU) patients (n = 47). Changes in symptoms were measured by Borderline Personality Disorder Severity Index-IV interview and quality of life by the 15D health-related quality of life questionnaire. After 1 year the CTBE patients showed a significant reduction in a wider range of BPD symptoms and better quality of life than TAU patients. The results of this study are encouraging. A well-structured treatment model was successfully implemented into community mental health care with improved patient adherence to treatment and superior treatment outcomes compared to TAU patients.

AB  - The Dynamic Recovery Project examined relationships between homelessness, substance abuse, and recovery, and investigated the effectiveness of the therapeutic community (TC) treatment model in helping homeless drug users move toward stable, drug-free living. This project compared two short-term TCs that were situated within pre-existing homeless shelters with a clean and sober dormitory. In a separate condition, peer counselors and staff were provided additional training in TC philosophy and practice to reduce program dropout. Dramatic decreases in drug and alcohol use at follow-up were verified by urinalysis. Length of time in treatment rather than specific program accounted for decreased alcohol and drug use. Important decreases in posttreatment criminality for both treatment programs were documented. The comparison group, starting with low criminality, experienced smaller, nonsignificant decreases unrelated to type of program or time in treatment. Major declines in Beck Depression Scores were evident, but were unrelated to groups or time in treatment. Training had no measurable impact on client retention or outcomes and there were no significant differences between TCs and the comparison group on posttreatment drug use, criminality, or depression. This report documents that short-term therapeutic communities can be successfully implemented in public shelters for homeless men.

AB  - Background: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating psychiatric disorder characterized by intrusive and distressing recollections of a traumatic event, avoidance of reminders of the event, and symptoms of hyper arousal, such as impaired sleep, irritability, and decreased concentration. Estimates of the rate of lifetime PTSD have ranged from 7%‐12% in the US population and 19% to 30% in combat veterans. PTSD carries enormous costs to individuals, society and to the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) medical system. It is frequently chronic with high rates of psychiatric co‐morbidity, is associated with substantial impairment in occupational, interpersonal, and family functioning, poorer quality of life, a greater number of physical health complaints and increased medical disease burden. While evidence‐based direct‐exposure psychotherapies for treatment of PTSD have been developed and disseminated within the VHA, no treatment has shown universal effectiveness and there is great concern about attenuated treatment response and elevated treatment drop out in veteran populations. Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is a promising alternative that is thought to serve as a gentler form of exposure for individuals who find traditional trauma focused treatments intolerable. Although promising, MBSR has not yet been systematically evaluated as a treatment for PTSD in a clinical research trial. This study evaluated the efficacy of an 8‐week MBSR intervention compared to 8 weeks of Present Centered Group Therapy (PCGT) as a group‐based treatment for PTSD in veterans. Methods: Investigators randomly assigned 116 veterans of any era or military background who suffered from PTSD to either MBSR or PCGT treatment groups. Participants were recruited from the PTSD and mental health clinics at the VHA or by response to a direct mail outreach. The study randomized participants into 9 cohorts consisting of one group each of MBSR and PCGT. Treatments were delivered by trained personnel receiving ongoing expert supervision and whose fidelity to protocol was evaluated. The MBSR course was administered following the protocol developed by Jon Kabat‐Zinn with a slight modification to include an initial session on PTSD psychoeducation and treatment rationale for how mindfulness training can lead to improvements in PTSD symptoms. The PCGT intervention provided a credible and clinically relevant comparison intervention that controlled for nonspecific therapeutic factors. It consisted of nine weekly 1.5 hour group sessions including an initial session on PTSD psychoeducation and treatment rationale. Assessments were conducted at baseline, weeks 3, 6, 9 and 17. Clinical interviews were conducted by trained independent evaluators blinded to participant treatment condition. Self‐report measures were collected by the study coordinator or research assistants. Results: Of the 116 participants randomized, 99 completed therapy and follow‐up and 17 were lost to attrition. All data was analyzed in this intent‐to‐treat model. Study groups did not differ significantly on any demographics. The two groups were equivalent on symptom severity measures of avoidance, depression, somatic symptoms and functional outcome suggesting successful randomization. However, at baseline, the MBSR group was significantly higher than the PCGT group on both the PTSD Checklist (PCL) (63.6 vs. 58.8, p=.032) and the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) severity scores (69.9 vs. 62.5, p=.016). An analysis of those who dropped out suggests that loss to follow‐up was not due to any demographic or clinical characteristics. The drop‐out was significantly higher in the MBSR group compared to the PCGT group (22.4% vs. 6.9%, suggesting that the differential demands of the two therapies may have contributed to higher dropout in the MBSR group. The results of growth curve mixed effect models found that the MBSR group showed significantly larger decreases on the PCL from baseline to the 2 month follow‐up than did the PCGT group (10.2 vs. 2.9; p=.004) as well as significantly greater declines in the CAPS severity score over the same time period (22.4 vs. 12.3; p=.031). This was also reflected in significant differences in rates of decrease on each of the PCL subscales; re‐experiencing (3.1 vs. 1.1; p=.012), avoidance (4.1 vs. .9; p=.015) and hyperarousal (3.0 vs. .8; p=.012). The MBSR group was also found to have significantly greater decreases on the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire‐II (AAQ) compared to the PCGT group (3.6 vs. .5; p=.012). The MBSR group showed significant greater increases on the World Health Organization Quality of Life‐ Brief (WHO‐BREF) psychological health domain (1.1 vs. ‐.1; p=.003), social relationships domain (2.3 vs. 1.0; p=.009) and environmental domain (.7 vs. ‐.1; p=.031). Conclusions: The VHA endorses several evidence‐based treatment interventions for PTSD which can be difficult for some veterans to tolerate. The current study demonstrates that MBSR can be an effective alternative treatment for veterans with PTSD.

AB  - Although social cognitive impairments are evident in patients with schizophrenia across many cultures, psychosocial interventions are less used in Eastern countries. Despite a growing emphasis on community care in mental health services in Eastern countries, the synergistic effects of social cognitive intervention strategies on routine community mental health services are not well documented. This study aimed to adapt a group‐based social cognitive skills training (SCST) program for use in a Korean context and evaluate its feasibility and preliminary effects among community‐dwelling individuals with schizophrenia. Forty‐seven patients were assigned to either the SCST + treatment as usual (TAU) group (n = 21) or the TAU only group (n = 24). Participants completed tasks to assess social cognition, social functioning, neurocognition, and psychiatric symptoms before and after treatment. Over a period of approximately 12 weeks, drop‐out rates were comparably low in both groups, and the attendance rates for the SCST program were high (85.7 %, mean sessions attended = 20.56/24 sessions). The SCST + TAU group demonstrated significant improvements in facial affect recognition, social functioning, and psychiatric symptoms compared to the TAU only group. A non‐significant trend in theory of mind was observed, along with no improvements in social perception and neurocognition. The adapted version of the SCST program is feasible for implementation and demonstrates promise for enhancing social cognition and functioning in Korean outpatients with schizophrenia.

AB  - Brief Eclectic Psychotherapy (BEP) is a manualized psychotherapy for posttaumatic stress disorder (PTSD) which has proven effective for police officers. This article reports on a randomized clinical trial using BEP to treat other types of PTSD patients recruited from an outpatient clinic. Twenty-four patients were randomly assigned to a treatment or a waitlist group. Assessment of PTSD was made before and after the treatment period (4 months). No significant differences between the groups were observed at pretest. By posttest, BEP had effectively reduced PTSD as well as general anxiety symptoms in the treated group of outpatients as compared to the waitlist group.

AB  - Compared results obtained from dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) and a treatment-as-usual (TAU) regimen for drug-dependent suicidal women displaying borderline personality disorder. 28 women (aged 18–45 yrs) were randomly assigned to DBT or TAU groups. The 12 Ss receiving DBT, which comprises strategies from cognitive and behavioral therapies and acceptance strategies adapted from Zen teaching, participated in individual psychotherapy, group skills training sessions, and skills coaching phone calls when needed. Those receiving TAU were referred to alternative substance abuse or mental health counsellors and community programs, or continued with their own psychotherapists. Results show a drop-out rate of 36% from DBT compared with a rate of 73% from TAU. Urinalysis showed a significant reduction in substance abuse among the DBT Ss, and significant improvements in social and global adjustment in DBT Ss at 16-mo follow-up. Findings suggest that DBT is an effective treatment for severely dysfunctional drug-dependent patients. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - We conducted a randomized controlled trial to evaluate whether dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), a treatment that synthesizes behavioral change with radical acceptance strategies, would be more effective for heroin-dependent women with borderline personality disorder (N = 23) than Comprehensive Validation Therapy with 12-Step (CVT + 12S), a manualized approach that provided the major acceptance-based strategies used in DBT in combination with participation in 12-Step programs. In addition to psychosocial treatment, subjects also received concurrent opiate agonist therapy with adequate doses of LAAM (thrice weekly; modal dose 90/90/130 mg). Treatment lasted for 12 months. Drug use outcomes were measured via thrice-weekly urinalyses and self-report. Three major findings emerged. First, results of urinalyses indicated that both treatment conditions were effective in reducing opiate use relative to baseline. At 16 months post-randomization (4 months post-treatment), all participants had a low proportion of opiate-positive urinalyses (27% in DBT; 33% in CVT + 12S). With regard to between-condition differences, participants assigned to DBT maintained reductions in mean opiate use through 12 months of active treatment while those assigned to CVT + 12S significantly increased opiate use during the last 4 months of treatment. Second, CVT + 12S retained all 12 participants for the entire year of treatment, compared to a 64% retention rate in DBT. Third, at both post-treatment and at the 16-month follow-up assessment, subjects in both treatment conditions showed significant overall reductions in level of psychopathology relative to baseline. A noteworthy secondary finding was that DBT participants were significantly more accurate in their self-report of opiate use than were those assigned to CVT + 12S.

AB  - Objective: This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of psychosocial rehabilitation intervention on schizophrenia. Methodology: One hundred forty schizophrenia outpatients in remission stage were randomized to either an antipsychotic monomedication (control group) or an antipsychotic monomedication plus a psychosocial rehabitation training (trial group). Positive and Negative syndrome Scale (PANSS), Disability Screening Schedule (SDSS) were performed longitudinally from baseline to month 18 to evaluate the efficacy. Results: Significant difference in relapse rate between the control group (42.9%) and the trial group (18.6%) was found at month 18. In patients who didn't relapse, the trial group showed significantly lower PANSS and SDSS score (P < 0.05) than did the control group after treatment. Conclusion: Psychosocial rehabilitation intervention could produce a better outcome in terms of reducing relapse and improving the social functioning in schizophrenia.

AB  - Background: Loneliness is common among people with mental health problems and predicts poorer recovery from depression and anxiety. Needs for support with loneliness and social relationships are often under-addressed in mental health services. The Community Navigator programme was designed to reduce loneliness for adults (aged 18 and above) with complex depression or anxiety who were using secondary mental health services. Acceptability and feasibility of the programme and a trial evaluation were tested in a feasibility randomised controlled trial with qualitative evaluation. Methods: Forty participants with depression or anxiety using secondary mental health services were recruited from mental health services in two London sites and randomised to receive: the Community Navigator programme over six months in addition to routine care (n = 30); or routine care (n = 10). Measures of loneliness, depression, other clinical and social outcomes and service use were collected at baseline and six-months follow-up. Levels of engagement in the programme and rates of trial recruitment and retention were assessed. Programme delivery was assessed through session logs completed by Community Navigators. The acceptability of the programme was explored through qualitative interviews (n = 32) with intervention group participants, their family and friends, programme providers and other involved staff. Results: Forty participants were recruited in four months from 65 eligible potential participants asked. No one withdrew from the trial. Follow-up interviews were completed with 35 participants (88%). Process records indicated the programme was delivered as intended: there was a median of seven meetings with their Community Navigator (of a maximum ten) per treatment group participant. Qualitative interviews indicated good acceptability of the programme to stakeholders, and potential utility in reducing loneliness and depression and anxiety. Conclusions: A definitive, multi-site randomised controlled trial is recommended to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the Community Navigator programme for people with complex anxiety and depression in secondary mental health services.

AB  - This study is a pilot Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) that compares the effectiveness of a Cognitively-Based Compassion Training (CBCT) group treatment to a support group in reducing depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation and increasing self-compassion and mindfulness in low-income African Americans who had attempted suicide (n=82). After completing several measures, including the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSS), Beck Depression InventoryII (BDI-II), Self-Compassion Scale (SCS), and Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), participants were assigned randomly to attend either a 6-session CBCT group or a 6-session support group. Although following intervention participants randomized to both groups had comparable reductions in levels of depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation and no significant changes in their levels of mindfulness, improvements in levels of self-compassion were found only for those receiving the CBCT intervention. In addition, for individuals in the CBCT group but not in the support group, the degree of improvement in self-compassion predicted the level of reduction in depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation and the degree of improvement in mindfulness predicted the level of reduction in depressive symptoms. Taken together, the results indicate that CBCT is potentially valuable for this population and its emphasis on self-compassion and mindfulness is associated with improved psychological functioning.

AB  - Objectives In a randomized clinical trial, short- and long-term psychodynamic group psychotherapy ( STG and LTG, respectively) schedules were equally effective for the 'typical' patient during a 3-year study period. Although several studies have reported good effects for patients with personality disorders ( PD) in diverse forms of psychotherapy, the significance of treatment duration is unclear. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that PD patients would improve more during and after LTG than STG. Design A randomized, longitudinal, prospective study contrasting the outcomes during and after short- and long-term dynamic group psychotherapies. Methods One hundred and sixty-seven outpatients with mood disorders, anxiety disorders, or PD were randomized to STG or LTG (respectively, 20 or 80 weekly sessions of 90 min each). Outcome measures are as follows: symptoms (SCL-90-R), interpersonal problems ( IIP-C), and psychosocial functioning ( GAF split version: GAF-Symptom and GAF-Function). PD pathology (number of PD criteria items) was selected a priori as a putative moderator of treatment effects. Change during the 3-year study period was assessed using linear mixed models. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT 00021417. Results Our hypothesis was supported, as patients with PD improved significantly more regarding all outcome variables in LTG than STG. For patients without PD, the rate of change was similar across 3 years; however, the rate of change in symptoms and interpersonal problems was higher in STG during the first 6 months. Conclusions The effectiveness of LTG is higher for patients with co-morbid PD. Patients without PD do not appear to experience additional gain from LTG. Practitioner points Clinical implications LTG demonstrates better effectiveness than STG for patients with personality disorder co-morbidity ( PD)., Patients without PD do not appear to experience additional gain from attending LTG., Correct initial allocation to treatment duration may prevent disruptive breaks in relationships and lead to both human and economic cost savings., Limitations Trials on mixed diagnostic samples may limit the ability to fully assess change for specific diagnostic groups., Therapists were unable to select patients and compose their own groups. Although this condition might increase the generalizability of the results, it may also have restricted the therapists and the clinical situation inadvertently.

AB  - Background and Objectives: There are limited investigations of brief interventions to facilitate treatment entry among individuals with substance use disorders. This study investigated the effectiveness of brief motivational feedback (BMF) for increasing entry into intensive substance abuse treatment in veteran patients.Methods: Veteran patients (N = 84) with substance use disorders referred for an intake assessment in a substance abuse specialty clinic received either (i) intake assessment plus BMF or (ii) intake assessment as usual (AAU). BMF consisted of brief motivational enhancement feedback pertaining to estimates of alcohol and drug consumption, money spent on drugs and alcohol, and self-reported problems due to substance abuse. Primary outcome was entry in treatment groups in an intensive outpatient program for substance abuse.Results: Patients in BMF and AAU conditions did not significantly differ on indices of treatment entry. However, among patients with comorbid substance dependence and psychiatric disorders, those who received BMF were significantly more likely to enter outpatient treatment groups.Conclusions and Scientific Significance: The addition of motivational feedback to a standard intake assessment enhanced substance abuse treatment entry among veteran patients with comorbid substance use disorders and psychiatric disorders. These preliminary findings extend the use of motivational feedback to facilitate entry into substance abuse treatment among veteran patients with comorbid substance use and psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, they suggest opportunity for more effective patient-treatment matching based on initial motivation and other individual factors such as psychiatric comorbidity.

AB  - Background:There exist few recovery and occupation-based interventions for mental health service users. Balancing Everyday Life (BEL) is a new occupation-based lifestyle intervention that was created to fill this need. Aim:To gain group leaders' and participants' perspectives of the BEL intervention content and format, including factors that helped, hindered, and could be improved. Methods:A constructivist grounded theory method guided data collection and analysis. Interviews took place with 12 BEL group leaders and 19 BEL participants from out-patient psychiatry settings and community-based day centers in Sweden. Results:BEL's structure and content were appreciated, yet flexibility was desired to adapt to participant needs. BEL could act as a bridge, helping participants connect with others, and to a more engaged and balanced everyday life. Facilitating factors included a person-focused (versus illness-focused) approach, physical and emotional environments, and connection. Barriers included room resources. More sessions were desired for the intervention. Conclusion:Group leaders and participants experienced BEL as a useful tool to instigate meaningful change and connection in the participants' lives. The combination of a positive person-focused approach and group support was appreciated. These results could inform future research, evaluation, and development of occupation-focused lifestyle interventions for mental health service users.

AB  - Shame has long been seen as relevant to substance use disorders, but interventions have not been tested in randomized trials. This study examined a group-based intervention for shame based on the principles of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) in patients (N = 133; 61% female; M = 34 years old; 86% Caucasian) in a 28-day residential addictions treatment program. Consecutive cohort pairs were assigned in a pairwise random fashion to receive treatment as usual (TAU) or the ACT intervention in place of 6 hr of treatment that would have occurred at that same time. The ACT intervention consisted of three 2-hr group sessions scheduled during a single week. Intent-to-treat analyses demonstrated that the ACT intervention resulted in smaller immediate gains in shame, but larger reductions at 4-month follow-up. Those attending the ACT group also evidenced fewer days of substance use and higher treatment attendance at follow-up. Effects of the ACT intervention on treatment utilization at follow-up were statistically mediated by posttreatment levels of shame, in that those evidencing higher levels of shame at posttreatment were more likely to be attending treatment at follow-up. Intervention effects on substance use at follow-up were mediated by treatment utilization at follow-up, suggesting that the intervention may have had its effects, at least in part, through improving treatment attendance. These results demonstrate that an approach to shame based on mindfulness and acceptance appears to produce better treatment attendance and reduced substance use.

AB  - The authors compared longitudinal treatment outcomes for depressed substance-dependent veterans (N = 206) assigned to integrated cognitive-behavioral therapy plus standard pharmacotherapy (ICBT + P) or 12-step facilitation therapy plus standard pharmacotherapy (TSF + P). Drug and alcohol involvement and depressive symptomology were measured at intake and at 3-month intervals during treatment and up to 1 year posttreatment. Participants in both treatment conditions showed decreased depression and substance use from intake. ICBT + P participants maintained improvements in substance involvement over time, whereas TSF + P participants had more rapid increases in use in the months following treatment. Decreases in depressive symptoms were more pronounced for TSF + P than ICBT + P in the 6 months posttreatment. Within both treatment groups, higher attendance was associated with improved substance use and depression outcomes over time. Initial levels of depressive symptomology had a complex predictive relationship with long-term depression outcomes. Early treatment response predicted long-term substance use outcomes for a portion of the sample. Although both treatments were associated with improvements in substance use and depression, ICBT + P may lead to more stable substance use reductions compared with TSF + P.

AB  - Recent guidelines for incarcerated women's programming have called for interventions that address offenders' traumatic experiences, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and substance use in an integrated manner. Seeking Safety (SS) is an empirically supported cognitive behavioral manualized treatment for individuals with PTSD and substance use disorders. This study examined the effectiveness of SS with 59 incarcerated women who completed the intervention and 55 who were waitlisted. Participants in SS demonstrated greater symptom improvement in PTSD and depression as well as improved interpersonal functioning and coping as compared to waitlisted offenders. These findings provide preliminary support for the use of this intervention with incarcerated women.

AB  - Objective: In a randomized controlled trial, a vocationally integrated program of assertive community treatment (ACT) was compared with a certified clubhouse in the delivery of supported employment services.Methods: Employment rates, total work hours, and earnings for 121 adults with serious mental illness interested in work were compared with published benchmark figures for exemplary supported employment programs. The two programs were then compared on service engagement, retention, and employment outcomes in regression analyses that controlled for background characteristics, program preference, and vocational service receipt.Results: Outcomes for 63 ACT and 58 clubhouse participants met or exceeded most published outcomes for specialized supported employment teams. Compared with the clubhouse program, the ACT program had significantly (p<.05) better service engagement (ACT, 98 percent; clubhouse, 74 percent) and retention (ACT, 79 percent; clubhouse, 58 percent) over 24 months, but there was no significant difference in employment rates (ACT, 64 percent; clubhouse, 47 percent). Compared with ACT participants, clubhouse participants worked significantly longer (median of 199 days versus 98 days) for more total hours (median of 494 hours versus 234 hours) and earned more (median of $3,456 versus $1,252 total earnings). Better work performance by clubhouse participants was partially attributable to higher pay.Conclusions: Vocationally integrated ACT and certified clubhouses can achieve employment outcomes similar to those of exemplary supported employment teams. Certified clubhouses can effectively provide supported employment along with other rehabilitative services, and the ACT program can ensure continuous integration of supported employment with clinical care.

AB  - The concept of stigma has been acknowledged as being an important factor in the way that people with mental health problems are viewed and treated. Some authors suggest that stigma should be viewed as a multifaceted rather than a single concept. One part of this multifaceted concept has been called self-stigma which has been defined as the reactions of stigmatized individuals towards themselves. This study examined the impact of a 6-week group programme designed to reduce self-stigma in a group of service users with serious and enduring mental health problems. Twenty participants were assessed prior to the commencement of the group and immediately following its cessation. In addition to self-stigma, assessments for self-esteem, self-acceptance and psychological health measures were also undertaken. The results record a significant reduction in the stigma following the group and also non-significant increases in the participants' levels of self-esteem, self-acceptance and overall psychological health. However, there was only a negligible correlation recorded between the reduction in self-stigma and the increase in self-esteem, self-acceptance and psychological health. The paper discusses the possible explanations for these findings.

AB  - Background Homelessness is linked to poor mental health and an increased likelihood of offending. People often lose accommodation when they enter prison and struggle to find accommodation upon release leading to an increased likelihood of relapse and reoffending. The RESET intervention was developed to support prisoners with mental health needs for 12 weeks after release to coordinate their transition into the community and obtaining secure housing. Methods The primary objective of the study was to assess the participants housing situation. A prospective cohort design followed up 62 prisoners with mental health needs for 9 months post-release. Data were collected at three time points regarding accommodation, reoffending and contact and engagement with services. Inferential statistics using Chi-squared tests and t tests were used to examine differences in scores between the two groups at each time point. Results The RESET group was significantly more likely to have secure housing at all three time points being housed for approximately twice as many days than the comparison group (244 vs 129 days at 9 months: p <= 0.01). The RESET group also had a significantly greater level of contact with GPs and significantly more received benefits at all three time points. Conclusion This is the first study to focus on reducing homeless for recently released prisoners with mental health needs. The RESET intervention was successful in achieving its main objective; accommodating participants in permanent housing and reducing homelessness. There was also an association between receiving the intervention and greater engagement with other services. This supports the view that secure housing is important in ensuring a positive transition from prison to the community for prisoners with mental health needs.

AB  - Background: Patients who experience the onset of psychotic illness with a comorbid diagnosis of cannabis dependence experience poor clinical outcomes. Few studies have identified interventions that reduce cannabis use and improve clinical outcome in this population.Aims: We undertook a multi-center, randomized controlled trial of a group psychological intervention for psychosis with comorbid cannabis dependence to determine whether there was any impact on cannabis use symptoms, global functioning, insight, attitudes to treatment and subjective quality of life.Method: Across three centers, we compared a group psychological intervention, based on cognitive behavioral therapy and motivational interviewing, with treatment as usual among patients experiencing their first psychotic episode or early in the course of psychotic illness. Substance misuse and indices of clinical outcome were assessed at baseline, 3months and 1year.Results: At 3month and 1year follow-ups, there was no evidence for an intervention effect on cannabis use, symptoms, global functioning insight or attitude to treatment. However, the intervention improved subjective quality of life at 3months and this effect was sustained at 1year.Conclusions: Over the early phase of psychotic illness, group psychological interventions for those with comorbid cannabis dependence improved subjective quality of life. However, this was not associated with reduction in use of cannabis or improvement in clinical outcomes.

AB  - This controlled, non-randomized study explored the feasibility of introducing a Combined Individual and Group Intervention (CIGI) for users with mental disorders in residential facilities, and tested whether users who received the CIGI had better functioning than users who received the Treatment-As-Usual (TAU), at two-year follow up. In the CIGI, a structured cognitivebehavioral approach called VADO (in English, Skills Assessment and Definition of Goals) was used to set specific goals with each user, while Falloon's psychoeducational treatment was applied with the users as a group. Thirty-one professionals attended a training course in CIGI, open to users' voluntary participation, and applied it for two years with all users living in 8 residential facilities of the Mental Health Department of Modena, Italy. In the same department, 5 other residential facilities providing TAU were used as controls. ANOVA for repeated measures showed a significant interaction effect between users' functioning at baseline and follow up assessments, and the intervention. In particular, change in global functioning was higher in the 55 CIGI users than in the 44 TAU users. These results suggest that CIGI can be successfully introduced in residential facilities and may be useful to improve functioning in users with severe mental disorders.

AB  - Although research on the effectiveness of 12-step group participation has been increasing, there has been little examination of the processes by which such participation leads to positive outcomes. Two kinds of factors have been proposed as mediating between 12-step group affiliation and outcomes for members, common process factors that have been identified in a range of behavioral treatments and factors that are relatively unique to the 12-step model. The study tested the hypotheses that two common process factors (internal locus of control and sociability) and two unique factors (spirituality and installation of hope) mediate the effects of 12-step group affiliation on drug/alcohol abstinence and health promoting behavior. The study respondents were members of a dual focus 12-step-based fellowship, Double Trouble in Recovery (DTR), designed to address issues of both substance use and mental health. Members of 24 DTR groups in New York City were recruited and followed-up for 1 year. The degree of 12-step group affiliation during the study period was associated with more positive outcomes at follow-up. Internal locus of control and sociability mediated the effects of 12-step group affiliation on both outcomes, whereas spirituality and hope acted as mediators only for health promoting behavior. Understanding that the therapeutic factors inherent in 12-step are not mysterious, but appear to capitalize on well-documented social learning principles, may increase the acceptance of 12-step programs among addiction and mental health professionals.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that addition of one year of communication‐oriented group therapy to a regime of neuroleptics and social skills training leads to greater improvement than neuroleptics and social skills training alone. The design was a controlled comparison over two years. Diagnostic criteria were autism, thought disturbances and ego‐disturbances and the patients' disorders were probably representative of a fairly broad spectrum of semi‐chronic schizophrenic syndromes. Eighty patients entered the study, and by randomization they were allocated to the therapy or the control group. Of the 40 patients in each group 34 completed the two‐year study. Of the 34 patients in the therapy group 23 completed the one year of group therapy. Treatment started in residential care and continued in open care. All patients received fluphenazine depot and social skills training. The assessment concerned symptoms and signs, social function in the community, life events, course of illness variables such as relapse rate, and a global evaluation of remission. The effectivity of neuroleptics in reducing symptoms and signs in the acute episode was confirmed. The two year outcome showed that the addition of group therapy had increased the improvement in factors and items related to emotional communication and anhedonia, increased free‐time activities, and entries and reentries into the social field. There were more remissions in the therapy group among patients without continuous psychotic symptoms. In patients with continuous psychotic symptoms the remission rate was low in both groups. No adverse effects were shown. Despite absence of remission in more than half of the patients nearly all could be discharged. Communication‐oriented group therapy as used here, may be considered as an elementary, unsophisticated form of psychotherapy that can be applied at almost any psychiatric treatment center both in hospitals and outpatient care. The outcome pattern suggests that this kind of group therapy cannot replace neuroleptic drugs, but increases the improvement from drugs and social skills training.

AB  - Background. Dual pathology is often found in addiction and mental health centers. Although there are integrated services for these patients, most countries have developed joint action protocols between addiction and mental health centers. The objective is to analyze the progress of patients diagnosed with dual pathology, comparing the therapeutic outcomes of those who exclusively attend either addiction or mental health centers with those patients who follow a program in which the two services are coordinated. It is hypothesized that patients assisted in coordinate manner will present a better evolution on psychopathological symptomatology, drug use and functional impairment. Methods. The sample was 182 dual pathology patients treated in addictions centers (n=62), mental health centers (n=51) and treated in a coordinated manner (n=62). The instruments administered was WHODAS 2.0, BSI-18 and SDSS. Results. In general, no statistically significant differences were found between baseline and follow up in WHODAS and BSI-18. More cocaine use was found in three groups but was statistically significant in patients attended by addictions center and mental health centers. High percentages of abandonment were found in patients attending coordinate services. In terms of reliable change, among those receiving the coordinated treatment, there were more patients who showed improvements in the WHODAS 2.0 dimensions. Conclusions. The inconvenience caused by going to different treatment networks may partially explain these results related with abandonment. However, patients who remain in treatment in coordinated services, show lower functionality deterioration than patients in other modalities.

AB  - This study evaluated a statewide demonstration project to implement a group-based intervention called Procovery in selected inpatient and community mental health centers. Procovery is a facilitated mutual support group designed to build hope and a sense of social inclusion by raising consciousness and helping people develop an understanding of the ways one can move toward recovery in their own lives. This evaluation sought to determine both consumer outcomes and perceptions of the program and implementation efforts held by consumers and the facilitators of the intervention. A multidimensional approach was used, including a quasi-experimental design with consumers, questionnaires and focus groups with the intervention facilitators, and individual interviews with administrators. The Procovery model was shown to have a positive impact on consumers' recoveries and was viewed favorably by consumers, facilitators, and administrators. Several barriers to effective implementation were identified. These findings and their implications for future practice and research are discussed.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors evaluated the effectiveness of behaviorally oriented social skills training and supportive group therapy for improving the social adjustment of schizophrenic patients living in the community and for protecting them against psychotic relapse. METHOD: Eighty male outpatients with schizophrenia were stabilized with a low dose of fluphenazine decanoate (5 to 10 mg every 14 days), which was supplemented with oral fluphenazine (5 mg twice daily) or a placebo when they first met criteria for a prodromal period. (Half of the patients did so at some time during the study.) Patients were randomly assigned to receive either social skills training or supportive group therapy twice weekly for 6 months and then weekly for the next 18 months. Rates of psychotic exacerbation were monitored, as were scores on the Social Adjustment Scale II. RESULTS: There were significant main effects favoring social skills training over supportive group therapy on two of the six Social Adjustment Scale II cluster totals examined (personal well‐being and total) and significant interactions between psychosocial treatment and drug treatment for three items (external family, social and leisure activities, and total). In each case, these interactions indicated that the advantage of social skills training over supportive group therapy was greatest when it was combined with active drug supplementation. Social skills training did not significantly decrease the risk of psychotic exacerbation in the full group, but an advantage was observed (post hoc) among patients who received placebo supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that social skills training resulted in greater improvement in certain measures of social adjustment than supportive group therapy. The greatest improvement in social outcomes occurred when social skills training was combined with a pharmacological strategy of active drug supplementation at the time prodromal worsening of psychotic symptoms was first observed. However, these improvements were modest in absolute terms and confined to certain subgroups of patients.

AB  - AIMS AND DESIGN: A randomized clinical trial was performed to evaluate the influence of two formats of cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy (individual vs. group) in the treatment of alcohol and/or drug dependent patients., SETTING: Public outpatient drug dependence service., PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and fifty-five alcohol and/or drug-dependent patients., INTERVENTION: The patients were randomly assigned to individual (n = 77) or group (n = 78) treatment formats. The treatment was developed into two phases: acquisition (eight sessions) and maintenance (nine sessions), distributed over an 8-month period., MEASUREMENTS: Alcohol and drug use, severity of dependence, and alcohol- and drug-related problems were evaluated at pre-treatment and 15 months after admission to treatment., FINDINGS: At follow-up evaluation both groups of patients presented similar levels of drug consumption, dependence and associated problems. Although group-treated patients reported slightly higher levels of alcohol consumption (both at baseline and follow-up) differences between the formats disappear if baseline levels are included as covariates. Compliance with treatment and a measure of drug severity were predictors of success for the drug dependents. The number of sessions attended and high GGT levels at admission were positively correlated with success for the alcohol dependents., CONCLUSIONS: The two modalities presented similar outcomes and, as the group format could present a better cost-benefit ratio, it may be used without decreasing compliance with treatment or treatment effectiveness.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Assertive community treatment (ACT) has been applied to a number of disorders in the adult population, such as schizophrenia, with some degree of success; its use in the treatment of people with intellectual disability (ID) and mental illness has received little attention. Despite the high costs of ID in health and social care, there has been very little evidence-based practice for people with ID and mental illness, and it remains a neglected area of research. Aims The aims of this study were an exploratory comparison of the effectiveness of an ACT model for the treatment of mental illness in people with ID (ACT-ID) with a standard community treatment (SCT-ID) approach. METHOD: A Randomized controlled trial design was adopted and allocation was made by stratified randomization by an independent statistician. The prognostic factors used in the randomization were gender and psychiatric diagnosis (psychosis vs. affective). Service users were randomly allocated to either ACT-ID or SCT-ID. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between ACT-ID and SCT-ID in terms of the level of unmet needs, carer burden, functioning and quality of life, but borderline evidence of a difference between treatment groups in quality of life in favour of SCT-ID. Both SCT-ID and ACT-ID groups decreased level of unmet needs and carer burden, and increased functioning. SCT-ID also led to a small increase in quality of life.

AB  - In this manuscript we describe results obtained for Group I I I of the Integral Rehabilitation Program for Outpatient Schizophrenic Patients (IRPS III) at the National Institute of Psychiatry Ramon tie la Fuente. This program was created for Mexican schizophrenic patients as a refined alternative for the treatment, rehabilitation and integration to a productive life within society. It is interdisciplinary and integral in nature; both patients and their relatives are involved in the treatment and rehabilitation. It includes admission, stabilization of clinical symptoms, and application of strategies for rehabilitation for one year (pharmacological treatment, group psychotherapy, labor-vocation induction therapy, Music therapy, psychosocial psychotherapy, occupational therapy, artistic painting, drawing, and Hata-Yoga workshops, psycho-educational workshops for relatives, group dynamics therapy with responsible relatives, and unifamilial psychotherapy); there were assessments at the beginning and at end of the study. Objective To evaluate the efficacy of an interdisciplinary and integral program in these patients, with respect to a control group that received the usual medical-psychiatric treatment. Evaluation was carried out according to: a) Severity of psychiatric symptoms, b) Treatment compliance, c) Everyday performance, d) Psychosocial functioning, e) Global activity, f) Home occupational activities, g) Expressed emotion and attribution of the illness, and h) Patterns of communication and relationship within the family. The goals of this program were to reduce the disabilities and to profit from the conserved functions, as well as to develop other skills in order to increase the quality of life of patients. Methods This was a quasi-experimental pretest-postest prospective study where an experimental group and a control group were compared. The control group (n=39) received the usual psychiatric management, while the experimental group (n=39), participated in addition to this management, in a one-year integral rehabilitation program at the outpatient service of the institute. The sample was obtained in a non-probabilistic and sequential way, according to the established inclusion and exclusion criteria. Variables: Efficacy was evaluated through: a) Severity of psychiatric symptoms; b) Treatment compliance; c) Everyday functioning; d) Psychosocial functioning; c) Occupational activities at home; f) Expressed emotion; g) Patterns of communication and relationship within the family. Instruments: Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANNS), Clinical Interview and File, Everyday Unemployment Scale, Psychosocial Functioning Scale, Global Assessment Scale, Assessment and Follow-up Questionnaire, Patient Labor Performance Scale, Social Behavior Assessment Schedule (SBAS), Five Minute Speech Sample (FMSS), Verification of the Performance in Occupational Activities for Schizophrenic Patients, Extrapyramidal Symptom Scale. Procedures: a) Incorporation of patients and relatives to the study; b) Stabilization of clinical symptoms; c) Initial assessment; d) Program application; e) Final assessment. Results Demographic data: There were 47 subjects in the final sample, 25 in the experimental group, and 22 controls. There were more males than females in both groups (76% in the experimental group and 63.6% in controls). Being single was the most frequent marital status among patients (88% in the experimental group and 91% in controls). Education was slightly higher in the experimental group, were 40% had a bachelor's degree as opposed to 27.2% in controls. Treatment compliance: The program had a final efficiency of 64% for the experimental group and 56% for controls. Some of the experimental subject's characteristics at the beginning of the program were related with treatment compliance: age, years of illness history, and number of different diagnoses. It was determined that 62% of the patients who completed the program were less than 30 years old, and in 80% of the cases the onset of the illness was less than 10 years ago. Regarding the number of diagnoses per patient, 60% of those who completed the study had one diagnosis, 40% had two or more. On the contrary, 30% of the patients who abandoned the study had one diagnosis and 70% had two or more. In other words, almost three fourths of the subsample that abandoned the Program had more than one diagnosis: 31% had two, 31% had three, and 10% had four or more. Clinical area: In the clinical area, there were no significant differences between groups. However, patients in the experimental group had a higher level of clinical adaptation and treatment compliance. Everyday performance: The everyday performance was improved in patients from the experimental group, with statistically significant changes in 71.5% of the pretest-postest evaluated areas, with emphasis on self-care, Family and interpersonal relationships, and remunerated work. In the control group, there was an improvement only in 28.5% of the areas. Psychosocial functioning: Global and by-area psychosocial functioning showed statistically significant differences in the experimental group in all functioning areas; there was an improvement from three to two, the latter number meaning feeling satisfied. This was not the case in the control group. Behavior at home: In the experimental group, the perception in families was that occupational behavior at home was improved, according to the final score. Family assessment: Relatives in the experimental group attributed the problems they had with the patient to Personality characteristics. These problems were diminished at the end of the study, but not in the control group. When relatives attributed problems to the way of being and attitudes of patients, there was a decrease of problems from 31.6% to 26.3%. Emotional Expression in relatives from the experimental group was observed in 79.2% at the beginning of the treatment program, which decreased to 33.3% at the end of the study, with a significant difference of p < 0.006, as opposed to relatives in the control group, who did not show statistically significant differences. Clinical assessment of families: At the beginning of the program, this group established reiterative communication patterns. The patient showed rejection to communication. Relatives blamed schizophrenia for the lack Of communication. At the end of the program, patterns of communication had importantly improved. Conclusions Demographic data in our sample are similar to those described in previous reports for male:female ratio, marital status, and education. Some characteristics of the patients, in particular age, years from onset of illness, and psychiatric comorbidity assessed at recruitment were associated with completing or not the program. At the end of the study it was clear the program reached its goals of reducing the patients' disabilities and profiting of conserved functions: 64% of the patients in the experimental group were more stable in clinical terms, and treatment compliance was better. Also, everyday performance was notably improved. In the experimental group there were pretest-postest statistically significant differences in 71.5% of the studied area, especially in self-care and interpersonal relationships. In the control group there were significant changes only in 28.5% of the areas. One level of improvement was observed in global and by-area psychosocial functioning in the experimental group, but not in controls. Patients at the end of the study had switched from a score of three (neutral, unconcerned) to level two (satisfied with their own functioning). In the control group there were no statistically significant differences. Emotional expression in relatives in the experimental group significantly decreased at the end of the study (p < .006), but not in the control group, given that the latter did not show statistically, significant differences. Occupational activities at home were also improved in the experimental group, with better scores at the end of the study. Regarding the assessment of occupational therapy, there were significant differences in four areas. Other areas with positive changes were: disease attribution to the patient, and patterns of communication in the family The areas with better results were self-care, socialization, and family dynamics, which are frequently altered in schizophrenic patients. These results showed the efficacy of the program in its integral version (pluridimensional). Once the proposed objectives are reached, we propose to continue this program with important modifications of the method, which will be described in future publications.

AB  - Substance abuse accounts for over 200,000 deaths annually in American females-more than four times the number who will die of breast cancer. While female addiction is at epidemic proportions, treatment continues to focus on males and their substance abuse. Furthermore, it is questionable whether treatment designed for male substance use can be generalized to female substance users. This is compounded by the dearth of studies that examine treatment of female substance abuse. A pretest-posttest comparative experimental design was used to evaluate whether Cognitive Behavioral Therapy or Insight-Oriented Psychotherapy was more efficacious in the treatment of substance abuse in a female population. The final sample for this study consisted of 17 participants who were randomly assigned to the two treatment conditions via a table of random numbers. Chi-square analysis indicated that there was no significant difference between the two treatment conditions on any demographic variable. Dependent variables include Drug- and Alcohol-Status, Psychosocial variables, anxiety and depression. Instruments used included the Structured Clinical Interview using the DSM, the Addiction Severity Index, and the Profile Of Mood States. Each group counseling session lasted for 90 minutes and convened weekly for a period of eight weeks. Statistical analyses included Means, standard deviations, effect size, and MANOVA procedures. The major findings in this study include: neither IOP or CBT was effective in increasing psychosocial functioning of the current sample; CBT was over ten times more effective than IOP in the reduction of alcohol use; CBT was four times more effective than IOP in the reduction of drug use; CBT was two times more effective than IOP in the reduction of anxiety; and, CBT was three times more effective than IOP in the reduction of depression. The current findings suggest that (1) IOP treatment is not the treatment of choice for females with a history of substance abuse who are in the early stages of recovery; (2) females can respond well to treatment based on a cognitive-behavioral paradigm; (3) treatment approaches designed for male veterans can be applied to a female population within an outpatient community mental health setting.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to test the efficacy of 2 brief interventions for alcohol misuse in a sample of combat veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan., METHOD: Participants were 68 combat veterans (91.2% male; 64.7% White, 27.9% Black) with a mean age of 32.31 years (SD = 8.84) who screened positive for hazardous drinking in a Veterans Affairs Medical Center primary care clinic using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (Babor, Higgins-Biddle, Saunders, & Monteiro, 2001). More than half of the sample (57.4%) met criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; based on the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale; Blake et al., 1995). Eligible veterans who elected to participate completed a baseline assessment and were randomized to receive 1 of 2 interventions (personalized feedback delivered with or without a motivational interviewing counseling session). Both interventions included information on hazardous drinking, PTSD symptoms, depression, and coping. Follow-up assessments were conducted at 6 weeks and 6 months post-intervention., RESULTS: Both conditions resulted in statistically significant reductions in quantity and frequency of alcohol use as well as frequency of binge drinking and alcohol-related consequences. Within-group effect sizes (ds) were in the small to medium range (.21-.55) for quantity and frequency of alcohol use. There were no statistically significant Condition x Time interactions, suggesting that both interventions were similarly effective. PTSD and non-PTSD veterans responded equally well to both interventions, but veterans with PTSD assigned to feedback plus motivational interviewing reported greater reductions in weekly drinking at the 6-week follow-up., CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that brief interventions for alcohol misuse may be effective for reducing drinking, even in an Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom veteran population with a high degree of PTSD.

AB  - The impact of multiple‐family group treatment (MFGT) on outpatient and inpatient mental health service utilization of 97 persons with schizophrenia was investigated. Participants were randomly assigned to standard care (n = 44) or standard care plus MFGT (n = 53). Service use for a year prior to randomization, the 2‐year study period, and a 1‐year follow‐up were examined. Relative to standard care participants, the MFGT group had reduced community hospitalization during year 1 of the intervention and reduced state hospitalization at follow‐up. During the intervention period, MFGT participants demonstrated a significant increase in outpatient utilization as a direct consequence of the intervention. However, when service use was summed across 3 years post‐randomization, no group differences were observed. Results suggest that implementation of MFGT in a community mental health setting reduces inpatient service at specific time periods, without significantly increasing outpatient service utilization. These findings add to other outcomes from this study that demonstrate decreased psychiatric symptoms and caregiver distress.

AB  - Abstract: Background: Interpersonal functioning is a key determinant of psychological well-being, and interpersonal problems (IPs) are common among individuals with psychiatric disorders. However, IPs are rarely formally assessed in clinical practice or within cognitive behavior therapy research trials as predictors of treatment attrition and outcome. The main aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between IPs, depressogenic cognitions, and treatment outcome in a large clinical sample receiving cognitive behavioral group therapy (CBGT) for depression in a community clinic. Methods: Patients (N=144) referred for treatment completed measures of IPs, negative cognitions, depression symptoms, and quality of life (QoL) before and at the completion of a 12-week manualized CBGT protocol. Results: Two IPs at pre-treatment, ‘finding it hard to be supportive of others’ and ‘not being open about problems,’ were associated with higher attrition. Pre-treatment IPs also predicted higher post-treatment depression symptoms (but not QoL) after controlling for pre-treatment symptoms, negative cognitions, demographics, and comorbidity. In particular, ‘difficulty being assertive’ and a ‘tendency to subjugate one's needs' were associated with higher post-treatment depression symptoms. Changes in IPs did not predict post-treatment depression symptoms or QoL when controlling for changes in negative cognitions, pre-treatment symptoms, demographics, and comorbidity. In contrast, changes in negative cognitions predicted both post-treatment depression and QoL, even after controlling for changes in IPs and the other covariates. Limitations: Correlational design, potential attrition bias, generalizability to other disorders and treatments needs to be evaluated. Conclusions: Pre-treatment IPs may increase risk of dropout and predict poorer outcomes, but changes in negative cognitions during treatment were most strongly associated with improvement in symptoms and QoL during CBGT.

AB  - Background: Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is effective for most patients with a social anxiety disorder (SAD) but a substantial proportion fails to remit. Experimental and clinical research suggests that enhancing CBT using imagery-based techniques could improve outcomes. It was hypothesized that imagery-enhanced CBT (IE-CBT) would be superior to verbally-based CBT (VB-CBT) on pre-registered outcomes. Methods: A randomized controlled trial of IE-CBT v. VB-CBT for social anxiety was completed in a community mental health clinic setting. Participants were randomized to IE (n = 53) or VB (n = 54) CBT, with 1-month (primary end point) and 6-month follow-up assessments. Participants completed 12, 2-hour, weekly sessions of IE-CBT or VB-CBT plus 1-month follow-up. Results: Intention to treat analyses showed very large within-treatment effect sizes on the social interaction anxiety at all time points (ds = 2.09–2.62), with no between-treatment differences on this outcome or clinician-rated severity [1-month OR = 1.45 (0.45, 4.62), p = 0.53; 6-month OR = 1.31 (0.42, 4.08), p = 0.65], SAD remission (1-month: IE = 61.04%, VB = 55.09%, p = 0.59); 6-month: IE = 58.73%, VB = 61.89%, p = 0.77), or secondary outcomes. Three adverse events were noted (substance abuse, n = 1 in IE-CBT; temporary increase in suicide risk, n = 1 in each condition, with one being withdrawn at 1-month follow-up). Conclusions: Group IE-CBT and VB-CBT were safe and there were no significant differences in outcomes.

AB  - Background and Aims Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is common among people with substance use disorders, and the comorbidity is associated with negative outcomes. We report on a randomized controlled trial comparing the effect of integrated cognitive-behavioral therapy (ICBT) plus standard care, individual addiction counseling plus standard care and standard care alone on substance use and PTSD symptoms. Design Three-group, multi-site randomized controlled trial. Setting Seven addiction treatment programs in Vermont and New Hampshire, USA. Participants/Cases Recruitment took place between December 2010 and January 2013. In this single-blind study, 221 participants were randomized to one of three conditions: ICBT plus standard care (SC) ( n = 73), individual addiction counseling (IAC) plus SC ( n = 75) or SC only ( n = 73). One hundred and seventy-two patients were assessed at 6-month follow-up (58 ICBT; 61 IAC; 53 SC). Intervention and comparators: ICBT is a manual-guided therapy focused on PTSD and substance use symptom reduction with three main components: patient education, mindful relaxation and flexible thinking. IAC is a manual-guided therapy focused exclusively on substance use and recovery with modules organized in a stage-based approach: treatment initiation, early abstinence, maintaining abstinence and recovery. SC are intensive out-patient program services that include 9-12 hours of face-to-face contact per week over 2-4 days of group and individual therapies plus medication management. Measurements Primary outcomes were PTSD severity and substance use severity at 6 months. Secondary outcomes were therapy retention. Findings PTSD symptoms reduced in all conditions with no difference between them. In analyses of covariance, ICBT produced more favorable outcomes on toxicology than IAC or SC [comparison with IAC, parameter estimate: 1.10; confidence interval (CI) = 0.17-2.04; comparison with SC, parameter estimate: 1.13; CI = 0.18-2.08] and had a greater reduction in reported drug use than SC (parameter estimate: -9.92; CI = -18.14 to -1.70). ICBT patients had better therapy continuation versus IAC ( P<0.001). There were no unexpected or study-related adverse events. Conclusions Integrated cognitive behavioral therapy may improve drug-related outcomes in post-traumatic stress disorder sufferers with substance use disorder more than drug-focused counseling, but probably not by reducing post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms to a greater extent.

AB  - Recidivism rates were examined for the near-exhaustive sample of 122 adult sex offenders placed in a rural Vermont county under correctional supervision from 1984 through 1995. Participants were at risk for an average of 62.9 mo. Of this sample, 71 nonrandomized participants enrolled in a comprehensive outpatient cognitive-behavioral and relapse-prevention-based treatment program, 32 participants received less specialized mental health treatment, and the remaining 19 participants received no treatment. Pretreatment, between-group comparisons identified the no-treatment group as having more extensive criminal histories. No other statistically significant between-group differences among factors related to reoffense risk were found. At follow up, the cognitive-behavioral treatment group demonstrated a statistically significant treatment benefit. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: The study examined the association between fidelity of programs to the assertive community treatment model and client outcomes in dual disorders programs. Methods: Assertive community treatment programs in the New Hampshire dual disorders study were classified as low-fidelity programs (three programs) or high-fidelity programs (four programs) based on extensive longitudinal process data. The study included 87 clients with a dual diagnosis of severe mental illness and a comorbid substance use disorder. Sixty-one clients were in the high-fidelity programs, and 26 were in the low-fidelity programs. Client outcomes were examined in the domains of substance abuse, housing, psychiatric symptoms, functional status, and quality of life, based on interviews conducted every six months for three years. Results: Clients in the high-fidelity assertive community treatment programs showed greater reductions in alcohol and drug use and attained higher rates of remission from substance use disorders than clients in the low-fidelity programs. Clients in high-fidelity programs had higher rates of retention in treatment and fewer hospital admissions than those in low-fidelity programs. No differences between groups were found in length of hospital stays and other residential measures, psychiatric symptoms, family and social relations, satisfaction with services, and overall life satisfaction. Conclusions: Faithful implementation of, and adherence to, the assertive community treatment model for persons with dual disorders was associated with superior outcomes in the substance use domain. The findings underscore the value of measures of model fidelity, and they suggest that local modifications of the assertive community treatment model or failure to comply with it may jeopardize program success.

AB  - This study presents the prevalence and treatment outcome of DUAL diagnoses (psychoactive substance use disorders [PSUD] plus other nonpsychotic mental disorders) among a population of homeless persons participating in a behavioral day treatment and contingency management drug abuse treatment program. Participants were 128 persons: 76.6% male, 23.4% female; 82.2% African-American, 17.2% Caucasian. There were 46 (35.9%) PSUDs and 82 (64.1%) DUAL participants. Cocaine (96.9%) and alcohol disorders (57.8%) were most prevalent overall, and 60.2% of participants had two or more psychoactive substance use disorders. DUAL participants had significantly more alcohol disorders than PSUDs (62.2% versus 50.0%). The most prevalent mental disorders (other than substance use) for the total and DUAL samples were, respectively, mood (51.6% and 80.5%) and anxiety (35.9% and 56.1%), and 31.3% and 48.8% had more than two mental disorders. The DUAL group had more severe problems than the PSUD group at baseline in alcohol, medical condition, employment/support, and psychiatric status areas on the ASI. Both groups showed treatment improvements at 6-months follow-up with the DUAL group showing greater mean changes than the PSUD group in five of the seven ASI areas. These findings are discussed in terms of effect of dual diagnoses on treatment outcome and study limitations related to a retrospective design and select sample of nonpsychotic mental disorders.

AB  - This article investigates a community-based group therapy intervention designed to address specific needs of women in transition as compared to women also in transition, engaged in a traditional, nonclinical women's program. Both interventions were found to increase social network size, decrease social isolation, and decrease financial stress. The group therapy intervention participants also reported increased self-efficacy beliefs. These findings suggest a need to integrate a group therapy intervention into traditional social service facilities that serve women during times of major life transition.

AB  - Background: People with schizophrenia have significant difficulties with cognition and social skills that negatively impact community functioning. Recovery oriented programs offer skills training to overcome these deficits, but problems generalizing what is learned, coupled with self defeating beliefs, environmental factors and motivational impairment often hamper the translation of the learned skills to community functioning. We developed a program of community based skills coaching (CBC) to provide an opportunity to practice the skills learned in the clinic, in relevant community situations. Methods: Four MA level clinicians were trained to provide CBC. The coaches helped their clients practice identified deficient skills (eg social, travel, independent living) an average of 2 hrs/week. We examined the functional abilities of all individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, aged 18‐ 58, who were enrolled for at least 4 months during 2012 in a recovery clinic and receiving group based skills training (cognitive remediation, CBT, DBT) to address neuro and social cognition, psychotic symptoms, social and motivational deficits. Ten individuals identified at intake as having the most difficulty with community functioning were offered CBC in addition to the clinic based group program; another 10 individuals participated only in clinic based groups. The clinic routinely administers the Multnomah Community Ability Scale (MCAS) upon intake and 4 months later by 3 individual care coordinators, trained to rate with good inter‐rater reliability (.87). Results: CBC recipients had significantly lower MCAS scores at Time 1 (p <.002) indicating worse community functioning at intake than the individuals who received clinic based treatment . The MCAS scores of the CBC participants increased significantly from Time 1 (M = 60, SD = 8.43) to Time 2 (M = 65.60, SD = 6.72) whereas the MCAS scores of those receiving clinic based training did not change significantly: Time 1 (M = 72, SD = 6.63); Time 2 (M = 70.40, SD = 6.20). CBC participants showed significantly more improvement in their functional skills than those receiving only clinic based treatment (p <.004). Conclusion: It is feasible to provide community based skills training to participants in recovery oriented programs and this form of treatment may facilitate faster functional improvement than is seen when all treatment is clinic based. Further research with a randomized controlled trial, using blinded raters, is indicated.

AB  - Background: The Danish OPUS I trial randomized 547 patients with first-episode psychosis to a two-year early-specialised assertive treatment programme (OPUS) versus standard treatment. The two years OPUS treatment had significant positive effects on psychotic and negative symptoms, secondary substance abuse, treatment adherence, lower dosage of antipsychotic medication, and a higher treatment satisfaction. However, three years after end of the OPUS treatment, the positive clinical effects were not sustained, except that OPUS-treated patients were significantly less likely to be institutionalised compared with standard-treated patients. The major objective of the OPUS II trial is to evaluate the effects of five years of OPUS treatment versus two years of OPUS treatment.Methods: The OPUS II trial is designed as a randomized, open label, parallel group trial with blinded outcome assessment. Based on our sample size estimation, 400 patients treated in OPUS for two years will be randomized to further three years of OPUS treatment versus standard treatment. The specialized assertive OPUS treatment consists of three core elements: assertive community treatment, psycho-educational family treatment, and social skills training.Discussion: It has been hypothesized that there is a critical period from onset up to five years, which represents a window of opportunity where a long-term course can be influenced. Extending the specialized assertive OPUS treatment up to five years may allow the beneficial effects to continue beyond the high-risk period, through consolidation of improved social and functional outcome.Trial Registration: Clinical Trial.gov NCT00914238.

AB  - Although aquatic‐based interventions are increasingly used in the psychiatric rehabilitation services, the effects of this type of community program as an adjuvant therapy for psychosocial problems of people with serious mental illness (SMI) have been under‐explored. This research evaluated the feasibility and outcomes of an occupational therapy program consisting of aquatic‐based activities (AA‐OT program) in the community in Spain. This study is the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) on this topic. This pilot trial was conducted with a sample of 16 adults with SMI who were randomly allocated to the AA‐OT program plus treatment as usual or treatment as usual alone (eight in each group). The AA‐OT program included activation of daily living skills, warm‐up, group activities/tasks, and relaxation. It consisted of two sessions per week over 12 weeks. Outcomes were evaluated at week 0 and 12. A total of 14 participants (87.5%) completed the trial. No adverse events or side‐effects were noted. Comparisons between the two groups on change scores showed that participants in the intervention group showed significant improvements in several outcome measures: psychosocial problems (HoNOS), two health‐related quality of life scales (SF‐36: Physical Functioning and Mental Health), and performance of social activities (Activity and Social Relations scale). Satisfaction with the program was high. In conclusion, the results support the feasibility and potential benefits of this occupational therapy program. 12 weeks of aquatic‐based activities in a group intervention may enhance the outcomes of psychiatric rehabilitation improving the severity of psychosocial problems, patient‐reported health status, and social relations. This community‐based program may be beneficial as a non‐pharmacologic method in the illness management and recovery of people with SMI. The findings from this pilot trial need to be confirmed in a large, fully‐powered RCT.

AB  - Almost 700,000 cases of child abuse and neglect have been substantiated annually, with many more un-reported children being exposed to community and interpersonal violence (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2017). Exposure to chronic or multiple potentially traumatic events places large numbers of children to grow up into emotionally and physically at-risk adults (Felitti et al., 1998). Although some helpful treatments already exist, examination of tailored alternative approaches is needed to address the broader somatic and psychological problems associated with complex trauma exposure. The current study involved developing and evaluating a pilot integrative group therapy treatment for adults who have experienced complex trauma. The treatment components draw from the field of interpersonal neurobiology and polyvagal theory. Interpersonal neurobiology approaches treatment through the lens of the embodied brain, including both the brain and the nervous system (Siegel, 2012). Polyvagal theory brings greater nuance to the interplay between experiencing trauma and the impacts on the autonomic nervous system via the dorsal and ventral vagal nerves (Porges, 2011). The group treatment combined process-oriented therapy with trauma-sensitive yoga delivered once weekly over the course of eight weeks. The treatment offered participants psychoeducation, opportunities for trauma processing, and various meditative grounding exercises. The study examined feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy across a range of psychological and physiological domains including complex traumatic stress, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and physical pain. Participants were recruited by flyers and an informational website through which interested individuals could message the lead researcher. Thirty eligible individuals completed intake procedures and ten participants were lost or dropped out before the treatment began. Participants (N=20) were randomly assigned to either the treatment or waitlist control group with ten participants falling into each condition. The sample included nineteen women and one man, were 60% White, with a mean age of 25.3 years. Independent samples t-tests indicated that at the time of intake there were no significant differences across the treatment and waitlist control conditions for all reported participant characteristics. Participants in the treatment condition felt that the group members accepted one another, that despite having differences, the group felt secure, and that the members felt that what was happening was important and there was a sense of participation. Paired samples t-tests examined change in depression, anxiety, complex traumatic stress symptoms, sleep disturbance, and physical pain intensity for each condition, but the only significant change was sleep disturbance between pre- and post-treatment for the treatment condition. Treatment effect sizes calculated at the conclusion of the study showed that the treatment condition saw moderate to large reductions in their complex traumatic stress symptoms (d = .64), and large reductions in their sleep disturbances (d = 1.09). Despite paired samples t-tests indicating no significant differences for the waitlist control condition, effect sizes also indicated that the waitlist control condition had moderate increases in their physical pain intensity (d = -.56) and small to moderate reductions in their complex traumatic stress symptoms (d = .38).Compared to similarly integrative trauma treatments (Nguyen-Feng et al., 2019; Niles et al., 2018), the current study found comparable reductions in symptoms of traumatic stress and depression and fewer reductions in anxiety as indicated by treatment effect size calculations. The current study was subject to some unexpected situations that may have affected results. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Panic disorder (PD) is a common, severe and persistent mental disorder, associated with a high degree of distress and occupational and social disability. A substantial proportion of the population experiences subthreshold and mild PD and is at risk of developing a chronic PD. A promising intervention, aimed at preventing panic disorder onset and reducing panic symptoms, is the 'Don't Panic' course. It consists of eight sessions of two hours each. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of this early intervention - based on cognitive behavioural principles - on the reduction of panic disorder symptomatology. We predict that the experimental condition show superior clinical and economic outcomes relative to a waitlisted control group. Methods/design: A pragmatic, pre-post, two-group, multi- site, randomized controlled trial of the intervention will be conducted with a naturalistic follow-up at six months in the intervention group. The participants are recruited from the general population and are randomized to the intervention or a waitlist control group. The intervention is offered by community mental health centres. Included are people over 18 years of age with subthreshold or mild panic disorder, defined as having symptoms of PD falling below the cut-off of 13 on the Panic Disorder Severity Scale-Self Report (PDSS-SR). Primary outcomes are panic disorder and panic symptoms. Secondary outcomes are symptoms of agoraphobia, anxiety, cognitive aspects of panic disorder, depressive symptoms, mastery, health-related quality of life, and cost-effectiveness. We will examine the following variables as potential mediators: cognitive aspects of panic disorder, symptoms of agoraphobia, anxiety and mastery. Potential moderating variables are: socio-demographic characteristics, panic disorder, agoraphobia, treatment credibility and mastery. Discussion: This study was designed to evaluate the (cost) effectiveness of an early intervention based on cognitive behavioural principles. The strong external validity is one of the strengths of the study design. Trial registration: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN33407455.

AB  - Objective: Mindfulness‐based cognitive therapy (MBCT) has recently been proposed as a treatment option for chronic depression. The cognitive behavioral analysis system of psychotherapy (CBASP) is the only approach specifically developed to date for the treatment of chronically depressed patients. The efficacy of MBCT plus treatment‐as‐usual (TAU), and CBASP (group version) plus TAU, was compared to TAU alone in a prospective, bicenter, randomized controlled trial. Method: One hundred and six patients with a current DSM‐IV defined major depressive episode and persistent depressive symptoms for more than 2 years were randomized to TAU only (N = 35), or to TAU with additional 8‐week group therapy of either 8 sessions of MBCT (n = 36) or CBASP (n = 35). The primary outcome measure was the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (24‐item HAM‐D, Hamilton, 1967) at the end of treatment. Secondary outcome measures were the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; Beck, Steer, & Brown, 1996) and measures of social functioning and quality of life. Results: In the overall sample as well as at 1 treatment site, MBCT was no more effective than TAU in reducing depressive symptoms, although it was significantly superior to TAU at the other treatment site. CBASP was significantly more effective than TAU in reducing depressive symptoms in the overall sample and at both treatment sites. Both treatments had only small to medium effects on social functioning and quality of life. Conclusions: Further studies should inquire whether the superiority of CBASP in this trial might be explained by the more active, problem‐solving, and interpersonal focus of CBASP.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Existing evidence suggests that family interventions can be effective in reducing relapse rates in schizophrenia and related conditions. Despite this, such interventions are not routinely delivered in Australian mental health services. The objective of the current study is to investigate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of introducing three types of family interventions, namely: behavioural family management (BFM); behavioural intervention for families (BIF); and multiple family groups (MFG) into current mental health services in Australia. METHOD: The ICER of each of the family interventions is assessed from a health sector perspective, including the government, persons with schizophrenia and their families/carers using a standardized methodology. A two-stage approach is taken to the assessment of benefit. The first stage involves a quantitative analysis based on disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted. The second stage involves application of 'second filter' criteria (including equity, strength of evidence, feasibility and acceptability to stakeholders) to results. The robustness of results is tested using multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: The most cost-effective intervention, in order of magnitude, is BIF (8000 Australian dollars per DALY averted), followed by MFG (21,000 Australian dollars per DALY averted) and lastly BFM (28,000 Australian dollars per DALY averted). The inclusion of time costs makes BFM more cost-effective than MFG. Variation of discount rate has no effect on conclusions. CONCLUSIONS: All three interventions are considered 'value-for-money' within an Australian context. This conclusion needs to be tempered against the methodological challenge of converting clinical outcomes into a generic economic outcome measure (DALY). Issues surrounding the feasibility of routinely implementing such interventions need to be addressed.

AB  - <bold>Introduction: </bold>Complementary interventions have the potential to enhance treatment engagement and/or response among veterans with psychiatric disorders and/or substance use disorders (SUDs). Mindfulness-based therapeutic sailing (MBTS) is a novel three-session, complementary intervention, which combines nature exposure via recreational sailing and mindfulness training. It was developed specifically to augment both treatment response and engagement among veterans with psychiatric disorders or SUDs. The study reports a follow-up investigation of a version of MBTS modified based upon a previous initial pilot study.<bold>Materials and Methods: </bold>This is an institutional review board-approved study of 25 veterans, 23 males and 2 females, who participated in MBTS along with a diagnosis-, gender-, and age-matched control group. All participants had at least one psychiatric disorder or SUD and most (92%) had two or more conditions, with the most common being any SUD (76%) and PTSD (72%). Instruments used to evaluate within-subjects pre- to post-intervention psychological changes were the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire II (AAQII), the Toronto Mindfulness Scale (TMS), and the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ). The Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES) was administered to evaluate how much the participants enjoyed the intervention. Outcome measures were collected for 1-year pre-intervention and 1-year post-intervention for between-subject analyses. These were numbers of medical and psychiatric hospitalizations, emergency department visits, mental health (MH) and substance abuse treatment visits, and MH and substance abuse treatment failed appointments. Data analysis consisted of using paired, two-tailed t-tests on psychological instrument results, Poisson regression on discrete outcome measures, and chi-square test of independence on demographic factors.<bold>Results: </bold>Within-subjects comparisons revealed significant mean pre- to post-intervention increases in AAQII (P = .04) and TMS scores (P = .009). The FFMQ scores increased but the change was nonsignificant (P = .12). The PACES scores were high for all sessions, indicating enjoyment of the intervention by participants. Although the coefficient was nonsignificant, Poisson regression uncovered reduction in substance abuse treatment visits post-intervention. There were no significant differences for the other variables. For demographic factors, the differences between intervention and control groups were not statistically significant.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>The MBTS is associated with increases in psychological flexibility (AAQII) and state mindfulness (TMS). The intervention was perceived as pleasurable by participants (PACES) and is potentially associated with decreased utilization of substance use treatment services. These results must be considered as preliminary; however, these finding corroborate results from a previous pilot study and indicate that MBTS holds promise as a complementary intervention that could result in enhanced treatment engagement and/or outcomes for the population studied. A randomized controlled trial of MBTS is warranted. Further, the model of a three-session intervention combining mindfulness training with nature exposure could be adapted for other types of nature exposure, such as hiking or snowshoeing or other complementary interventions including equine-assisted activities and therapies.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to determine whether supplementing traditional cognitive-behavioral therapy for depression with clinical case management would reduce the rate of dropout from care and improve outcomes for ethnically diverse, impoverished medical outpatients. Methods: The study was a randomized trial that compared cognitive-behavioral group psychotherapy alone (N = 103) with the same therapy supplemented by clinical case management (N = 96). Results. The patients who received supplemental case management had lower dropout rates than those who received cognitive-behavioral group therapy alone. Supplemental case management was associated with greater improvement in symptoms and functioning than. cognitive-behavioral therapy alone for patients whose first language was Spanish (N = 77) but was less effective for those whose first language was English (N = 122). Conclusion's: Supplemental case management improves retention in traditional mental health outpatient care and can improve outcomes for Spanish-speaking patients.

AB  - Study objectives. To assess the efficacy of short-term group cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) of insomnia in a chronic psychiatric population. The study objective was to assess the effects of CBT on sleep parameters and daytime symptoms compared to a stress treatment group (STG) and wait list control (WLC) conditions. Design. Matched assignment to one of three conditions. Setting. A psychiatric out-patient setting. Patients. Forty-one out-patient subjects who met criteria of a = or >30 minute sleep latency and sleep efficiency <85%. Interventions. Multi-component CBT, utilized stimulus control, modified sleep restriction, relaxation techniques, behavioral-cognitive strategies, sleep hygiene, and sleep education. STG utilized supportive therapy and emotional expression of current psycho-social problems. Measurements. Data from subjective (sleep diary) measures are analyzed by means of General Linear Model 3 x 4 repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs). A priori orthogonal contrasts and post hoc Tukey HSD multiple comparisons were conducted. The outcome measures were analyzed using a 3 x 2 repeated measures ANOVAs, with the 3 groups as the between-subjects factor and the 2 evaluations (pre and post-treatment) as the within-subjects factor. A priori orthogonal contrasts were done to identify differences between the treatment groups. Post hoc Tukey HSD comparisons were done to identify possible differences between the groups at each evaluation period. Results. The CBT group produced larger improvements across the majority of outcome measures than the STG or the WLC group. Self-report measures of sleep onset latency, total wake time, number of awakenings, nap time, and time in bed, showed significant change with treatment. Post-treatment gains on most measures were maintained at Week 10. Conclusions. Results provide evidence from a controlled trial that CBT improves insomnia in a psychiatric population with diagnoses of schizophrenia, schizoaffective, and bipolar disorder. As hypothesized, participants in the CBT condition showed significant improvements on many sleep parameters, while those participants in the STG and WLC groups showed few changes.

AB  - Objective: The study explored the presence of different patterns of change in a sample of patients who received cognitive therapy for depression sequentially in two different formats: group and individual. Our hypothesis was that patients' baseline characteristics (e.g., symptom severity, self-esteem) would discriminate patterns of response to group and individual therapy. Method: 108 adults who met criteria for depression and completed the treatments included in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) were assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), the Clinical Outcome in Routine Evaluation-Short Form B (CORE-SFB), the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF), and the repertory grid technique. Growth mixture modeling was carried out to identify the patterns of change. Mixed linear models and repeated measures analysis of variance were performed to compare patients' characteristics in each pattern. Multinomial logistic regression was used to compute predictive models for the patterns from patients' characteristics. Finally, hierarchical linear regression was used to establish the power of each pattern to predict treatment outcome. Results: A 3-class solution was obtained: group therapy improvers, individual therapy improvers, and nonimprovers. Group therapy improvers started therapy with less severe levels of depression and psychological distress, higher functioning and self-esteem, lower perceived social isolation, and lower dilemmatic construction of the self than the other groups. Individual therapy improvers and nonimprovers presented similar characteristics at baseline. However, a significant proportion of nonimprovers presented a concurrent diagnosis of fibromyalgia. Conclusion: The greater the impairment that patients present at baseline, the more likely they are to benefit from individual therapy after group therapy. A diagnosis of fibromyalgia can be considered a risk factor for therapy failure in the treatment of depression.

AB  - The different family‐based interventions that have proven to be effective in treating people with schizophrenia present some therapeutic elements in common and differ in certain other respects, although to date, none of the proposed approaches have demonstrated to be clearly superior to each other in reduced relapse and readmission rates. Although the approaches based on relatives group therapies save considerable amounts of time, some data reveal better short‐term results when the intervention focuses on the family unit and the participant patient. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether the clinical and social benefits observed in the short term would be maintained 5 years later. METHOD: Follow‐up study over a 5‐year period on 87 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and their families taking part in a cognitive behavioral therapy, assigned at random either to (a) a family unit including the patient or (b) a group of relatives. RESULTS: The statistical contrast between the 2 survival curves reveals that they are not significant with regard to relapse (log‐rank test, 1.30; P < .2538) nor readmissions (long rank test, 0.03; P = .8547). Results after analyzing other variables were also similar in both groups, with slight differences for the strategy where the patient was not present. CONCLUSIONS: Both types of interventions have similar long‐term impact with a clear tendency to loose benefits acquired during the intervention. This finding suggests that it might be possible for some subgroups of patients to conduct a 12‐month therapy followed by a support group, hoping that long‐term benefits would be maintained.

AB  - Objective: The Recovery Management paradigm provides a conceptual framework for the examination of joint impact of a focal treatment and post-treatment service utilization on substance abuse treatment outcomes. We test this framework by examining the interactive effects of a treatment for comorbid PTSD and substance use, Seeking Safety, and post-treatment Twelve-Step Affiliation (TSA) on alcohol and cocaine use.Method: Data from 353 women in a six-site, randomized controlled effectiveness trial within the NIDA Clinical Trials Network were analyzed under latent class pattern mixture modeling. LCPMM was used to model variation in Seeking Safety by TSA interaction effects on alcohol and cocaine use.Results: Significant reductions in alcohol use among women in Seeking Safety (compared to health education) were observed; women in the Seeking Safety condition who followed up with TSA had the greatest reductions over time in alcohol use. Reductions in cocaine use over time were also observed but did not differ between treatment conditions nor were there interactions with post-treatment TSA.Conclusions: Findings advance understanding of the complexities for treatment and continuing recovery processes for women with PTSD and SUDs, and further support the chronic disease model of addiction.

AB  - Metacognitive training (MCT) for psychosis is a group intervention targeted at reducing positive symptoms in schizophrenia through an improvement of cognitive biases in these patients. Despite evidence for its feasibility and efficacy, the recommendations for including or excluding patients from MCT have so far been largely based on anecdotal clinical wisdom rather than empirical evidence. Predictors and moderators of outcome are presently unknown. We reanalyzed data from a large randomized controlled trial, for which 150 patients were randomly assigned to either MCT or CogPack (neurocognitive training) and followed up for up to 3 years. We explored which demographic variables, baseline symptoms, and cognitive biases would predict overall outcome and specific treatment benefits in MCT. Low self-esteem and social anxiety at baseline as well as positive appraisal of the intervention were consistently associated with improved outcome in MCT relative to CogPack. Among other variables, improvement of cognitive biases and selective attention during the intervention period as well as number of sessions attended were general predictors of positive outcome, irrespective of the type of intervention. Patients with cognitive biases and psychological strain (e.g., low self-esteem and quality of life) paired with social problems may represent an ideal target group for MCT. The present findings await replication in independent samples and may not generalise to other forms of metacognitive training (e.g., MCT for depression) or individualized metacognitive intervention for psychosis (MCT+).

AB  - Objective: People with substance use disorders who present with suicidal behavior are at high risk of subsequent suicide. There are few effective treatments specifically tailored for this population that diminish this risk. We aimed to assess the impact of an opportunistic cognitive behavioral intervention package (OCB) among adult outpatients with a substance use and comorbid suicide risk. Method: A randomized controlled trial was conducted across 2 sites in which 185 patients presenting with suicide risk and concurrent substance use received either OCB (8 sessions plus group therapy) or treatment as usual (TAU) over a 6-month period. Primary outcomes were suicidal behavior (suicide attempts, suicidal intent and presence of suicide ideation) and level of drug and alcohol consumption. Secondary outcomes were changes in psychological measures of suicide ideation, depression, anxiety, and self-efficacy. Results: There were no completed suicides, and only 2 participants reported suicide attempts at follow-up. Suicide ideation, alcohol consumption, and cannabis use fell over time but no significant Treatment × Time differences were found. There were also no differences between OCB and TAU over time on psychological measures of depression, anxiety, or self-efficacy. Suicide ideation at 6-month follow-up was predicted by cannabis use and higher scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale at baseline. Conclusions: The opportunistic cognitive behavioral intervention package did not appear to be beneficial in reducing suicide ideation, drug and alcohol consumption, or depression relative to treatment as usual.

AB  - AIM: To assess the effectiveness of a 12 week specialized, integrated intervention for alcohol dependence with comorbid anxiety and/or mood disorder using a randomized design in an outpatient hospital setting., METHODS: Out of 86 patients meeting the inclusion criteria for alcohol dependence with suspicion of comorbid anxiety and/or depressive disorder, 57 completed a 3-week stabilization period (abstinence or significantly reduced consumption). Of these patients, 37 (65%) met a formal diagnostic assessment of an anxiety and/or depressive disorder and were randomized to either (a) integrated intervention (cognitive behavioural therapy) for alcohol, anxiety and/or depression, or (b) usual counselling care for alcohol problems., RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analyses revealed a beneficial treatment effect of integrated treatment relative to usual counselling care for the number of days to relapse (chi(2) = 6.42, P < 0.05) and lapse (chi(2) = 10.73, P < 0.01). In addition, there was a significant interaction effect of treatment and time for percentage days of abstinence (P < 0.05). For heavy drinking days, the treatment effect was mediated by changes in DASS anxiety (P < 0.05). There were no significant treatment interaction effects for DASS depression or anxiety symptoms., CONCLUSIONS: These results provide support for integrated care in improving drinking outcomes for patients with alcohol dependence and comorbid depression/anxiety disorder., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01941693.

AB  - Six-month outcomes are evaluated from a 9-site quasi-experimental study of women with mental health and substance use disorders who have experienced physical or sexual abuse who enrolled in either comprehensive, integrated, trauma-informed, and consumer/survivor/recovering person-involved services (N = 1023) or usual care (N = 983). Mental health, post-traumatic stress symptoms, and substance use outcomes are assessed with multilevel regression models, controlling for program and personal characteristics. Person-level variables predict outcomes independent of intervention condition and, to a small extent, moderate intervention and program effects. In sites where the intervention condition provided more integrated counseling than the comparison condition, there are increased effects on mental health and substance use outcomes; these effects are partially mediated by person-level variables. These results encourage further research to identify the longer-term effects of integrated counseling for women with co-occurring disorders and trauma histories.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Women with co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders frequently have a history of interpersonal violence, and past research has suggested that they are not served effectively by the current service system. The goal of the Women, Co-occurring Disorders, and Violence Study was to develop and test the effectiveness of new service approaches specifically designed for these women., METHODS: A quasi-experimental treatment outcome study was conducted from 2001 to 2003 at nine sites. Although intervention specifics such as treatment length and modality varied across sites, each site used a comprehensive, integrated, trauma-informed, and consumer-involved approach to treatment. Substance use problem severity, mental health symptoms, and trauma symptoms were measured at baseline, and follow-up data were analyzed with prospective meta-analysis and hierarchical linear modeling., RESULTS: A total of 2,026 women had data at the 12-month follow-up: 1,018 in the intervention group and 1,008 in the usual-care group. For substance use outcomes, no effect was found. The meta-analysis demonstrated small but statistically significant overall improvement in women's trauma and mental health symptoms in the intervention relative to the usual-care comparison condition. Analysis of key program elements demonstrated that integrating substance abuse, mental health, and trauma-related issues into counseling yielded greater improvement, whereas the delivery of numerous core services yielded less improvement relative to the comparison group. A few person-level characteristics were associated with increases or decreases in the intervention effect. These neither moderated nor supplanted the effects of integrated counseling., CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes for women with co-occurring disorders and a history of violence and trauma may improve with integrated treatment.

AB  - Examined variables that influence treatment effects on days in stable housing and client satisfaction for homeless mentally ill clients, using a process evaluation of data from a previous study by G. A. Morse et al (see record [rid]1993-01551-001[/rid]). 178 individuals (58% men, 52% African American) were divided into 3 groups: continuous treatment condition, drop-in center condition, and outpatient condition. Housing contacts, entitlement contacts, mental health contacts, and supportive services were significant mediators of the treatment effect on days in stable housing. Program contacts, mental health contacts, and supportive services were significant mediators of client satisfaction. Results provide insight into why continuous treatment may be more effective than more traditional programs, although the effectiveness was less for men and African Americans.

AB  - Objective: Three types of case management were compared to determine their relative effectiveness in helping people with severe mental illness who were homeless or at risk of homelessness. Methods: Subjects recruited from a psychiatric emergency room and inpatient units were randomly assigned to one of the three treatment conditions: broker case management, in which the client's needs were assessed, services were purchased from multiple providers, and the client was monitored; assertive community treatment only, in which comprehensive services were provided for an unlimited period; and assertive community treatment augmented by support from community workers, who assisted with activities of daily living and were available for leisure activities. Of 165 subjects recruited, 135 were followed for 18 months. Results: Compared with clients assigned to broker case management, clients assigned to assertive community treatment only and assertive community treatment with community workers had superior outcomes on several variables. They were number of contacts with the assigned treatment program, resource utilization (for example, use of entitlements), severity of thought disorder, activity level, and client satisfaction. Clients in the assertive community treatment only condition achieved more days in stable housing than those in the other two treatment conditions. No significant treatment group effects were found on income, self-esteem, or substance abuse. Conclusions: Assertive community treatment is superior to broker case management in assisting individuals with serious mental illness who are at risk of homelessness.

AB  - This study compared the costs and outcomes associated with three treatment programs that served 149 individuals with dual disorders (i.e., individuals with co-occurring severe mental illness and substance use disorders) who were homeless at baseline. The three treatment programs were: Integrated Assertive Community Treatment (IACT), Assertive Community Treatment only (ACTO), and standard care (Control). Participants were randomly assigned to treatment and followed for a period of 24 months. Clients in the IACT and ACTO programs were more satisfied with their treatment program and reported more days in stable housing than clients in the Control condition. There were no significant differences between treatment groups on psychiatric symptoms and substance use. The average total costs associated with the IACT and Control conditions were significantly less than the average total costs for the ACTO condition.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of four interventions in providing services to homeless clients with dual disorders: standard care (SC), assertive community treatment only (ACTO), integrated assertive community treatment (IACT), and new integrated assertive community treatment (NIACT). Participants had to be homeless, have a substance use disorder, and have a severe mental illness to be eligible for the study. One hundred ninety-six individuals were randomly assigned to SC, ACTO, or IACT. Approximately two years later, 85 participants were assigned to NIACT. A quasi-experimental design was employed to analyze the data. Clients in the NIACT program had better outcomes on consumer satisfaction than clients in the other conditions. Clients in NIACT, IACT, and ACTO groups had better housing outcomes than clients in SC. Clients in NIACT reduced their use of drugs more than clients in the other programs, but there was no difference between conditions on the other substance abuse variables. There was no difference between conditions on psychiatric symptoms. IACT may need to be augmented with other services to reduce substance use and produce better psychiatric outcomes for dual-disorder homeless individuals.

AB  - A pilot study of a brief group‐based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) intervention (12 two‐hour sessions) was conducted with clients of public mental health services meeting four or more criteria for borderline personality disorder (BPD). Participants were randomly assigned to receive the ACT group intervention in addition to their current treatment (ACT + TAU; N= 21) or to continue with treatment as usual alone (TAU; N= 20). There was significantly more improvement from baseline for the ACT + TAU condition than the TAU condition on the primary outcome variable‐self‐rated BPD symptoms. The ACT + TAU gain was both clinically and statistically significant. The ACT + TAU condition also had significantly more positive change on anxiety and hopelessness, and on the following ACT consistent process variables: psychological flexibility, emotion regulation skills, mindfulness, and fear of emotions. For all but anxiety, the improvements for the ACT + TAU condition were significant, while the TAU condition had no significant changes on any measure. Follow‐up was possible for only a small number of participants. The improvements gained by the ACT + TAU participants were maintained except for fear of emotions. Anxiety continued to improve, becoming significantly different from baseline at follow‐up. Examination of mediators found that psychological flexibility, emotion regulation skills and mindfulness, but not less fear of emotions, mediated BPD symptoms. Psychological flexibility and emotion regulation skills also mediated hopelessness. There is a need for a larger trial, for comparison with other established treatments for BPD, and for conducting a trial of a longer intervention. Nonetheless, this pilot study suggests that a brief group‐based ACT intervention may be a valuable addition to TAU for people with BPD symptoms in the public sector. © 2012.

AB  - Objectives. Relapse prevention is one of the most important goals of long-term schizophrenia management, as relapse is both distressing and costly. Family intervention supplementation to standard treatment could reduce the relapse rate. This study assessed the influence of a short-term, clinically based, and profesionally led family psychoeducation programme on a 1-year relapse rate. Methods. A total of 120 patients were recruited upon discharge from two psychiatric hospitals in Prague: (1) Site A (N=86), where family psychoeducation is offered to all patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and acute psychotic episode with schizophrenic symptoms; and (2) Site B (N=34), where no such programme was offered. Results. Compared to nonparticipants, psychoeducation participants had a shorter average length of rehospitalization stay (5.89 vs. 17.78 days, P=0.045) in a 1-year follow-up after discharge. The probability of rehospitalization during a 1-year follow-up was higher for patients from the site that did not provide psychoeducation. Conclusions. A shorter average length of rehospitalization of psychoeducation participants, a high turnout of first-episode patients, and positive responses of psychoeducation participants suggest that family psychoeducation should be supplemented early in the course of the illness to achieve favourable treatment outcomes and minimize adverse health and the social consequences of schizophrenia.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide a rationale for working with families of clients with psychiatric and substance use disorder, and to describe a new program, family intervention for dual disorders (FIDD). METHOD: We developed and manualized the FIDD program, which includes both single-family and multiple-family group formats. We trained several clinicians at a local mental health center in the model and conducted a small pilot study. RESULTS: Clinicians were able to implement the program, and to successfully engage families in treatment. Most clients demonstrated significant improvements in substance abuse over one to two years of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The FIDD program is feasible and appears to promote collaboration between families and professionals, thereby improving the course of dual disorders. Controlled research is underway to evaluate the effects of the FIDD program on client and family outcomes.

AB  - A cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) program for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was developed to address its high prevalence in persons with severe mental illness receiving treatment at community mental health centers. CBT was compared with treatment as usual (TAU) in a randomized controlled trial with 108 clients with PTSD and either major mood disorder (85%) or schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (15%), of whom 25% also had borderline personality disorder. Eighty-one percent of clients assigned to CBT participated in the program. Intent-to-treat analyses showed that CBT clients improved significantly more than did clients in TAU at blinded posttreatment and 3- and 6-month follow-up assessments in PTSD symptoms, other symptoms, perceived health, negative trauma-related beliefs, knowledge about PTSD, and case manager working alliance. The effects of CBT on PTSD were strongest in clients with severe PTSD. Homework completion in CBT predicted greater reductions in symptoms. Changes in trauma-related beliefs in CBT mediated improvements in PTSD. The findings suggest that clients with severe mental illness and PTSD can benefit from CBT, despite severe symptoms, suicidal thinking, psychosis, and vulnerability to hospitalizations.

AB  - A randomized, controlled trial was conducted on 110 subjects who scored positive on the Diagnostic Interview for Borderlines to assess the merits of an experimental, time‐limited group treatment for borderline personality disorder (BPD) in comparison with the control condition, individual dynamic psychotherapy. Seventy‐nine subjects received treatment. Analyses at 12‐ and 24‐month follow‐ups on 84% of the treated subjects (N = 66), demonstrated no statistically significant differences in outcome on the major dependent variables. Outpatient referrals to the study complied with the treatments at twice the rate of inpatient referrals. The total study cohort showed significant improvements on all major outcomes at follow‐up. The cost effectiveness of the group approach, in tandem with its potential for application in a range of community services by multidisciplinary practitioners, speaks to the promise of this treatment as an innovative service approach for BPD.

AB  - Objective: Many adults with serious mental illness have significant medical illness burden and poor illness self-management. In this study, the authors examined Living Well, a group-based illness self-management intervention for adults with serious mental illness that was cofacilitated by two providers, one of whom has lived experience with co-occurring mental health and medical conditions. Method(s): Adults with serious mental illness (N=242) were randomly assigned to Living Well or an active control condition. Participants completed assessments of quality of life; health attitudes; self-management behaviors; and symptoms at baseline, posttreatment, and follow-up. Emergency room use was assessed by means of chart review. Mixed-effects models examined group x time interactions on outcomes. Result(s): Compared with the control group, adults in Living Well had greater improvements at posttreatment in mental health-related quality of life (t=2.15, p=.032), self-management self-efficacy (t=4.10, p < 001), patient activation (t=2.08, p=.038), internal health locus of control (t=2.01, p=.045), behavioral and cognitive symptom management (t=2.77, p=.006), and overall psychiatric symptoms (t=-2.02, p=.044); they had greater improvements at follow-up in physical activity-related self-management (t=2.55, p=.011) and relationship quality (t= -2.45, p=.015). No effects were found for emergency room use. The control group exhibited greater increases in physical health-related quality of life at posttreatment (t=-2.23, p=.026). Significant group differences in self-management self-efficacy (t=2.86, p=.004) and behavioral and cognitive symptom management (t=2.08, p=.038) were maintained at follow-up. Conclusion(s): Compared with an active control group, a peer-cofacilitated illness self-management group was more effective in improving quality of life and self-management self-efficacy among adults with serious mental illness.Copyright © 2019 American Psychiatric Association.

AB  - Background: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is found to be effective for common mental disorders and has been delivered in self-help and guided self-help formats. Crisis and transitional case management (TCM) services play a vital role in managing clients in acute mental health crises. It is, therefore, an appropriate setting to try CBT in guided self-help format. Methods: This was a preliminary evaluation of a formulation-driven cognitive behavioral guided self-help. Thirty-six (36) consenting participants with a diagnosis of nonpsychotic illness, attending crisis and the TCM services in Kingston, Canada, were recruited in this study. They were randomly assigned to the guided self-help plus treatment as usual (TAU) (treatment group) or to TAU alone (control group). The intervention was delivered over 8-12 weeks. Assessments were completed at baseline and 3 months after baseline. The primary outcome was a reduction in general psychopathology, and this was done using Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation - Outcome Measure. The secondary outcomes included a reduction in depression, measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and reduction in disability, measured using the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0. Findings: Participants in the treatment group showed statistically significant improvement in overall psychopathology (P<0.005), anxiety and depression (P<0.005), and disability (P<0.005) at the end of the trial compared with TAU group. Conclusion: A formulation-driven cognitive behavioral guided self-help was feasible for the crisis and TCM clients and can be effective in improving mental health, when compared with TAU. This is the first report of a trial of guided self-help for clients attending crisis and TCM services.

AB  - Background: The high prevalence of relapse following substance use disorder (SUD) treatment highlights the need for improved aftercare interventions. Mindfulness-Based Relapse Prevention (MBRP) is a group-based psychosocial aftercare program for individuals with substance use disorders. MBRP integrates evidence-based relapse prevention (RP) strategies with mindfulness-based interventions and aims to foster increased awareness of triggers, cravings, and habitual reactions and reduce relapse risk. In previous studies, MBRP resulted in lower levels of craving compared to treatment as usual (TAU; Bowen et al., 2009) and was more effective in preventing substance use and heavy drinking relapse at 12-month follow-up compared to both TAU and RP (Bowen et al., 2014). While initial results are promising, there is a paucity of MBRP efficacy studies, none of which have examined MBRP programs adapted for Veteran populations. Therefore, the present study aims to: 1) establish the feasibility of enrolling and retaining Veterans in an adapted 8-week MBRP protocol for Veterans in outpatient aftercare treatment at the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Healthcare System, and 2) obtain preliminary assessment of the efficacy of this program to increase mindfulness and reduce the risk for relapse. Method(s): Veterans in outpatient aftercare treatment for substance use disorders were eligible to participate and were assessed at baseline and post-MBRP. We tallied the number of Veterans referred vs. enrolled, the percent of visits attended, and percent of MBRP completers as defined by attendance of the Week-8 session. Random-intercept linear mixed models were used to explore the efficacy of MBRP on increasing trait mindfulness and reducing the risk for relapse. Trait mindfulness was assessed using the Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory (FMI), which is a valid and reliable self-report questionnaire for measuring mindfulness (Walach et al., 2006). Relapse risk was assessed using the Brief Addiction Monitor (BAM), which is a valid and reliable self-report measure assessing substance use, relapse risk and protective factors (Cacciola et al., 2013). Result(s): 54 Veterans were referred and 18 (33.3%; 2 female) between the ages of 34 and 73 enrolled in the program. Out of 144 possible visits (8 sessions*18 participants), 86% of the sessions were attended. 15 participants (83.3%) completed the adapted MBRP program. Trait mindfulness significantly increased following treatment (F(1,14)=5.12, p=0.04). Although not statistically significant, results also indicated a numerical reduction in substance-related risk factors and an increase in protective factors following MBRP. Three participants (17%) reported active substance use at baseline; all of whom reported abstinence at follow-up. Conclusion(s): These preliminary findings suggest that enrollment and retention of Veterans in an adapted version of MBRP is feasible and may be effective for increasing mindfulness and reducing relapse risk. Summary: The integration of evidence-based relapse prevention strategies and targeted mindfulness interventions may contribute to an increased ability to identify and adaptively cope with distress associated with craving and negative affect for Veterans in outpatient aftercare treatment for substance use disorders. Further study of this program is warranted.

AB  - People with schizophrenia often have problems functioning in everyday life. As people with schizophrenia get older, resources for effective health care and social services may become more limited. There is a need to develop effective rehabilitation programs that are sensitive to the special needs of older persons with schizophrenia. Patients are randomly assigned to either 1 of 2 groups. The FAST group will involve 24 sessions of group intervention designed to enhance daily functioning of older patients with schizophrenia. The placebo group will involve participation in a psychosocial support group for an equivalent amount of time. Treatment is followed by 6 monthly maintenance sessions. Patients will be assessed at 6, 12, and 18 months after the study start. Assessments include clinical and functional measures.

AB  - Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe, and disabling brain disorder. People with schizophrenia sometimes hear voices others don't hear, believe that others are broadcasting their thoughts to the world, or become convinced that others are plotting to harm them. These symptoms make it difficult for people with schizophrenia to interact normally and establish healthy social relationships with others. Cognitive Behavioral Social Skills Training (CBSST) is a group behavioral therapy intervention that focuses on improving cognitive and metacognitive impairments and social skills deficits that interfere with normal functioning in people with schizophrenia. Goal‐focused supportive contact (GFSC) is a group therapy intervention that focuses on helping people with schizophrenia to verbalize their problems or worries and to seek advice from fellow group members. This study evaluated the effectiveness of CBSST versus GFSC in improving social functioning in people with schizophrenia. The study will assessed changes in cognition, psychotic symptoms, and use of psychiatric healthcare services. Participants in this open label study were randomly assigned to one of the following treatment groups: treatment as usual (TAU) plus CBSST or TAU plus GFSC. Both interventions consist of 2‐hour therapy sessions weekly for 36 weeks. Groups receiving each intervention do not exceed ten people. CBSST integrates cognitive therapy, social skills training, and neurocognitive compensatory aids. Cognitive therapy helps participants challenge unhelpful thoughts and build communication and problem‐solving skills. Participants receive workbooks that describe the skills and contain homework assignments. GFSC focuses on empowering participants to share problems, worries, or concerns with others who face similar issues. Participants share advice with each other, but therapists do not teach skills. Outcomes were be assessed at Months 4.5, 9, 15, and 21 for all participants.

AB  - PURPOSE OF THE TRIAL: The randomized clinical trial aims to examine the effect of specialized treatment of cannabis abuse amongst young people with psychosis. Specialized addiction treatment is compared with treatment as usual. Treatment as usual is a non‐specialized, non‐manualized treatment. In order to examine the effect of the two treatments, patients are randomized to either specialized addiction treatment or treatment as usual. INTRODUCTION: Clinically, consensus exists about the fact that cannabis can cause psychotic symptoms that cannot be distinguished from schizophrenia, and that abuse of cannabis among patients with psychosis can maintain and worsen the psychotic symptoms. This has also been found in scientific studies [Linszen et al., 1994]. Several studies show that use of cannabis increases the risk of development of schizophrenia‐like symptoms, especially in young men disposed to developing psychosis [Zammit et al., 2002; Arseneault et al., 2002; Arseneault et al., 2004; Henquet et al., 2005]). Comorbid schizophrenia and substance abuse (dual‐diagnosis) have been associated in several reviews with lack of compliance to treatment. A systematic examination of hospitalized patients with schizophrenia found that lack of compliance to the treatment was related to substance abuse and lack of insight (Kamali et al., 2001). A follow‐up study of patients with schizophrenia and cannabis abuse found significantly more rehospitalizations, worse psychosocial functioning, higher levels of thought disorders and more pronounced paranoia compared to non‐abusing patients with schizophrenia (Caspari, 1999). In the "Reference Programme for Schizophrenia" [Sekretariatet for reference programmer, 2004], the Danish National Board of Health makes the following recommendation: "Since patients with schizophrenia and concomitant cannabis abuse have a poorer prognosis, the treatment system should therefore develop treatment methods that are effective at alleviating cannabis abuse." Evidence for the effect of treatment for cannabis abuse: There is little evidence concerning the treatment of cannabis abuse, but the literature suggests that it can be treated using methods that are effective for other types of abuse. Several randomized trials show an effect of cognitive behavioural therapy [Waldron and Kaminer, 2004]; however, treatment programmes that combine motivational interviewing, family involvement, and cognitive behavioural treatment seem to be more effective [McRae et al., 2003; Carroll, 2005]. Evidence for the effect of treatment of patients with dual diagnosis: A Cochrane review from 2002 concludes that insufficient evidence exists to show that any intensive treatment method is superior to others [Ley et al., 2000]. It is recommended not to offer the treatment separately but as a part of treatment programmes [Linszen et al., 1994b; Drake et al., 2004]. A randomized trial showed that the combination of cognitive behavioural therapy, motivational interviewing, and family involvement had a significant positive effect on level of functioning, psychotic symptoms, and duration of periods without abuse, compared with regular treatment [Barrowclough et al., 2001]. Two reviews conclude that there is positive evidence for integrated treatment with motivational interviews, cognitive behavioural therapy (individual or group‐based), 12‐step treatment, and a harm‐reduction approach [Ziedonis, 2004; Rachbeisel et al., 1999]. Evidence for the effect of group‐based intervention for cannabis abuse: There is no evidence to show that group‐based interventions are superior to individual treatment (McRoberts et al., 1998; Greene, 2002). Treatment in groups is less expensive. In a literature review, Weiss et al. conclude that specialized group therapy can reinforce the effect of the existing treatment (Weiss et al., 1992). A study from 1999 that robustly implemented a manualized behavioural group intervention showed a significant positive effect on symptoms, level of functioning, and lower costs for supportive services [Jerrell and Ridgely, 1999]. There is evidence for the efficacy of a stepwise or phase‐specific treatment that is successively based on engagement, motivation, coping with symptoms, and preventing relapse [Drake et al., 2004]. Conclusion: A review of the literature shows that there is a lack of randomized trials that can ensure that the treatment of patients with dual diagnosis is evidence‐based. This trial will assist in solving this problem by building on best practice. Therefore, we plan a trial in which group‐based, combined treatment, such as motivational interviewing, psychoeducation, cognitive behavioural therapy, and social skills training is compared with treatment as usual. INTERVENTIONS: 1. The experimental intervention: Cannabis and Psychosis (CapOpus) ‐ the specialized treatment programme: The patient is connected to a case manager who is offered education and supervision by one of the two addiction consultants employed in the trial‐project. The addiction consultants are both directly and indirectly involved in the treatment of the patient. During the month prior to the group intervention, one of the addiction consultants is in contact with the patients once or twice a week. A meeting is also held with the patient's family and fortnightly contact with the case manager is established. During the three months of group intervention, one of the addiction consultants has weekly individual contacts with the patient and two meetings with the family. In addition, the patient follows the weekly group intervention (12 meetings of 1½ hours) and has fortnightly consultative contacts to the case manager. During the two months following the group intervention, the addiction consultants are in weekly contact with the patient and the family is invited to a meeting. The addiction consultants contact the patient's case manager every three weeks. For the purpose of creating alliance and motivation, the treatment starts with motivational interviewing [Miller, 1983; Miller and Rollnick, 1991]. There is good evidence for the efficacy of motivational interviews in short‐term treatment [Hettema et al., 2005; Burke et al., 2003]. The patient formulates individual goals for the treatment and is offered the group intervention. The groups consist of 6 to 8 patients, with the addiction consultants as trainers. Each group runs for three months with weekly sessions lasting 1½ hours. The group is conducted at a fixed time on a weekday and the structure of the agenda is the same at all meetings. The group intervention is followed by two months during which the individual weekly meetings with the patient continue. The two addiction consultants offer consultative assistance to the patient's case manager, who also has the possibility of involving the consultants directly in the treatment of the patient. The entire specialized treatment programme, in which the addiction consultants are involved, amounts to six months. A manualized treatment programme based on the Australian EPPIC manual [Hinton et al., 2002] especially developed for first��episode psychotic patients with cannabis abuse is used. This method is well described and incorporates methods with a high degree of evidence. Motivational interviewing with analyses of advantages and drawbacks of continued abuse are used. Instruction is given in coping skills in relation to craving and situations that usually trigger abuse, and in developing personal strategies for avoiding or handling these situations. Furthermore, strategies for handling withdrawal symptoms and for preventing relapse are facilitated. General coping skills are introduced, such as handling unpleasant emotions, stress‐management, social skills training, and relaxation techniques. An element of contingency management is introduced to enhance motivation for participation in the group intervention. In a Cochrane Review from 2006, Denis et al. conclude that contingency management treatment may enhance outcomes combined with CBT or motivational enhancement [Denis et al., 2006] Contingency management in the CapOpus trial is solely connected to positive reinforcement of attendance in the group intervention. It has no connection to whether or not the use of cannabis is decreased. Patients are offered participation in free excursions, cinema visits etc. in the company of one of the addiction consultants. Also, sandwiches are served in conjunction with group sessions. An important part of "Cannabis and Psychosis" is to understand and to help the patients understand the mechanisms that prevent them from abstaining from cannabis. The overall target is harm reduction, a method which has proved effective in several studies [Ziedonis, 2004b; Rachbeisel et al., 1999]. The treatment is based on the patients' own goals for tackling cannabis abuse. The treatment is structured around the circle of change [Prochaska, 1991; Prochaska and Diclemente, 1992]. This describes changes in behaviour as a process that runs through phases of pre‐contemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance. Relapse is considered to be an integrated part of the process, after which the phases must be repeated. Pedagogy of the group intervention takes into account that psychotic patients most often have subnormal cognitive functioning. It is therefore important that the structure of each session is predictable and over‐learning is encompassed. This is done by using the same agenda at each session: ‐ Round ‐ what has happened the past week. ‐ Repetition from last session. ‐ Homework assignment for this session. ‐ Talk/psychoeducation (new topic in each session). ‐ Discussion of participants' experience with the topic. ‐ New homework assignment. ‐ Finishing round ‐ evaluation. The active participation of the patients is facilitated through discussions and role‐playing and homework between each session. To increase motivation, the teaching is made relevant in relation to the life of each patient and their individual goals for the treatment. The overall principles are described in the manual, but each session leaves room for adaptation to the patients' wishes and stage in the circle of change. Therapist roles are directive and direct, but non‐confronting non‐critical. Emphasis is on empathy and positive reinforcement, problem solving and generalization to the patients' daily life. The atmosphere is sought to be relaxed and with room for humour. For the concluding part of the group intervention, a patient with former cannabis abuse is involved as a role model. Methods of treatment are all part of the cognitive therapeutical framework, using psychoeducation, cognitive behavioural therapy, and social skills training. The aim is to ensure that the patients gain insight into inappropriate patterns of thoughts and actions and develop coping strategies. This is facilitated through: Exploration of the patient's reasons for using cannabis and the connection to symptomatology. Mapping of advantages/disadvantages of cannabis use and cessation of use. Warning signs of craving/relapse. Problem‐solving skills and coping skills for symptoms. Use of behavioural chain analysis (Mørch and Rosenberg, 2005). Work with negative automatic thoughts and alternative thoughts. Social skills training (e.g. to refuse drugs, solve conflicts, and engage in new contacts). Facilitating daily and recreational activities. Relapse prevention and developing a crisis plan. Structure of the modules in the group‐intervention: The structure of the intervention is based on the stages in Prochaska and Diclemente's model of change (circle of change). The model is based on the view that the patient often fluctuates between the different stages and undergoes relapses before being able to reach the final stage, which marks lasting change. In order to support the group and patient in the process of changing lifestyle, the therapists must be able to identify the current stage of the group/patient. Thus, the intervention can be aimed specifically, either by being oriented towards motivation enhancing or advisory techniques, or by changing focus, e.g. from exploring reasons for change to making plans for change. The purpose is to motivate the patient to move on through the stages; therefore, the model is also called "the motivational cycle" or "circle of change". In this way, each session in the group can be adapted to the participants' motivational level and stage of change. Sessions for the pre‐contemplation stage: Psychoeducation about: Knowledge of psychotic symptoms. Knowledge of the psychosis‐inducing effect of cannabis. Knowledge of risks and harms caused by cannabis use. Knowledge of abstinence symptoms following cannabis use (Budney et al., 1999). Knowledge of the effect of decreased use (harm reduction). Mapping the individual pattern of use, with focus on disadvantages of cannabis use and the triggers for craving and use. This is done by using registration charts. Contemplation stage: Exploration of pros and cons of cannabis use and cessation of use. This is used with the aim of replacing some of the advantages of cannabis use with other interventions. Exploration of connections between cannabis abuse and symptomology. Ambivalence and resistance is addressed from an accepting viewpoint. Preparation stage: Individual goal‐setting with focus on disadvantages of cannabis use. Exploration of the connection between cannabis use and symptomatology. Development of symptom‐coping skills and alternative coping strategies. This is facilitated through exploration of pros/cons, behavioural chain analysis and exploration of negative automatic thoughts and actions in relation to the cannabis abuse. Social skills training to enhance ability to refuse drugs, solve conflicts, and initiate contacts to non‐users. Introduction to the problem‐solving model (Mørch and Rosenberg, 2005). Action stage: Problem solving, where coping strategies are tested. Mapping of warning signs for relapse and triggers for cannabis use. Individual crisis plans in relation to relapse and worsening of symptoms. Maintenance stage: Development of new skills and habits in daily life. Support (in cooperation with the case manager) to maintain an active life with focus on activities of daily life (ADL), exercise and work/education/recreational activities. Widening of personal network with non‐cannabis users. Training of general coping skills such as social skills training, handling of unpleasant emotions, stress management, and relaxation techniques. Strategies for relapse prevention and coping strategies for craving are tested in daily life. Involvement of patient with former cannabis abuse as a consultant and role model. Relapse: De‐dramatizing and normalization with focus on learning from relapse. Support in order to re‐engage in the stages of change, with focus on the patient's own coping strategies. Programme adherence: To ensure programme adherence, the number of contacts with the patient, the patient's family, and the case manager are registered during the six‐month intervention period. Forms for registration of programme adherence are implemented in individual and group sessions. Registration forms are also used to ensure that the planned content in the group intervention is sufficiently implemented. These forms are anonymized and reviewed by the research assistant. The addiction consultants are supervised by an external supervisor with expertise in cannabis abuse, motivational interviewing, and cognitive behavioural therapy. 2. The control intervention: non‐specialized individual treatment: The non‐specialized treatment programme is carried out by staff in OPUS (a treatment for young people with psychosis in Copenhagen), in Assertive Community Treatment or in Community Mental Health Centres. Thus, the control intervention is identical to the treatment that is ordinarily offered to this patient‐group. The frequency of contact with the patients may vary. There is no standardized manual for this treatment. The treatment approach is supportive and not condemnatory. It is important to advise the patient about alternative coping strategies and to encourage every small reduction in abuse. RESEARCH PLAN: A research assistant is responsible for conducting interviews at the time of inclusion in the trial, at six months, and again ten months later. Thereby, the first follow‐up interview is held when the specialized CapOpus treatment is concluding. The second follow‐up interview is held four months after the specialized treatment has ended. The assessment instruments used as effect measures are all validated psychometric scales, which the research assistant is certified to use. Referred patients will be assessed by a research assistant to ensure that they meet the criteria for inclusion. Randomization and blinding: Randomization into one of the two treatment arms is performed after the baseline assessment. Firstly, randomization is stratified by severity of cannabis abuse as measured by TLFB, by creating two sub‐strata; one of patients having used cannabis less than 15 days in the preceding 30 day period, and one of patients having used cannabis 15 days or more. This is done to avoid the risk of heavy‐users of cannabis being overrepresented in either of the treatment groups. Similarly, randomization will be stratified based on the referrer ‐ OPUS, CMHC, or ACT, as it is unlikely that patients from these three referrers are comparable with regard to psychotic symptoms and level of functioning. The Copenhagen Trial Unit (CTU) will perform the centralized randomization, and only the CTU will know the block size used to randomize. A research assistant provides information on the patients to the CTU after conducting the baseline assessment. The CTU then performs the randomization procedure based on computer‐generated allocation sequences, and communicates the allocated treatment to the CapOpus consultants responsible for the CapOpus experimental intervention. If a patient is allocated to CapOpus intervention, the consultants contact the patient. Regardless of allocation, the consultants also contact the patient's case manager, so that the treatment as usual intervention can be commenced. This procedure ensures that the research assistant, who will be doing the subsequent patient assessments, is blinded to the allocated intervention. Blinding is maintained until the end of the trial. Patients are instructed not to reveal details that may cause the research assistant to deduce which treatment they are receiving. At each of the two follow‐up assessment points, the research assistant will register a guess as to which treatment the patient is receiving. When the trial is finished, inter‐rater reliability between the actual treatment and the research assistant's guess will be estimated using Cohen's kappa coefficient to assess whether blinding has been successful. Effect measurements: The following effect measurements are used at baseline, after six months and after ten months: 1. Severity of abuse. Assessment of number of days with cannabis abuse during the last month with Time Line Follow‐Back (Sobell and Sobell, 1992). This effect measurement is the best for measuring the effect the trial aims to influence; namely whether number of days with cannabis use can be reduced. Information supplied by patients on cannabis use will be validated with the results of blood analysis. Blood tests are taken at the six‐month and ten‐month follow‐up interviews. If the comparison of results of blood analysis and the patient's self‐report in Time Line Follow‐Back indicates that the patient's reports are reliable, Time Line Follow‐Back is used to measure effect. 2. Influence and severity of other substance use, including prescribed medication, and establishment of the severity of consequences of cannabis use, are assessed using sections 11 (use of alcohol) and 12 (use of psychoactive substances other than alcohol) of the SCAN interview (Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry).[Wing et al., 1990] 3. Psychosis symptoms are assessed by the use of The positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) for schizophrenia. [Kay et al., 1987] A psychiatrist, who is blinded to patients' allocations, rates samples of videotaped interviews to measure the reliability of the rating of these interviews 4. Cognitive function: Danish Adult Reading Test (DART) is used as an estimate of prepsychotic IQ. Speed of information processing is assessed with BACS' symbol coding and with Trailmaking A. Attention/vigilance is assessed by CBT test. Working memory is assessed with Trailmaking B. Memory and verbal learning is assessed with Hopkins Verbal Learning Test. Executive functioning is assessed with NAB Mazes. Social functioning (major life areas; community, social, and civic life) is assessed with WHODASII. 5. Quality of life is assessed with MANSA and EQ‐5D. 6. User satisfaction is assessed with Client Satisfaction Questionnaire [Larsen et al., 1979] 7. Expenses for the experimental intervention (CapOpus) and control intervention is measured by examining number of outpatient treatment and bed days in both treatment groups. Follow‐up is planned to be undertaken at six months, because patients in specialized CapOpus treatment have just finished the intervention at that time. Follow‐up at ten months is chosen, because this allows for a four‐month follow‐up period after the end of specialized treatment. Sample size and power calculation: Our power sample size calculation is based on a t‐test with five fewer days of cannabis use in one of the treatments, and with a standard deviation of five. This means that 22 patients should be allocated to each of the two treatments. In the OPUS‐study, those receiving standard treatment and who had a substance abuse at baseline had a drop‐out rate of 37% after one year. Generalizing this to the present study, and ignoring the likelihood of a smaller drop‐out in the intervention arm, we require at least 35 patients to be allocated to each intervention. However, we aim to include between 60 and 70 patients in each group in order to be able to measure differences in secondary outcomes. In the group intervention, the maximum inclusion is 32 patients annually (4x8); therefore, it is necessary for the project to continue for several years in order to recruit the necessary number of patients. The necessary number of patients can be ensured by launching the project as a cooperation between the three OPUS teams in Copenhagen, Assertive Community Treatment, Community Mental Health Centres, and treatment facilities for cannabis abusers in Copenhagen and Frederiksberg. Statistics: The main null‐hypothesis to be tested is that there is no difference between the two treatment arms with regard to decrease in cannabis use. All randomized patients will be analyzed, including those who stop receiving treatment, according to the intent‐to‐treat principle. Continuous outcome measures, including the primary outcome of reduction of days with cannabis abuse, will be analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) mixed models with repeated measurements. This will include interaction analyses of time and type of treatment, in order to evaluate the effect over time. Binary outcome measures will be analyzed using multivariate logistic regression models. The subgroup of patients who complete the entire experimental treatment will be compared with all those randomized into the trial. Sensitivity analyses will be carried out to evaluate the effect of treatment in patients that are inaccessible for follow‐up. This will be conducted by multiple imputation methodology. Publication: The results of the trial will be published in national and international journals. Authorship is determined in an agreement of cooperation for the entire project. The publications will be publicized according to Consort and Vancouver guidelines of publication of randomized trials. Ethical considerations: The participants are invited by letter to an assessment by the research assistant, who presents the trial to the patients, both orally and in writing. The research interviews can take place at Bispebjerg Hospital, in OPUS, in the patient's home, or wherever it may be possible. In the oral presentation, it is stated explicitly that participation is voluntary and not dangerous, and that the patient can withdraw informed consent at any time without any consequences for the treatment. Oral and written informed consent are obtained. The trial is registered with the ethics committee, the data surveillance agency and 'clinicaltrials.gov'.

AB  - Background: Interpersonal violence (IPV) among substance use disorder (SUD) patients is common, undertreated, and costly. SUD patients have high rates of perpetrating IPV, and IPV is a risk factor for poor response to SUD treatment. Failure to address IPV among SUD patients interferes with treatment effectiveness and contributes to relapse and higher rates of health services use. Nonetheless, SUD treatment programs typically do not include violence prevention interventions and few studies have examined interventions designed to prevent violence perpetration among SUD patients. Objectives: This trial evaluated the effectiveness of an IPV‐prevention (IPV‐P) intervention among patients entering VA SUD treatment who had perpetrated violence in the past year against another adult. Primary objectives were to test the hypotheses that, compared to patients assigned to a control condition (CC), those assigned to IPV‐P would (1) improve more on violence and SUD outcomes, and (2) use fewer VA mental health and medical care services, thereby saving costs for VA. Secondary objectives were to test the hypothesis that, compared to patients assigned to CC, those assigned to IPV‐P would improve more on legal and alienation problems and social resources. Methods: Patients entering VA SUD treatment who met eligibility criteria (past‐year violence; cognitively intact) and provided informed consent were assigned to SUD usual care plus either a CC (N=60) or IPV‐P (N=59) intervention using a recurrent institutional design. That is, the IPV‐P and CC conditions were run in alternate 3‐month periods. The manualized IPV‐P group intervention, based on a Cognitive‐Behavioral approach, consisted of 8 in‐person group sessions over 1 month, followed by telephone calls once a month for 3 months. The manualized CC was designed to control for non‐specific treatment effects associated with the IPV‐P condition, i.e., counselor time and attention, peer support, patients' expectations that additional sessions provide benefit. It consisted of 8 in‐person group sessions over 1 month that reviewed material covered in usual SUD treatment, but with novel methods used to deliver the IPV‐P intervention (role‐play, homework, group activities). CC included the booster telephone sessions (once per month for 3 months). Participants were assessed at baseline and end‐of‐intervention (4 months post‐baseline) and 6 and 12 months post‐intervention (i.e., 10 and 16 months post‐baseline) for primary and secondary outcomes and non‐VA healthcare. Assessments consisted of the Addiction Severity Index (ASI, to assess Alcohol, Drugs, Psychiatric, and Legal functioning), the Conflicts Tactics Scale (CTS, to assess Psychological Aggression and Physical Assault against another adult), the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire (MDQ, to assess Alienation, Stress Reaction, and Aggression), and the Life Stressors and Social Resources Inventory (LISRES, to assess family and friends resources). VA health care is being assessed with VA databases. Response rates at 4, 10, and 16 months were 90%, 79%, and 73%, respectively, and did not differ between the IPV‐P and CC groups. Follow‐up analyses compared the IPV‐P to the CC group on outcomes using analyses of covariance that controlled for the baseline value of the outcome. Status: We are still completing portions of this project: (1) conducting mixed effects regression analyses to compare the CC and IPV‐P groups on primary and secondary outcomes (these analyses are partially completed), and (2) using data on VA health care utilization to compare the two groups on VA health care costs (permission to download these data has been obtained, and we are working with HERC investigators to download and analyze the data).

AB  - The mental health needs of Veterans within the VA Healthcare system are notable. With the substantial increase over the past 10 years in Veterans seeking Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) treatment services, the VA system is straining to accommodate these needs, relying heavily on group‐based treatments. The proposed research will take the next step in the literature on group psychotherapy for PTSD by examining a group cognitive behavioral treatment (GCBT) program with promising pilot data. This application supports a randomized controlled trial, which will compare GCBT with Supportive Group Psychotherapy (SGP). The trial will involve 196 male Veterans with combat‐related PTSD who will be randomly assigned to GCBT (n= 98) or SGP (n =98) to determine efficacy within a naturalistic care environment. Outcome data will be collected pre‐treatment, mid‐treatment, post‐treatment, and 3‐, 6‐ and 12‐month follow‐up. Two aims are included, one focusing on outcome with respect to PTSD symptom severity, the second focusing on treatment generalization to comorbid emotional disorders (major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and alcohol abuse), and distress and impairment. Data will be examined using latent growth curve modeling, with emphasis on determining efficacy and effectiveness. The information provided by the proposed project could assist in developing more effective care models for individuals with chronic PTSD from numerous traumatic experiences. Additionally, this project represents an effort to move the literature on group‐based treatments for PTSD ahead, through inclusion of advanced methodological and analytic approaches.

AB  - Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating psychiatric disorder associated with high rates of chronicity, poor quality of life, and severe impairments in interpersonal, occupational, and social functioning. While evidence‐based psychotherapies for treatment of PTSD have been developed and disseminated within the VA system, no treatment has shown universal effectiveness and there have been great concerns about attenuated treatment response and elevated treatment drop out in veteran populations. The evaluation of alternative treatment modalities for veterans with PTSD is therefore an important priority. The Minneapolis VA Health Care System (MVAHCS) has taught Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), a group‐based intervention focused on mindfulness meditation, to veteran clinical populations since 2001, and pilot data from veterans diagnosed with PTSD is promising. Despite support for the application of MBSR to other mental health and physical problems, MBSR has not been systematically evaluated as a treatment for PTSD. Moreover, the existing literature on MBSR is limited by methodological weaknesses. If shown to be efficacious through scientifically sound trials, MSBR may offer an effective, acceptable, and tolerable intervention for veterans suffering PTSD who are unable to engage in or complete traditional exposure‐based therapies. The primary goal of this proposal is to conduct a methodologically rigorous randomized controlled trial (RCT) of MBSR in treating PTSD among veterans, examining both symptom outcomes and subsequent health services utilization. Given our compelling pilot data, we propose initial steps to evaluate putative mechanisms of change (self‐report and electrophysiology markers, i.e., EEG) through which MBSR may relate to PTSD symptom improvements, and to examine the acceptability of MBSR to the veteran population. The MVAHCS and the assembled team combines expertise in PTSD treatment and research, clinical trials, and neuroscience, with clinical expertise in MBSR and compelling pilot data to support the feasibility and scope of the current project. The efficacy of MBSR will be examined relative to present‐centered group therapy (PCGT), a non‐specific therapeutic comparison group. Veterans diagnosed with PTSD will be randomized to MBSR or PCGT for 9 weeks. Each intervention will be delivered in group format following manualization by trained clinicians receiving expert supervision. Treatment integrity will be independently monitored. Assessment of clinical outcomes post‐treatment and 2 months follow‐up will be independently evaluated. Putative mechanisms of mindfulness meditation will be assessed using self‐report and electrophysiology markers. We have the following aims: Primary Aim 1: To evaluate the efficacy of MBSR as a treatment for PTSD in veterans compared to PCGT over 9‐weeks of treatment and 2‐month follow‐up. Secondary Aim 1: To identify potential treatment‐based predictors of PTSD outcomes. Secondary Aim 2: To identify differences in subsequent VA health services utilization among veterans across treatment conditions. Exploratory Aims: 1. To evaluate rates of drop‐out, compliance, and consumer satisfaction with MBSR. 2. To evaluate acceptability and outcomes of treatment with veterans with mild traumatic brain injuries.

Participants: Patients (n=278), aged 18‐65 years, with common mental problems or disorders were referred to the study by the GPs and 245 were included in the study. Interventions: Participants were randomised to CAU or one of two group interventions in addition to CAU. These were: a) group cognitive behavioural based therapy (CBT) administered by psychologists once a week for 12 weeks, and b) group multimodal intervention (MMI) based on a protocol comprising a mix of existing group interventions and exercises borrowed from multiple techniques and therapeutic schools and administered by assistant nurses with brief training, including two sessions per week for 6 weeks. Main outcome measures: Primary outcome measure was the Mental Component Summary score of SF‐36. Secondary outcome measures were perceived stress scale (PSS) and Self‐Rating Scale for Affective Syndromes (CPRS‐S‐A)

AB  - Background, current evidence and key references Psychotic disorders including schizophrenia are severe mental illnesses that affect 3% of the population and constitute an enormous burden to patients and the society. They cause profound disruptions in patients' functioning including independent living skills, relationships, scholastic and vocational development, and are ranked by World Health Organization as the third most disabling medical condition. In an attempt to minimize long‐term disability, numerous early intervention (EI) programs for psychosis have been established worldwide in the past decade. It is based on the premise that shortening of treatment delay and provision of phase‐specific treatments in the initial few years of psychosis can improve illness outcome. Literature indicated that patients who received EI had better clinical and functional outcomes than those treated by standard psychiatric care. Nonetheless, accumulating evidence has suggested that a significant proportion of early psychosis patients exhibited functional deterioration even in the presence of clinical remission. Studies have also consistently shown that patients with psychosis frequently experience motivational deficits and diminished goal‐directed behaviours which are key negative symptoms predictive of functional outcome. Functional disability thus represents an unmet therapeutic need in EI for psychosis. In this regard, there is a shift of therapeutic focus from symptom control to functional enhancement. It is also increasingly recognized that patients' perspectives should be taken into consideration in conceptualizing functional recovery and developing recovery‐oriented service to further improve functional outcome . Owing to lack of effective treatments in addressing functional impairment, recently, there is an emerging interest in adopting life coaching to complement other interventions by its specific focus on motivation and functioning. Life coaching is defined as a collaborative, solution‐focused, outcome‐oriented and systematic process which aims to facilitate enhancement of life experience and goal attainment of an individual in various life domains . It is based on the theoretical framework of positive psychology and behavioural change model, and targets at building up an individual's potential via fostering hope, motivation, self‐efficacy and self‐regulation. The principles of life coaching thus closely align with recovery orientation that emphasizes on self‐initiation and empowerment via person‐centred and strength‐based approach. In fact, empirical evidence suggested that hopelessness and low self‐efficacy were associated with poor functioning in early psychosis. Conversely, increased motivation was shown to enhance both functional and cognitive outcomes in schizophrenia . Additionally, studies evaluating coaching in non‐clinical population found that it significantly improved subjects' motivation and psychological wellbeing. Despite the growing recognition and adoption of life coaching approach in mental health services, it has rarely been applied in the early course of psychotic disorder. Jockey Club Early Psychosis (JCEP) project is a territory‐wide specialized EI service that is launched in August 2009 and provides 3‐year phase‐specific intervention for adult patients presenting with first‐episode psychosis (FEP) to psychiatric units of Hospital Authority (HA). To promote early functional recovery, JCEP project develops recovery‐oriented intervention based on life coaching approach (recovery‐oriented coaching) in addition to case management. This is a structured, group‐based coaching program incorporating cognitive‐behavioural and solution‐focused therapeutic components. The program facilitates patients to undergo active change process via identification of achievable goals, formulation of action plans, provision of feedback and progress monitoring for goal attainment. Unlike the majority of therapies that focus mainly on symptoms and functional deficiencies, this program is strength‐oriented and aims to facilitate patients to gain a sense of agency and to achieve sustained functional improvement via firstly, enhancing motivation, self‐regulation and competence by positive reinforcement obtained from successive accomplishments of self‐determined goals; secondly, providing an autonomy‐supportive treatment environment with a context of recovery expectations; and thirdly, facilitating formation of supportive social network in group‐based setting. We have previously examined perceptions of early psychosis patients on recovery, with achievement of adequate functioning being regarded as a key element signifying recovery. Our earlier study on FEP patients with EI revealed that less than one‐fifth achieved recovery and only 43% of remitted patients were in functional remission at the end of 3‐year follow‐up. Thus, in line with the literature, our findings indicated an urgent need for developing effective interventions to optimize patients' functional outcome in the early illness stage which is otherwise regarded as a critical window of opportunity for minimizing long‐term disability. In this context, recovery‐oriented coaching program which specifically addresses motivational and functional impairments may prove to be an effective psychosocial intervention for promoting functional recovery, and thereby worthy of systematic evaluation in patients with early psychosis.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objectives are to 1) evaluate the effectiveness of exposure, cognitive, and skills (assertiveness/relaxation) therapies within a 16‐session group; and 2) evaluate the relative contribution of each of three treatment components in a manualized treatment group in a sample of OIF/OEF female PTSD veterans. HYPOTHESES: Hypothesis 1. Female OIF/OEF PTSD veterans will show reductions in PTSD symptoms and improvement in general functioning after participation in a structured group treatment compared to a wait‐list control group. Hypothesis 2. Exposure and cognitive components will show greater improvement in PTSD symptoms than the skills component. RESEARCH DESIGN/BACKGROUND: Based on studies with male combat veterans, female civilian rape victims, and female veterans, therapies most effective for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) are exposure therapy (1,2,3) and cognitive restructuring (4), with less improvement found in other treatments, such as relaxation and assertiveness training (5). Most examinations of PTSD treatments have been conducted in an individual format, but most PTSD treatments offered in Veterans Administration (VA) hospital PTSD programs are conducted in a group format (6). It is critical to determine if these therapies work in a group setting, as only one study (7) found no differences in exposure therapy compared to a support group. In a comprehensive manualized group treatment protocol (8) exposure therapy provided in a group was found effective (9). The aim of the present study is to establish the effectiveness of exposure therapy, among other evidence‐based therapies, in a well designed randomized study. METHODOLOGY: Castillo's (8) manualized group treatment protocol for female veterans with PTSD will be modified into a 16‐week treatment group with a five‐week exposure, five‐week cognitive, and four‐week skills treatment blocks. Seventy‐two subjects will be assessed with structured interviews (SCID and CAPS) and questionnaires (Traumatic Life Events and Quality of Life Inventory) and randomized into one of two arms: 16‐week immediate treatment, or a 16‐week wait‐list control, the latter of which will be reassessed and offered the study treatment. Oversampling will result in 72 subjects in the active treatment arm. Subjects will be reassessed upon completion of treatment or wait‐list, at 3, and 6 months following treatment. All treatment groups will include three female OIF/OEF veterans positive for PTSD. The treatment blocks will be varied into six possible orders to control for order effects and the PTSD Symptom Checklist will be administered after each treatment block. Data will be collected for three years. CLINICAL RELATIONSHIPS: Significant results will contribute to the establishment of evidence‐based treatments in a manualized treatment group for all veterans with a PTSD diagnosis. FINDINGS: Present findings from Dr. Castillo's lab suggest the effectiveness of exposure therapy in a group setting.

AB  - BACKGROUND Classification and comorbidity Hypochondriasis is broadly defined in the international classification systems for mental disorders ICD‐10 (WHO) and DSM‐IV (APA) under somatoform disorders as a preoccupation with fears and the belief of having a serious disease with the condition lasting for at least 6 months. It is non‐delusional, and the symptoms are not better explained by another mental disorder, it causes distress or impairment of functioning and persists despite appropriate medical reassurance. Somatoform disorders are defined as syndromes with physical symptoms, which are not sufficiently explained by physical causes alone, defined somatic illnesses or comorbid mental disorders. A less stigmatizing name: health anxiety has been suggested, and new research has reported more valid diagnostic criteria with continuous ruminations of fears and belief of having a serious disease lasting for at least 2 weeks and the presence of minimum one of five other symptoms: preoccupation with illness or body, preoccupation with medical information, suggestibility or autosuggestibility, fear of infection or contamination and fear of medication. A degree for severity has also been introduced here with either mild or severe health anxiety split by the presence of minimum one severely distressing symptom or a significant impairment of functioning [1]. Hypochondriasis and Health Anxiety (HA) are from now on used synonymously here. HA like other somatoform disorders show high degree of mental comorbidity with depressive disorders between 15,3‐45,2%, anxiety disorders between 22‐52,4%, somatoform disorder between 8‐21,4% and mental comorbidity in total between 54‐78,6% [11,34,46]. HA also show a high degree of mental comorbidity with personality disorders (PD) between 63‐76% [34,35] when using questionnaire for assessment, but they seem to overestimate the prevalence [36] and between 40‐74% when using SCID‐II, the semi‐structured interview developed for DSM, that is the present golden standard for diagnosing PD [39,40]. A high degree of mental comorbidity has risen questions of classification, if HA is a primary mental disorder and therefore its own disease entity, or the symptoms are only secondary to another mental disorder like a melancholic depression, or if HA is better classified as a personality disorder [37] or an anxiety disorder [38]. In DSM‐V and ICD‐11 the disorder entity is suggested preserved and kept categorized under somatoform disorders, but the name is suggested changed to illness anxiety disorder in DSM‐V and health anxiety in ICD‐11. Epidemiology Studies have reported a prevalence for HA in communities between 0,2‐4,5% [2,28] and in primary care between 0,8‐7.0% [3‐7], and using the new and more valid criteria on 9,5% (12.1% incl. mild degree) [1] and in secondary care on 10‐20% [8‐9]. Severe HA has an early onset with mean age of onset = 25 years [1], an equal sex distribution, it is fluctuating but persistent with a median duration before treatment on 2‐ 20 years [10,11,31,45], and it is distressing and disabling and therefore also costly for our health and social care system [12,13]. Personality characteristics Only 2 former studies have assessed patients with HA using SCID‐II. One had a small sample size of 21 psychiatric outpatients, and 74% of these patients were found to have comorbid PD compared to 52% for other psychiatric outpatients in Greece. Here the most prevalent PD for HA were histrionic and obsessive‐compulsive personality disorders [39]. The other study included 42 patients with HA and no comorbid OCD or Social Phobia recruited from a community in USA. This study found, that 40% with HA had comorbid PD, and the most prominent types were paranoid, obsessive‐compulsive and avoidant PD. Here the group of HA were compared to groups of patients with OCD and Social Phobia, and they found no significant difference between the prevalence of PD with HA compared to the prevalence of PD with either of these 2 anxiety disorders [40]. Few studies of personality dimensions for HA have been made. One study used the questionnaire Personality Assessment Schedule (PAS) and found for hypochondriacal PD a high degree of the personality traits: hypochondriasis, anxiousness, consciousness and dependence [37]. Other personality traits for HA that have been reported are high degree of neuroticism, narcissism and avoidance and histrionic and borderline traits [37,43,44]. Treatment Patients suffering from HA are not often diagnosed and treated well by doctors [5]. It causes frustration for both doctors and patients. Doctors feel powerless towards the patients continuing suffering and complaints, patients feel they are not taken seriously by the doctor and do not get sufficient help, and the extensive somatic focus and medical examinations contribute to the chronic development of the disorder [48,49,59]. On Zealand with app. 2.5 million inhabitants only about 40 patients with HA were referred from medical doctors to specialized treatment in the existing 2 clinics of Liaison Psychiatry in 2011. Earlier on HA was considered untreatable, but psychotherapy with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for HA has been developed over the past 2 decades and has shown effective. There is also evidence from 2 studies reporting moderate treatment effectiveness of SSRI medication for HA [22,23], but prior to treatment patients with HA favour psychological treatment over pharmacological treatment, although pharmacological treatment is equally tolerated [22‐24]. A meta‐analysis from 2007 includes 6 randomized controlled trials (RCT) and finds evidence for effectiveness of treatment of HA with short term individual CBT. The effective factors of the CBT on health anxiety symptoms as primary outcome measure were found to be cognitive restructuring (cognitive therapy), response‐prevention, exposure, and behavioural stress management, and with resource use as secondary outcome measure also psychoeducation [14]. CBT for personality disorders has so far only shown effective in long term treatment [65]. Group CBT might have some advantages over individual CBT in cost‐effectiveness, because of less therapist time spend per patient, individual CBT is more vulnerable to session cancellation from the patient and possible effective group dynamics. No studies so far have compared effectiveness of group CBT to individual CBT for HA, and generally cost‐effectiveness and group dynamics have little empirical evidence and need more research [16‐21]. 5 studies on effectiveness of group CBT for HA have formerly been made. They showed treatment effective and acceptable [25,26,29,30], and one study also showed cost‐effective for society in saved health care [27]. But the sample sizes of 3 of the studies were small, and their design were not controlled, and for the two RCT studies one began therapy with 8 individual sessions of CBT [30], and the intervention of the second study was mostly psychoeducational [29]. Prior to treatment patients generally prefer individual CBT over group CBT, but attrition and satisfaction with both treatments have shown equal at the end of treatment with dropout rates between 10‐47% [20,21,47]. Predictors of outcome Only a few studies so far have examined predictors of outcome of CBT for HA and often with conflicting results. 2 studies found no predictive value for sociodemographic variables [33,62], but one study found a positive predictive value for marital status [32] and one a negative predictive value for high age [66]. 3 studies have found a negative predictive value for a higher degree of health anxiety before treatment [32,33,66], but the results for pretreatment anxiety, general psychopathology and chronicity are inconsistent [32,33,62,66]. One study also found negative predictive value for more dysfunctional cognitions related to bodily functioning, disability at work and utilization of health care before treatment but no predictive value for comorbid anxiety or depressive disorders [33]. The influence of comorbid PD in HA for treatment outcome has to our knowledge only been investigated in one former study. The design included no control group, and the included 36 patients had been non‐respondant to previously given pharmachological treatment, and afterwards they were treated with different duration of individual insight psychotherapy and anti‐anxious medication. Here comorbid PD had a negative predictive value for outcome [62]. Studies of patients with depressive and anxiety disorders and comorbid PD have generally found worse treatment outcome for both pharmacological and psychological treatments [41,42,60]. RATIONALE No RCT on outcome and effectiveness of classical group CBT for severe health anxiety and hypochondriasis has yet been conducted. Group CBT compared to individual CBT (and usual care) for patients with health anxiety might have some therapeutic advantages due to manualised and structured treatment, favourable group dynamics, improving social skills and creating a support group, group‐CBT might be less costly and therefore have better cost‐effectiveness, but attrition might be worse, so it needs further investigation. Initial assessment prior to CBT should also include categorical and dimensional assessment of personality because of possible relevance for prognosis, treatment preference and possibilities, creation of homogenous groups for group therapy improving acceptability and outcome, and individual designed CBT as an element of group CBT. But better general knowledge of personality vulnerability for patients with HA here by using best diagnostics and a larger sample size than before and new and better assessment questionnaires for personality dimensions and traits is also relevant for designing more effective treatment and protocols for individual and group CBT in the future. As more general practitioners become educated in CBT and programs of Shared Care are introduced, in time this treatment for HA might also be possible to integrate in primary care more close to the patients. AIMS In a randomised controlled trial to examine the treatment outcome of specialized classical cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) delivered in a group setting for patients with severe health anxiety (HA) including the evidence based effective factors of individual CBT for HA [14]. More specifically: 1. To examine if patients with severe HA have reduced level of health anxiety or even are cured 6 months after treatment with group CBT compared to a wait‐list group receiving usual care. 2. To examine if patients with severe HA experience a better mental and physical health and improved social function 6 months after treatment with group CBT compared to a wait‐list group receiving usual care. 3. To examine if patients with severe HA show a reduction in health care use and sick days 6 months after treatment with group CBT compared to a wait‐list group receiving usual care. 4. To do a categorical and dimensional assessment of personality of patients with severe HA referred from doctors using a larger sample size than before with best diagnostics and a new instrument for dimensional and trait assessment (PID‐5) to yield new general knowledge of personality vulnerability for patients with severe HA. 5. To examine predictors of outcome for group CBT for patients with severe HA especially personality disorders. 6. To examine cost‐effectiveness of group CBT compared to a wait‐list group receiving usual care and a standard duration of individual CBT for patients with severe HA. 7. To examine how the illness perception of patients with severe health anxiety change after treatment with group CBT compared to a wait‐list group receiving usual care. 8. To examine how the illness perception is related to the personality of patients with severe HA and the outcome of group CBT compared to a wait‐list group receiving usual care. 9. To examine the course for patients with severe health anxiety after this short term group‐CBT and afterwards long term psychotherapeutic treatment for comorbid personality disorders at 2 years follow‐up. Hypotheses Main hypothesis: Patients with severe HA who have received group CBT will at 6‐month follow‐up compared to a wait‐list group receiving usual care show a significantly reduction in health anxiety. Additional hypothesis: Patients with severe HA who have received group CBT will at 6‐month follow‐up compared to a wait‐list group receiving usual care have significantly: a) better mental and physical health and improved global and social functioning, b) lower use of health care services and c) less sick days. 30‐60% of patients with severe HA have a comorbid personality disorder. Both patients with severe HA with or without comorbid PD show reduction in health anxiety from short term group CBT, but patients with comorbid personality disorder show a significantly lower cure‐rate, than patients without comorbid personality disorder. Patients with severe health anxiety and comorbid PD (or other comorbid mental disorders) afterwards therefore need long term psychotherapeutic treatment to be cured. This hypotheses will be examined at 24 month follow‐up, where a part of the patients after group CBT also have received long term psychotherapy for their PD. Group CBT is significantly more cost‐effective than a wait‐list group receiving usual care and a standard duration of individual CBT for patients with severe HA. Group CBT is a feasible and acceptable treatment for the patients (high satisfaction and low drop‐out). Patients with severe HA who have received group CBT will at 6‐month follow‐up compared to a wait‐list group receiving usual care show a significantly more sound illness perception. Patients with severe HA and a comorbid personality disorder have before group CBT a less sound illness perception than patients without comorbid personality disorder. METHODS 84 patients with severe health anxiety consecutively referred from family physicians, medical specialists or hospital wards on Zealand to The Clinic of Liaison Psychiatry in Koege, Region Zealand. The project is communicated through relevant homepages, regionsjaelland.dk and sundhed.dk, and through arranged visits with medical doctors. The patients are block randomized per 14 patients into 2 groups: group CBT or a wait‐list receiving usual care and after 9 month offered group CBT. Expected drop‐out rate on 20% in group CBT and on wait‐list. DATA AND PROCEDURES Diagnostic assessment The patients referred are initially screened for inclusion by a telephone interview of a specialist in psychiatry (MS). The telephone interview consist of direct questions for the inclusion and exclusion criteria, WI‐7, the diagnostic criteria for severe health anxiety and seeking verbal consent to send the first online questionnaire. Each patient fulfilling the inclusion is assessed by use of the SCAN interview (Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry), which is a thorough semi‐structured diagnostic interview recommended by the WHO and is applied in the diagnostics of general mental disorders as defined by ICD‐10 and DSM‐IV criteria [50], and by use of the SCID II [51], which is a semi‐structured diagnostic interview for personality disorders developed for DSM‐IV. Just before the semi‐structured interviews are performed a non‐structured clinical interview and assessment is performed and ended by psychoeducation and the joint creation of the individual illness model for cognitive behaviour therapy. Global assessment of functioning (GAF‐F) and diagnostic assessment using DSM‐V, ICD‐10 and the criteria for severe health anxiety will also be performed in this initial clinical assessment. The clinical and diagnostic interviews are performed by a specialist in psychiatry (MS), certified at the SCAN training centre in Copenhagen and trained in SCID��II assessment before project start. If needed a second opinion on the patients from another medical doctor at the clinic in Koege is possible (JS). For inter‐rater‐reliability assessment 5% of the patients are similarly clinically assessed by a blinded second rater and specialist in psychiatry. After the patients have answered the 5. online questionnaire (6 month after end of treatment), they are diagnostically assessed for severe health anxiety with direct questions for the diagnostic criteria for severe health anxiety in a telephone interview performed by a blinded second rater and specialist in psychiatry. Right after this telephone interview MS will see the patients in the clinic as a conclusion of the treatment and a possibility for the patient to be referred to further psychotherapeutic treatment, if it is indicated by a comorbid mental disorder and wanted by the patient. Course The patients will be followed by means of various self‐reporting health measures reported online (Survey Xact); before clinical assessment (after telephone interview including verbal consent) (SCAN and SCID‐II), 14 days before group start (baseline), at the end of treatment, and 3, 6 and 24 months after end of treatment (see attached Flowchart Figure 1). Dimensions and traits of personality are assessed at baseline by the questionnaire Personality Inventory for DSM‐V (PID‐5) [52] developed for DSM‐V, where it is being included in the Appendix. 6 months after end of treatment the patients are clinical assessed for severe HA by a telephone interview from a blinded second rater (Cure is defined here as either no diagnosis of severe HA or a WI‐7 score<21,4 6 months after end of treatment). Use of health care services and sick days from a period of 9 months preceding treatment and 6 months after end of treatment are drawn from relevant registers. The 6. online questionnaire will be send to all patients at 2 years follow‐up. Most patients have here received the short term group‐CBT. Some of the patients have afterwards also received long term psychotherapeutic treatment for their comorbid personality disorder. The patients in the control groups will be offered the group CBT immediately after answering the 6 month follow‐up questionnaire of the RCT (no. 5), which then also functions as their baseline questionnaire. The patients in the control groups are then also given this questionnaire no. 5 again 9 month after (Their 6 month follow‐up from the group CBT). The patients in the control group are then given one more questionnaire than the RCT treatment group then a total of 7 questionnaires for the 24 month follow‐up prospective cohort study. Randomisation After the patients have given written informed consent, they are put on a wait‐list for block randomization until there is a total of 14 patients. When 14 patients have answered the 2. online questionnaire, they are randomized to 2 groups; group therapy (n=7), starting shortly after randomization, or wait‐list (n=7) with an offer to start group therapy after 9 months. Patients are randomized by means of a computer algorithm that use predefined concealed random numbers. Treatment Group CBT The patients are treated in groups of 7 by 2 therapists, that are either medical doctors, psychologists, psychomotoric or nurses trained in cognitive behaviour therapy and experienced in treating patients with HA with CBT. 2 teams of therapists (4 therapists) deliver the treatment, and MS only take part as a therapist if necessary. The therapists are during the project supervised regularly from an external psychologist. The group therapy includes 12 weekly meetings of 3 hours excl. a 15 minutes break and a booster‐meeting of 3 hours delivered 3 month after end of treatment. The treatment follows a written manual for each meeting, which is given to the patients at the first meeting. The treatment and manual generally consists of the CBT elements of goal setting, psychoeducation, symptom registration, relaxation training, stress management, cognitive restructuring including individual designed behavioural experiments, response prevention, exposure, relapse prevention and homework. For assessment of therapist competencies and adherence to the manual all group‐CBT is video‐recorded, and app. 5% of the essential material is assessed by a blinded rater. The therapist satisfaction with the group‐CBT is rated with a questionnaire. Usual care group After the diagnostic assessment and after randomization, patients, referring doctors, and family physicians are informed in writing about the diagnosis, in the same way as for the patients randomized for group CBT. But here the patient has been put in the group for usual care with the offer to receive group CBT after 9 months. This group CBT will not be part of the primary research project (RCT), but it still takes place at The Liaison Psychiatric Clinic in Koege. Patients in the usual care group receive a letter stating that they have been randomized to 9‐month with usual care, and in this period they continue usual care by their other health care providers. The patients in the usual care group are followed‐up by questionnaires in the same way as the patients randomized to group CBT (see attached flowchart Figure 1). For details regarding timing and characteristics of treatment elements delivered in the group CBT see attached Figure 3. Drop‐outs The patients that drop‐out (after inclusion) are followed‐up by questionnaires in the same way as the patients randomized to either group CBT or wait‐list. This is done for intention to treat analysis. Also these patients are telephoned to examine reasons for drop‐out. Attending in less than 8 of the total 13 treatment meetings is also defined as drop‐out.

Expectations and satisfaction with the treatment along the full course of the treatment in the clinic Definition of sufficient treatment: Sufficient treatment demands attendance to group‐CBT meetings in at least 8 meetings out of 13 meetings in total. If less attendance occurs, the patient is defined as drop‐out. Perspectives Health anxiety is costly for the social and health care system and cause suffering and disability for the patients. This study will hopefully form the basis of an effective and evidence‐based group therapy for patients with impairing health anxiety and thereby help increase the patients' quality of life and functional level and reduce social and health care costs. As more general practitioners are trained in cognitive behaviour therapy and Shared Care is introduced into primary care, elements of this developed group‐CBT can be used for prevention and treatment of patients with lesser degree of HA in primary care. Time frame Recruitment of patients for the pilot‐study will begin primo 2013. The 2 pilot‐groups will be conducted in 2013. Patient inclusion to the RCT will begin primo 2014 and end in 2015 depending on referrals. The rate of referrals is expected to be 4 patients a month. Treatment groups are expected to run during a course of approx. 2 years. In the same period the PhD student will participate in teaching, training and courses. In 2016 the last patients will be followed up, and data will be analyzed and interpreted, and papers to relevant journals will be written. Please see the enclosed time schedule for the three‐year PhD program (Figure 4). The 2 years follow‐up assessment (prospective cohort study) will not be a part of the PhD study, but MS is responsible for this study also. The responsibility of the RCT study of cost‐effectiveness and illness perception lies with other researchers mentioned as collaborators and named specifically under the relevant planned articles. DATA ANALYSIS The results will be analysed and published according to the Consort statement [58]. The power calculation is based on change in Whiteley‐7 scores (scale 0‐100). An uncertainty of the change in Whiteley‐7 scores of 25 is estimated from a pilot study and other randomised controlled trials [11,15,61]. A sample size of 70 was estimated to provide 84.9% power, at the 5% significance level, to find a difference in mean reductions in Whiteley‐7 scores from baseline to 6 month follow‐up of the size 20 and allowing for a drop‐out rate of 20% in both groups. Relevant statistical methods for group comparison will be applied, including multiple regression. In the data analysis, both "intention‐to‐treat" analyses and analyses of the clinic's existing data will be performed. There will be applied multiple imputations of missing outcomes. A statistician is involved in the study. The study will also be registered in an international database for clinical trials (www.clinicaltrials.gov)) SUPERVISORS ‐ Professor Erik Simonsen, MD, PhD, principal supervisor Director of Psychiatric Research Unit, Region Zealand, Denmark Institute of Psychology and Lifelong Learning, Roskilde University Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen ‐ Professor Per Fink, DMSc , project supervisor Director of The Research Clinic for Functional Disorders in Aarhus, Denmark ‐ Professor Brian Fallon, MD, Columbia University, NY, USA COLLABORATORS ‐ Flemming Rasmussen, psychologist (research backup) Clinic of Liaison Psychiatry, Psychiatry Region Zealand, Denmark ‐ Eva Ørnbøl, statistician The Research Clinic for Functional Disorders in Aarhus, Denmark ‐ Lene Halling, cand. oecon, PhD The Psychiatric Research Unit, Region Zealand, Denmark ‐ Lisbeth Frostholm, psychologist, PhD The Research Clinic for Functional Disorders in Aarhus, Denmark ‐ Ulf Soegaard, MD, Medical Head of Department of Special Functions, Psychiatry Region Zealand, Denmark ‐ Jan Stenberg, MD, Medical Head of Clinic of Liaison Psychiatry, Psychiatry Region Zealand, Denmark ‐ Pia Callesen, psychologist, PhD student (group‐CBT supervision) Director of Cektos on Zealand, Denmark ‐ Annette Davidsen, MD, PhD The Research Unit for General Practitioners, Institute of Public Healthcare Sciences, Faculty of Health, University of Copenhagen, Denmark

AB  - Attention will be paid to Theory of Triadic Influence intrapersonal, social/ situational, and cultural/ environmental risk and protective factors that impact outcomes. The central hypothesis is that compared to enhanced treatment as usual, through targeting Theory of Triadic Influence‐risk and protective factors the culturally‐informed, Theory of Triadic Influence‐driven, empowerment based psychosocial group intervention will more positively alter trajectories in suicidal behaviors and its correlates. The rationale is that upon study completion, if data support the psychosocial group intervention value, they will facilitate our long‐term goal of disseminating evidence‐based culturally‐relevant interventions. In order to test the hypothesis that at post‐intervention and 6 and 12‐month follow‐up, compared to individuals in ETAU, those in the PGI will endorse less I, SS, and CE risk factors, reduced suicidal ideation, depressive symptoms, and hopelessness, and greater levels of I, SS, and CE protective factors as well as increased quality of life, the study procedures will be as follows: Male and female participants between the ages of 18‐64 will be recruited in the medical and psychiatric emergency rooms at GHS. Once the individual has been medically cleared and has provided informed consent, he/she will be screened for study appropriateness by trained project team members (10‐20 minutes). If he/she meets inclusion criteria, study participation will include a 3‐hour interview. All study measures will be read to each participant. Measures will assess background variables, suicidal behavior, depressive symptoms, hopelessness, quality of life, and I, SS, and CE risk and protective factors. All measures are psychometrically sound and appropriate for use with an African American population. Once the interview is over, the participant will be randomly assigned to either the PGI (10 group therapy sessions) or the ETAU condition (participation in a support group focused on suicidal behaviors plus suicidal behavior monitoring and help with accessing resources). The PGI, conducted in accord with the culturally informed, TTI‐guided, and empowerment based group protocol, and the support group will be unstructured; both groups will last 120 minutes. Following the completion of the PGI or ETAU condition, the individuals will be assessed at post‐intervention (3 hours), and at 6 month and 12 month follow‐ups (3 hours each). To increase retention and reduce suicide risk, reminder phone calls will be made and texts sent on Relieflink, a suicide prevention app that received 1st prize in an App Challenge sponsored by Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.

AB  - Preamble Social anxiety is highly prevalent in people with schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders, and represents a major obstacle to a positive functional outcome. The investigators have recently developed a psychosocial intervention for social anxiety that is specifically tailored to people with psychosis. An adapted Cognitive‐Behavioural Therapy (CBT) intervention for psychosis must target the stigma attached to the illness, the possible presence of poor social skills, delusional and persecutory ideas, potential limited reading abilities, and associated cognitive deficits that are the hallmark of schizophrenia and related psychoses. Our preliminary data from an uncontrolled evaluation of our new intervention in first episode psychosis revealed a significant positive impact of this 13‐week group intervention for manifestations of social anxiety. Following these promising results, the investigators now propose to conduct a multi‐center randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of this intervention relative to an active control condition consisting of a cognitive remediation group. Their primary goal is to show the efficacy of this intervention on symptoms of social anxiety as determined by self‐report measures and clinician‐rated measures. Their secondary goal is to examine the impact of such an intervention on clinical and functional outcomes. The highly impairing nature of social anxiety in psychosis is well established and the proposed trial will ultimately show that treating this aspect of the condition is possible and will result in improved functioning. From 2010 to 2012, the investigators have offered their CBT intervention for social anxiety to several groups of patients at the Douglas Institute and now, more recently, at the McGill University Health Centre (MUHC). The investigators have employed an uncontrolled design recommended to evaluate the feasibility and potential benefits of a pilot psychosocial intervention. In their feasibility study, they offered this intervention to five groups of clients who were part of the Prevention and Early Intervention Program for Psychosis (PEPP‐Montreal) and to two groups of clients with longer standing illness, from the Psychosis Program at the Douglas Institute and from the MUHC, respectively. All participants were referred by their treating team (e.g. psychiatrist, nurse, case manager, etc.) and were screened by our research team to evaluate the presence of significant social anxiety. They assessed the effects of this intervention using four scales: Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS), the Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN) and the Brief Social Phobia Scale (BSPS), Structured Clinical Diagnosis (SCID‐I) for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM‐IV). Focusing on their work in FEP at our program PEPP‐Montreal, 25 out of 29 participants who were recruited for the feasibility study met diagnostic criteria for social phobia, whereas 4 represented 'borderline' cases that were clearly reporting significant difficulties with social interactions and active avoidance of social situations. From the 29 clients who started the group intervention, 3 did not complete it (completion defined as attending more than 50% of the sessions). The overall attendance rate of completers of the weekly 13‐week program was excellent, with an average of 11 sessions attended per participant (ranging from 9‐13), confirming that the intervention was well tolerated by the participants. For the 26 patients who completed the intervention, a significant reduction in social anxiety was observed on all three measures (SPIN, SIAS, BSPS) at the end of the 13‐week treatment. We observed effect sizes of 1.04 on the SIAS, 0.93 on the SPIN, and 0.95 on the BSPS, after correcting for within‐subject dependence among means for the total sample of participants who completed the intervention. These effect sizes are quite large and represent a strong justification to pursue a larger‐scale investigation of this novel intervention. Critically, from the 24 participants with a SCID‐I based diagnosis of social phobia prior to the treatment, only two still met diagnostic criteria at the end of the study. Moreover, the investigators administered the Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness (ISMI) scale and observed a significant reduction in stigma following this intervention (p<.01), suggesting that our intervention does indeed target stigma in an efficient way. Having established the potential benefits of our new psychosocial intervention for social anxiety, the investigators devised a control condition to reproduce some of the aspects of our group intervention without the active ingredients of group CBT. An active control condition that could control for spontaneous changes in symptoms of social anxiety, the effect of being in a trial, and therapeutic commitment was chosen. In the selection of an active control condition, it is essential that this intervention does not target social anxiety while still controlling for the non‐specific effects described above. As discussed by Everitt, a control intervention that does not target the symptoms of interest should potentially lead to a greater effect size between the experimental treatment and the control condition, and as such requires a smaller sample. Several researchers have attested to the appropriateness of cognitive remediation therapy (CRT) as a control condition for CBT intervention: two recent large multi‐center trials involving a group CBT intervention to improve patients' insight into their illness or to improve negative symptoms have used CRT as their active control condition. CRT targetting cognitive performance can be offered in a group format and thus represents a very promising control condition for the proposed study. Several computer‐assisted cognitive remediation therapies (CACRT) have been developed in the last few years. Many of these programs developed specifically for psychiatric patients follow a structured protocol and are given in small groups under supervision of a trained therapist. The goals of these programs are to improve performance on cognitive domains that have been determined to hinder functioning. The intervention aims to provide a positive experience for patients through the promotion of positive attitudes towards learning, and patients are encouraged to develop independent learning skills as well as a sense of competence and confidence. The intervention is also designed to increase awareness of the strengths and weaknesses of the patients' own learning styles. This particular method is advantageous because its goals match other psychiatric rehabilitation models and because it has theoretical bases in neuropsychology, learning, educational psychology, rehabilitation psychology, self‐determination, and client‐centered therapy. Furthermore, CRT has been shown to be effective at improving patients' cognitive abilities but has less impact on social functioning. Since fall 2011, the investigators have developed a group CRT program in collaboration with the Psychosis Program of the Douglas Institute and have presented their results at a recent scientific conference. The investigators propose to use Dr. Christopher Bowie's protocol in the current study. This psychosocial intervention represents an excellent control condition for their randomized controlled trial: it is conducted in a group format comparable to their proposed group CBT intervention, which controls for potential non‐specific effects of simply participating in a group activity. Additionally, although this is a group activity, social interactions are limited as each participant spends most of the time working individually on a computer. Proposed study General aim: The goal of this research proposal is to evaluate the efficacy of a group CBT intervention (experimental condition) for social anxiety in first‐episode psychosis in comparison to group‐based cognitive remediation (control condition) on reducing symptoms of social anxiety. Primary objective: To compare the efficacy of a 13‐week group CBT intervention adapted for people with psychosis for reducing symptoms of social anxiety to an active control condition comprised of a 13‐week group cognitive remediation therapy. Primary hypothesis: Compared to the active control group, individuals receiving the brief manualized CBT intervention will show a reduction in symptoms associated with social anxiety, as determined with the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS), the Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN) and the Brief Social Phobia Scale (BSPS) at the end of 13 weeks of intervention and at follow‐up assessments (3‐ and 6‐months). In addition, fewer participants receiving CBT will meet DSM‐IV diagnostic criteria for social phobia at the end of the study. Secondary objective: To measure the effect of a group CBT intervention for social anxiety in first episode psychosis on clinical outcome and functional outcome. Secondary hypothesis: Following the treatment trial the CBT group will show better clinical outcome relative to the control group, defined as the length of symptomatic remission at follow‐ups. For functional outcome, they will show significant improvement on a self‐report measure of recovery (the Recovery Assessment Scale) and on a clinician‐rated measure, the Social and Occupational Functioning Scale (SOFAS) at 3‐ and 6‐month follow‐ups. Methods Study design: A randomized controlled trial will be conducted comparing the experimental group, which will be receiving group CBT for social anxiety plus standard care, to the active control group who will be receiving CACRT and standard care. During the randomization process and repartition of participants, the two groups will be matched on the severity of social anxiety, level of functioning and gender (as described below) in order to avoid any initial group inequality. Participants will be assessed before and after treatment. They will also be asked to return for completion of two follow‐up assessments (at 3‐ and 6‐months) in order to measure the effect of treatment over time and verify whether the hypothesized therapeutic gains are maintained. As part of these follow‐up evaluations, participants will complete various questionnaires and scales. Participants: This study will take place in Montreal and will involve five first‐episode psychosis clinics affiliated with McGill University or Université de Montréal (UdeM). These include PEPP‐Montréal, the Douglas Institute (Director Dr Ashok Malla, co‐investigator), the First Episode Psychosis Program from the Jewish General Hospital (Director Dr. G. Eric Jarvis, co‐investigator), and the First Episode Psychosis Program from the MUHC (Director Dr. Howard Margolese, co‐investigator) from the McGill network, and The Clinique Jeunes Adultes Psychotiques from the Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal (CHUM) (Director Dr. Amal Abdel‐Baki, co‐investigator) and the Programme des Premiers Épisodes Psychotiques from Institut Universitaire de Santé Mentale de Montréal (Director Dr. Luc Nicole, co‐investigator) from UdeM. These related first episode psychosis programs all provide a complete range of services for adults suffering from psychosis, including evaluation, prevention, treatment, hospitalization, outpatient and family services, rehabilitation, modified assertive community case management, and variable community follow‐ups. These programs provide follow‐up for up to five years. Collectively, these five first‐episode programs service the entire population of Montreal (2.2 million) and have more than 1000 active patients in addition to accepting about 300 new clients per year. Screening of potential participants: Recruitment of participants will be facilitated by the co‐investigators, who are clinical heads at the different services involved in this study, and by the culture of integration of clinical care and research that characterizes these different programs. Clinical assessment: After the screening is performed and informed consent is obtained, the participant will be administered a Structured Clinical Diagnosis (SCID) for DSM‐IV to confirm the diagnosis of a psychotic disorder in collaboration with a research psychiatrist. If the diagnosis is confirmed and eligibility for the study is established, the participant will undergo a thorough clinical assessment at intake, 3‐month and 6‐month follow‐ups, and at the end of therapy. Symptom evaluation will include the Scale for Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS) and the Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), as well as the Calgary Depression Scale. Social anxiety will be assessed via three scales: the SIAS is a 20‐item scale which measures anxiety in interpersonal encounters; the SPIN is a 17‐item scale assessing multiple dimensions of social anxiety including fear, avoidance and physiological discomfort; the Brief Social Phobia Scale (BSPS) is an 11‐item clinician‐rated assessment scale developed by Davidson which specifically measures fear, avoidance and autonomic physiological responses that are usually associated with most common social situations. In addition, the social phobia module of the SCID‐I will be used to confirm a diagnosis of social phobia. We have extensive experience in administering these instruments and our raters have achieved a high level of inter‐rater reliability (ICC 0.79‐.92). Finally, the Recovery Assessment Scale (RAS) and the Social and Occupational Functioning Scale (SOFAS) will be administered. The RAS is a 41‐item self‐report measure examining multiple dimensions of functional recovery as perceived by the patient him/herself. SOFAS is used to evaluate the individual's level of social and occupational functioning independent of the overall severity of psychiatric symptoms. The ratings are done first to allocate a category (1‐10) based on the description of that category and how it applies to the individual, followed by a numerical score within that category. Neuropsychological assessment: Initial assessment of participants will include the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI), a pen and paper intelligence quotient (IQ) test consisting of 4 sub‐scales (Vocabulary, Similarities, Block Design, Matrix Reasoning). It will only be administered once as part of initial assessment before treatment. Participants will also be evaluated using CogState, a computerized cognitive battery of 11 tasks that evaluate 7 cognitive domains (reasoning/problem solving, speed of processing, attention/vigilance, visual learning and memory, verbal learning and memory, working memory and social cognition). Both will be administered by a trained evaluator under the supervision of a neuropsychologist. The CogState is a repeatable neuropsychological battery that was specifically designed for schizophrenia and related psychoses. This assessment will be used to: confirm that participants present an IQ of at least 70; explore any impact of CACRT on neurocognitive performance; explore whether cognitive performance is predictive of treatment response in CBT, as some suggest. Procedure for participant recruitment and group randomization: Potential participants will be identified by clinical staff, in collaboration with the project coordinator, within the participating early psychosis programs. In all cases, only clients who will have indicated to their treating team a wish to learn more about the research study will be referred to the investigators. Once formal consent is obtained and an initial screening procedure completed, the research coordinator will assess the participant's overall functioning and eligibility for the current study by conducting the Global Assessment Scale (GAF), which has been shown in numerous studies to be a reliable and valid clinical measure of functioning. This measure will allow researchers to match participants not only on cognitive abilities (i.e. intermediate reading level) and language (i.e. informal participant‐report of language proficiency) but also on their functionality. The score used for stratification will be a score of 50 or more, which will identify "high functional" versus "low functional" participants. In addition, participants will be asked to fill out the SIAS, SPIN and BSPS, and those with a score above the cut‐off values described above will be approached for this study. A brief description of both psychosocial interventions (CBT and CACRT) will be offered by the referral source and the case will be referred to the research coordinator. During this initial session, the research staff will conduct a semi‐structured interview, the Social Phobia / Anxiety sub‐scale of the SCID‐I. Random assignment will be carried out using a computer‐run randomization protocol, which improves upon chance allocation to a given group by adjusting assignment probabilities based upon the frequency and characteristics of current group membership on key intake characteristics that could influence outcomes. A biostatistician (co‐applicant Norbert Schmitz) not connected with treatment in any capacity and located away from the treatment site will carry out the randomization. Recruitment of participants and symptom assessments will be conducted, respectively, by a research coordinator and a research assistant, and the latter will be blind to treatment. After random assignment is complete, an appointment for the therapy session will be scheduled for those assigned to receive CBT and to those assigned to receive CACRT. We expect to take four years to complete the recruitment for this study. Treatment fidelity and quality control measures: To ensure that both interventions are being carried out in accordance with the detailed guidelines provided in the respective manuals, we will put in place quality control measures. For group CBT, we will use the approach developed by one of the co‐investigator (T.L.) that is specific to group intervention in early psychosis. Briefly, all sessions will be audiotaped and the group adaptation of the Cognitive‐ Behavioral Therapy Scale will then be completed by two experienced CBT therapists. The audiotapes of the first 5 sessions of every group will be reviewed by two experienced CBT therapists and they will offer supervision to the therapists. Afterward, approximately 1 in every 3 sessions will be examined, or more if requested. For the active control condition involving cognitive remediation, Dr. Bowie (co‐investigator), who has extensive experience in this field, will be responsible for quality control. Dr. Bowie has already conducted several randomized controlled trials using cognitive remediation interventions. Therapists will be trained by a registered clinical psychologist who is a senior clinician with over 12 years of experience with cognitive remediation. Medication: Medications will be monitored monthly using information from multiple sources (case managers, psychiatrists, and patients) to ensure that results are not due to changes in medication. Blinding the evaluations: While it is well acknowledged that conducting a classical double blind evaluation in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a psychosocial intervention is not feasible, we believe it is important to conduct blind evaluations of the study outcomes. Therefore, all evaluations will be conducted by a trained bilingual rater who will have no involvement in the conduct of the study, the delivery of the interventions or any involvement with any trial‐related meetings. Clinical trial management: The steering committee will meet on a regular basis, about once every three months.

AB  - Balancing Everyday Life ‐ evaluation of the effectiveness of an activity‐based lifestyle intervention for people with psychiatric disorders This is a RCT study, evaluating the effectiveness of the Everyday Life in Balance (BEL) intervention. The intervention: The BEL was developed on the basis of previous research on lifestyle interventions made by the current research group and other researchers. Other important sources of inspiration were descriptive studies on everyday life among people with severe mental illness. It is a group‐based programme (5‐8 participants) with 12 sessions, one session a week, and 2 booster sessions with two‐week intervals. The themes for the group sessions are, e.g., activity balance, motivation, healthy living, work‐related activities, leisure and social activities. Each session contains a brief educational section, a main group activity and a home assignment to be completed between sessions. The main group activity starts with analysing the present situation and proceeds with identifying desired goals and finding strategies for how to reach them. The home assignment is aimed at testing one of the proposed strategies. The next‐coming session starts with looking back at the home assignment, and depending on the outcome, goals may need to be revised. Self‐analysis, setting goals, finding strategies and evaluating the outcome of tested strategies form a process for each session, but also for the BEL intervention as a whole. After completed BEL, the participants will have developed an ability to reflect on their own situation and have strategies for changing their everyday life in a desired direction, such that they feel their everyday life has a satisfactory balance between rest and work, secluded and social activities, etc. The BEL intervention is led by occupational therapists. They take part in a specifically developed two‐day education and follow the BEL manual. They also participate in a web‐based discussion forum where they can seek support from the researchers and/ or other BEL occupational therapists. Selection of units and participants: Units in both county council‐based psychiatry (outpatient units within general psychiatry and psychosis care) and community‐based activity centers (CBACs) in four counties in south Sweden have been invited. Cluster randomization is used to assign the units to the BEL or the control condition. On the basis of blocks of four units, two are randomized to the BEL and two to the control condition, which is care as usual (CAU). CAU generally means standard occupational therapy. Four categories of participants will be recruited: a) BEL participants from county‐council‐based psychiatry; b) BEL participants from community‐based psychiatry; c) CAU participants from county‐council‐based psychiatry; and d) CAU participants from community‐based psychiatry. Occupational therapists in the units select participants based on the patients' needs for a lifestyle intervention and being likely to benefit from a group intervention. The same criteria are applied in the BEL units and the CAU units. Power analysis: The investigators based the power calculation on the Satisfaction with Daily Occupations (SDO) scale. A previous study found a mean difference of 0.5 points on the SDO between groups of people with mental illness who had varying structure to their everyday life. Based on the means and standard deviations from that study, the analysis pointed to 41 participants in each condition as the desired sample size to detect a difference on the SDO of 0.5 with 80% power at p<0.05. The investigators still desire 60 participants from each group (a ‐ d above) since no solid base for a power calculation exists in the field. In all 240 participants are thus sought, 60+60 receiving the BEL and 60‐60 receiving CAU. The following instruments are used: Rosenberg's self‐esteem scale: Positive and negative attitudes towards the self; Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF): Symptom severity and psychosocial functioning; Satisfaction with Daily Occupations and Balance (SDO‐B): Satisfaction with everyday occupation and occupational balance; Occupational Value with pre‐defined items (OVal‐pd): Perceived value with daily occupation; Pearlin's Mastery Scale: Self‐mastery; Medical Outcomes Short Form (SF‐36) (1st item): Self‐rated Health; Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life (MANSA): Quality of life; Interview Schedule for Social Interaction (ISSI): The social network; Worker Role Self‐assessment (WRS): Attitudes and expectations concerning the worker role; "Making decisions": Empowerment; Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ): Satisfaction with the intervention; Estimating Perceived Meaning in Day Centers (EPM‐DC): Characteristics of day centers; Questionnaire of Personal Recovery (QPR): Recovery from mental illness; Fidelity scale: Fidelity to the intervention. In addition, consequences of the intervention will be reflected in qualitative interviews with users and staff. Another important part of the data collection will be to make a detailed description of the CAU provided in the comparison units. Procedure: As the intervention starts, the attendees answer questionnaires about their personal situation regarding satisfaction with daily occupations, well‐being, perceived worker role, social interaction, recovery etc. Subsequently, the BEL is implemented in the units randomised to that condition. After 16 weeks of intervention (including the booster sessions), the measurements are repeated. A follow‐up is then made after another six months. The same data collection is made at corresponding time points in the comparison units. Additional qualitative interviews are made in the intervention units, with strategically selected participants (attendees and staff) to get a deeper picture of the intervention process and its implications. When the research project is finished, the comparison units will be given the opportunity to go through the intervention. Analyses: The primary analysis concerns differences in outcomes between the intervention and the control group (a+b versus c+d above), at the unit level (characteristics of the CBACs) and the individual level (perceptions of worker role, satisfaction, well‐being etc.), and the stability of such outcomes. The sample size will also allow for comparison between community‐based and county‐council‐based BEL. Since measuring characteristics of CBACs is not of relevance for county council‐based psychiatry, the comparison at the unit level will only concern community‐based psychiatry. Analyses of the qualitative interviews, by means of grounded theory [10], will yield a more detailed description of the BEL and its implications, as perceived by both attendees and staff. Current state of the study: The project is in the initial phase and the first units were recruited in late 2012. At present, 24 units have been randomized to either condition. The second measurements (after completed BEL) have just been completed and follow‐ups will continue until mid‐2016, as will qualitative interviews. Analysing data and reporting results will continue until late 2018. Methodological considerations By including 60 participants in each group the studies will be able to detect a medium effect size (ES=0.4), which would be a difference of clinical and practical significance. Self‐rating instruments are used and it is important to consider whether these produce reliable data when used with people with SMI, particularly since many in the target group have cognitive problems. However, research has shown that self‐ratings of psychological factors were valid and reliable among people with schizophrenia, also those with a poor insight into their mental illness. Age, gender and being of foreign origin will be considered as covariates, along with other socioeconomic factors such as family situation, educational level and money at one's disposal. Other factors that should be considered are the participant's functional status and diagnoses. Research has not shown that diagnosis per se plays any substantial role in the outcome of psychiatric rehabilitation, for the course of a psychiatric disability or for how people perceive their everyday occupations, but this should be investigated further because the evidence is inconclusive. Level of functioning, level of psychopathology, and negative symptoms have indeed been shown to be of importance for outcomes of psychiatric rehabilitation. Therefore, this project will also control for factors related to diagnosis and functional status.

AB  - Background: The focus in recent years on evidence for non‐pharmacological treatment in adults with ADHD raises the question of potential effects of structured group therapy. Structured skills training groups have shown beneficial effects in some studies in an outpatient psychiatric context by reduction in ADHD symptoms in individuals who remained stable regarding medication status. Aims: The main objective for the trial is to investigate the potential effects of structured skills training groups in a clinically relevant but still controlled setting on broader outcomes including both symptomatic, functional and health related quality of life measures. Methods/Design: The trial is designed as a multicenter randomized controlled parallel group design. At each outpatient site the enrolled patients are randomized into two groups for either Group 1 (G1) with start of weekly treatment in active structured skills training group lasting for 14 weeks or allocated to Group 2 (G2) with treatment as usual/clinical management and with 15 weeks delayed start of their group treatment for comparison wth patients in the other arm. Those patients in the control condition arm receiving treatment as usual or clinical management of individual patients (G2), are thereafter switched to active structured skills training group therapy.All patients are followed up after six months with assessments of primary and secondary outcomes.

AB  - This randomized controlled pilot study will evaluate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of MBRP plus usual community treatment as usual (TAU) compared to TAU alone (TAU) for women with substance use disorders(SUD) and PTSD enrolled in community substance abuse treatment. Participants will be randomized to eight weekly 90‐minute, mixed individual and group‐based MBRP in addition to TAU or TAU alone. The eight sessions of MBRP will replace 8 sessions of seeking safety (SS); a trauma focused integrated therapy currently implemented in TAU. Outcomes assessed will be: 1. PTSD symptom severity as measured by the Clinician's Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Symptom Scale‐Self Report (PSS‐SR); 2. Alcohol and substance use as measured by the Timeline Follow Back (TLFB) assessment and corroborated with urine drug screens. 3. psychosocial functioning; 4. Measure of emotional regulation and mindfulness awareness, attention and acceptance. Recruitment of participants will primarily take place a community treatment program treating women with co‐occurring PTSD and SUD. Following therapist training, certification and piloting, eligible women will be invited to participate in the study. Interested potential participants will be screened for major inclusion/exclusion criteria including age, alcohol/substance use, history of trauma and psychiatric/health/medication status. If potentially eligible, an Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved informed consent will be obtained and participants will be scheduled for a baseline assessment appointment. If an individual is ineligible to participate in this research protocol, she will continue in her usual community treatment program and/or if indicated, be referred for additional treatment services. The investigators decided to limit the study group to women because they represent the largest percentage of patients with comorbid PTSD and SUDs and most have experienced sexual and/or physical trauma. So when trauma‐focused treatment is delivered in a group setting for this population, single sex groups create a safe, comfortable and open atmosphere that is required for MM‐based treatment and trauma focused work. After having at least 7 days in standard treatment baseline assessments will be collected. Women meeting inclusion with no exclusionary criteria will be randomized to MBRP plus TAU or TAU alone control. Both groups will attend their standard intensive TAU program. The eight MBRP therapy sessions will be integrated into the standard TAU program and replace 8 TAU SS sessions. Participants will be introduced to the therapists and scheduled for their first individual/small group session. The primary outcome measures for the efficacy portion of this study are 1) the effective reduction in PTSD symptom severity through the total score on the CAPS at the end of treatment between the two study groups and 2) the effective reduction in the proportion of days using and amount of use of alcohol/substances during the final 30 days of treatment as measured by the TLFB verified by urine drug screens (UDS). In addition, secondary endpoints will include CAPS scores at the 3 and 6 month post‐intervention follow‐up visits, the 7 day point prevalence abstinence rates at each treatment, post treatment and follow up visits. Also, PSS‐SR, Obsessive Compulsive Drinking and Substance Use Scale‐Revised (OCDS‐R), Addiction Severity Index‐Lite (ASI‐Lite), Difficulties in Emotional Regulation Scale (DERS), Mindfulness Acceptance and Awareness Questionnaire (MAAS), Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFQS) and Cognitive and Affective Regulation Scale (CAMS‐R). There will also be secondary endpoints and used to gain insight into potential effect modification and mediation. Secondary analysis will also include the proportion of days using alcohol/drugs, craving, psychosocial functioning and emotional regulation. Participants will be assessed weekly throughout the intervention, at the end of the intervention and at 3‐ and 6‐ month follow‐ups.

AB  - Methods/Design The study compares Cognitive Behavioral Rehabilitation with Treatment as Usual (TAU), the latter being the commonly offered pharmacological treatment to bipolar patients. The psychological intervention will consist of twelve weekly group sessions, lasting 90 minutes each, and including 8 to 10 individuals. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the two arms, and submitted to a 12‐month follow‐up. During the entire study, all patients will be medicated accordingly to their clinical needs, and all changes in medication will be recorded as a secondary outcome , following the Necessary Clinical Adjustment (NCA) instrument. The NCA records medication adjustments implemented to reduce symptoms, improve response and functioning, or handle unbearable side effects. Participants In order to be included, patients must be between 18 to 55 years old, literate, present an IQ score higher than 80 and have been diagnosed with bipolar I or II accordingly to DSM‐V criteria (APA, 2014). Excluding conditions are: presence of substance or alcohol abuse in the last 6 months, current suicide risk, organic mental disorders or scores higher than 12, in the Montgomery‐Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) or the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) at the beginning of the interventions. Recruiting will take place at an outpatient service provided by the Bipolar Disorder Research Program (PROMAN) at the University of São Paulo Medical School, Brazil. Patients will receive invitations individually, and sign an informed consent. Procedure and Outcomes Once included, patients will complete the Portuguese versions of the following self‐report questionnaires: the abbreviated instrument of quality of life (WHOQOL‐bref), the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale 11 (BIS 11), the Social Skills Inventory (IHS) and the Biological Rhythms Interview of Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (BRIAN) . Patients will also complete the Functioning Assessment Short Test (FAST) and a brief questionnaire about bipolar disorder. A brief neuropsychological battery will be conducted, which includes the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) (Wechsler, 1999), and following subtests from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB): Motor Screening Task (MOT); Rapid Visual Information Processing (RVP); Reaction Time (RTI); Spatial Span (SSP); Spatial Working Memory (SWM); One Touch Stockings of Cambridge (OTS); Pattern Recognition Memory (PRM); Delayed Matching to Sample (DMS); Attention Switching Task (AST); Emotion Recognition Task (ERT). Subjects will also complete the initial assessment and mood module of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM‐5 (SCID‐5) (APA, 2014) post‐intervention at week 12, and 6 and 12 months thereafter. Hypothesis The study hypothesizes that Cognitive Behavioral Rehabilitation, in comparison to TAU, will: I. Decrease the recurrence rates of new episodes; our primary outcome measure. II. Improve attention, mental flexibility, working memory and emotional recognition; our secondary outcome. In an exploratory analysis we will also assess whether Cognitive Behavioral Rehabilitation may: A. Enhances functional, social skills and quality of life scores; B. Increases sleep quality and knowledge about the disorder; and C., Reduces impulsivity Interventions Treatment as Usual (TAU) The control group from this study will receive standard out‐patient treatment offered in our clinic, which involves psychopharmacological mood stabilization and regular contacts with mental health nurses. The number and amount of pharmacological treatment will follow the physician decision, respecting individual demands. All pharmacological treatment will be monitored and recorded in accordance to the Litmus study (Nierenberg et al. 2009). Cognitive Behavioral Rehabilitation We developed a 12‐session intervention combining previous experience in cognitive behavior therapy for bipolar patients with several elements of cognitive remediation. The first step was to identify behaviors that have an important role in patients´ autonomy, followed by determining which cognitive domains are involved. The core objective was to promote the generalization of the learnt behaviors in the daily routine. Described below is the arrangement of each session, divided in three major Modules: In the first Module comprises four sessions that attempt to improve attention and memory, considering the necessity to retain the information discussed throughout the sessions. There are two target behaviors involved: adherence to pharmacological treatment and mood monitoring. The cognitive remediation exercises seek to enhance verbal and visual memories, while secondarily enhancing attention with the paper material included in the manual. In the first session, group members and psychotherapists introduce themselves, followed by a discussion regarding the manual, individual´s expectations and the importance of attendance. The second session explores the concept of attention, and its importance as a door to further cognitive functions; the group also learns exercises aimed at training attention and memory. The third session focuses on medication adherence and its relation to attention. The core of the third session is the organization of the patient´s environment, which is frequently chaotic; a discussion about cues is encouraged at the end of the session. The fourth session starts by introducing mood graphics to patients and the importance of the early identifying of mood episodes. At the end of the first module, patients are stimulated to cook as method of reinforcing what they have learned while enhancing their autonomy. The second module targets social cognition and communication. The fifth session familiarizes the patients with the concept of automatic thoughts (Rush and Beck, 1978), and a guide to identify its presence. Cognitive distortions are discussed along with examples provided by the subjects´ own experiences. The sixth session begins returning to the initial theme by habituating patients to the automatic thought record (Beck, 1997), patients are stimulated to restructure their own thoughts during experiences identified in previous sessions. Mental flexibility and empathy are introduced and discussed. The seventh session acquaint patients to assertive communication and emotion recognition by teaching role‐playing exercises and the importance of positive assertiveness. The eighth session follows the same agenda as the seventh. The last module of Cognitive Behavioral Rehabilitation aims at problem solving strategies and relapse prevention. The ninth session begins with the identification of personal problems, mainly by distinguishing it from preoccupations; the topic is important because patients often incorporate their problems to expectations and desires, generating an urge to abandon them, the session ends by emphasizing the importance of mental flexibility in generating as many responses as possible to each identified problem. In the tenth session, patients learn solving‐problem techniques in a systematic setting. The eleventh session devotes to review information and clarify possible doubts from the patients; patients are also encouraged to debate the importance of regular routines and regular sleep, which can be adjusted using sleep hygiene techniques. A progressive muscle relaxation ends the session. Finally, the last session´s target is to avoid future mood relapses, it by returning to the personal goals defined in session one and prompting patients to develop a prevention plan. The acronym H.U.M.O.R. resumes the core points of the post‐intervention maintenance program: 1) Habituate to a regular routine; 2) Use what you have learnt; 3) Monitor your mood; 4) Observe arising problems and deal effectively with it; and 5) Respond to automatic thoughts. All patients in the cognitive behavioral rehabilitation group will also receive TAU. Statistical Analysis Sample Size The sample size calculation was based on the proportion of patients that remain episode‐free after 12 months following a group intervention. Previous studies utilizing TAU exhibited a decrease of bipolar relapses in 30% of patients after a one‐year follow‐up. The present study anticipates a 55% success rate in prevention of mood relapses, during the same period, in patients assigned to the Cognitive Behavioral Rehabilitation. Thus, considering an 80% power to obtain a 5% significance, an estimated sample of 28 individuals per group, 56 in total, should be sufficient to achieve significant results. A previous study conducted by the same research team measured a drop‐out rate of 10% in a one year follow‐up, for this latter reason, the study will consist of 60 participants. Baseline and Follow up Data. In order to measure the effects of the interventions, the study will employ the following statistical tests: 1) Qui‐squared and Mann‐Whitney to test homogeneity between the groups at the beginning of the interventions; 2) Student t test or Mann‐Whitney to investigate the effects of such interventions, pre and post treatment, depending on the distribution of the data; 3) An analysis of variance, with and without adjustment for mood symptoms scores, IQ and BD duration, for comparison between groups; and 4) The Kaplan‐Meyer survival method with log rank test for statistical analysis, to investigate the survival data between groups, which measures in weeks, the time to the first episode as an event.

AB  - Background: Transdiagnostic Cognitive Behavior Therapy (TCBT) Manuals delivered in individual format, have been reported to be just as effective as traditional diagnosis specific CBT manuals. The investigators have translated and modified the "The Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders" (UP‐CBT) developed by Barlow and colleagues for use in Mental Health Service (MHS), and shown effects comparable to traditional CBT in a naturalistic trial. As the use of one manual instead of several diagnosis‐specific manuals could simplify logistics, reduce waiting time, and increase therapist expertise compared to diagnosis specific CBT, the study aim to test the relative efficacy of group UP‐CBT and diagnosis specific group CBT. Methods/design: It is a partially blinded, pragmatic, non‐inferiority, parallel, multi‐center randomized controlled trial (RCT) of UP‐CBT vs diagnosis specific CBT for depression, social anxiety disorder and agoraphobia/panic disorder. In both arms, the intervention consists of weekly group session for 14 weeks. In total, 248 patients are recruited from three regional MHS centers across the country and included in two intervention arms.31st July 2018 suppl: Inclusion number expanded to 340 due to unexpected large drop‐out. Outcomes are measured at end of therapy and at 6 months follow‐up. Weekly patient‐rated outcomes and group evaluations are collected for every session. Outcome assessors, blind to delivered intervention, will perform the observer‐based symptom ratings, and fidelity assessors will monitor manual adherence. Discussion: The current study will be the first RCT investigating the dissemination of the UP in a MHS setting and UP delivered in groups and including patients with depression. Hence the results are expected to add substantially to the evidence base for rational group psychotherapy in MHS. The planned moderator and mediator analyses could spur new hypotheses about mechanisms of change in psychotherapy and the association between patient characteristics and treatment effect.

AB  - Rationale & hypothesis ‐ Both, management of multi‐morbidity and efficient collaboration between specialized care and community‐based services are unmet needs that can be overcome by implementation of structured, but flexible, service workflows. That is, an ACM approach, as well as appropriate patient health risks assessment and stratification. The service workflow has two sequential phases with specific target outcomes for each of them: i) Short‐term (30 and 90 days after hospital discharge) prevention of hospital‐related events after hospital discharge; and ii) Intervention aiming at long‐term enhanced CCP management. Objectives ‐ To assess the impact of ICT‐supported ACM on: i) reduction of early hospital‐related events including hospital re‐admissions, visits to emergency department and mortality; and, ii) Health value generation of the long‐term intervention, defined as target outcomes achieved relative to their costs.Detailed outcomes include the eleven indicators recommended by the Spanish Health System covering the following dimensions: i) Characteristics of the study groups and health status (i.e, Users attended in primary care and, Health‐related quality of life of patients and caregivers); ii) Intermediate outcomes (Emergency Department visits; General Practitioner visits; Cumulative days per year admitted in hospital; Poli‐medication; Potentially avoidable hospitalizations; Hospital readmissions; Needs for social support); iii) Empowerment (Unhealthy life styles); and, iv) Structure (Access to ICT‐supported integrated care). Moreover, through the program lifespan progresses consolidated by the International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM) will be incorporated. Study design ‐ The large‐scale deployment will be evaluated as an observational study with a matched control group. Assessment will be done by an independent team. The number of patients to be included in the implementation study is approximately one‐thousand individuals per year, including both conventional hospitalization and home hospitalization as recruitment sources. Intervention ‐ The general structure of the service workflow for the intervention group is as follows: Case identification. Identification of candidates for inclusion into the program following the pre‐defined inclusion/exclusion Case evaluation. During hospital admission or home hospitalization. A holistic characterization should be performed covering a threefold aim: i) Comprehensive assessment of each individual's need for health and social support; ii) Individualized pharmacological and non‐pharmacological treatment, including adherence and self‐management interventions needs; iii) Identification of short and long‐term clinical requirements; and, iv) Assessment of barriers that may limit fulfilment of the program. Personalized work plan definition ‐ Personalized action plan based on case evaluation. Work plan execution, follow‐up and event handling with the support provided by information and communication technologies (ICT) that facilitate the program follow up and the handling of unexpected events by: i) fostering patient empowerment for self‐management; ii) enhance patient adherence to the program; iii) facilitating remote supervision; and, iv) allowing patient monitoring. Discharge ‐ At the end of the program evaluation.Eventually, it can be moved to other types of integrated care services depending upon his/her needs. The intervention is implemented by a multidisciplinary team from the hospital and from the Primary Care, of advanced‐practice nurses, physicians, physiotherapists, community nurses, social workers having a general practitioner as a reference. The collaboration between specialized care and primary care is guided by the reform of specialized care in the healthcare sectors initiated in 2006. Both teams share ICT‐supported tools. The intervention during hospital admission includes four key features: 1) A comprehensive assessment of the patient at entry; 2) A two‐hour educational program administered at entry by a nurse followed by distribution of patient‐specific support material. Intervention after hospital discharge a) Phone call at 24 hours; b) Home visit at 72 hours after discharge. Accessibility to the point of care available 24 hours/day; PHF, as self‐management tool and appointment at 1m after discharge. After the transitional phase, the advanced‐practice nurses perform regular training sessions to the community‐based care teams, facilitate high accessibility to specialized care as needed and support functionalities of the PHF for the patients admitted into the program. The number of home care visits, as well as access to specialized care, during the follow‐up 12 month period is individually tailored, and dynamically adapted, to patient needs. Moreover, planned visits by specialized professionals can be scheduled through the day hospital or home visits if this was deemed necessary by primary care teams. ICT‐ Support ‐ The three main actors, namely: i) the healthcare professionals with access to an adaptive case management system for work plan prescription, follow‐up, coaching, and care‐coordination across healthcare tiers; ii) the adaptive case management system supporting execution of the patient work plan and providing a bridge of interoperability and collaborative tools among the patient (through the PHF), the case manager and the electronic medical record; and, iii) the patient, with access to the PHF wherein she/he can answer questionnaires, perform monitoring through mHealth apps, and have access to a follow‐up reports and tailored educational information. Control group ‐ Patients assigned to usual care will follow conventional treatment, being managed by their physician without support by the multidisciplinary team, as described above for the intervention group. Clinical assessment ‐ Evaluation will be done by an independent team at baseline and after the 12‐month follow‐up. The questionnaires are those used by the integrated care team with additions designed to capture patient empowerment characteristics: mental status, activities of daily living, anxiety and depression, health‐related quality of life; acute episodes requiring emergency department consultations and/or hospital admissions within the healthcare sector will be assessed using shared registries from the public health system. Moreover, core outcomes, will be assessed from public registries. Data analysis‐ A sample size of 200 patients per group was necessary to recognize statistically significant effects of the intervention. The estimated number of patients identified during the screening process (one‐thousand per year) is markedly higher than minimum required, thus ensuring enough statistical power. Results will be expressed as mean and standard deviation (SD), or as number and percentages, in the corresponding categories. Comparisons between the two study groups on admission and at 12 months will be performed using unpaired Student t‐test for continuous variables, if variables to be compared have two categories; and, chi‐square tests for non‐continuous variables. Changes within each group were assessed by paired analysis (for example using paired t test). The effects of the intervention on mortality and time to admission will be analyzed respectively using multivariate logistic and Cox regression models, adjusted for baseline differences between groups. We will build saturated models introducing all of the covariates which result statistically significant during bivariate assessment. After this, we will build parsimonious models by excluding, one to one, all of the variables not significant according to the Wald test p‐value. Finally, we will decide the final model, comparing the saturated with the parsimonious models, according to the likelihood ratio test.Statistical significance is set at a p value less than 0.05. Analyses will be done with SPSS release 20. Additionally, qualitative assessment of technology will be done using standard questionnaires and through focus groups.

AB  - The purpose of this multi‐site RCT is to determine the effectiveness of the MAC group intervention on reducing psychotic disorder symptomatology (primary outcome) as well as promoting quality of life, critical skills for recovery and decreasing mental health service utilization (secondary outcomes) for transitional aged youth (16‐25 years old) experiencing early psychosis. This study is being run at five southern Ontario Early Psychosis Intervention (EPI) sites with Prevention and Early Intervention Program for Psychoses (PEPP) at London Health Sciences Centre (LHSC) being the lead site. Three of the larger sites (located in London, Kitchener‐Waterloo, and Hamilton Ontario) are following the RCT design, while the two smaller sites (located in Chatham‐Kent and Sarnia, Ontario) are participating in a pre‐post design. For the three RCT sites we aim to recruit 20‐24 participants, and for the pre‐post sites we aim to recruit 10 participants (total n=92 participants). Participants at the RCT sites will be randomized into Group‐A (n = 12; immediate treatment intervention group) or Group‐B (n = 12; delayed treatment intervention group). Group‐A will receive the MAC intervention at the onset of the study, while Group‐B will receive treatment as usual (TAU). Group‐B will have the option of receiving the MAC intervention approximately 6 months after the onset of the study. At all times during this study, participants who are receiving the MAC intervention will also be able to continue receiving TAU. Both groups will be assessed with a battery of quantitative measures at baseline (T1), three months later (i.e., immediately post‐MAC intervention) (T2), and again three months post‐MAC intervention (T3). The measures include interview assessments of psychotic disorder symptoms, and self‐report measures of affect, self‐esteem, quality of life, coping strategies, assertiveness, social functioning, mindfulness and cognitive skills. In addition, healthcare utilization records for the 6 months preceding MAC intervention onset and for the 6 month duration of the study (3 month MAC intervention + 3 month post‐MAC intervention follow‐up period) will be collected. Researchers conducting symptom assessment interviews and data analysis will be blinded to the group membership of participants. For the two pre‐post sites, all 10 participants will receive the MAC intervention immediately. All 10 participants will complete T1, T2, and T3 assessments and their healthcare utilization records will also be collected. Based on the pilot study at PEPP‐LHSC, and based on previous findings of Mindfulness Based Interventions for psychoses in the literature, we are expecting that participation in the MAC intervention will result in improvement in the following areas: psychotic symptomology (including affective symptoms), mindfulness skills, quality of life, measures of recovery (self‐esteem, perceived recovery), perceived coping, assertiveness, social functioning, cognitive skills, and a reduction in healthcare service utilization (e.g., emergency room visits, inpatient admissions/length of hospitalization).

AB  - This study is carried out at two specialized stress rehabilitation centers in Stockholm. All patients included in the clinics stress rehabilitation program are asked to participate in the study and are recruited consecutively from October 2017 throughout December 2018. An estimate of 400 patients will be included. The treatment program is a 24‐week Multiprofessional standardized CBT‐rehabilitation consisting of a nine‐session CBT group treatment (stress management) followed by a seven‐session group treatment in applied relaxation. Parallel to the group treatments patients receives nine sessions of individual CBT, three visits to an MD (for medication, follow‐up, and sick‐listing), two individual sessions to a physiotherapist and a three session‐exercise group. Also, vocational measures are taken through rehabilitation meetings together with the patient's employer (if an employer exists). Primary treatment outcomes will be return‐to‐work (RTW) and symptoms of ED, anxiety, and depression. Secondary treatment outcomes will be quality of life, pathological worry, psychological flexibility, clinical perfectionism, insomnia, burnout, and symptoms. Predictors of symptom development and RTW will be explored. Also, comorbidity of chronic pain, negative effects of psychotherapy and treatment credibility will be investigated.

AB  - Background Young adults have elevated rates of serious mental illnesses and they often do not receive consistent mental health care. This is a considerable challenge for public health, as most often mental health conditions persist into adulthood. Continuing to engage this population in their professional mental health treatment has been a pervasive challenge globally. Few mental health interventions have been designed specifically for young adults and none are conceptualized as meta‐interventions or orientation programs. Just Do You is a young‐adult‐centered and theoretically guided intervention that has shown promise for keeping young adults connected to their professional treatments, while also enhancing their hope for the future and their own recovery. Just Do You is a brief two‐module engagement program that utilizes a hybrid provider team of a licensed clinician and peer to address mistrust, lack of hope for the future, stigma concerns, literacy and a sense of efficacy early on when young adults begin a new service experience in adult outpatient day programs (i.e., New York State Personalized Recovery Oriented Services). Methods/design This study utilizes a randomized controlled trial to test the preliminary impact of the intervention, compared to best available services (treatment as usual, TAU) at two outpatient programs for adults with serious mental illnesses (n = 195). The program was adapted to two‐sessions from the piloted four‐session version through conversations with leadership at partnering agencies. The intervention involves intensive staff training and 24 months of ongoing provision, monitoring and supervision of the program. Quantitative survey data will be collected at baseline (pre), 2 weeks (post), 1 month, and 3 months. In this intention‐to‐treat analysis, the investigators will conduct basic omnibus analyses to examine whether Just Do You leads to improved outcomes relative to TAU utilizing t tests across treatment conditions for each outcome measure specified. The investigators will likewise examine whether changes in the proposed mediating variables differ across groups. Discussion The aim of this study is to test Just Do You through a moderately‐sized randomized trial in order to see if it improves initial and secondary engagement among young adults with serious mental health conditions. The program is designed as an orientation to services, coupled with a curriculum designed to enhance motivation and agency, and keep young adults connected to their care. Continuity of care among this population is a serious challenge and Just Do You has the potential to address this challenge in the service system for poor, young adults living in low‐resourced communities. If it is shown to be successful in this setting, it could likely be used to address the continuity of care issue more broadly in additional settings that serve young adults with serious mental illness. It may enhance the menu of care options for those who have been recently diagnosed with a serious mental health condition, providing them with an orientation for how professional mental health care can help them. The program is recovery‐oriented, builds on the best evidence to date, and is in line with both local and national health care reform efforts.

AB  - In recent years, there has been an interest in the development of intervention programs focused on the social cognition for people with schizophrenia (Andres et al., 2001; P Penn et al. 2005). At least, five reviews and one meta‐analysis have been conducted to date, which demonstrate promising results of the effectiveness of such interventions on social cognitive deficits and functional outcomes (Tan et al; 2016; Choi et al., 2009; Horan et al., 2008; Kurtz and Richardson, 2012; Statucka and Walder, 2013; Wolwer et al., 2010). Some approaches are focused on one specific domain of social cognition ("targeted" interventions, such as the Training in Affect Recognition (TAR, Wolwer et al., 2005), and others incorporate multiple domains to create more complex, eclectic programs ("broad‐based" interventions, such as the Social Cognition and Interaction Training (SCIT; Penn et al. 2007; Kurtz & Richardson, 2012). TAR (Frommann et al., 2003) is one of the social cognition interventions with greater empirical support (Statucka & Walder, 2016) and has been shown to effectively attenuate facial affect recognition deficits in patients with schizophrenia (Wölwer et al. 2005; Wölwer and Frommann 2011; Sachs et al. 2012; Luckhaus et al. 2013). TAR teaches compensation strategies using errorless learning principles, positive reinforcement, feature abstraction, self‐instruction and, most importantly, verbalization of characteristic features of facial affect. In a randomized controlled trial, the TAR group achieved significant improvements in facial affect recognition ‐in particular in recognizing sad faces‐ and in the quality of life domain social relationship. Furthermore, the TAR training contributed to enhancing some aspects of cognitive functioning and negative symptoms (Sachs et al, 2012). In the other hand, SCIT is a 24‐session manual‐based group treatment, including elements of cognitive behavioral therapy and social skills training. It is designed for those with schizophrenia spectrum disorders to improve social functioning by enhancing social cognition. Across different studies and research groups, SCIT has been also shown to improve in emotion perception, theory of mind (ToM), and social functioning (Bartholomeusz et al., 2013; Combs et al., 2007; Hasson‐Ohayon, 2014; Parker et al. 2013; Penn et al., 2007; Roberts & Penn, 2009; Roberts et al. 2010; Roberts et al., 2014, 2016; Wang et al., 2013). The efficacy of both interventions has been demonstrated in randomized controlled trials compared to "treatment as usual", occupational therapy or cognitive remediation (Kurtz et al. 2016) but to date no study has compared the efficacy of two different social cognitive interventions (a direct comparison design). A more precise knowledge about the effect of each intervention on the 4 main domains of social cognition (affect recognition, theory of mind, attributional style and social perception) is needed, and this would enable to identify potential candidates for each program. The present work consists of a randomized clinical trial comparing the effectiveness of two interventions based on social cognition training in outpatients with schizophrenia. The investigators sought to compare the effect of a "targeted" (TAR) and a "broad‐based" (SCIT) intervention on schizophrenia patients' performance in facial affect recognition, theory of mind and attributional style. Secondarily, the investigators compare the effect on symptomatology, general cognition and functioning. The main hypothesis was that the patient group receiving TAR would exhibit a greater improvement in emotion recognition performance at the post‐intervention assessment in comparison to patients receiving the SCIT, and, conversely, patients receiving SCIT would show more effect in ToM and attributional style. To assess the durability of these effects, performance in measures of social cognition, basic cognitive functioning, symptomatology and functional capacity were assessed before (T0), after treatment (T1) and 3 months later (T2). 2. Methods 2.1. Participants Outpatients who met DSM‐IV criteria for schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder (SCID‐P; First et al. 1994) with stable symptoms in the range from 18 to 65 years were included into the study. Patients were recruited from 4 Mental Healt Centers in Madrid, Barcelona, Zaragoza and Teruel (Spain). All were clinically stable, without any psychiatric hospitalizations in the last 3 months, with the same antipsychotic medication during the previous 6 weeks, and no planned change in the drug regime for the next 3 months. Exclusion criteria were: 1. Disorders other than schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, according to DSM‐IV diagnosis criteria; 2. Additional axis‐I or axis‐II diagnosis; 3. Dependence to alcohol or other drugs (except nicotine); 4. Serious somatic disorders or organic brain damage; 5. Mental retardation or difficulty speaking or understanding the Spanish language. The study was approved by the loval ethics committee and all participants gave their informed consent. Overall 100 participants were randomized either to TAR group (n = 49) or to the SCIT group (n = 51) (Consort diagram, Graphic 1). 2.1.1. Treatment TAR is a 12‐session training on facial affect recognition over a period of 6 weeks. Treatment includes one therapist (psychiatrist or clinical psychologist) and 2 patients. It involves neuropsychological strategies, such as restitution and compensation, as well as principles of errorless learning, direct positive reinforcement, verbalization and self‐instruction (Frommann et al., 2003; Wölwer et al., 2005). The program is divided into three blocks, whereas each block consists of 4 sessions: during the first block patients learn to identify and discriminate the prototypical facial signs of the six basic emotions (happiness, sadness, fear, disgust, anger and surprise). The next block aims at a more holistic processing mode with fast decisions, relying on first impression, nonverbal processing and recognition of facial expressions with small intensities. The third block deals with the role of facial emotions in social, behavioral and situational context. Baseline assessments (T0=pre‐treatment) were performed after enrolment to the study and post treatment assessments (T1=post‐treatment) after the end of the training period (Sachs et al. 2012). SCIT is a manual‐based group intervention that is delivered in 20‐24weekly, hour‐long sessions. Groups include two clinicians and six to ten patients. SCIT uses a combination of psychoeducation, drill‐and‐repeat skill practice, strategy games, heuristic rehearsal, and homework assignments to remediate deficits and decrease biases in social cognition. Each SCIT group participant was encouraged to identify a 'practice partner', a family member or acquaintance who was willing to practice SCIT skills with the participant weekly in lieu of, or in addition to, traditional homework. SCIT clinicians attempted to reach practice partners by phone each week to check ‐in and provide guidance in their efforts to support SCIT participants' learning (Roberts et al. 2014).

AB  - The aim of this study is to test the cost‐effectiveness and cost‐utility of adding a transdiagnostic group cognitive‐behavioural therapy (TD‐CBT) to treatment as usual (TAU) for emotional disorders in primary care . A single‐blind randomized controlled clinical trial will be conducted to compare the TD‐CBT group therapy plus TAU to progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) group plus TAU in individuals, aged 18 to 65, with emotional disorders in four primary care centres located in Cantabria, Spain. The study will take a societal perspective. Psychological assessments will be carried out at baseline, post‐treatment, and 12‐months follow‐up. The assessments will include measures of clinical symptoms (anxiety, depression, and/or somatic), dysfunction, cognitive‐emotional factors (ruminative processes, pathological concern, attentional and interpretative biases, emotion regulation strategies and meta‐cognitive beliefs), and satisfaction with the treatment received. Data on health service use, including medication and days of absence from work, will be collected from electronic medical records. The primary outcomes are the incremental cost‐effectiveness ratios (ICER) based on the difference in mean costs and effectiveness between interventions and incremental cost‐utility ratios (ICURs) based on health‐related quality of life at post‐treatment and 12‐month follow‐up. Secondary outcome measures include clinical symptoms, quality of life, functioning and treatment satisfaction. Bootstrap sampling will be used to assess the uncertainty of the results. Secondary moderation and mediation analyses will also be conducted. In addition, in sessions' number 1, 4 and 7 of both treatment arms, two questionnaires will be administered that collect therapeutic alliance and group satisfaction. The main study hypothesis is that adding TD‐CBT to TAU in primary care will be more cost‐effective than TAU plus PMR. In addition, these gains will be maintained in the 12‐month follow‐up. If it is successful, the dissemination of cost‐effective treatment can help to overcome problems in accessing psychological treatment for emotional disorders in the context of an increasing demand for mental healthcare in primary care.

AB  - Background: The suicide rate among active duty service members is more than double the civilian population in the United States. Also, approximately 1 in 20 service members report suicidal ideation each year, and 1 in 100 service members report a non‐fatal suicide attempt annually. Suicidal behavior rates are compounded by a number of mental health services access barriers such as clinician shortages. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to demonstrate that a new group therapy intervention protocol, Group Brief Cognitive‐Behavioral Therapy (G‐BCBT) for Suicide, will positively impact suicidal behavior, mental health, and self‐regulatory skill outcomes for service members experiencing recent suicidal behavior. Hypotheses/Objectives: The overall objective of the proposal is to evaluate the effects of a G‐BCBT protocol on suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, mental health, and self‐regulatory skills. Investigators expect that G‐BCBT will result in improved service member suicidal behavior (Aim 1), ability to use coping strategies (Aim 2), and overall mental health (exploratory analysis). The combination of tailored means safety counseling and training in evidence‐based emotion regulation and cognitive flexibility skills will improve service members' self‐control. The group format will provide opportunities to learn and practice skills, thereby enhancing self‐efficacy. G‐BCBT outcomes are expected to be no worse than Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) group skills training, an existing gold standard intervention that is twice the length of time as G‐BCBT. Secondary hypotheses are that G‐BCBT will (a) demonstrate non‐inferior improvements in self‐regulatory skills, and (b) self‐regulatory skills will moderate G‐BCBT's impact on suicidal ideation. Specific Aims: Investigators expect this project will yield mental health and coping skills benefits for service members. These expected outcomes will be attained through the following aims: Aim 1: Pilot a group format of BCBT for its impact on suicidal behavior among active duty military service members; Aim 2: Assess the relationship between G‐BCBT and self‐regulatory factors. Study Design: This study employs a single‐site 4‐year, 2‐arm phase III RCT design. Data will be collected at Naval Medical Center Portsmouth. University of North Carolina at Charlotte will coordinate the study and conduct intervention evaluation. The Ohio State University will conduct fidelity monitoring and provide treatment subject matter expertise for both conditions. A total of 136 active duty service members will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions: (1) G‐BCBT or (2) DBT. Service members in the G‐BCBT condition will complete a 12‐week protocol comprising tailored means safety counseling followed by emotion regulation and cognitive flexibility skills training. Service members assigned to the DBT condition will complete a 24‐week protocol covering mindfulness, emotion regulation, distress tolerance, and interpersonal effectiveness skills training. All participants will complete assessments at baseline, after each session, upon treatment completion, and 3‐ and 6‐months post‐intervention completion. Data will address suicidal behavior, mental health, self‐regulatory skills, treatment process factors, and demographic and suicide‐related covariates. Clinical Impact: G‐BCBT will be tested as an evidence‐based suicide‐specific intervention requiring less resources compared to available options. This study will result in the following knowledge products that will be distributed to military healthcare system and community stakeholders: G‐BCBT protocol, revised BCBT manual, train‐the‐trainer materials, technical report, suicide prevention white paper, and G‐BCBT fidelity assessment materials. This study supports in the 2015 Department of Defense (DoD) Strategy for Suicide Prevention and 2019 Veterans Affairs/DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Assessment and Management of Patients at Risk for Suicide. G‐BCBT lethal means counseling and coping skills training will enhance service member quality of life and operational readiness. This randomized controlled clinical trial will test a new suicide‐specific group therapy intervention, Group‐Brief Cognitive‐Behavioral Therapy for Suicide (G‐BCBT), by comparing it to an established gold standard.

AB  - Intimate partner violence constitutes a serious health problem worldwide. To date the evidence is sparse on whether intimate partner violence group interventions could improve mental health outcomes among perpetrators and their partners. To compare the effectiveness of nurse-led cognitive-behavioural group therapy vs. mindfulness-based stress reduction group therapy in improving reported mental health outcomes and emotion regulation at 12 months' follow-up amongst perpetrators who voluntarily seek help for violence in intimate partnerships. A randomised controlled trial. A total of 125 persons at an outpatient service run by a University Hospital in Norway for men who perpetrate intimate partner violence were enroled in the study. The participants were randomly assigned to cognitive-behavioural group therapy (intervention group, N = 67) or mindfulness-based stress reduction group therapy (comparator group, N = 58). The pre-defined outcomes were symptoms of anxiety and depression as reported by the Hopkins Symptom Checklist 25 and general emotion regulation as reported by Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale at 12 months' follow-up. A reduction of symptoms of anxiety and depression was reported, with no between-group differences (intervention group: coefficient: − 0.17, P = 0.009; comparator group: coefficient: − 0.13, P = 0.036). Both groups had a small but statistically significant reduction in the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale scores at 12 months' follow-up (intervention group: coefficient: − 0.47, P = <0.001; comparator group: coefficient: − 0. 34, P = <0.001). Even though there was reduction in symptoms in both groups at 12 months' follow-up with no between-group differences, the total symptom scores remained high in both groups. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01653860.

AB  - Antisocial personality disorder (APD) is associated with increased problem severity in treatment-seeking opioid-dependent patients. Treatment studies have reported mixed results but generally show that patients with APD make progress that is often comparable to drug-dependent patients without the personality disorder. Much of this work is based on secondary analyses of studies evaluating responses to a variety of drug abuse treatment interventions. This study reports on a randomized prospective trial evaluating a behavioral approach for managing opioid-dependent patients with APD. Subjects (N = 100) met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria for opioid dependence and APD using a structured clinical interview and were randomly assigned to either an experimental condition (n = 51), which used a highly structured contingency management intervention, or a control condition (n = 49), which reflected standard methadone treatment. Subjects in the experimental group had significantly better counseling attendance and some indication of lower psychosocial impairment compared to the control group. The experimental intervention increased attendance in subjects with low and high levels of psychopathy and with and without other psychiatric comorbidity. These findings support the development of interventions more tailored to drug-dependent patients with APD. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: A successful psychoeducation program for serious mental illness, PsychoEducation Responsive to Families (PERF), was modified for hepatitis C virus (HCV). An effectiveness study was carried out comparing HCV-PERF with didactic education.Patients and Methods: A sample of 309 adult HCV patients was recruited from three outpatient settings and randomized (60% HCV-PERF, 40% didactic control). Groups met for 90 min bimonthly for 6 months following separate structured protocols. HCV-PERF sessions included a didactic curriculum developed uniquely for groups by member choice, with group problem-solving and support interactions. Patients were assessed at baseline, after the intervention, and 1 year later. Demographic and HCV-related variables and structured diagnostic interview data were obtained.Results: Both groups improved significantly on major depression and alcohol and drug use, quality of life, risk behaviors, and treatment satisfaction, and worsened on disability and perceived HCV-related problems. Intervention groups did not differ on outcomes.Conclusion: Even though the active intervention did not achieve a significant improvement relative to the control condition, the observable improvements in both conditions warrant further exploration of the contributions of education and support as potentially important elements of HCV behavioral intervention. Further study is needed to identify elements common to education interventions that may be contributory to the improved outcomes over time.

AB  - The co-occurrence of severe mental illness (SMI) and substance use disorder (SUD) in dual diagnosis patients is common and associated with negative treatment outcomes. Therefore, integrated treatments, combining proven effective mental health and substance abuse interventions, have emerged. However, evidence about the effectiveness of integrated outpatient versus inpatient treatment for dual diagnosis patients from randomised controlled trials is lacking. The aim of the paper is to determine whether integrated outpatient treatment for patients with SMI and SUD is more effective than integrated inpatient treatment. Three months of post-treatment hospitalisation, problem drug use and psychiatric status were assessed in 82 patients with SMI and SUD in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing five months of integrated inpatient treatment (n = 40) with five-months integrated outpatient treatment (n = 42) following a shared one-month inpatient stabilisation phase. No significant differences in outcomes were found between the two treatment conditions using intention-to-treat analyses. However, considerable crossover of patients between treatment conditions occurred. This crossover occurred significantly more in the outpatient treatment group, where patients remained in inpatient treatment longer than the intended one month stabilisation phase. As a consequence, actual time in inpatient treatment did not differ between the study groups. Post hoc analyses showed that baseline patient characteristics did not predict actual time in inpatient treatment. Due to considerable crossover of study participants, we were unable to answer our study question regarding the comparative effectiveness of inpatient versus outpatient treatment. This raises serious questions regarding the feasibility of RCTs investigating inpatient versus outpatient integrated treatment in patients with SMI and co-occurring SUD.

AB  - Evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of treating homeless mentally ill chemical abusers in community residences compared with a therapeutic community. 694 homeless mentally ill chemical abusers were randomly referred to 2 community residences or a therapeutic community. All programs were enhanced to treat persons with dual diagnoses. Ss' attrition, substance use, and psychopathology were measured at 2, 6, and 12 mo. 42% of the Ss were admitted to their assigned program and showed up for treatment, and 13% completed 12 mo or more. Clients retained at both types of program showed reductions in substance use and psychopathology, but reductions were greater at the therapeutic community. Compared with Ss in the community residences, those in the therapeutic community were more likely to be drug free, as measured by urine analysis and self-reports, and showed greater improvement in psychiatric symptoms, as measured by the Center for Epidemiological Studies—Depression Scale (L. S. Radloff, 1977) and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. Their functioning also improved, as measured by the Global Assessment of Functioning scale (J. E. Endicott et al, 1976).

AB  - There is increasing interest in the application of recovery principles in mental health services. We studied the implementation of a programme of intensive case management (ICM) emphasizing recovery principles in a community mental health service in Ireland. Eighty service attenders with severe and enduring illness characterized by significant ongoing disability were randomized into (1) a group receiving a programme of ICM and (2) a group receiving treatment as usual (TAU). Groups were compared before and after the programme for general psychopathology using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) (clinician rated) and How are You? scale (self-rated). The Functional Analysis of Care Environments (FACE) scale provided assessment of multiple functional domains. The overall group (mean age 44.5 +/- A 13.2 years; 60% male) had mean total Health of the Nation Outcome Scale (HoNOS) scale scores of 10.5 +/- A 4.6, with problems in social functioning especially prominent (mean social subscale score 5.0 +/- A 2.7). The ICM group were younger (p < 0.01) with higher baseline scores on the HoNOS social subscale and BPRS (p < 0.05). An analysis of covariance, controlling for these baseline differences, indicated greater improvement in BPRS scores (p = 0.001), How are You? scores (p = 0.02) and FACE domains for cognition, symptoms and interpersonal relationships (all p < 0.001) in the ICM group. The ICM group underwent greater changes in structured daily activities that were linked to improved BPRS scores (p = 0.01). A programme of ICM emphasizing recovery principles resulted in significant improvement across psychopathological and functional domains. Improvements were linked to enhanced engagement with structured daily activities. Recovery-oriented practices can be integrated into existing mental health services and provided alongside traditional models of care.

AB  - Work plays a significant role in how people identify themselves, and successful return to work is associated with significant psychological and rehabilitative benefits. Unfortunately, despite the many benefits of employment, Veterans who experience mild traumatic brain injury and have mental health issues often have significant difficulty getting their vocational needs met. Considering that a consistent relationship between cognitive dysfunction and difficulties with employability has been firmly established, cognitive rehabilitation may enhance engagement in vocational rehabilitation and return to work outcomes. In this pilot study, we evaluated a 12 wk cognitive rehabilitation intervention embedded within vocational rehabilitation services. Eighteen Veterans were randomly assigned to receive either the embedded cognitive rehabilitation intervention (n = 10) or a control condition offering supportive client-centered therapy that did not focus on employment or cognitive rehabilitation (n = 8); all Veterans (intervention and control groups) received vocational rehabilitation services. This pilot feasibility study demonstrated efficient implementation of an embedded cognitive rehabilitation intervention within vocational rehabilitation. The current pilot data revealed small to moderate effect sizes on employment outcomes. Given these preliminary findings, a larger outcome study is warranted.

AB  - • Individuals with social anxiety disorder (SAD) are at elevated risk for loneliness. • We examined loneliness in a randomized controlled trial of two treatments for SAD. • Individuals who received treatment were less lonely than waitlist controls. • Treatment changes in social anxiety predicted lower loneliness during follow-up. • Treatment changes in loneliness predicted lower social anxiety during follow-up. Individuals with social anxiety disorder (SAD) are at elevated risk of loneliness, yet little research has examined loneliness in this population. Cognitive-behavioral group therapy (CBGT) and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) have demonstrated efficacy in treating SAD, yet research has not examined whether they lead to reductions in loneliness. This sample comprised 108 individuals with SAD who were randomized to CBGT, MBSR, or a waitlist control (WL); WL participants were re-randomized to CBGT or MBSR following WL. Assessments were completed pre- and post-treatment, and 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month follow-up assessments. Compared to WL, individuals in CBGT and MBSR were less lonely at post-treatment; there was no difference between treatments after treatment or during follow-up. Greater reductions in social anxiety from pre- to post-treatment predicted lower levels of loneliness during follow-up. Greater reductions in loneliness from pre- to post-treatment also predicted lower levels of social anxiety during follow-up. Individuals who experience reductions in their social anxiety during treatment may also feel less lonely following treatment. Reductions in loneliness also lead to improvements in social anxiety. Future research should continue to examine the relationship between social anxiety and loneliness and how interventions for SAD may help reduce loneliness.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Yoga has several mechanisms that make it a promising treatment for depression and anxiety, including physical activity, behavioural activation, and mindfulness. Following positive outcomes from adapted CBT interventions incorporating mindfulness‐based practices, this study explored the effects of a therapeutic yoga program as an adjunct to group‐based CBT for depression or anxiety. METHODS: This was a pragmatic preference trial involving adults diagnosed with depression or anxiety in a regional primary mental healthcare service (n = 59), comparing transdiagnostic group CBT (n = 27) with transdiagnostic group CBT combined with an adjunct therapeutic yoga program (n = 32). A preference recruitment design allowed eligible participants (n = 35) to self‐select into the adjunct program. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale‐21 (DASS) was assessed at baseline, post‐intervention, and three‐months follow up. RESULTS: CBT + Yoga was an acceptable alternative to CBT alone. Significant reductions were observed in total DASS scores and the 3 subscales of the DASS for both groups, however CBT + Yoga showed significantly lower depressive and anxiety symptoms post‐intervention, compared to CBT alone. CBT + Yoga also showed sustained reductions in depressive symptoms over three‐months, and more rapid reductions in depressive symptoms, compared to CBT alone. LIMITATIONS: These findings should be considered preliminary due to the moderate sample size, with a rigorous randomised control trial necessary to definitively support the integration of yoga within mental health care to augment the benefits and uptake of transdiagnostic CBT for depression and anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Complementing other mindfulness‐based practices, therapeutic yoga shows promise as an adjunct to transdiagnostic CBT.

AB  - Recent surveys of the substance abuse patient population have shown a striking increase in the proportion of patients with a comorbid psychiatric disorder. In this study, patients with substance abuse and psychotic, anxiety/depressive, or personality disorders were compared with patients with only substance use disorders on treatment experiences and outcomes. Regardless of dual diagnosis status, patients generally improved on both substance use and social functioning outcomes after substance abuse treatment. At the 1-year follow-up, dually diagnosed patients, and patients with only substance use disorders, had comparable substance use outcomes. However, patients with major psychiatric disorders, specifically psychotic and anxiety/depressive disorders, fared worse on psychological symptoms and employment outcomes than did patients with personality disorders and only substance use disorders. Although there were some group differences on the amount of index treatment received and continuing care, the overall pattern of relationships between treatment variables and outcomes was comparable for the patient groups. In addition, there was no diagnostic group by treatment orientation matching effects, which indicated that the dual diagnosis patient groups improved as much in 12-Step as in cognitive-behavioral substance abuse programs.

AB  - Background: In connection with the National Mental Health Policy published in 2006, the Ministry of Health of Turkey began to put more focus on community-based mental health services. Accordingly, starting from 2009, Community Mental Health Centers (CMHC) have been established in many regions and districts of the country. Thus, in addition to institutionbased care already provided by outpatient and inpatient clinics in mental health hospitals and psychiatry departments of general hospitals, a community-based mental health care system is targeted [1]. CMHCs provide a comprehensive mental health service including psychoeducation, rehabilitation and home visits as well as the treatment and follow-up of psychiatric patients. In the literature, favourable outcomes of deinstitutionalisation have been mentioned, in the presence of adequate community support systems [2]. Thornicroft and Tansella emphasized a balanced approach integrating both inpatient and community mental health care [3]. Aim(s): The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of CMHC services on clinical parameters in psychotic patients. Method(s): All patients registered to Bakirkoy CMHC in 2012, having a diagnosis of psychotic disorder (including schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder and psychotic disorder not otherwise specified) and at least 5 years of illness were included in the study. Along with sociodemographic data, clinical parameters such as compliance to treatment, relapses, hospitalizations, suicidal and homicidal behaviors and functionality were investigated in a 2-year period before application to CMHC and a 2-year period of follow-up in CMHC and compared. Result(s): In a total number of 54 patients, 29 (54%) were female, 25 (46%) were male and the mean age was 49.5+/-14.8 (range: 24-79) years. The majority was single (n = 34, 63%) and unemployed (n = 45, 83%). 45 (83%) patients received individual counseling, 17 (32%) participated in group therapy and 24 (44%) in rehabilitation during this 2-year period of follow-up. Home visits were made in 33 (61%) patients. When 2-year periods before and in CMHC were compared, there was a significant difference in the rates of relapses, hospitalizations, suicidal and homicidal behaviors, compliance to treatment, depressive symptoms and insight. No significant difference was obtained in occupational functionality. Conclusion(s): The main target population of community-based mental health model consists of patients with severe mental disorders [1]. The majority of patients seen by community mental health teams has been reported to have psychotic disorders in the study of Keown et al. [4]. According to the findings of our study, treatment and follow-up of psychotic patients in CMHCs may have a positive effect on many clinical parameters. When psychiatric disorders considered as an important public health problem, community-based mental health approach may have an essential role in the solution. In order to accomplish a more comprehensive mental health service, establishment of half-way houses, sheltered homes and sheltered workplaces should also be considered.

AB  - Introduction: Four psychotherapies have been recognized as effective with scientific evidence for the treatment of BPD, but are long term techniques. It is necessary to explore new time limited psychotherapies in order to be more accessible. We have developed a specific manualized psychotherapy for BPD named Psychic Representation focused Psychotherapy (PRFP) Objectives: To assess the efficacy of the PRFP in BPD in an outpatient care setting compared to a control group receiving psychiatric treatment “as usual” in several specific symptoms and in diminishing the disability due to the illness. Methods: 60 subjects with BPD were randomized to one of the two treatment groups. The study group has received PRFP with 20 sessions on a weekly basis; the control group has received treatment “as usual”. Both groups may receive psychopharmacological treatment. The assessment is done in four time-points: at baseline, after the psychotherapy or conventional treatment (six months), and at a six and twelve month''s follow-up period. Results: Preliminary results of the first 30 patients (control group 17, experimental group 13, without significant differences, Age 18–35 years; 70% women) assessed at the baseline and at the end of the intervention (six months). Experimental group reached a statistically significant clinical improvement over the controls in all measured variables: Scales: SCL-90; Zanarini ; MDRS; Barrat; STAI anxiety state; Rosemberg self-esteem and SASS social adaptation. Conclusion: The preliminary results are encouraging and reveal that this method could be effective. This study state the interest in develop more studies about time limited psychotherapy for BPD.

AB  - Background: A number of studies indicate a link between cannabis-use and psychosis as well as more severe psychosis in those with existing psychotic disorders. There is currently insufficient evidence to decide the optimal way to treat cannabis abuse among patients with psychosis. Objectives: The major objective for the CapOpus trial is to evaluate the effects of a specialized addiction treatment program adding group treatment and motivational interviewing to treatment as usual compared with just treatment as usual. Design: The trial is designed as a randomized, parallel-group, observer-blinded clinical trial. Patients are recruited through teams for early detection of people with psychosis, community mental health centers, and assertive community treatment teams. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms, both lasting six months: [1.] specialized addiction treatment plus treatment as usual or [2.] treatment as usual. The specialized addiction treatment is manualized and consists of both individual and group-based motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy, and incorporates both the family and the case-manager of the patient. The primary outcome measurement will be amount of reduction in cannabis consumption. Other outcome measures will be improvements in psychosis symptoms, cognitive functioning, quality of life and social functioning, and cost-benefit of the treatments.

AB  - Abstract: Little is known about the effect of group therapy treatment modules on symptom change during treatment and on outcomes post-treatment. Secondary analyses of depressive symptoms collected from two group therapy studies conducted in substance use treatment settings were examined (n =132 and n =44). Change in PHQ-9 scores was modeled using longitudinal growth modeling combined with random effects modeling of session effects, with time-in-treatment interacted with module theme to test moderation. In both studies, depressive symptoms significantly decreased during the active treatment phase. Symptom reductions were not significantly moderated by module theme in the larger study. However, the smaller pilot study's results suggest that future examination of module effects is warranted, given the data are compatible with differential reductions in reported symptoms being associated with attending people-themed module sessions versus thoughts-themed sessions.

AB  - Background: Follow-up studies revealed that subjects with borderline personality disorder (BPD) present high rates of clinical remission, although psychosocial functioning often remains impaired. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a cognitive rehabilitation intervention versus a psychoeducational program on psychosocial functioning in subjects with BPD. Methods: A multicenter, randomized, and positive-controlled clinical trial was conducted. Seventy outpatients with BPD were randomized to cognitive rehabilitation or psychoeducational group interventions. Participants were evaluated after completion of the intervention period (16 weeks) and after the follow-up period (6 months). Psychosocial functioning, clinical and neuropsychological outcomes were evaluated. Results: No main effects of group or group x time were observed on functionality but a significant effect of time was found. Post-hoc analyses showed that only cognitive rehabilitation increased psychosocial functioning significantly at endpoint. Psychoeducation showed a significant enhancement of depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Cognitive rehabilitation and psychoeducational interventions appeared to show good efficacy in improving disabilities in daily life in subjects with BPD. These interventions are easily implemented in mental health settings and have the advantage of improving general functioning and clinical symptoms.

AB  - Objective: Substance use problems are common among people with schizophrenia, as are significant cognitive impairments. Because of potential shared neurobiological pathways, it is possible that cognitive remediation interventions may be associated with improvements in both substance use and cognition. This study examined the impact of cognitive remediation on alcohol and cannabis use and the cognitive correlates of changes in substance use among outpatients with schizophrenia. Methods: Individuals with schizophrenia who were receiving outpatient services at a psychiatric clinic and had moderate or higher addiction severity scores (N = 31) were randomized to 18 months of cognitive enhancement therapy (n = 22) or usual care (n = 9). Cognitive enhancement therapy is a cognitive remediation approach that integrates computer-based training in attention, memory, and problem solving with a group-based social cognition curriculum. Usual care was provided to all participants and consisted of routine psychiatric care. Primary outcomes included days of alcohol and cannabis use, assessed with the Timeline Followback method every six months and modeled using penalized quasi-likelihood growth curves. Results: Participants were on average 38.23 (SD = 13.44) years of age, had been ill for 14.19 (SD = 11.28) years, and were mostly male (n = 22, 71%), and about half were Caucasian (n = 16, 52%). Temporal patterns of substance use days were highly variable and followed nonlinear trajectories. Intent-to-treat analyses indicated that, compared to patients only receiving usual care, those receiving cognitive enhancement therapy were significantly less likely to use alcohol (OR =.22; 95% CI:.05,.90; p =.036), but not cannabis (OR = 1.89; 95% CI:.02, 142.99; p =.774) over time, and they reduced their alcohol use at significantly accelerated rates (OR = 1.02; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.03; p =.003). Changes in cognition were variably associated with substance use outcomes, although improvements in visual learning and reasoning and problem solving were both consistently related to reduced alcohol and cannabis use. Conclusions: Cognitive remediation may be effective for improving some substance use problems in schizophrenia. Visual learning and problem-solving deficits may be particularly important targets of such interventions, given their association with reduced alcohol and cannabis use. This study is registered at clinicaltrials.gov under #NCT01292577.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Developing behavioral interventions to improve functioning of older patients with schizophrenia and other chronic psychoses has the potential to significantly increase the patients' independence and quality of life. METHODS: The authors evaluated a psychosocial intervention designed to improve everyday living skills of middle‐aged and older outpatients with very chronic psychotic disorders (mean duration of illness: 21 years). Forty patients who resided in board‐and‐care facilities were randomly assigned to either a 24‐session functional adaptation skills training (FAST) group therapy program targeting problem areas identified in previous work as being problematic for this population (e.g., using public transportation) or treatment‐as‐usual. Almost all the participants also received antipsychotics. RESULTS: Compared with the patients randomized to the treatment‐as‐usual condition, FAST‐treated patients' performance on everyday living skills improved significantly immediately post‐intervention and was still significantly better at a 3‐month maintenance follow‐up period. There was no significant change in psychopathology. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that older patients with longstanding psychotic disorders may benefit from participation in this skills‐training program.

AB  - This study examines community integration among homeless adults with mental illness 6 and 12 months after random assignment to Housing First (independent apartments or congregate residence) with support services or to treatment as usual (TAU). Residence in independent apartments was associated with increased 'psychological integration' for participants with less severe needs; however, no significant improvement in 'physical integration' was observed among any of the intervention groups. Analysis of individual items on the Psychological Integration subscale revealed that, compared to TAU, participants assigned to independent apartments were more likely to endorse statements related to the emotional components of community but not statements related to neighboring. Participants assigned to the congregate residence were more likely to endorse knowing their neighbors, but not interacting with neighbors or the emotional components of community. Findings are discussed in terms of housing program as well as broader contextual factors.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Rehabilitation connects the personal relevant goals of the person to services that reduce disability and promote recovery. Achieving this goal requires the integration of medical and psychosocial models of interventions through a multidisciplinary team. In Romania the development of community alternatives to hospitalization and recovery-oriented services has been one of the main aims since 2005, as indicated by the Action Plan and Strategies of Ministry of Health. Despite that, little improvements were made, and health care is still mostly hospital based. In these problematic contexts, and drawing on previous experience of ACT interventions, an experimental case management program was implemented at Campulung Moldovenesc Community Mental Health Center in order to bridge the existent gap between hospital and community and support people with mental health problems not just improve their access to treatment services but also to improve their overall functioning and health. We have evaluated the impact of a Mental Health Program implemented Campulung Moldovenesc in comparison with standard treatment, on reducing symptoms and improving the overall level of functioning in a group of 91 participants diagnosed with depression and schizophrenia. Specifically compared with standard treatment, case management was associated with greater improvement in symptoms, fewer of hospital days, increased number of contacts between clients and professional staff, decrease of dropout rates from mental health services, greater improvement in the global and social functioning level, decreasing burden of care and increasing client and his family satisfaction with services and last, but not least, with lower total cost of care.

AB  - Background: People with psychosis have high rates of trauma, with a post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) prevalence rate of approximately 15%, which exacerbates psychotic symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations. Pilot studies have shown that trauma-focused (TF) psychological therapies can be safe and effective in such individuals. This trial, the largest to date, will evaluate the clinical effectiveness of a TF therapy integrated with cognitive behaviour therapy for psychosis (TF-CBTp) on post-traumatic stress symptoms in people with psychosis. The secondary aims are to compare groups on cost-effectiveness; ascertain whether TF-CBTp impacts on a range of other meaningful outcomes; determine whether therapy effects endure; and determine acceptability of the therapy in participants and therapists.Methods: Rater-blind, parallel arm, pragmatic randomised controlled trial comparing TF-CBTp + treatment as usual (TAU) to TAU only. Adults (N = 300) with distressing post-traumatic stress and psychosis symptoms from five mental health Trusts (60 per site) will be randomised to the two groups. Therapy will be manualised, lasting 9 months (m) with trained therapists. We will assess PTSD symptom severity (primary outcome); percentage who show loss of PTSD diagnosis and clinically significant change; psychosis symptoms; emotional well-being; substance use; suicidal ideation; psychological recovery; social functioning; health-related quality of life; service use, a total of four times: before randomisation; 4 m (mid-therapy); 9 m (end of therapy; primary end point); 24 m (15 m after end of therapy) post-randomisation. Four 3-monthly phone calls will be made between 9 m and 24 m assessment points, to collect service use over the previous 3 months. Therapy acceptability will be assessed through qualitative interviews with participants (N = 35) and therapists (N = 5-10). An internal pilot will ensure integrity of trial recruitment and outcome data, as well as therapy protocol safety and adherence. Data will be analysed following intention-to-treat principles using generalised linear mixed models and reported according to Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials-Social and Psychological Interventions Statement.Discussion: The proposed intervention has the potential to provide significant patient benefit in terms of reductions in distressing symptoms of post-traumatic stress, psychosis, and emotional problems; enable clinicians to implement trauma-focused therapy confidently in this population; and be cost-effective compared to TAU through reduced service use.Trial Registration: ISRCTN93382525 (03/08/20).

AB  - Objective: Empirical evidence has only weakly supported antidepressant treatment for patients with co-occurring depression and alcohol dependence. While some studies have demonstrated that antidepressants reduce depressive symptoms in individuals with depression and alcohol dependence, most studies have not found antidepressant treatment helpful in reducing excessive drinking in these patients. The authors provide results from a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy of combining approved medications for depression (sertraline) and alcohol dependence (naltrexone) in treating patients with both disorders. Method: A total of 170 depressed alcohol- dependent patients were randomly assigned to receive 14 weeks of treatment with sertraline (200 mg/day [N=40]), naltrexone (100 mg/day [N=49]), the combination of sertraline plus naltrexone (N=42), or double placebo (N=39) while receiving weekly cognitive-behavioral therapy. Results: The sertraline plus naltrexone combination produced a higher alcohol abstinence rate (53.7%) and demonstrated a longer delay before relapse to heavy drinking (median delay=98 days) than the naltrexone (abstinence rate: 21.3%; delay= 29 days), sertraline (abstinence rate: 27.5%; delay=23 days), and placebo (abstinence rate: 23.1%; delay=26 days) groups. The number of patients in the medication combination group not depressed by the end of treatment (83.3%) approached significance when compared with patients in the other treatment groups. The serious adverse event rate was 25.9%, with fewer reported with the medication combination (11.9%) than the other treatments. Conclusion: More depressed alcohol-dependent patients receiving the sertraline plus naltrexone combination achieved abstinence from alcohol, had delayed relapse to heavy drinking, reported fewer serious adverse events, and tended to not be depressed by the end of treatment.

AB  - <bold>Aims: </bold>There is a scarcity of clinical trials on psychological treatments for concurrent borderline personality disorder (BPD) and substance use disorder (SUD). Mentalization-based treatment (MBT) have shown efficacy in several trials on BPD. The aim of the present study was to examine the feasibility and effectiveness of MBT for concurrent BPD and SUD.<bold>Methods: </bold>Patients (n = 46) with concurrent BPD and SUD were randomized either to MBT in combination with SUD treatment (n = 24) or to SUD treatment alone (n = 22). Outcome was measured after 18 months using objective data, as well as interview and self-report measures.<bold>Results: </bold>There was no significant difference between the groups on any outcome variable. No suicide attempts occurred in the MBT group in contrast to 4 suicide attempts that occurred in the control group - a difference that did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.06). A majority of the therapists did not show sufficient MBT adherence and quality.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>MBT for patients with concurrent BPD and SD does not appear to be harmful; on the other hand, it is possibly helpful in reducing the risk involved in suicide attempts.

AB  - Objectives: Substance Use Disorders (SUDs) are increasingly prevalent among Veterans. Effective interventions for SUDs that also meet the clinical reality of open treatment groups are needed. Transcending Self Therapy: Group Integrative Cognitive Behavioral Treatment (Group TST-I-CBT) was developed to address this need. Group TST-I-CBT is a four-module, 20-session treatment designed so that a person can enter at any point in the treatment. We conducted a program evaluation of Group TST-I-CBT for veterans with SUDs. Methods: Participants were N = 68 veterans enrolled in the 28-day Substance Abuse Residential Rehabilitation Treatment Program at an urban Veterans Administration Medical Center who received either Group TST-I-CBT (N = 34) or treatment-as-usual (TAU; N = 34). Medical records were reviewed and participant treatment outcome data was retrieved. Group TST-I-CBT clients completed a knowledge and feedback form at treatment completion. Results: Compared to TAU participants, Group TST-I-CBT participants were significantly less likely to have a positive urine drug screen (UDS) during treatment (17.6% versus 0%; P =.01) and within one month post-discharge (50% versus 17.6%; P =.04). Among Group TST-I-CBT clients, Quality of Life Inventory scores significantly increased by an average of 14 points from pre- to post-treatment, t (15) = –3.31, P =.005, d = 0.83. Group TST-I-CBT clients displayed cognitive-behavioral therapy knowledge (mean correct answers ranged from 92%-100%) and rated Group TST-I-CBT as helpful, understandable, and useful (mean scores ranged from 9.3-9.6 out of 10). Conclusions: These preliminary data indicate that Group TST-I-CBT may be an effective group therapy as part of SUD treatment. A formal randomized controlled trial of Group TST-I-CBT may be warranted.

AB  - Young adults with personality disorders (PD) other than borderline are in urgent need of validated treatments to help them in managing important life transitions. Therapeutic interventions focused upon social and interpersonal difficulties may facilitate these individuals in maximizing opportunities for employment, forming stable romantic relationships, and belong to social groups. It is also important that they are offered evidence‐based, first‐line time‐limited treatments in order to maximize effectiveness and reduce costs. We developed a 16‐session programme of group‐based Metacognitive Interpersonal Therapy (MIT‐G) including psychoeducation on the main interpersonal motives, an experiential component enabling practice of awareness of mental states; and use of mentalistic knowledge for purposeful problem‐solving. We report a feasibility, acceptability, and clinical significance randomized clinical trial. Participants meeting inclusion criteria were randomized to receive MIT‐G (n = 10) or waiting list+TAU (n = 10). Dropout rate was low and session attendance high (92.19%). Participants in the MIT‐G arm had symptomatic and functional improvements consistent with large effect sizes. In the MIT‐G arm similarly large effects were noted for increased capacity to understand mental states and regulate social interactions using mentalistic knowledge. Results were sustained at follow‐up. Our findings suggest potential for applying MIT‐G in larger samples to further test its effectiveness in reducing PD‐related symptoms and problematic social functioning.

AB  - This paper describes a pilot study of the effectiveness of a specificoutpatient programme for Cluster B Personality Disorder. According tothis model, the patient is offered a pathway of two-year duration, whichincludes once a week supportive individual psychotherapy combinedwith fortnightly group psychotherapy (Dialectical BehaviouralTherapy), as well as general psychiatric management.We present the results of a prospective research study based on datacollected on a first group of six patients treated in the programme. Thesample, screened by using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IVAxis II Disorders (SCID II), for presence of a Cluster B disorder, wasevaluated at regular intervals using the Symptom Check List-90 (SCL-90), for the affective symptoms, the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, version11 (BIS-11) and the Aggression Questionnaire (AQ), for the dimensionsof Impulsiveness and Aggression. The level of disability perceived hasbeen measured by the Dissociative Disorders Interview Schedule (DISS).Finally, the referring psychiatrist filled in the Global Assessment ofFunctioning (GAF) and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). At theend of treatment improvement was found in all measures. The results,based on a limited sample, suggest that improvements in the dimensionsof impulsiveness, affectivity, degree of disability and readmission tohospital can be achieved with Cluster B patients in an outpatient settingby utilizing different concurrent psychotherapeutic approaches. This isencouraging concerning the intensive outpatient psychotherapeutictreatment with severe personality disorder.

AB  - Multiple group psychotherapy was employed as the primary treatment modality in a day-treatment program as an innovative multifaceted approach to treating adolescents comorbid for psychiatric and substance abuse diagnoses. The concurrent educational program included a high school on site. The groups included Substance Abuse Group, which promoted the 12-step model; Health Group; Psychotherapy Group; Leisure Time Group; Self-Awareness Group; and Multiple Family Group. The effect of the multiple groups was to provide a variety of experiences focusing on varied aspects of normal and dysfunctional adolescent development. Together the combination of groups served to strengthen the participants' cohesiveness, communicating skills, and hopefulness. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: The authors' goal was to com- pare the efficacy of a manualized cognitive behavior therapy that addresses both posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance abuse (seeking safety) with a manualized cognitive behavior therapy that addresses only substance abuse (relapse prevention) and with standard community care for the treatment of comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance use disorder. Method: One hundred seven women from an urban, low-income population who had comorbid PTSD and substance use disorder were randomly assigned to receive the two kinds of cognitive behavior therapy or received standard community treatment. Participants were recruited from both community and clinical populations and evaluated with structured clinical instruments. Forty-one women received seeking safety therapy, 34 received relapse prevention therapy, and 32 received standard community care. Results: At the end of 3 months of treatment, participants in both cognitive behavior therapy conditions had significant reductions in substance use, PTSD, and psychiatric symptoms, but community care participants worsened over time. Both groups receiving cognitive behavior therapy sustained greater improvement in substance use and PTSD symptoms at 6-month and 9-month follow-ups than subjects in the community care group. conclusions: Seeking safety and relapse prevention are efficacious short-term treatments for low-income urban women with PTSD, substance use disorder, and other psychiatric symptoms.

AB  - Objectives:This study examined effects of a social intervention on depressive symptoms, melancholy, loneliness, and perceived togetherness in community-dwelling Finnish older people. Method:Promotion of mental well-being in older people (GoodMood; ISRCTN78426775) was a single-blinded randomized control trial lasting 1.5 years. Two hundred and twenty-three persons aged 75–79 years reporting symptoms of loneliness or melancholy were randomized into intervention and control groups. The intervention group was allowed to choose among supervised exercise, social activity, or personal counseling. Follow-up measurements were conducted at the end of 6-month intervention, and at 3, 6, and 12 months post intervention. Results:Number of depressive symptoms remained unchanged, while loneliness and melancholy decreased in both the intervention and control groups during the study (p< 0.001). Social integration increased in the intervention group but not in controls (p= 0.041). Attachment and guidance increased in both groups (p< 0.001). Conclusion:The intervention did not alleviate depressed mood. Positive changes over time were observed in loneliness, feelings of melancholy, attachment, and guidance but these occurred independently of the intervention. Our secondary analysis suggests that the intervention increased perceived social integration. In sum, the effects of the intervention were moderate only and did not expedite further overcoming depressive mood or loneliness.

AB  - Background: In 2010, the Zentrum für seelische Gesundheit Leopoldau was established as the first institution for medical rehabilitation of mental disorders with outpatient care in Austria. Until 2013, the rehabilitation center was run as a pilot project in cooperation with the Austrian Pensionsversicherungsanstalt (Pension Insurance Institution) and thoroughly evaluated. The 6‐week multimodal rehabilitation program is based on cognitive behavioral and disorder‐specific therapy. Using a waiting list control group study design, an additional measurement of treatment efficacy will be performed. Patients and Methods: From October 2010 until December 2013, a total of 2,365 patients made use of a rehabilitation treatment und filled out questionnaire‐based surveys at 3 time points: 1) at the time of pre‐contact (screening interview) before starting rehabilitation, 2) at admission, and 3) at the time of discharge. The study includes all patients having waited between 42 and 48 days to start their rehabilitation treatment (n = 170), resulting in comparable waiting times and 6‐week treatment times for all patients included in the study. A randomized selection of 170 patients from the remaining sample (2,195 patients) was chosen as intervention group. The general symptomatology was examined applying the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), depression via the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and quality of life via the WHO Quality of Life‐BREF (WHOQOL‐BREF). Results: Significant improvements with regard to the general symptomatology, depressive symptoms, and quality of life were shown when comparing the waiting list control group and the intervention group, as well as within the intervention group. Discussion: The present study can be seen as the first controlled analysis to ascertain the effectiveness of a multimodal behavioral therapy‐based rehabilitation program. The results lead to the conclusion that this method results in a significant reduction of the symptomatology, which can be interpreted as confirmation of effectiveness.

AB  - The objectives of this study are to test the efficacy of Cognitive-Behavioral Social Skills Training (CBSST) in enhancing social function in a sample of older patients with schizophrenia, and to assess whether baseline cognition moderates response to CBSST. To address these objectives, we conducted a randomized controlled trial of 63 participants, randomized 1:1 into CBSST or Treatment-As-Usual (TAU). The setting was a community-based geriatric mental health outpatient clinic in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Data were collected at baseline, and week 18, 36 and 52, between June 2008 and May 2014. Participants were outpatients, aged 60 or older, with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and no evidence of dementia or other conditions associated with cognitive or functional impairment. The intervention was a weekly group CBSST for 36 weeks. Cognition, including executive function, was assessed at baseline. Modified total score on the Independent Living Skills Survey (ILSS) at 18, 36, and 52 weeks was the primary outcome measure. In a linear mixed model analysis, the ILSS trajectory was better in the CBSST group than the TAU group, with significantly better function at 36 (Cohen's d = 0.75) and 52 weeks (Cohen's d = 0.92). Baseline executive dysfunction moderated CBSST response, whereby participants with more severe executive dysfunction experienced the most improvement in ILSS. CBSST was efficacious in patients with late-life schizophrenia and prevented decline in social function over a one-year period. CBSST was most beneficial for patients with more severe executive dysfunction, i.e., those who needed skills training the most.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Social anxiety disorder (also called social phobia) is an anxiety disorder in which affected individuals fear the scrutiny of others. Clinical reports suggest that individuals with social anxiety disorder often use alcohol to alleviate anxiety symptoms, a practice that leads to alcohol abuse and/or dependence in approximately 20% of affected individuals. The present study investigated whether simultaneous treatment of social phobia and alcoholism, compared with treatment of alcoholism alone, improved alcohol use and social anxiety for clients with dual diagnoses of social anxiety disorder and alcohol dependence., METHODS: The design was a two-group, randomized clinical trial that used 12 weeks of individual cognitive behavioral therapy for alcoholism only (n = 44) or concurrent treatment for both alcohol and social anxiety problems (n = 49). Outcome data were collected at the end of 12 weeks of treatment and at 3 months after the end of treatment., RESULTS: Results with intent-to-treat analyses showed that both groups improved on alcohol-related outcomes and social anxiety after treatment. With baseline scores covaried, there was a significant effect of treatment group on several drinking measures. Counter to the hypothesis, the group treated for both alcohol and social anxiety problems had worse outcomes on three of the four alcohol use indices. No treatment group effects were observed on social anxiety indices., CONCLUSIONS: Implications for the staging of treatments for coexisting social phobia and alcoholism are discussed, as well as ways that modality of treatments might impact outcomes.

AB  - Thirty combat veterans with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) completed group-based exposure therapy (GBET) in three cohorts of 10 within a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care system (VA) outpatient program. GBET cohorts met twice a week, 3 hr per day, for 16 weeks. Participants made two within-group combat-related presentations and were asked to listen to recordings of these at least 10 times. The PTSD Checklist (PCL) and Beck Depression Inventory 2 (BDI-2) were administered at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 7-11-month follow-up. PTSD symptoms were significantly lower on both posttreatment assessments with a large effect size (d = .89). Moderate effects were found on depressive symptoms (d = .70) at follow-up. At follow-up, 73% of participants endorsed reliable reductions on either the PCL (<7), the BDI-2 (<8), or both. Moreover, 36% no longer met the criteria for PTSD on the PCL (<= 50) at follow-up. There was relatively high compliance with participants reporting completion of almost all assignments. A higher "dose" of reported listening to recordings of war-related presentations seems to reduce PCLs at follow-up.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Veterans and civilians with mental health disorders have a growing interest in complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), though evidence for efficacy is sparse. Patients who seek CAM range in their traditional mental healthcare utilization, from minimal to extensive, and they may face several barriers in accessing mental health services. We describe treatment seeking (TS) characteristics of women with PTSD who participated in a yoga intervention, as well as subsequent perception of PTSD symptoms and symptom management. METHODS: We conducted a pilot study of a randomized controlled trial at a VA medical center comparing a 12‐session weekly yoga intervention with control. Veteran and civilian women ages 18‐65 with PTSD or sub‐threshold PTSD were included. The intervention consisted of trauma‐sensitive yoga; controls completed weekly assessments. Demographic data included age, ethnicity, education, and veteran status. Self‐reported measures of TS at baseline included treatment history, characteristics of providers accessed, and reasons for not seeking treatment. We then assessed subsequent treatment uptake among those without prior mental healthcare at post intervention and 1‐month follow‐up. We also examined interest in treatment, perception of PTSD symptoms, and self‐efficacy around symptom management. We used Fisher exact tests to compare yoga and control groups. RESULTS: Thirty‐eight women were randomized to the yoga intervention (n=20) and assessment‐only control (n=18). Mean age was 43.3. 53 % were Caucasian, 37 % Black, and 11 % Asian or other. Over 90 % had education beyond high school. The majority of participants (76 %) completed the study. At baseline, the majority of participants reported accessing mental health care in several settings including the VA, community health clinics, and private practices. Forty‐one percent of participants had specifically engaged in PTSD treatment prior to the study. Participants reported visits to psychologists and social workers (53 %), primary care physicians (25 %), and psychiatrists (9 %). Over 50 % had seen more than one provider. Of patients without prior treatment, only 1 in 12 participants post intervention and 1 in 10 at follow‐up had met with a professional to discuss a mental health problem. However, the majority of patients in both groups expressed interest in PTSD treatment (postintervention 72 %, follow‐up 56 %). 71 % of yoga group participants, compared to 25 % of controls, noticed reduced PTSD symptoms post intervention (p=0.19); this trend was similar at follow‐up (69 % yoga vs. 18 % control, p=0.05). Yoga group participants also reported improved ability to self‐manage symptoms (Post intervention: 78 % yoga vs. 50 % control, p=0.15. Follow‐up: 92 % yoga vs. 9 % control, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Many women with PTSD participating in a yoga intervention had accessed mental health services, often from multiple providers. During the study, there was limited uptake of traditional therapy, though many treatment‐naïve participants expressed interest in PTSD treatment. Additionally, yoga group participants reported improved perception of PTSD symptoms and self‐efficacy compared to the controls. Further study is warranted into the role of CAM in conventional mental healthcare utilization.

AB  - Background: Individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) often exhibit high-risk substance use behaviors. Complementary and alternative therapies are increasingly used for mental health disorders, although evidence is sparse. Objectives: Investigate the effect of a yoga intervention on alcohol and drug abuse behaviors in women with PTSD. Secondary outcomes include changes in PTSD symptom perception and management and initiation of evidence-based therapies. Materials and Methods: The current investigation analyzed data from a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing a 12-session yoga intervention with an assessment control for women age 18 to 65 years with PTSD. The Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) and Drug Use Disorder Identification Test (DUDIT) were administered at baseline, after the intervention, and a 1-month follow-up. Linear mixed models were used to test the significance of the change in AUDIT and DUDIT scores over time. Treatment-seeking questions were compared by using Fisher exact tests. Results: The mean AUDIT and DUDIT scores decreased in the yoga group; in the control group, mean AUDIT score increased while mean DUDIT score remained stable. In the linear mixed models, the change in AUDIT and DUDIT scores over time did not differ significantly by group. Most yoga group participants reported a reduction in symptoms and improved symptom management. All participants expressed interest in psychotherapy for PTSD, although only two participants, both in the yoga group, initiated therapy. Conclusions: Results from this pilot study suggest that a specialized yoga therapy may play a role in attenuating the symptoms of PTSD, reducing risk of alcohol and drug use, and promoting interest in evidence-based psychotherapy. Further research is needed to confirm and evaluate the strength of these effects.

AB  - Abstract: Emotion processing is supposed to play an important role in psychological dysfunctions in alcohol and drug dependency disorders (DD), as well as in personality disorders (PD). The model of “Emotional Openness” (“Ouverture émotionnelle”) provides a multidimensional framework to analyze problematic patterns of emotion processing. Within this framework, it is suggested that drug- and alcohol-dependent patients as well as borderline and antisocial patients show reduced a) “cognitive/conceptual representation” of affective states; b) “emotion regulation”; and c) “expression and communication of emotion”; but d) increased “awareness of body internal indicators” of affectivity; and e) appropriate psychological treatment is supposed to improve these patterns. Drug-dependent patients with PD comorbidity (in particular borderline or antisocial) are supposed to present even stronger deficits in (a) and (b). The hypotheses are tested with the 36-item DOE questionnaire (“Dimensions of Openness to Emotional experiences”, trait version; ), assessing six main dimensions of emotion processing as represented by the subject (French and Italian version). The instrument presents satisfying reliability coefficients (mean alphas of the scales in two recent studies (N =251; N =435) vary between 0.74 and 0.82) and good factorial validity (6-factor PCA solutions with varimax rotation solutions in the two samples are highly coherent; the mean of Tucker''s congruence coefficients is 0.93). Results of two clinical studies are presented, comparing N =71 patients (21 drug-dependent without personality disorder; 30 drug-dependent with borderline or antisocial personality; 20 dependent in-patients receiving psychological therapy) with normal control subjects (N =51 matched; N =50 reference group), including one pre-post treatment comparison. Results confirm marked deficits of DD patients concerning “conceptual representation” and “emotion regulation”, as well as a reduction of “communication/expression of emotion” but an increased “awareness of body internal indicators” of affectivity. Differences of patients with a double diagnosis correspond to effect sizes of d=–1.33 for cognitive/conceptual representation of emotions and d=–1.25 for emotion regulation; differences in emotion communication and expression are also significant but less important d=–0.44. Awareness of body internal emotion indicators is increased (d=+0.27) but does not differ significantly from the control group. As supposed, patients with a double diagnosis (DD and PD) described significantly stronger deficits in conceptual representation and emotion regulation than the patients with dependency disorder only. In the second study, a group of DD patients receiving multi-component treatment, including individual and group therapeutic intervention, according to the client-centered approach, and working on emotion processing, showed marked differences from the reference group at the beginning of the treatment (d=–0.91 for cognitive/conceptual representation, d=–0.82 for emotion regulation and d=+0.46 for awareness of bodily internal indicators). As supposed, pre-post comparisons indicate improvement with change effect sizes of d=0.99 for conceptual representation, d=0.97 for emotion regulation, as well as d=0.88 for emotion communication and expression. Furthermore, the changes following treatment are highly significant and substantial, except for the awareness of internal bodily indicators, which only slightly decreased. Patients “normalize” their emotion processing following treatment, describing increased conceptual representation and emotion regulation, as well as emotion communication and expression. Results underline the importance of dysfunctional modes of emotion processing in both pathologies, and underline the validity of applying the model and the DOE instrument. They are discussed with reference to the model of alexithymia.

AB  - Comorbidity among the anxiety disorders is common and may negatively impact treatment outcome. Potentially, transdiagnostic cognitive-behavioral treatments (CBT) deal more effectively with comorbidity than standard CBT. The present study tested the effectiveness of The Unified Protocol (UP) applied to Mental Health Services. Pre-post-treatment effects were examined for psychiatric outpatients with anxiety disorders receiving UP treatment in groups. Forty-seven patients (mean-age = 34.1 (SD = 9.92), 77% females) with a principal diagnosis of anxiety were included. We found significant and clinically meaningful changes in the primary outcomes Clinical Global Impression Severity Scale (CGI-S;d= 1.36), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HARS;d =.71), and WHO-5 Well-being Index (WHO-5;d= .54). Also, comorbid depressive symptoms and levels of positive and negative affect changed significantly after treatment. Patients with high levels of comorbidity profited as much as patients with less comorbidity; however, these patients had higher scores after treatment due to higher symptom burden at onset. Patients with comorbid depression profited more from treatment than patients without comorbid depression. The treatment effects found in the present study correspond to treatment effects of other TCBT studies, other UP group studies, and effectiveness studies on standard CBT for outpatients. The results indicate that the UP can be successfully applied to a MHS group setting, demonstrating positive effects on anxiety and depressive symptoms for even highly comorbid cases.

AB  - In a MDA-funded Stage I Behavioral Therapies Development grant (1994- present) that we are now completing, our group has developed a manualized integrated relapse prevention group therapy ('Integrated Group Therapy') for patients with current comorbid substance dependence and bipolar disorder (BPD). Outcome results for Integrated Group Therapy (IGT) have been promising; patients showed significant improvement in drug use and psychiatric symptoms from baseline to the end of treatment, and from baseline to 3- month post-treatment follow-up. Moreover, in this open, non-randomized pilot study, patients in IGT had significantly fewer days of drug use at the end of treatment and at 3-month post-treatment follow-up than did a comparison group of patients who received no experimental group treatment, but had monthly assessments. The primary aim of our current competing continuation proposal is to extend the work accomplished under this previous award (DA09400) by conducting a randomized. controlled Stage lb study in 60 patients, comparing 20 weekly sessions of Integrated Group Therapy (in which both BPD and substance use disorder are addressed simultaneously) versus an equivalent amount of an active comparison treatment, namely, Group Drug Counseling; the latter treatment focuses exclusively on the patients' substance use disorder, without focusing on BPD. We plan to assess patients monthly and will compare treatment outcomes for IGT versus Group Drug Counseling (GDC) at 5 months (i.e., the end of treatment), 8 months (3-month post-treatment follow-up), and one year (7-month post-treatment follow-up). We hypothesize that patients in IGT will have better outcomes than will patients who receive GDC, as measured by (a) days of drug use and (b) BPD symptoms. We plan to use effect sizes from the proposed study to help us in preparation for a larger-scale subsequent Stage II study. Our second aim is to compare the impact of these two treatments on a number of secondary outcome measures, including treatment retention, patient satisfaction, medication compliance, overall functioning, and engagement in HIV risk behaviors.

AB  - Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the impact of a 6-session psychoeducational group (PEG) intervention for borderline personality disorder (BPD) in an underserved community-based outpatient setting. Methods: The study was conducted between July 2015 and January 2017. Of 96 outpatients who met DSM-IV criteria for BPD, the first 48 received the experimental treatment, whereas the next 48 were assigned to a wait list. All received non-intensive treatment as usual. The primary outcome measure, the Zanarini Rating Scale for DSM-IV Borderline Personality Disorder (ZAN-BPD), was administered at baseline, at the end of treatment, and 2 months after the end of treatment. Results: The PEG intervention was associated with a significant improvement on all sectors of BPD (P<.001). Improvements were greater for the PEG on all sectors except impulsivity. Benefits remained stable during 2-month follow-up. The PEG intervention had a large effect size (Cohen d=-1.16), whereas the wait list effect size was small (Cohen d=-0.18). The between-arms effect size was 0.80 after treatment and 0.90 at follow-up. With full response defined as a decrease of >= 50% from baseline in ZAN-BPD total score, 22 patients (46%) in the psychoeducation group and 3 (6%) in the wait list group were considered full responders. Conclusions: This study shows that a PEG intervention can be an effective treatment for patients with BPD. The overall cost benefits of group interventions and the the applicability of a PEG intervention to underserved patients demonstrate its potential to address significant public health needs.

AB  - Objectives Intensive outpatient programs (IOPs) have become increasingly common for treating highly distressed patients, and a burgeoning number of IOPs are based on, or informed by, dialectical behavior therapy (DBT). The goal of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of DBT in a community mental health center IOP for patients with heterogeneous diagnoses. Method Using a within-subjects design, we examined changes in depression, anxiety, mindfulness, and hope during DBT treatment in a community mental health center in the Midwestern United States. The final sample comprised 56 participants (59% female) ranging in age from 18 to 73 years, with a mean age of 36.8 years (standard deviation = 13.7). The majority of participants (80%) met criteria for a mood disorder, just over half met criteria for an anxiety disorder, and 20% met criteria for comorbid substance abuse or dependence. Over half met criteria for more than one diagnosis. Length of treatment varied based on the needs of the individual patient; treatment ranged from 2 to 16 weeks, with an average stay of 6 weeks. Results Depression and anxiety scores decreased significantly and hope scores increased significantly over the course of treatment (all p's < .001). Mindfulness scores did not increase significantly, although changes did occur in the predicted direction. In addition, the extent to which hope and mindfulness increased over the course of treatment predicted final depression and anxiety scores after controlling for baseline symptom levels. Conclusions Results suggest that this DBT-informed intervention was effective in reducing depression and anxiety and increasing hope. Because of the move away from inpatient hospitalizations over the last few decades, it is incumbent on the field to find alternative ways to treat patients in need of more acute, intensive care. Moreover, these treatments must be cost effective, as many of these patients have limited financial resources. Group therapy formats might provide an appropriate and needed bridge for this coverage gap. The results of this study suggest that a DBT-informed IOP might be an amenable treatment for this population.

AB  - Background: Anxiety disorders are the most common mental disorders in community settings, and they are associated with significant psychological distress, functional and social impairment. While cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is the most consistently efficacious psychological treatment for anxiety disorders, barriers preclude widespread implementation of CBT in primary care. Transdiagnostic group CBT (tCBT) focuses on cognitive and behavioural processes and intervention strategies common to different anxiety disorders, and could be a promising alternative to conventional CBT. This study aims to examine the effectiveness of a transdiagnostic group CBT for anxiety disorders program as a complement to treatment-as-usual (TAU) in primary mental health care. Methods/Design: The trial is a multicentre pragmatic randomized controlled trial with a pre-treatment, post-treatment, and follow-up at 4, 8 and 12-months design. Treatment and control groups. a) tCBT (12 weekly 2-h group sessions following a manualized treatment protocol); b) TAU for anxiety disorders. Inclusion criteria comprise meeting DSM-5 criteria for primary Panic Disorder, Agoraphobia, Social Anxiety Disorder and/or Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Patients are recruited in three regions in the province of Quebec, Canada. The primary outcome measures are the self-reported Beck Anxiety Inventory and the clinician-administered Anxiety and Related Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-5 (ADIS-5); secondary outcome measures include treatment responder status based on the ADIS5, and self-reported instruments for specific anxiety and depression symptoms, quality of life, functioning, and service utilisation. Statistical analysis: Intention-to-treat analysis. A mixed effects regression model will be used to account for between-and within-subject variations in the analysis of the longitudinal effects of the intervention. Discussion: This rigorous evaluation of tCBT in the real world will provide invaluable information to decision makers, health care managers, clinicians and patients regarding the effectiveness of the intervention. Widespread implementation of tCBT protocols in primary care could lead to better effectiveness, efficiency, access and equity for the large number of patients suffering from anxiety disorders that are currently not obtaining evidence-based psychotherapy.

AB  - Background: The integration of a personal recovery-oriented practice in mental health services is an emerging principle in policy planning. Self-management support (SMS) is an intervention promoting recovery that aims at educating patients on the nature of their mental disorder, improving their strategies to manage their day-to-day symptoms, fostering self-efficacy and empowerment, preventing relapse, and promoting well-being. While SMS is well established for chronic physical conditions, there is a lack of evidence to support the implementation of structured SMS programs for common mental disorders, and particularly for anxiety disorders. This study aims to examine the effectiveness of a group-based self-management support program for anxiety disorders as an add-on to treatment-as-usual in community-based care settings. Methods/design: We will conduct a multicentre pragmatic randomized controlled trial with a pre-treatment, post-treatment (4-month post-randomization), and follow-ups at 8, 12 and 24-months. Treatment and control groups: a) group self-management support (10 weekly 2.5-h group web-based sessions with 10-15 patients with two trained facilitators); b) treatment-as-usual. Participants will include adults meeting DSM-5 criteria for Panic Disorder, Agoraphobia, Social Anxiety Disorder, and/or Generalized Anxiety Disorder. The primary outcome measure will be the Beck Anxiety Inventory; secondary outcome measures will comprise self-reported instruments for anxiety and depressive symptoms, recovery, self-management, quality of life, and service utilisation. Statistical analysis: Data will be analysed based on intention-to-treat with a mixed effects regression model accounting for between and within-subject variations in the effects of the intervention. Discussion: This study will contribute to the limited knowledge base regarding the effectiveness of structured group self-management support for anxiety disorders. It is expected that changes in patients' self-management behaviour will lead to better anxiety management and, consequently, to improved patient outcomes.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders adapted for homeless women (UPHW). Eighty-one homeless women participated in this single-blinded quasi-experimental clinical trial, involving up to 12 sessions of group treatment, and 3-and 6-month follow-ups. The participants received either immediate treatment with the UPHW (n = 46) or delayed treatment, following a 12-week wait-list control period (WLC; n = 35). Primary outcomes included depression and anxiety. Secondary measures comprised positive and negative affect, psychological well-being, health perception, and social support. The UPHW resulted in significant improvement on measures of anxiety, depression and negative affect. Improvements in anxiety and depression were maintained over a 3-month follow-up period, but not at 6-month. The reliability of the clinical changes showed significant differences between UPHW and WLC for depression. Moreover, the inter-session assessment in the UPHW group showed a linear trend reduction for depression and anxiety scores along the 12 sessions. The clinical implications on the UPHW in social settings are also discussed.

AB  - <p>The effectiveness of participation in dual-focus groups (i.e., focusing on both mental health and substance use) has not been studied empirically. The study examined whether three hypothesized active ingredients of self-help (helper-therapy, reciprocal-learning, and emotional-support processes) are associated with drug/alcohol abstinence outcomes for members of a 12-step dual-focus fellowship, Double Trouble in Recovery (DTR). The study was able to control for member attitudes and behaviors at baseline, which might be related to both self-help processes and outcomes, i.e., extent of participation in DTR and traditional 12-step groups, prior drug/alcohol use, severity of psychiatric symptoms, motivation for change, stressful life events, perceived coping, self-efficacy for recovery, and social support. Members of 24 DTR groups in New York City were recruited, interviewed, and reinterviewed after 1 year. Drug/alcohol abstinence in the past year increased from 54% at baseline to 72% at follow-up. Helper-therapy and reciprocal-learning activities were associated with better abstinence outcomes, independent of other attitudes and behaviors of the members. However, emotional support was not related to outcome. We conclude that specific elements of self-help participation contribute substantially to progress in recovery for members of dual-focus groups; facilitating such self-help processes should be encouraged by clinicians and senior fellowship members.</p>

AB  - Mindfulness-based relapse prevention (MBRP) is an effective treatment for substance use disorders (SUD). However, evidence is primarily based on studies of closed groups, and few studies support flexible formats of MBRP, such as rolling groups. This non-randomized, open trial evaluated the feasibility, acceptability, dose-response relations, and mechanisms of rolling admission MBRP (Rolling MBRP) offered as part of short-term residential treatment for SUD. Rolling MBRP was developed prior to the trial through an iterative process over several years. Participants included 109 adults (46% female, 74.3% racial/ethnic minorities, mean age=36.40). Rolling MBRP was offered to all patients in the program 2x/week, and attendance was tracked. Outcomes were craving, self-efficacy, mental health, mindfulness, and self-compassion at discharge. Self-reported out-of-session mindfulness practice was examined as a mediator of attendance-outcome relations. Analyses involved multiple regression and mediation models. Feasibility was demonstrated by good attendance rates. Acceptability was demonstrated by high engagement in mindfulness practice and high satisfaction ratings. Total sessions attended did not predict outcomes at discharge. However, attending 2+ sessions (versus one or none) significantly predicted better mental health and higher mindfulness at discharge, and these effects were mediated by informal and formal mindfulness practice. Total sessions attended had significant indirect effects on craving, self-compassion, mindfulness, and mental health, via mindfulness practice. Results support the feasibility and acceptability of Rolling MBRP and suggest mindfulness practice may be a key mechanism driving effects of MBRP on other key mechanisms during the recovery process, such as decreased craving and improved mental health.

AB  - Background: First-episode psychosis intervention may improve the course and outcome of schizophrenic disorders. Aims: To describe the Danish National Schizophrenia Project and to measure the outcome of two different forms of intervention after 1 year, compared with standard treatment. Method: A prospective, longitudinal, multicentre investigation included 562 patients, consecutively referred over a 2-year period, with a first episode of psychosis. Patients were allocated to supportive psychodynamic psychotherapy as a supplement to treatment as usual, an integrated, assertive, psychosocial and educational treatment programme or treatment as usual. Results: There was a non-significant tendency towards greater improvement in social functioning in the integrated treatment group and the supportive psychodynamic psychotherapy group compared with the treatment as usual group. Significance was reached for some measures when the confounding effect of drug and alcohol misuse was included. Conclusions: Integrated treatment and supportive psychodynamic psychotherapy in addition to treatment as usual may improve outcome after 1 year of treatment for people with first-episode psychosis, compared with treatment as usual alone.

AB  - The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioural group treatment of panic disorder and agoraphobia in a clinical setting. Fifty-three patients were offered treatment and assessed before, after and at follow-up 1 1/2-2 years after treatment. The study included an informal waiting-list control group of 40 patients. The investigation group achieved better outcome on most analyses with 47.2% found to be panic-free after treatment compared with 12.5% in the control group. Treatment gains were durable with 66.7% without panic attacks at follow-up. Most patients, however, still had major psychological problems after treatment. The outcomes of cognitive-behavioural group treatment of panic disorder in this study were modest compared with most controlled studies, possibly due to an unselected patient group with a high degree of agoraphobia.

AB  - Patient treatment matching hypotheses were tested for substance users randomly assigned to a group cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT; n = 114) or a group motivational intervention (GM!; n= 116). Treatment was scheduled twice weekly for 10 weeks. Using a patient attribute by treatment interaction design with a 15-week follow-up, the study predicted that alexithymia, antisocial personality disorder (ASPD), and network support for alcohol and drug use would be associated with less substance use for CBT subjects and that hostility and lower treatment motivation would be associated with less substance use for GMI subjects. Three of the hypothesized moderators were empirically supported: alexithymia, network support for alcohol, and ASPD. Results indicate the use of assessing specific patient attributes to better inform treatment recommendations.

AB  - Background: Previous studies have indicated that persons with co-occurring mental health and substance use problems can benefit by attending dual-focus mutual aid groups. However, to date, a trial to test the efficacy of these groups has not been published.Method: This study randomly assigned 203 substance misusing clients attending a mental health or dual-diagnosis facility to either a dual-focus 12-step group (Double Trouble in Recovery; DTR) or a waiting list control group. Participants were followed for 3-6 months. The primary outcome was substance use (days used in the past 30 with saliva testing to detect under-reporting); secondary outcomes included psychiatric medication adherence, attendance at traditional (single-focus) 12-step meetings (e.g., AA/NA); and improvement in mental health and substance use problems (quality of life). Multilevel model (MLM) regression was used to analyze the nested effect of participants within 8 facilities (7 in New York City and 1 in Michigan). Regression imputation was used to adjust for drug use under-reporting.Results: At follow-up 79% of the subjects were interviewed. In intent to treat analysis, DTR subjects compared with control subjects used alcohol (p=.03) and any substances (p=.02) on fewer days. DTR compared with control subjects were also more likely to rate themselves as experiencing better mental health and fewer substance use problems (p=.001). There were no effects for DTR on drug use only, medication adherence or NA/AA attendance.Conclusion: Findings reported in previous studies on the association between exposure to DTR and reductions in substance use were partially supported in this efficacy trial.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Meaning‐Centered Group Psychotherapy (MCGP) has been demonstrated to be an effective method for improving advanced cancer patients' quality of life and reducing their depression, hopelessness, and desire for hastened death. To further understand MCGP, this study examined the mechanisms of change in MCGP on these outcomes via advanced cancer patients' changes of sense of meaning and peace in life. METHODS: The sample data were from 2 randomized control trials that compared MCGP (n = 124) to supportive group psychotherapy (n = 94). Mediation effects of treatment status on outcomes (2 months after completion of treatment) via patients' change in sense of meaning and peace (posttreatment minus pretreatment) were tested. The outcome variables used in these analyses were quality of life, depression, hopelessness, and desire for hastened death. RESULTS: Significant mediation effects via change in sense of meaning and peace on these outcomes were found. Consistent results were found using intention‐to‐treated statuses. Weaker, but still significant, mediation effects via change in sense of faith on these outcomes were also found. CONCLUSIONS: Results supported the hypotheses that improvement due to MCGP is mediated by advanced cancer patients' enhanced sense of meaning. These findings highlight the importance of interventions focused on enhancing sense of meaning, as this appears to be a viable route to improve quality of life and decrease psychological distress among patients with advanced cancer.

AB  - Background: The assertive community treatment (ACT) model for people with severe mental illness was originally designed to be provided continuously without termination. This study evaluated postdischarge changes in health status and service use associated with the time-limited provision of ACT to homeless people with severe mental illness. Method(s): Clients in the fourth annual cohort of the Access to Community Care and Effective Services and Supports (ACCESS) program (N = 1617) were assessed at entry into ACT and 3, 12, and 18 months later. Random effects models were used to compare outcomes and service use among clients who terminated ACT and clients who remained in ACT, controlling for potentially confounding factors. Result(s): Altogether, of clients who participated in follow-up, 8.7% participated for less than 3 months; 40.6%, for 3 to 10 months; 15.3%, for 11-13 months; and 35.3%, for 14 months or more. Controlling for potentially confounding factors, mental health, substance abuse, and housing outcomes did not significantly differ between clients who had been discharged at the time of follow-up as compared with those who had not. Those who had been discharged had worked significantly more days than those who had not (t1794=3.24, P<.001), and they reported significantly less outpatient health service use though there was no decline in hospital days or receipt of public support payments. Conclusion(s): Homeless clients who have severe mental illness can be selectively discharged or transferred from ACT to other services without subsequent loss of gains in mental health status, substance abuse, housing, or employment.

AB  - Background: Supported housing, integrating clinical and housing services, is a widely advocated intervention for homeless people with mental illness. In 1992, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) established the HUD-VA Supported Housing (HUD-VASH) program. Methods: Homeless veterans with psychiatric and/or substance abuse disorders or both (N = 460) were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: (1) HUD-VASH, with Section 8 vouchers (rent subsidies) and intensive case management (n = 182); (2) case management only, without special access to Section 8 vouchers (n = 90); and (3) standard VA care (n = 188) Primary outcomes were days housed and days homeless. Secondary outcomes were mental health status, community adjustment, and costs from 4 perspectives. Results: During a 3-year follow-up, HUD-VASH veterans had 16% more days housed than the case management-only group and 25% more days housed than the standard care group (P<.001 for both). The case management-only group had only 7% more days housed than the standard care group (P = .29). The HUD-VASH group also experienced 35% and 36% fewer days homeless than each of the control groups (P<.005 for both). There were no significant differences on any measures of psychiatric or substance abuse status or community adjustment, although HUD-VASH clients had larger social networks. From the societal perspective, HUD-VASH was $6200 (15%) more costly than standard care. incremental cost-effectiveness ratios suggest that HUD-VASH cost $45 more than standard care for each additional day housed (95% confidence interval, $-19 to $108). Conclusions: Supported housing for homeless people with mental illness results in superior housing outcomes than intensive case management alone or standard care and modestly increases societal costs.

AB  - Objective: This study compared the effectiveness of two interventions in reducing alcohol use, drug use, and criminal justice charges for persons with severe mental illnesses: first, a community-oriented group intervention with citizenship training and peer support that was combined with standard clinical treatment, including jail diversion services, and second, standard clinical treatment with jail diversion services alone.Methods: A total of 114 adults with serious mental illness participated in a 2 x 3 prospective longitudinal, randomized clinical trial with two levels of intervention (group and peer support for the experimental condition and standard services for the control) and three interviews (baseline, six months, and 12 months). Self-report questionnaires assessed alcohol and drug use, and program databases assessed criminal justice contacts. The authors used a mixed-models analysis to assess alcohol and drug use, repeated-measures analysis of covariance to assess criminal justice charges, and correlational analyses to assess the relation between intervention participation and outcome variables.Results: The experimental group showed significantly reduced alcohol use in comparison with the control group. Further, results showed a significant group-by-time interaction, where alcohol use decreased over time in the experimental group and increased in the control group. Drug use and criminal justice charges decreased significantly across assessment periods in both groups.Conclusions: Of the outcomes, only decreased alcohol use was attributable to the experimental intervention. Although this may be a chance finding, peer- and community-oriented group support and learning may facilitate decreased alcohol use over time.

AB  - Group interventions for persons with co-occurring disorders of serious mental illness (SMI) and alcohol or other substance use disorders may positively affect participants' substance use, criminal justice contacts, and transition to community supports and community living. We report on a group intervention with wraparound peer support that, in earlier research, has shown promise regarding these domains. We provide a detailed description and discussion of the intervention, including case vignettes. We also discuss future research on this intervention and offer recommendations for additional research in this area and with this target population.

AB  - Procrastination is defined as a voluntarily delay of an intended course of action despite expecting to be worse‐off for the delay, and is considered a persistent behavior pattern that can result in major psychological suffering. About one‐fifth of the adult population and half of the student population are presumed having substantial difficulties due to recurrent procrastination in their everyday lives. However, chronic and severe procrastinators seldom receive adequate care due to preconceptions and the lack of understanding regarding procrastination and the treatment interventions that are assumed beneficial. Cognitive‐behavioral therapy is often deemed a treatment of choice, although the evidence supporting its use is scarce, and only one randomized controlled trial has been performed. The primary aim of the proposed study is therefore to test the efficacy of cognitive‐behavioral therapy delivered as either a group intervention or via the Internet. Participants will consist of students recruited through the Student Health Centre at Karolinska Institutet. A randomized controlled trial with a sample size of 100 participants divided into blocks of thirty will be used, comparing an eight‐week Internet‐based cognitive‐behavioral therapy intervention, and an eight‐week group cognitive‐behavioral therapy based intervention. It is believed that the proposed study will result in two important findings. First, different treatment interventions in cognitive‐behavioral therapy are assumed to be helpful for people suffering from problems caused by procrastination. Second, both an Internet‐based cognitive‐behavioral therapy intervention and a group intervention are presumed suitable for administering treatment for procrastination, which is considered important as the availability of adequate care is limited, particularly among students. The proposed study will increase the knowledge regarding the efficacy of different treatments of procrastination, as well as enhance the overall comprehension of the difficulties related to dilatory behavior. © 2014.

AB  - This study examined the relationship between racial/ethnic match and treatment outcomes for 224 women who participated in a clinical trial of group treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance use disorders. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine the effect of client-therapist racial/ethnic match on outcomes. Results revealed racial/ethnic match was not significantly associated with session attendance. There was a significant three-way interaction between client race/ethnicity, baseline level of PTSD symptoms, and racial/ethnic match on PTSD outcomes. White clients, with severe PTSD symptoms at baseline, who attended treatment groups where they were matched with their therapist, had greater reductions in PTSD symptoms at follow-up than their counterparts who were racially/ethnically mismatched with their group therapist. Racial/ethnic match did not confer additional benefits for Black clients in terms of PTSD outcomes. Racial/ethnic match interacted with baseline substance use to differentially influence substance use outcomes at follow-up for all women. Clinical implications are discussed.

AB  - Objective: Supported employment has experienced immense growth as an evidence-based intervention targeting the disproportionately high rates of unemployment among individuals with psychiatric disabilities who actively want to work. However, employment services are often not available to individuals who are ambivalent about work or lack work self-efficacy. The purpose of this study was to pilot-test the efficacy of a new peer-run photography-based group intervention (Vocational Empowerment Photovoice [VEP]) designed to empower individuals with psychiatric disabilities to consider employment services and pursue work. Method: A total of 51 individuals with serious mental illnesses enrolled at a university-based recovery center, who were not employed or enrolled in any vocational services, were randomly assigned to the VEP program or to a wait-list control group. Mixed-effects regression models were used to examine the impact of the VEP program on both extrinsic (enrollment in employment services and employment rates) and intrinsic (work hope, motivation and self-efficacy, vocational identity, overall empowerment and internalized stigma) work-related outcomes. Results: Participation in the VEP program was associated with a significantly higher rate of engagement in employment services over the course of the intervention and with significantly higher overall empowerment and decrease of internalized stigma sustained through the 3-month follow-up assessment. Stronger engagement in the VEP program was associated with increased work hope, self-efficacy and sense of vocational identity. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: The study highlights the malleable nature of defeatist beliefs which prevent many individuals with mental illnesses from pursuing employment services despite their inherent interest in working.

AB  - Homeless individuals represent a disadvantaged and marginalised group who experience increased rates of physical illness as well as mental and substance use disorders. Compared to stably housed individuals, homeless adults with mental disorders use hospital emergency departments and other acute health care services at a higher frequency. Housing First integrates housing and support services in a client-centred model and has been shown to reduce acute health care among homeless populations. The present analysis is based on participants enrolled in the Vancouver At Home Study (n = 297) randomised to one of three intervention arms (Housing First in a 'congregate setting', in 'scattered site' [SS] apartments in the private rental market, or to 'treatment as usual' [TAU] where individuals continue to use existing services available to homeless adults with mental illness), and incorporates linked data from a regional database representing six urban emergency departments. Compared to TAU, significantly lower numbers of emergency visits were observed during the post-randomisation period in the SS group (adjusted rate ratio 0.55 [0.35,0.86]). Our results suggest that Housing First, particularly the SS model, produces significantly lower hospital emergency department visits among homeless adults with a mental disorder. These findings demonstrate the potential effectiveness of Housing First to reduce acute health care use among homeless individuals and have implications for future health and housing policy initiatives.

AB  - Background:People with long-term unemployment and mental health problems often find it difficult to take active steps toward help-seeking and job search and to navigate the complex system of available services. Likewise, job center staff would welcome interventions to improve the reintegration of long-term unemployed individuals with mental health problems into the labor market.Aim:To examine the efficacy of a peer-led group program that supports unemployed people with mental health problems in terms of help-seeking, job search and recovery.Methods:Based on participatory research, a four-session group program was designed and evaluated in a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 42 participants, randomized to the program (n&thinsp;=&thinsp;23) or treatment as usual (n&thinsp;=&thinsp;19). Outcomes were assessed at baseline (T0), 3&thinsp;weeks (T1), 6&thinsp;weeks (T2) and 6&thinsp;months later (T3).Results:There were no significant intervention effects on primary outcomes (job search self-efficacy and help-seeking). But compared to the control group, intervention participants showed significant improvements in depressive symptoms (p&thinsp;=&thinsp;.02) and recovery (p&thinsp;=&thinsp;.04) at T2 with medium effect sizes. There were trend-level positive program effects on self-stigma, hopelessness and secrecy.Conclusion:This pilot RCT provides initial evidence for the efficacy of a peer-led group program to improve symptoms and recovery among unemployed participants with mental health problems.

AB  - Background: Episodes of depression are the most frequent cause of disability among patients with bipolar disorder. The effectiveness and safety of standard antidepressant agents for depressive episodes associated with bipolar disorder (bipolar depression) have not been well studied. Our study was designed to determine whether adjunctive antidepressant therapy reduces symptoms of bipolar depression without increasing the risk of mania. Methods: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we randomly assigned subjects with bipolar depression to receive up to 26 weeks of treatment with a mood stabilizer plus adjunctive antidepressant therapy or a mood stabilizer plus a matching placebo, under conditions generalizable to routine clinical care. A standardized clinical monitoring form adapted from the mood-disorder modules of the Structured Clinical Interview for the <Emph EmphType="Italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,: fourth edition, was used at all follow-up visits. The primary outcome was the percentage of subjects in each treatment group meeting the criterion for a durable recovery (8 consecutive weeks of euthymia). Secondary effectiveness outcomes and rates of treatment-emergent affective switch (a switch to mania or hypomania early in the course of treatment) were also examined. Results: Forty-two of the 179 subjects (23.5%) receiving a mood stabilizer plus adjunctive antidepressant therapy had a durable recovery, as did 51 of the 187 subjects (27.3%) receiving a mood stabilizer plus a matching placebo (P=0.40). Modest nonsignificant trends favoring the group receiving a mood stabilizer plus placebo were observed across the secondary outcomes. Rates of treatment-emergent affective switch were similar in the two groups.Conclusions: The use of adjunctive, standard antidepressant medication, as compared with the use of mood stabilizers, was not associated with increased efficacy or with increased risk of treatment-emergent affective switc [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of New England Journal of Medicine is the property of New England Journal of Medicine and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

AB  - This article summarizes results from four research studies (n = 902) that examined the effectiveness of the modified therapeutic community (MTC) for clients with co-occurring disorders (most with severe mental disorders). Significantly better outcomes for MTC were found across four experimental versus control comparisons on 23.1% (12 of 52) of primary outcome measures of substance use, mental health, crime, HIV risk, employment, and housing. Study limitations included the potential for selection bias, limited measurement of program fidelity, and insufficient examination of the relationship between treatment dose and outcome. Future research should emphasize clinical trial replications, multiple outcome domains, and further development of continuing care models. Given the need for research-based approaches, the MTC warrants consideration when program and policy planners are designing programs for co-occurring disorders.

AB  - This random assignment study compared women in a prison Therapeutic Community (TC) program with those in a cognitive-behavioral intervention. Over two thirds of study subjects received a lifetime diagnosis of severe mental disorder, nearly one-half received a diagnosis of PTSD, and virtually all reported exposure to trauma. Preliminary analysis (n = 314) found significantly better six-month post-prison outcomes for the TC group on measures of mental health, criminal behavior and HIV-risk behavior. These findings suggest the short-term effectiveness of prison TC treatment for female offenders with substance use disorders, and underscore the importance of adapting treatment to address mental health.

AB  - This study, which was conducted in an outpatient substance abuse treatment program, randomly assigned clients with mental health symptoms to either a control group, which received basic program services, or an experimental group, which was configured as a modified therapeutic community (TC) track, with the addition of modified TC features and three specific elements-psychoeducational seminar, trauma-informed addictions treatment, and case management. The experimental group had significantly better outcomes as compared with the control group on measures of psychiatric severity and on the key measure of housing stability; no difference was observed for substance use, crime, and employment. The findings must be qualified because (a) only 3 of 34 representative measures (< 10%) showed significant differential treatment effects and (b) analysis revealed partial implementation of the enhancements. The study provides modest support for the effectiveness, on specific outcomes, of outpatient substance abuse treatment programs that add modified TC features and targeted interventions to strengthen their capacity to treat co-occurring disorders.

AB  - This clinical trial evaluated a modified therapeutic community aftercare (MTC-A) program for a population triply diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, a substance use disorder, and a mental disorder. After six months of MTC residential treatment (MTC-R), subjects were randomly assigned to MTC-A (n=42) or to standard aftercare (C; n=34). Follow-up interviews at six and 12 months assessed eight outcome domains and adherence to prescribed HIV medication. A propensity model was used to re-balance the retrieved sample. At the six-month follow-up, High stratum MTC-A clients (those with greater psychological functioning and stable physical health at baseline) had greater improvement overall and for substance use and mental health than C clients in the same stratum. In contrast, C clients in the Low/Medium stratum (those with poorer psychological functioning and improved physical health) had more favorable outcomes overall and for substance use than their MTC-A counterparts; however, this stratum was not re-balanced effectively. Differences in HIV medication adherence were not detected. Clients with greater psychological functioning and stable health at treatment entry benefit more from the MTC-A program. In view of the potentially progressive nature of HIV, measuring physical and mental health during treatment and controlling for changes could be important in future research. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - This article describes a randomized study to determine the effectiveness of a reentry modified therapeutic community (RMTC) for offenders with co-occurring substance use and mental disorders (co-occurring disorders or COD). Men with COD, approved for community corrections placement postrelease, were recruited from nine Colorado prisons and stratified according to the type of treatment received while incarcerated (i.e., a prison modified therapeutic community [MTC] program or standard care). When released, each offender was randomly assigned either to the experimental RMTC (E-RMTC) condition (n = 71) or to the control parole supervision and case management (PSCM) condition (n = 56). An intent-to-treat analysis 12 months postprison release showed that the E-RMTC participants were significantly less likely to be reincarcerated (19% vs. 38%), with the greatest reduction in recidivism found for participants who received MTC treatment in both settings. These findings support the RMTC as a stand-alone intervention and provide initial evidence for integrated MTC programs in prison and in aftercare for offenders with COD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This randomized controlled study of 164 outpatients with bipolar disorder in a community mental health center who received standardized psychoeducation (Life Goals Program [LGP]) or treatment as usual sought to determine whether there were differences between the groups in medication adherence attitudes and behaviors. METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to treatment as usual (N=80) or treatment as usual plus LGP (N=84) and were assessed at baseline and at the three‐, six‐, and 12‐month follow‐up. Primary outcomes were change in score from baseline on the Drug Attitude Inventory (DAI) and on self‐reported treatment adherence behaviors (SRTAB). RESULTS: At baseline, there were no significant differences between the two groups. Slightly less than half (N=41, 49%) of the LGP group participated in most or all (four to six) LGP sessions, 14% (N=12) participated in one to three sessions, and 37% (N=31) did not participate in any sessions. At the 12‐month follow‐up there was improvement among all patients, with no significant differences between the two groups, in DAI scores, SRTAB, symptoms, psychopathology, and functional status. Greater depressive severity at baseline was associated with more negative attitudes toward treatment over time, although this finding was not significant (p=.056). Secondary analysis of persons in the LGP group found that compared with those who did not go to any LGP sessions, those with partial or full participation in LGP sessions had improved attitudes toward medication at the three‐ and six‐month follow‐up, but no difference was found between the three LGP subgroups by the 12‐month follow‐up. CONCLUSIONS: There were no differences between two groups in treatment attitudes at the 12‐month follow‐up. Low attendance rates mitigated effects on primary outcomes. Effects of LGP may become lost over time without ongoing intervention, and individuals with depression may have reduced response to LGP.

AB  - Relatives of individuals with mental illness are exposed to an elevated level of burden. Consequently, it is important to provide them with coping strategies. We explored the benefits of an online skills-training intervention. This open, uncontrolled interventional pilot study included 104 relatives of individuals with a mental illness. They participated either in a face-to-face group (n = 60) or online intervention (n = 44); participants were free to choose the type of intervention. Depressive symptoms and emotion regulation were assessed before and after the interventions. The analysis was based on an intention-to-treat model. About one-third of both samples did not complete the posttest assessments. The results of a multivariate analysis of variance revealed a significant effect of the interaction between time and intervention type, F(2,101) = 11.77, p < .01. Reductions in depressive symptoms, F(1,102) = 9.41, p < .01, ε2p = .08, and emotion-regulation difficulty, F(1,102) = 8.01, p < .01, ε2p = .07, following the online intervention were greater relative to the group intervention. Despite the limitations of this study because of group differences, the results demonstrated the benefits of an online intervention for the relatives. These encouraging initial results require further confirmation using a randomized controlled trial. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: There are few studies comparing the efficacy of short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (STPP) and pharmacotherapy in major depressive disorder. We conducted a comparative study on the efficacy of STPP versus fluoxetine treatment in patients with major depressive disorder in a primary care setting. Methods: Fifty-one patients with major depressive disorder (DSM-IV) of mild or moderate severity were recruited through occupational health services providing primary health care. Patients were randomized to receive either STPP (1 session/week) or fluoxetine treatment (20-40 mg/day) for 16 weeks. The outcome measures included the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS). Results: Intent-to-treat analyses indicated that both treatments were highly effective in reducing the HDRS (p < 0.0001) and BDI (p < 0.0001) scores, as well as in improving functional ability (SOFAS; p < 0.0001), with no statistically significant differences between the treatments. Of those 40 subjects who completed the follow-up, 57% in the psychotherapy group and 68% in the fluoxetine group showed full remission (HDRS <= 7) after 4 months. Conclusions: Both STPP and pharmacological treatment with fluoxetine are effective in reducing symptoms and in improving functional ability of primary care patients with mild or moderate depression. This study suggests no marked differences in the therapeutic effects of these two treatment forms in a primary care setting. Copyright (c) 2008 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Background: The purpose of this study is to assess the relative effectiveness of Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT), Psychoeducative Group Therapy (PeGT), and treatment as usual (TAU) for patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in municipal psychiatric secondary care in one Finnish region. Methods: All adult patients (N = 1515) with MDD symptoms referred to secondary care in 2004-2006 were screened. Eligible, consenting patients were assigned randomly to 10-week IPT (N = 46), PeGT (N = 42), or TAU (N = 46) treatment arms. Antidepressant pharmacotherapy among study participants was evaluated. The Hamilton Depression Rating scale (HAM-D) was the primary outcome measure. Assessment occurred at 1, 5, 3, 6, and 12 months. Actual amount of therapists' labor was also evaluated. All statistical analyses were performed with R software. Results: All three treatment cells showed marked improvement at 12-month follow-up. At 3 months, 42 % in IPT, 61 % in PeGT, and 42 % in TAU showed a mean >= 50 % in HAM-D improvement; after 12 months, these values were 61 %, 76 %, and 68 %. Concomitant medication and limited sample size minimized between-treatment differences. Statistically significant differences emerged only between PeGT and TAU favoring PeGT. Secondary outcome measures (CGI-s and SOFAS) showed parallel results. Conclusion: All three treatments notably benefited highly comorbid MDD patients in a public sector secondary care unit.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of the study was to rigorously test Illness Management and Recovery (IMR) against an active control group in a sample that included veterans. Methods: A total of 118 participants with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, 56 of whom were veterans, were recruited from a Department of Veterans Affairs medical center and a community mental health center in the same city and were randomly assigned to an IMR group (N=60) or a weekly problem-solving group intervention (N=58). Groups met weekly for nine months. Blinded assessments were conducted at baseline, nine months, and 18 months on measures of symptoms, functioning, illness self-management, medication adherence, subjective recovery experiences, and service utilization. Results: No significant differences were found between IMR and problem-solving groups. Participants in both groups improved significantly over time in symptom severity, illness management, and quality of life and had fewer emergency department visits. Participation rates in both interventions were low. Only 28% of consumers assigned to IMR and 17% of those assigned to the problem-solving group participated in more than half the scheduled groups, and 23% and 34%, respectively, attended no sessions. Conclusions: This is the first randomized controlled trial of IMR to report negative findings. Given the inclusion of an active control group and the low participation rates, further research is needed to understand factors affecting IMR effectiveness. Increased attention may need to be paid to facilitate more active participation in IMR, such as individual follow-up with consumers and the integration of IMR with ongoing treatment.

AB  - Dually diagnosed patients with chemical dependency and a comorbid psychiatric disorder typically show poor compliance with aftercare treatment, which may result in costly and pervasive individual and societal problems. In this study, the authors investigated the effect of adding motivational interviewing in a group format to standard treatment for dually diagnosed psychiatric inpatients. The patients (n = 101) all received standard care and in addition were assigned to either group motivational interviewing (GMI) or a therapist attention activity control group (TAAC). Of patients who attended aftercare and who used alcohol or drugs, those who participated in GMI attended significantly more aftercare treatment sessions, consumed less alcohol, and engaged in less binge drinking at follow-up compared with those in TAAC. Differences between conditions in the overall percentage of participants who achieved complete abstinence or who attended aftercare treatment were not significant, possibly because of a lack of power. These results provide preliminary evidence for the efficacy of GMI when added at the outset to an inpatient program. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Background: Motivational interviewing delivered in a group format is understudied yet promising as a treatment for substance use disorders (SUD). We evaluated the efficacy of group motivational interviewing (GMI) relative to a treatment-control (TCC) for enhancing treatment and self-help engagement and decreasing alcohol and drug use among veterans with SUD and co-existing psychiatric disorders. Method(s): Veterans (n = 118) with alcohol use disorder were recruited within an outpatient SUD treatment program and randomized to GMI or TCC upon program entry. Alcohol use, SUD treatment, and 12-step session attendance were primary outcomes. Drug use days was the secondary outcome. Participants were assessed at baseline and at one-and three-month follow-up. Result(s): Significant differences were observed between GMI and TCC for binge drinking at both one (RR =.74; 95 % CI [.58,.94]) and three-month follow-up (RR =.74; 95 % CI [.59,.91]). At three-month follow-up, significant differences between treatment conditions were observed for alcohol use days (RR =.79; 95 % CI [.67,.94]), number of SUD treatment sessions (RR = 2.53; 95 % CI [1.99, 3.22]), and 12-step sessions attended (RR = 1.64; 95 % CI [1.35-1.98]). Similarly, we observed significant effects for GMI on reducing alcohol consumption in standard drinks (RR =.49; 95 % CI [.25,.95]). Drug use days declined at each follow-up, with no significant differences between treatment conditions. Conclusion(s): GMI delivered at SUD treatment program entry enhanced treatment session and 12-step group attendance and lowered alcohol consumption among outpatient Veterans. Future research should study how GMI works and its effectiveness in SUD treatment settings.Copyright © 2021

AB  - Examined the effectiveness of an activity group, structured discussion group, and control group on the social interaction skills of 25 19–64 yr olds with psychiatric disabilities. Bivariate analysis revealed that the Ss participating in the activity group demonstrated significant improvement in social skills, as compared to no significant changes found in the social skills of Ss in the structured discussion group or the control group. Findings suggest that activity groups are more conducive to improving social interaction than structured discussion groups or control groups (no treatment) for individuals with severe psychiatric disabilities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study 420 is a randomized clinical trial of 2 methods of group psychotherapy for treating posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in male Vietnam veterans. METHODS: Vietnam veterans (360 men) were randomly assigned to receive trauma‐focused group psychotherapy or a present‐centered comparison treatment that avoided trauma focus. Treatment was provided weekly to groups of 6 members for 30 weeks, followed by 5 monthly booster sessions. Severity of PTSD was the primary outcome. Additional measures were other psychiatric symptoms, functional status, quality of life, physical health, and service utilization. Follow‐up assessments were conducted at the end of treatment (7 months) and at the end of the booster sessions (12 months); 325 individuals participated in 1 or both assessments. Additional follow‐up for PTSD severity was performed in a subset of participants at 18 and 24 months. RESULTS: Although posttreatment assessments of PTSD severity and other measures were significantly improved from baseline, intention‐to‐treat analyses found no overall differences between therapy groups on any outcome. Analyses of data from participants who received an adequate dose of treatment suggested that trauma‐focused group therapy reduced avoidance and numbing and, possibly, PTSD symptoms. Dropout from treatment was higher in trauma‐focused group treatment. Average improvement was modest in both treatments, although approximately 40% of participants showed clinically significant change. CONCLUSIONS: This study did not find a treatment effect for trauma‐focused group therapy. The difference between the effectiveness and adequate dose findings suggests the possible value of methods to enhance the delivery of cognitive‐behavioral treatments in clinical practice settings.

AB  - OBJECTIVE This study examined the effect of treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) on work-related quality-of-life outcomes and the relationship between clinically significant change during treatment and work-related outcomes. Additional analyses explored whether current depression and employment status moderated the effects of treatment and clinically significant change. METHODS Participants were 218 female veterans and soldiers with current PTSD who participated in a randomized clinical trial of treatment for PTSD. They received ten weekly sessions of prolonged exposure or present-centered therapy and were assessed before and after treatment and at three- and six-month follow-ups. Outcomes were clinician-rated and self-rated occupational impairment and self-rated satisfaction with work. RESULTS Both treatment groups had improvements in occupational impairment, and the degree of improvement by the two groups was similar. There was no pre- to posttreatment change in work satisfaction. At the end of treatment, participants who no longer met diagnostic criteria for PTSD had greater improvements in all domains of work-related quality of life than participants who still had PTSD. CONCLUSIONS Although prolonged exposure resulted in better PTSD symptom outcomes than present-centered therapy in the randomized clinical trial, it did not result in better work-related quality-of-life outcomes. The improvement in occupational impairment associated with loss of diagnosis suggests the importance of continuing treatment until clinically meaningful change has been attained.

AB  - Adults with dual diagnoses of severe mental illness and substance use disorders present a unique challenge to publicly funded mental health and substance abuse treatment systems. Among adults with severe mental illness, substance use disorders are associated with greater psychiatric symptomotology, increased risk of homelessness and involvement with the criminal justice system, and a variety of other problems in living. Integrated treatment programs, that attempt to treat both disorders simultaneously, have shown promise for treating this population. This dissertation presents the results of a multi-site pilot of integrated treatment provided by publicly funded substance abuse treatment programs and community mental health centers in a large Southern state. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to examine differences between integrated treatment and standard community mental health services among 349 dually diagnosed consumers. Outcomes included substance use, retention in treatment, psychiatric symptomotology, community functioning, and stage of substance abuse treatment. In contrast to many prior studies, retention rates were quite high. Nearly 90% of clients were retained in the study for at least six months. However, the integrated and standard treatment groups did not differ significantly in terms of retention. Clients in the integrated treatment group used substances less frequently during the 30 days preceding the follow-up interview compared to those receiving standard treatment (means of 6.75 days and 10.48 days, respectively). Unfortunately, the presence of substantial missing data resulted in inadequate statistical power for testing this effect. Likewise, statistical power was insufficient for detecting differences in psychiatric symptomotolgy as measured by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Although the main treatment effect was not significant, two diagnostic predictors--the presence of a personality disorder and the presence of a psychotic disorder--were modestly associated with greater impairment in community functioning as measured by the Multnomah Community Ability Scale (MCAS). Integrated treatment was moderately superior to standard treatment in terms of clients' stage of substance abuse treatment as measured by the Substance Abuse Treatment Scale (SATS). Implications for integrated treatment and public mental health and substance abuse treatment are discussed. Treatment comparability, site variability, and analysis strategies are discussed in relation to multi-site evaluations.

AB  - AIMS: Third‐wave psychological interventions have gained relevance in mental health service provision but their application to people with psychosis is in its infancy and interventions targeting wellbeing in psychosis are scarce. This study tested the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of positive psychotherapy adapted for people with psychosis (WELLFOCUS PPT) to improve wellbeing. METHODS: WELLFOCUS PPT was tested as an 11‐week group intervention in a convenience sample of people with psychosis in a single centre randomised controlled trial (ISRCTN04199273) involving 94 people with psychosis. Patients were individually randomised in blocks to receive either WELLFOCUS PPT in addition to treatment as usual (TAU), or TAU only. Assessments took place before randomisation and after the therapy. The primary outcome was wellbeing (Warwick‐Edinburgh Mental Well‐Being Scale, WEMWBS). Secondary outcomes included symptoms (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale), depression (Short Depression‐Happiness Scale), self‐esteem, empowerment, hope, sense of coherence, savouring beliefs and functioning, as well as two alternative measures of wellbeing (the Positive Psychotherapy Inventory and Quality of Life). Intention‐to‐treat analysis was performed. This involved calculating crude changes and paired‐sample t‐tests for all variables, as well as ANCOVA and Complier Average Causal Effect (CACE) Analysis to estimate the main effect of group on all outcomes. RESULTS: The intervention and trial procedures proved feasible and well accepted. Crude changes between baseline and follow‐up showed a significant improvement in the intervention group for wellbeing according to all three concepts assessed (i.e., WEMWBS, Positive Psychotherapy Inventory and Quality of Life), as well as for symptoms, depression, hope, self‐esteem and sense of coherence. No significant changes were observed in the control group. ANCOVA showed no main effect on wellbeing according to the primary outcome scale (WEMWBS) but significant effects on symptoms (p = 0.006, ES = 0.42), depression (p = 0.03, ES = 0.38) and wellbeing according to the Positive Psychotherapy Inventory (p = 0.02, ES = 0.30). Secondary analysis adapting for therapy group further improved the results for symptom reduction (p = 0.004, ES = 0.43) and depression (p = 0.03, ES = 0.41) but did not lead to any more outcomes falling below the p = 0.05 significance level. CACE analysis showed a non‐significant positive association between the intervention and WEMWBS scores at follow‐up (b = 0.21, z = 0.9, p = 0.4). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides initial evidence on the feasibility of WELLFOCUS PPT in people with psychosis, positively affecting symptoms and depression. However, more work is needed to optimise its effectiveness. Future research might evaluate positive psychotherapy as a treatment for comorbid depression in psychosis, and consider alternative measurements of wellbeing.

AB  - The purpose of this research was to determine if group music therapy significantly affected Mexican farmworkers’ levels of depression, anxiety, and social isolation. Anxiety, depression, and social isolation have all been found in high levels in this population; however, intervention studies have not been conducted to determine which interventions could be effective in alleviating these symptoms. While significant results were not found for the music therapy group over the control group, effect sizes were promising. This research could lead the way to developing best practice interventions for Mexican farmworkers experiencing mental health issues. Limitations and suggestions for future research were also discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Context: Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is a group-based psychosocial intervention designed to enhance self-management of prodromal symptoms associated with depressive relapse. Objective: To compare rates of relapse in depressed patients in remission receiving MBCT against maintenance antidepressant pharmacotherapy, the current standard of care. Design: Patients who met remission criteria after 8 months of algorithm-informed antidepressant treatment were randomized to receive maintenance antidepressant medication, MBCT, or placebo and were followed up for 18 months. Setting: Outpatient clinics at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and St Joseph's Healthcare, Hamilton, Ontario. Participants: One hundred sixty patients aged 18 to 65 years meeting DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder with a minimum of 2 past episodes. Of these, 84 achieved remission (52.5%) and were assigned to 1 of the 3 study conditions. Interventions: Patients in remission discontinued their antidepressants and attended 8 weekly group sessions of MBCT, continued taking their therapeutic dose of anti-depressant medication, or discontinued active medication and were switched to placebo. Main Outcome Measure: Relapse was defined as a return, for at least 2 weeks, of symptoms sufficient to meet the criteria for major depression on module A of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Results: Intention-to-treat analyses showed a significant interaction between the quality of acute-phase remission and subsequent prevention of relapse in randomized patients (P=.03). Among unstable remitters (1 or more Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score >7 during remission), patients in both MBCT and maintenance treatment showed a 73% decrease in hazard compared with placebo (P=.03), whereas for stable remitters (all Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression scores >7 during remission) there were no group differences in survival. Conclusions: For depressed patients achieving stable or unstable clinical remission, MBCT offers protection against relapse/recurrence on a par with that of maintenance antidepressant pharmacotherapy. Our data also highlight the importance of maintaining at least 1 long-term active treatment in unstable remitters.

AB  - Objective: Hierarchically organized board-and-staff-run consumer-operated service programs (COSPs) are viewed as organizations that promote recovery while working in concert with community mental health agencies (CMHAs). This study's objective was to determine the effectiveness of such combined services for people with serious mental illness. Methods: A board-and-staff-run consumer-operated drop-in center and colocated CMHA provided the context for the randomized clinical trial. In a weighted sample, 139 new clients seeking help from the CMHA were randomly assigned to agency-only service or to a combination of COSP and CMHA services. Client-members were assessed at baseline and eight months on a measure of symptom severity and on four recovery-focused outcome measures: personal empowerment, self-efficacy, independent social integration, and hopelessness. All scales used have high reliability and well-established validity. Differences in outcome by service condition were evaluated with multivariate analysis of covariance via dummy variable regression. Change scores on the five outcomes were the dependent variables. The covariates for the multivariate analysis included baseline status on each outcome measure and service condition between-group demographic differences. Results: Results indicated that significant changes in three recovery-focused outcomes were associated with service condition across time: social integration (p<.001), personal empowerment (p<.006), and self-efficacy (p<.001). All changes favored the CMHA-only condition. Neither symptomology nor hopelessness differed by service condition across time. Conclusions: Hierarchically organized board-and-staff-run COSPs combined with CMHA service may be less helpful than CMHA service alone. (Psychiatric Services 62:915-921, 2011)

AB  - Exercise has diverse benefits for physical and mental health in people with mental illness; however, it is unclear how to effectively promote exercise motivation in this group. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions utilising exercise instruction or behavioural counselling with people with mental illness to improve self‐determined motivation for exercise, and physical and mental health. Participants were adults (aged 18+ years) receiving mental health services. Participants could choose from two 8‐week programs comprising weekly group‐based sessions delivered by an exercise physiologist: (a) exercise instruction in a gym (GYM) or (b) behavioural counselling (MOT). Self‐determined motivation was measured using the Behaviour Regulations for Exercise Questionnaire (BREQ3). Physical health indicators included waist circumference, blood pressure, leg strength (sit‐to‐stand test), physical capacity (six‐minute walk test) and self‐reported exercise. Mental health was assessed using the Kessler‐6 scale of psychological distress. Most of the 95 participants chose exercise instruction (GYM = 60; MOT = 35). At baseline, participants who chose MOT had higher external motivation, body mass index, waist circumference and psychological distress, and a higher proportion had multiple physical comorbidities than those who chose GYM. More self‐determined motivation was associated with meeting physical activity guidelines. Post‐intervention, GYM participants had significant improvements in self‐determined motivation, psychological distress and sit‐to‐stand test; MOT participants had significant improvements in integrated regulation, self‐reported exercise and physical functioning. In conclusion, exercise instruction can improve self‐determined motivation; however, more intensive behavioural counselling support may be needed to improve self‐determined motivation. Counselling programs can increase exercise behaviour and may appeal more to people with poorer health and more external motivation. Findings have high ecological validity and applicability to real‐world implementation of exercise interventions. To accommodate people with diverse conditions and motivations, motivational counselling should be combined with practical exercise support, and participants afforded the autonomy to decide their level of involvement.

AB  - This randomised controlled trial examined if for people with enduring mental illness, being supported to socialise leads to improved social functioning, increased self-esteem and extended social networks; a reduction in social isolation, social, emotional and family loneliness and a reduction in illness symptoms, namely depression. A prospective randomised controlled trial was undertaken from November 2007 to September 2011. Service users with a diagnosis of enduring mental illness (>18 years) were invited to participate. Participants were randomly allocated to intervention or control group conditions in a 1:1 ratio. Intervention group participants were matched with a volunteer partner, asked to engage in social/leisure activities for 2 hours weekly over a 9-month period, and received a ...20 stipend monthly. Control group participants received a ...20 monthly stipend and were asked to engage in a weekly social/leisure activity. Social functioning, the primary outcome, was measured using the Social Functioning Scale (SFS) at three time points (baseline, midpoint and endpoint). In all, 107 people completed this study. There were no significant differences between control and intervention groups at the commencement of the intervention on demographic characteristics or the main outcome measures of interest. Overall social functioning positively changed throughout the three time points from a mean of 99-7 (standard deviation (SD) = 15.1) at baseline, to a mean of 106.0 (SD = 27.0) at the endpoint for the control group, and from a mean of 100-4 (SD = 15.0) at Time 1 for the intervention group, to a mean of 104.1 (SD = 23.4) at the endpoint for the intervention group. The intervention showed no statistical differences between the control and intervention groups on primary or secondary outcome measures. The stipend and the stipend plus volunteer partner led to an increase in recreational social functioning; a decrease in levels of social loneliness, in depression and in the proportion living within a vulnerable social network.

AB  - Describes a comprehensive and integrated treatment program designed for dually diagnosed clients that is located within 1 neighborhood of a community. The 4 components of the program include a 6-mo to 1-yr dual diagnosis residential and maintenance program, a 3- to 5-yr dual diagnosis residential program, an independent sober housing program, and an outpatient aftercare and case management program. The latter provides a clinical, educational, and administrative umbrella to the 3 residential programs. The treatment approach addreses the clients' mental illnesses and addictions simultaneously and with equal importance. All clients are involved in individual outpatient psychotherapy, while self-support groups supplement their individual and group treatments. The cases of 3 men (aged 33, 34, and 45 yrs) in the program are presented. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - BACKGROUND: Change talk (CT), or client speech in favor of change, is a hypothesized mechanism of action in motivational interviewing (MI) for substance use disorders. Although group-based treatment is the primary treatment modality for the majority of clients seeking substance use treatment, limited research has examined group motivational interviewing (GMI) among this population, and no study has examined CT within GMI. Therefore, in the current study we examined both standard CT (e.g., desire, ability, reason, need) and a novel phenomenon involving CT which we termed 'relatedness,' or the synergistic exchange of CT between and among group members., METHOD: Data were utilized from an ongoing randomized controlled trial (RCT) examining the effectiveness of GMI relative to a treatment control condition (TCC) among U.S. veteran outpatients with a primary alcohol use disorder at a Veterans Affairs hospital. A subsample of participants (n = 52) from the RCT were randomly assigned to receive GMI or TCC. The majority of participants in the subsample had co-existing psychiatric (88%) and dual diagnosis drug use disorders (38%). Two of four treatment sessions were coded by trained raters for CT and relatedness., RESULTS: Analyses demonstrated that CT and relatedness occurred with greater frequency in GMI compared to TCC, with effect sizes in the large range for each difference. Results held after controlling for number of group members in treatment sessions., CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that GMI is associated with more frequent CT and relatedness than TCC, consistent with the broader literature demonstrating the influence of MI on CT.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of brief cognitive behavioral therapy for patients with acute posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) resulting from various types of psychological trauma. Method: The authors randomly assigned 143 patients with acute PTSD (irrespective of the time criterion), within 3 months after experiencing a traumatic incident, to either brief cognitive behavioral therapy (N = 79) or a waiting list comparison group (N = 64). Cognitive behavioral therapy consisted of four weekly sessions containing education, relaxation exercises, imaginal exposure, in vivo exposure, and cognitive restructuring. Main outcome measure was PTSD score measured by structured interview; secondary outcomes were anxiety and depression measured by questionnaire. Assessments took place before the intervention and 1 week and 4 months after the intervention. Results: Symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, and depression decreased in both groups over time. One week after the intervention, the cognitive behavioral therapy group had significantly fewer symptoms of PTSD than the comparison group, but this difference was smaller and no longer significant 4 months after the intervention. Similar results were found for anxiety and depression scores. Subgroup analyses showed that cognitive behavioral therapy led to significantly lower PTSD scores at 4 months in patients with baseline comorbid major depression and in patients who were included within the first month after the traumatic incident both at 1 week and at 4 months. Conclusions: Brief early cognitive behavioral therapy accelerated recovery from symptoms of acute PTSD but did not influence long-term results. Brief early cognitive behavioral therapy showed enhanced efficacy in patients with baseline comorbid depression and patients who were included within 1 month after their traumatic experience.

AB  - The purpose of this cluster‐randomized pilot effectiveness study was to compare two different group‐based educational music therapy interventions with a control condition as measured by the stage model of recovery in adults on an acute care mental health unit. Participants (N = 69) were cluster‐randomized to one of three single‐session conditions: educational lyric analysis (ELA), educational songwriting (ESW), or control. ELA and ESW conditions targeted motivations for and factors contributing to recovery. Results indicated no significant between‐group difference. However, ELA and ESW conditions tended to have slightly more favorable stage of recovery mean scores than the control condition. Generally, educational music therapy may be clinically relevant for impacting stage of recovery within the temporal parameters of a single session. As ELA and ESW conditions had similar results, the specific educational music therapy intervention did not affect results. Implications for clinical practice, limitations, and suggestions for future research are provided.

AB  - Individuals with serious mental illness (SMI) are at a high risk for abusing alcohol and illicit substances relative to the general population. This use, even in small quantities, can negatively affect mental and physical health. Group therapy is an evidence-based treatment for individuals dually diagnosed with SMI and a substance abuse disorder. The Skills for Recovery group used a recovery-oriented therapy manual for dual diagnoses and was informed by the International Association for Social Work with Groups' Standards for Social Work Practice with Groups throughout the development and implementation of the group.

AB  - This study sought to compare outcomes of a modified therapeutic community (TC) in a shelter for homeless mentally ill chemical abusers (MICA) clients, with a general shelter for veterans, with a subgroup of MICA clients. The study attempted to answer the following question: Are specialized shelter programs for homeless MICA persons more effective than general shelter programs in the area of length of stay, stabilization (i.e., medication compliance and sobriety), and housing placement? Seven hypotheses were formulated based on the research question and sub-questions. The hypotheses are summarized as follows: greater effectiveness in the modified TC would be demonstrated in the area of longer periods of sobriety, fewer days of psychiatric hospitalizations, shorter lengths of stay in a shelter; positive discharge from the shelter, medication compliance, housing placement within the first year, and housing placement. The study utilized a quasi-experimental design involving a retrospective review of closed case records that compared outcome data on length of stay, stability, and housing placement. The sample size was 140, with 70 subjects in each group. The modified TC shelter was the control group, and the general shelter served as the comparison group. Subjects were selected based on housing placement and discharge criteria from September 1, 1998-June 1, 2000 for the modified TC shelter, and from June 1, 1999-June 1, 2000 for the general shelter. Data were collected on independent (demographic) and dependent (outcome) variables. Parametric and non-parametric tests (t-test and chi-square) were the primary statistical analyses conducted. The two groups tested different by age, length of homelessness, years of education, years of work experience, veteran status, marital status, and psychiatric diagnosis. Veteran status had to be controlled because of the disparity in numbers of veterans in the general shelter (100%) and veterans in the modified TC shelter (25%). Of the seven hypotheses, three were supported statistically significant at p le; .05 with a one-tailed analysis of significance. The supported hypotheses included discharge status, overall medication compliance, and housing placement. Although four hypotheses were not supported, the fact that the modified TC shelter subjects had more deficits, and the results were parallel to the general shelter despite controlling for veteran status, the results indicated that overall, the modified TC milieu was more effective in discharge status, housing placement, and medication compliance.

AB  - This article reports on a study conducted to determine the effectiveness of a modified therapeutic community (MTC) shelter on client outcomes. The seven-study hypotheses focused on whether greater effectiveness in the MTC would be demonstrated in longer periods of sobriety, fewer days of psychiatric hospitalization, shorter lengths of stay in a shelter, positive discharge from the shelter, medication compliance, housing placement within the first year, & appropriate housing placement according to level of functioning. The study utilized a quasi-experimental design with two groups: 1) an experimental group (E) homeless persons with co-occurring disorders (COD) of substance abuse/dependence & mental illness who reside in a modified therapeutic community(N = 70); & 2) a comparison group (C) of veterans with CODs living in a general shelter(N = 70). The data collection procedures involved a retrospective review of closed case records for subjects in the facilities from September 1, 1998-June 1, 2000 for the MTC shelter, & from June 1, 1999-June 1, 2000 for the general shelter. Baseline differences between the E & C groups were found in age, length of homelessness, years of education, years of work experience, veteran status, marital status, & psychiatric diagnosis; all except for veteran status were unrelated to outcomes & were controlled in subsequent analyses. Significant difference was found on medication compliance when controlled for both groups. Overall, this study showed some promise for the MTC approach. The study also raised a question as to the contribution of veteran status to the differences between groups & to treatment of CODs. 2 Tables, 53 References. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to describe an outpatient dual-diagnosis treatment program and 1-year clinical outcome and hospital utilization data. Subjects were 118 consecutive admissions to the Seattle Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center's Dual Disorders program over the period from June 1, 1992, to August 31, 1994. Program eligibility requirements included having a current substance use disorder and an active non-substance-related major Axis I disorder (typically major depression, post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD], bipolar disorder, or schizoaffective disorder). The treatment frame involved group-based programming (including support, medications management, and psychoeducation), routine urine drug screening, and crisis interventions. Results showed that subjects averaged 1.5 non-substance-related Axis I psychiatric disorders (54% involving psychotic symptoms) and 1.8 active substance use disorders. Patients stayed engaged in treatment for a median of 217 days, with 60% of patients having no positive drug screens, and the overall sample having a 40% reduction in the number of inpatient bed days in the year after intake. Conclusions were that, for a number of patients with comorbid disorders, psychiatric stabilization and cessation of substance use can be accomplished within an outpatient treatment frame that averages two completed clinical contacts per week.

AB  - Despite significant advances in individual treatment approaches for PTSD, knowledge of group approaches has lagged behind. Much of the reason knowledge about group treatment for PTSD has been limited is due to the complexity of conducting randomized controlled trials in the group treatment context. This limited empirical knowledge is unfortunate given the frequency with which group treatment for PTSD is used in clinical settings, including the Department of Veteran Affairs. The goal of this study is to examine the efficacy of a group cognitive‐behavioral treatment (GCBT) for PTSD relative to group supportive counseling approach (i.e. group present centered treatment; GPCT). The sample consists of 196 veterans diagnosed with PTSD who are randomly assigned to either GCBT (n=98) or GPCT (n=98). Both treatments are administered by two therapists over the course of 14 sessions. Assessments take place at baseline, mid‐treatment, post‐treatment and 3‐, 6‐, and 12‐month follow‐up. The primary outcome measure is the PTSD symptom severity assessed with a semi‐structured diagnostic instrument. Given the substantial rise of veterans presenting for PTSD treatment services, identifying an efficacious group treatment approach is invaluable.

AB  - Relative to advances in the literature that have examined individual treatment approaches for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), scientific knowledge about group treatment approaches has lagged, resulting in no currently available group treatment for PTSD despite the frequency with which this format is used. Our goal was to build upon the existing literature by examining the efficacy of a group cognitive-behavioral treatment (GCBT) for PTSD relative to group present-centered treatment (GPCT). The sample consisted of 198 male veterans with PTSD who were recruited at two Department of Veteran Affairs medical centers and randomly assigned to either GCBT (n = 98) or GPCT (n = 100); both treatments were 14 sessions. Assessments occurred at baseline, midtreatment, posttreatment, and 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups. Findings indicated significant reductions in PTSD severity and PTSD diagnostic status following treatment for both GCBT, d = 0.97, and GPCT, d = 0.61. In addition, we observed significant reductions for depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and functional impairment for both group treatments as well as a reduction in the percentage of veteran participants who met diagnostic status for co-occurring major depression disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Notably, these treatment gains were maintained at 12-month follow-up. Contrary to expectations, there were no significant differences between treatment conditions. Veterans diagnosed with PTSD were successfully treated using a group approach. Consistent with a growing body of evidence, the findings also suggest GPCT is as equally efficacious as group trauma-focused treatment. The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01544088).

TRATAMIENTO GRUPAL COGNITIVO CONDUCTUAL PARA TEPT Relativo a los avances en la literatura que han examinado enfoques de tratamiento individual para el Trastorno de Estrés Postraumático (TEPT), el conocimiento científico acerca de los enfoques de tratamiento grupal se ha retrasado, resultando en que actualmente no hay ningún tratamiento de grupo disponible para TEPT, a pesar de la frecuencia con que se usa este formato. Nuestro objetivo fue construir sobre la literatura existente el examen de la eficacia de un Tratamiento Grupal Cognitivo Conductual (GCBT, por sus siglas en inglés) respecto al Tratamiento Grupal Centrado en el Presente (GPCT, por sus siglas en inglés). La muestra consistió en 198 hombres veteranos con TEPT, quienes fueron reclutados en dos centros médicos del Departamento de Asuntos de Veteranos y fueron asignados al azar a GCBT (n = 98) o GPCT (n = 100); ambos tratamientos fueron de 14 sesiones. Se realizaron evaluaciones al inicio, en la mitad del tratamiento y post‐tratamiento, además de seguimiento a los 3, 6 y 12 meses. Los hallazgos indicaron una reducción significativa en la severidad del TEPT y en el estado diagnóstico del TEPT luego del tratamiento en ambos grupos GCBT, d = 0.97 y GPCT, d = 0.61. Adicionalmente, observamos una reducción significativa en síntomas depresivos, síntomas ansiosos y deterioro funcional en ambos grupos de tratamiento, así como también una reducción en el porcentaje de veteranos participantes que presentaban diagnóstico concurrente de Trastorno Depresivo Mayor y Trastorno de Ansiedad Generalizada. Notablemente, estos beneficios del tratamiento se mantuvieron a los 12 meses de seguimiento. Contrario a lo esperado, no hubo diferencias significativas entre condiciones de tratamiento. Los veteranos diagnosticados con TEPT fueron tratados exitosamente usando un enfoque grupal. Consistente con un creciente conjunto de evidencia, los hallazgos también sugieren que GPCT es igualmente eficaz que un tratamiento grupal con enfoque en trauma. El estudio fue registrado en clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01544088).

AB  - Objective: Few interventions assist individuals with a mental illness and a co-occurring substance abuse disorder in the transition from hospitalization to outpatient treatment. This change in care is often abrupt, resulting in fragmented treatment that jeopardizes recovery. This article reports on the preliminary outcomes from a new eight- week linkage intervention entitled ‘Time-Limited Case Management (TLC)’ that integrates intensive outreach, Dual Recovery Therapy (DRT), and peer support to facilitate outpatient treatment engagement following discharge from Acute Psychiatry. Method: This eight-week naturalistic feasibility study included 59 recently hospitalized subjects with a mental illness and substance abuse disorder who were offered the new service. The individuals who agreed to receive TLC (n = 26) formed the treatment group and those who refused (n = 33) made up the comparison group. Results: The TLC service was successfully implemented into the system and improved the transition from inpatient to outpatient care. The individuals who received the TLC intervention had a higher show rate at the Day Treatment Center intake appointment, attended more days of treatment at the Day Center, had greater pharmacy refill compliance, and were less likely to he lost to follow-up at eight weeks than the comparison group. Conclusion: TLC represents a promising new approach to maintaining continuity in care following psychiatric hospitalization that may be easily implemented in other systems. We are currently in the process of developing an implementation manual and doing a large randomized controlled trial to determine whether the intervention improves substance abuse and psychiatric outcomes in addition to facilitating treatment engagement.

AB  - Study objectives were to evaluate a brief intervention designed to facilitate outpatient engagement following an inpatient psychiatric stay for individuals with mental illness and substance use. A total of 102 veterans were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: (1) Time Limited Care-Coordination (TLC), an eight-week co-occurring disorders intervention or (2) a matched attention (MA) control condition in the form of health education sessions. Both groups also received treatment as usual in inpatient and outpatient settings. Sixty-nine percent of TLC participants attended an outpatient appointment within 14 days of discharge, compared to only 33% of MA participants (P < 0.01). TLC participants were also more likely to be engaged in outpatient services at the end of the intervention period (44 vs. 22%, P < 0.01). This study provided evidence that an eight-week intervention could improve treatment engagement. Research is currently underway to examine impact of TLC intervention beyond the 8 week study period.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - This article reports the results of a low-intensity wraparound intervention, Maintaining Independence and Sobriety through Systems Integration, Outreach, and Networking (MISSION), to augment Treatment as Usual (TAU) and engage and retain homeless veterans with a co-occurring disorder (COD) in care. Using a quasi-experimental design, 333 homeless veterans were enrolled, 218 who received MISSION along with TAU and 115 who received TAU alone. Group assignment was based on MISSION treatment slot availability at time of enrollment. Compared with TAU alone, individuals receiving MISSION demonstrated greater outpatient session attendance within the 30 days before the 12-month follow up assessment and a larger decline from baseline in the number of psychiatric hospitalization nights. Individuals in the MISSION and TAU-only groups both showed statistically significant improvements in substance use and related problems at 12 months, with those in MISSION less likely to drink to intoxication and experience serious tension or anxiety. Although this study confirmed that compared with TAU alone, MISSION along with TAU is effective in augmenting usual care and engaging and retaining homeless veterans in treatment, some caution is warranted as this study did not involve random assignment. These results, however, are similar to a recent study involving a briefer version of the intervention which included random assignment. Based on these findings, MISSION is being further studied in the joint Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) - Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) program, which offers rapid housing placement and case management to aid in housing maintenance.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to replicate findings that neurocognitive capacity in schizophrenia is more predictive of acquisition of social skills than are symptoms. METHOD: Thirty‐two hospitalized patients with chronic psychotic disorders were randomly assigned to community reintegration skills training or supportive group therapy. Neurocognitive functioning was assessed before treatment, and symptoms and skill levels were measured before and after treatment. RESULTS: The skills training group showed significantly greater skill acquisition. In a regression model, skill acquisition was predicted by group membership and verbal memory capacity and not by symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: With methodological advances, the authors replicated findings regarding the importance of neurocognition in determining treatment outcome in schizophrenia.

AB  - Research suggests a link between loneliness, depression, and anxiety. Multiple studies have examined treatment programs for loneliness; however, none have examined the efficacy of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for depression and anxiety in reducing loneliness. Change in loneliness in sixty-two older adults (≥60 yrs; 65% female) who took part in a previously reported randomized controlled trial for the treatment of comorbid depression and anxiety was examined. Older adults were randomized to a 12-week group CBT or waitlist control condition. Participants who took part in CBT were followed-up three months later. Linear Mixed Model analyses indicated that after controlling for baseline cognition, depression, and anxiety, participants who completed CBT experienced a significant decrease in loneliness while the control group did not. This reduction was maintained at follow-up. CBT programs for depression and anxiety are likely to be effective at reducing loneliness. This may be due to shared underlying cognitive and behavioral mechanisms between loneliness, depression, and anxiety such as sensitivity to perceived threat and social withdrawal. Further research is needed to understand if specific loneliness interventions are more effective. CBT may be effective at reducing loneliness among older adults with depression and anxiety.

AB  - [Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 184 of Journal of Affective Disorders (see record [rid]2015-34966-012[/rid]). The authors regret that one of the institutional affiliations of the first author was omitted in the published paper. The affiliation that also should be credited is Drammen District Psychiatric Centre, Division for Mental Health and Addiction, Vestre Viken Health Trust, Norway.] Background: The study investigated the effectiveness of an Intensive Short-Term Dynamic (ISTDP) residential treatment program for patients with treatment resistant anxiety- and/or depressive disorders, with and without comorbid personality disorders. Method: A non-randomized controlled trial examined the effects of an eight week intensive residential treatment program based on principles from ISTDP. Patients (N = 60), who had repeated prior treatment failure for current mental disorder, sufficient dysfunction to warrant hospitalization, and evidencing capacity to take an intrapsychic perspective on own problems, were included. Outcome variables included measures of target complaints (depression/anxiety, social role dysfunction, and interpersonal distress), general symptom distress, and interpersonal functioning. Measures were administered throughout and after treatment. Change was assessed by multilevel growth curve modeling. Changes during and after treatment were compared to those reported by a sub-sample of wait-list controls taking treatment as usual (N = 30). Results: The treatment group evidenced significant improvements on all measures. By contrast, receiving treatment as usual while on the wait-list did not yield significant changes. Effect sizes in the treatment group were consistently large at both termination and follow-up. Fourteen months after treatment 50.0% of patients had recovered in terms of target complaints. Approximately 53.3% and 48.3%, respectively, had recovered in terms of general symptom distress and interpersonal functioning. Limitations: Limitations included a relatively small sample size, inability to discern the effectiveness of separate components of the treatment program, and lack of randomization of patients to wait-list and treatment. Conclusion: ISTDP-based residential treatment with an eight-week time-limit appears to be effective for alleviating common and severe, treatment resistant mental disorders. The treatment program was superior to receiving treatment as usual while on the wait-list. Participation in the program quickly reduced target complaints, symptoms and interpersonal problems for patients who, based on previous treatment experiences, were expected to fare poorly in treatment. Gains were consistently maintained or improved further at follow-up. Results are promising for patients with chronic debilitating problems who often do not profit from traditional psychiatric treatment. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Individuals with mental illnesses are overrepresented among the homeless. Housing First (HF) has been shown to promote positive outcomes in this population. However, key questions remain unresolved, including: how to match support services to client needs, the benefits of housing in scattered sites versus single congregate building, and the effectiveness of HF with individuals actively using substances. The present study aimed to recruit two samples of homeless mentally ill participants who differed in the complexity of their needs. Study details, including recruitment, randomization, and follow-up, are presented. Methods: Eligibility was based on homeless status and current mental disorder. Participants were classified as either moderate needs (MN) or high needs (HN). Those with MN were randomized to HF with Intensive Case Management (HF-ICM) or usual care. Those with HN were randomized to HF with Assertive Community Treatment (HF-ACT), congregate housing with support, or usual care. Participants were interviewed every 3 months for 2 years. Separate consent was sought to access administrative data. Results: Participants met eligibility for either MN (n = 200) or HN (n = 297) and were randomized accordingly. Both samples were primarily male and white. Compared to participants designated MN, HN participants had higher rates of hospitalization for psychiatric reasons prior to randomization, were younger at the time of recruitment, younger when first homeless, more likely to meet criteria for substance dependence, and less likely to have completed high school. Across all study arms, between 92% and 100% of participants were followed over 24 months post-randomization. Minimal significant differences were found between study arms following randomization. 438 participants (88%) provided consent to access administrative data. Conclusion: The study successfully recruited participants meeting criteria for homelessness and current mental disorder. Both MN and HN groups had high rates of substance dependence, suicidality, and physical illness. Randomization resulted in no meaningful detectable differences between study arms.

AB  - Abstract: Drug abstinence is difficult to achieve and maintain, especially when clients return to their pretreatment environment. Forging ties with the natural helping networks in the community, such as religious organizations, may reinforce abstinent behaviors established during treatment. This study evaluated Bridges to the Community, a supplemental component to an intensive residential treatment program. Bridges uses members of African-American churches as mentors for recovering women. This demonstration project included 118 female participants with primary cocaine dependence who received either standard treatment or Bridges plus standard treatment. Participants in both groups reduced substance use, risk-taking behaviors, depression, and increased self-esteem. Participants who received Bridges had greater treatment retention, reported 100% cocaine abstinence at follow-up, and were more satisfied with their treatment.

AB  - Context: Cognitive therapy (CT) focuses on the modification of biased information processing and dysfunctional beliefs of social anxiety disorder (SAD). Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) aims to change problematic interpersonal behavior patterns that may have an important role in the maintenance of SAD. No direct comparisons of the treatments for SAD in an outpatient setting exist. Objective: To compare the efficacy of CT, IPT, and a waiting-list control (WLC) condition. Design: Randomized controlled trial. Setting: Two academic outpatient treatment sites. Patients: Of 254 potential participants screened, 117 had a primary diagnosis of SAD and were eligible for randomization; 106 participants completed the treatment or waiting phase. Interventions: Treatment comprised 16 individual sessions of either CT or IPT and 1 booster session. Twenty weeks after randomization, posttreatment assessment was conducted and participants in the WLC received 1 of the treatments. Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome was treatment response on the Clinical Global Impression Improvement Scale as assessed by independent masked evaluators. The secondary outcome measures were independent assessor ratings using the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, and patient self-ratings of SAD symptoms. Results: At the posttreatment assessment, response rates were 65.8% for CT, 42.1% for IPT, and 7.3% for WLC. Regarding response rates and Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale scores, CT performed significantly better than did IPT, and both treatments were superior to WLC. At 1-year follow-up, the differences between CT and IPT were largely maintained, with significantly higher response rates in the CT vs the IPT group (68.4% vs 31.6%) and better outcomes on the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale. No significant treatment X site interactions were noted. Conclusions: Cognitive therapy and IPT led to considerable improvements that were maintained 1 year after treatment; CT was more efficacious than was IPT in reducing social phobia symptoms.

AB  - Background: Depression is highly prevalent within individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia, and is associated with an increased risk of suicide. There are no current evidence based treatments for low mood within this group. The specific targeting of co-morbid conditions within complex mental health problems lends itself to the development of short-term structured interventions which are relatively easy to disseminate within health services. A brief cognitive intervention based on a competitive memory theory of depression, is being evaluated in terms of its effectiveness in reducing depression within this group.Methods/Design: This is a single blind, intention-to-treat, multi-site, randomized controlled trial comparing Positive Memory Training plus Treatment as Usual with Treatment as Usual alone. Participants will be recruited from two NHS Trusts in Southern England. In order to be eligible, participants must have a DSM-V diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizo-affective disorder and exhibit at least a mild level of depression. Following baseline assessment eligible participants will be randomly allocated to either the Positive Memory Training plus Treatment as Usual group or the Treatment as Usual group. Outcome will be assessed at the end of treatment (3-months) and at 6-month and 9-month post randomization by assessors blind to group allocation. The primary outcome will be levels of depression and secondary outcomes will be severity of psychotic symptoms and cost-effectiveness. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with all participants who are allocated to the treatment group so as to explore the acceptability of the intervention.Discussion: Cognitive behaviour therapy is recommended for individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia. However, the number of sessions and length of training required to deliver this intervention has caused a limit in availability. The current trial will evaluate a short-term structured protocol which targets a co-morbid condition often considered of primary importance by service users. If successful the intervention will be an important addition to current initiatives aimed at increasing access to psychological therapies for people diagnosed with severe mental health problems.

AB  - Although most female veterans treated in specialized intensive Veterans Health Administration (VHA) posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) programs receive services in settings in which over 95% of participants are men, two programs include only women. Whether outcomes for women with PTSD are superior in women-only programs has not been evaluated. National program evaluation data on 1,357 women veterans from 57 sites were collected at program entry and 4 months after discharge. With adjustment for differences in baseline characteristics, outcomes of women in two women-only programs (n = 469) were compared with those from 55 mixed-gender programs (n = 888), using mixed models with random effect for site. The primary outcome was total PTSD symptom level, with supplementary information on PTSD assessment subscales, substance use, and other outcomes. At program entry, female veterans in women-only programs had lower scores on measures of total PTSD symptoms, p = .013, d = -0.24, and on several subscales. Adjusting for these differences, there were no significant differences between program types in terms of PTSD total score or scores on secondary measures. In women-only programs, veterans had longer lengths of stay and were rated by their clinicians to have a higher level of commitment to therapy at discharge. Thus, women-only programs did not show superior outcomes; however, compared to participants in mixed-gender programs, those in women-only programs had longer lengths of stay, higher levels of commitment to therapy, and were more likely to participate in posttreatment outcome assessments following discharge.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Group treatment is delivered in youth correctional facilities, yet groups may be iatrogenic. Few measures with demonstrated psychometric properties exist to track behaviors of individuals during groups. The authors assessed psychometrics for the Group Process-Individual Level measure (GP-IL) of group treatment., METHODS: N = 152 teens were randomized to 1 of 2 groups (10 sessions each). Adolescents, counselors, and observers rated teen behaviors at sessions 3 and 10. GP-IL assesses reinforcement for deviancy and positive behaviors, member rejection, and counselor connection and praise., RESULTS: Internal consistency and 1-month stability were demonstrated. Concurrent validity is supported by correlations with measures expected to be associated with group behavior (e.g., coping skills). Counselors and observers rated more deviancy during interactive skills-building groups versus didactic psychoeducational groups (P <= .005). Scales evidenced incremental validity., CONCLUSIONS: GP-IL offers a sound method of tracking adolescent behaviors for professionals working with groups. Counselors ratings were most reliable and valid overall.

AB  - Large studies investigating the psychosocial effects of lifestyle interventions in patients with a severe mental illness (SMI) are scarce, especially in residential patients. This large, randomized controlled, multicentre pragmatic trial assessed the psychosocial effects of a combined diet-and-exercise lifestyle intervention targeting the obesogenic environment of SMI residential patients. Twenty-nine sheltered and clinical care teams were randomized into intervention (n=15) or control (n=14) arm. Team tailored diet-and-exercise lifestyle plans were set up to change the obesogenic environment into a healthier setting, and team members were trained in supporting patients to make healthier choices. The control group received care-as-usual. The Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS), Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Health of the Nation Outcome Scales (HoNOS) and the Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life (MANSA) were assessed at baseline and after three and twelve months. Data were available for 384 intervention and 386 control patients (48.6±12.5years old, 62.7% males, 73.7% psychotic disorder). Linear mixed model analysis showed no psychosocial improvements in the intervention group compared to care-as-usual; the intervention group showed a slightly reduced quality of life (overall) and a small increase in depressive symptoms (clinical care facilities) and psychotic symptoms (sheltered facilities). This may be due to difficulties with implementation, the intervention not being specifically designed for improvements in mental well-being, or the small change approach, which may take longer to reach an effect. Further research might elucidate what type of lifestyle intervention under what circumstances positively affects psychosocial outcomes in this population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to fragmented mental, somatic, and social healthcare services, it can be hard to engage into care older patients with severe mental illness (SMI). In adult mental health care, assertive community treatment (ACT) is an organizational model of care for treating patients with SMI who are difficult to engage. So far all outcome studies of assertive community treatment have been conducted in adults. METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial design we compared the effectiveness of ACT for elderly patients with that of treatment as usual (TAU). Sixty‐two outpatients (60 years and older) with SMI who were difficult to engage in psychiatric treatment were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group (32 to ACT for elderly patients and 30 to TAU). Primary outcomes included number of patients who had a first treatment contact within 3 months, the number of dropouts (i.e. those discharged from care due to refusing care or those who unintentionally lost contact with the service over a period of at least 3 months); and patients' psychosocial functioning (HoNOS65+ scores) during 18 months follow‐up. Secondary outcomes included the number of unmet needs and mental health care use. Analyses were based on intention‐to‐treat. RESULTS: Of the 62 patients who were randomized, 26 were lost to follow‐up (10 patients in ACT for elderly patients and 16 in TAU). Relative to patients with TAU, more patients allocated to ACT had a first contact within three months (96.9 versus 66.7%; X2 (df = 1) = 9.68, p = 0.002). ACT for elderly patients also had fewer dropouts from treatment (18.8% of assertive community treatment for elderly patients versus 50% of TAU patients; X2 (df = 1) = 6.75, p = 0.009). There were no differences in the other primary and secondary outcome variables. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that ACT for elderly patients with SMI engaged patients in treatment more successfully. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NTR1620.

AB  - This study was a secondary data analysis of clinical trial data collected from 268 active duty U.S. military service members seeking cognitive processing therapy (CPT) for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at Fort Hood, Texas, related to combat operations following September 11, 2001. Our primary aim was to evaluate changes in PTSD symptom severity and alcohol misuse as a function of baseline hazardous drinking and treatment format (i.e., group or individual). At baseline and posttreatment, PTSD was assessed using the PTSD Symptom Scale–Interview Version and PTSD Checklist for DSM‐5. Hazardous drinking was categorically defined as an Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test total score of 8 or higher. Employing intent‐to‐treat, mixed‐effects regression analysis, all groups reported reduced PTSD symptom severity, Hedges' gs = −0.33 to −1.01, except, unexpectedly, nonhazardous drinkers who were randomized to group CPT, Hedges' g = −0.12. Hazardous drinkers who were randomized to individual therapy had larger reductions in PTSD symptoms than nonhazardous drinkers who were randomized to group CPT, Hedges' g = −0.25. Hazardous drinkers also reported significant reductions in alcohol misuse, regardless of treatment format, Hedges' gs = −0.78 to −0.86. This study builds upon an emerging literature suggesting that individuals with PTSD and co‐occurring alcohol use disorder can engage successfully in CPT, which appears to be an appropriate treatment for these individuals whether it is delivered individually or in a group format. However, as a portion of participants remained classified as hazardous drinkers at posttreatment, some individuals may benefit from integrated treatment.

AB  - Background and Objectives: A Stage II, two-site randomized clinical trial compared the manualized, single-gender Women's Recovery Group (WRG) to mixed-gender group therapy (Group Drug Counseling; GDC) and demonstrated efficacy. Enhanced affiliation and support in the WRG is a hypothesized mechanism of efficacy. This study sought to extend results of the previous small Stage I trial that showed the rate of supportive affiliative statements occurred more frequently in WRG than GDC.Methods: Participants (N = 158; 100 women, 58 men) were 18 years or older, substance dependent, and had used substances within the past 60 days. Women were randomized to WRG (n = 52) or GDC (n = 48). Group therapy videos were coded by two independent raters; Rater 1 coded 20% of videos (n = 74); Rater 2 coded 25% of videos coded by Rater 1 (n = 19).Results: The number of affiliative statements made in WRG was 66% higher than in GDC. Three of eight affiliative statement categories occurred more frequently in WRG than GDC: supportive, shared experience, and strategy statements.Discussion and Conclusions: This larger Stage II trial provided a greater number of group therapy tapes available for analysis. Results extended our previous findings, demonstrating both greater frequency of all affiliative statements, as well as specific categories of statements, made in single-gender WRG than mixed-gender GDC.Scientific Significance: Greater frequency of affiliative statements among group members may be one mechanism of enhanced support and efficacy in women-only WRG compared with standard mixed-gender group therapy for substance use disorders.

AB  - This paper examines outcomes 12 months post-prison release for offenders with co-occurring disorders (n = 185) randomly assigned to either a mental health control treatment (C) or a modified therapeutic community (E). Significant between-group differences were not found for mental health measures, although improvements were observed for each group. Reductions in criminal behavior were associated more with substance use than improvements in mental health symptoms, supporting the primacy of substance abuse treatment in affecting recidivism. Additional study of this population is needed to describe the relationships among diagnostic subgroups, as well as change in substance use and in mental health symptoms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The need for psychotherapy in primary health care is on the increase but individual‐based treatment is costly. The main aim of this randomised controlled trial (RCT) was to compare the effect of mindfulness‐based group therapy (MGT) with treatment as usual (TAU), mainly individual‐based cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), on a broad range of psychiatric symptoms in primary care patients diagnosed with depressive, anxiety and/or stress and adjustment disorders. An additional aim was to compare the effect of MGT with TAU on mindful attention awareness. METHODS: This 8‐week RCT took place in 2012 at 16 primary care centres in southern Sweden. The study population included both men and women, aged 20‐64years (n=215). A broad range of psychiatric symptoms were evaluated at baseline and at the 8‐week follow‐up using the Symptom Checklist‐90 (SCL‐90). Mindful attention awareness was also evaluated using the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS). RESULTS: In both groups, the scores decreased significantly for all subscales and indexes in SCL‐90, while the MAAS scores increased significantly. There were no significant differences in the change in psychiatric symptoms between the two groups. The mindfulness group had a somewhat larger change in scores than the control group on the MAAS (P=0.06, non‐significant). CONCLUSIONS: No significant differences between MGT and TAU, mainly individual‐based CBT, were found in treatment effect. Both types of therapies could be used in primary care patients with depressive, anxiety and/or stress and adjustment disorders, where MGT has a potential to save limited resources.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although mindfulness‐based group therapies (MGTs) for depressive, anxiety or stress and adjustment disorders are promising, there is a substantial lack of knowledge regarding the long‐term improvements after such therapies in these common psychiatric disorders. METHODS: Two hundred and fifteen patients were randomized in a randomized clinical trial (RCT) (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT01476371) conducted in 2012 at 16 primary healthcare centres in southern Sweden. The patients were randomized to MGT or treatment as usual (TAU) and completed four psychometric self‐rated scales after 8 weeks of treatment. Approximately 12 months after the completion of the 8‐week treatment, the same scales were repeated. Ordinal and generalized linear‐mixed models, adjusted for cluster effects, were used for the analysis. RESULTS: For all four psychometric scales (MADRS‐S [Montgomery‐Åsberg Depression Rating Scale‐S], HADS‐D, HADS‐A [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale A and D] and PHQ‐9 [Patient Health Questionnaire‐9]) the scores at the 1‐year follow‐up were significantly improved (all P values <0.001) in both groups. Furthermore, there were no significant differences between the MGT and TAU in the psychometric scores at the 1‐year follow‐up. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first RCT comparing the long‐term improvements after MGT with TAU. Although it cannot be excluded that our findings are a result of the natural course of common psychiatric disorders or other factors, they suggest a long‐term positive improvement after both MGT and TAU.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study examined a strategy to prevent homelessness among individuals with severe mental illness by providing a bridge between institutional and community care. METHODS: Ninety-six men with severe mental illness who were entering community housing from a shelter institution were randomized to receive 9 months of a 'critical time' intervention plus usual services or usual services only. The primary analysis compared the mean number of homeless nights for the two groups during the 18-month follow-up period. To elucidate time trends, survival curves were used. RESULTS: Over the 18-month follow-up period, the average number of homeless nights was 30 for the critical time intervention group and 91 for the usual services group. Survival curves showed that after the 9-month period of active intervention, the difference between the two groups did not diminish. CONCLUSIONS: Strategies that focus on a critical time of transition may contribute to the prevention of recurrent homelessness among individuals with mental illness, even after the period of active intervention.

AB  - The state of Oklahoma has the highest rate of incarceration of women in the United States, with almost twice the national average (Oklahoma Department of Corrections, 2011). Studies with incarcerated women have shown high rates of trauma exposure and substance use compared to community populations. The Oklahoma Department of Corrections (DOC) has implemented treatment programs to address these complex problems in incarcerated women. Helping Women Recover/Beyond Trauma (HWR/BT; Covington, 2003, 2008) is a manualized group treatment which addresses trauma and substance use in an integrated format specific to women. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of this comprehensive HWR/BT-based treatment program versus a matched comparison sample not attending the target treatment. Self-report measures were collected during the week before and after the 4-month treatment, and included assessments of posttraumatic stress, substance use self-efficacy, and other mental health symptoms. Baseline data was collected from 95 women, with 56 women in the final completer sample. Results indicated statistically significant pre-post and between-group differences, favoring the treatment group, for negative posttraumatic cognitions. Pre-post, but not between-group, improvements were also observed for PTSD and substance-related self-efficacy. Results indicate preliminary effectiveness for this integrated treatment program for reducing trauma- and substance-related symptoms in incarcerated women. More research is needed regarding mental health symptoms. Further investigation is also needed regarding the unique benefit of the treatment over standard prison services. Implications and future directions are discussed. Copies of dissertations may be obtained by addressing your request to ProQuest, 789 E. Eisenhower Parkway, P.O. Box 1346, Ann Arbor, MI 48106-1346.

AB  - Competitive employment is a common goal for those with severe mental illness (SMI), and evidence shows that the majority of those with SMI want to work. However, despite the desire to work competitively, those with SMI have the highest unemployment rate of any disability group (Mueser, Salyers, & Muesar, 2001). The Recovery Model is an approach to Supported Employment that has provided hope for those with mental illness, as well as challenged treatment providers to adopt a more collaborative, optimistic approach to helping clients live fulfilling, self-directed lives. To increase employment for those with SMI, effective vocational rehabilitation methods must be investigated and implemented. Only a few demographic and clinical factors correlate with future vocational outcomes, including work history, participation in an individual placement, and support vocational rehabilitation models such as Supported Employment, and self-efficacy. Despite decades of research demonstrating the advantages of Supported Employment model over traditional methods (Burns et al., 2007) the mechanisms for this success are not fully understood. In particular, any interaction between Supported Employment and self-efficacy needs to be more fully examined. This study utilized the Work-Related Self-Efficacy Scale (WSES), a psychometric tool designed specifically for the SMI population (Waghorn, Chant, & King, 2005), to investigate a possible effect of Supported Employment on self-efficacy. A treatment group of 39 participants in a Supported Employment program completed the WSES before entering the program, and after completing various stages of vocational treatment. Treatment consisted of a 10-week psycho-educational class, volunteer work and individual vocational counseling. Clients who obtained employment received 30 days of post-employment support, including benefits counseling and peer support meetings. A control group (n=19), were given the WSES at 30-day intervals. Repeated-measures of analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze the data set. Results indicated that the supported employment program participants experienced an increase in work-related self-efficacy as compared to those individuals in the control group. This study adds meaningful information to the growing research on vocational self-efficacy for persons with SMI. In addition, it supports the WSES as a method of feedback to the service-delivery system and related clinical vocational programs to target and improve treatment in order to maximize scarce vocational resources and increase vocational outcomes.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of actions intended to implement or improve patients' social network within the Italian National Health Service community mental health services. Methods: We conducted a randomized clinical trial through a network of 47 community mental health services on patients with a diagnosis in the schizophrenia spectrum (F20 in the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision), who were young (aged younger than 45 years), and with a poor social network (less than 5 relationships). In addition to routine treatments, for the experimental group, the staff identified possible areas of interest for individual patients and proposed social activities taking place outside the services' resources and with members of the community. The main outcome was an improvement in the patients' social network; secondary end points were clinical outcome, abilities of daily living, and work. Results: One- and 2-year outcomes of 345 and 327 respectively, of the 357 patients randomized were analyzed by intention-to-treat. A social network improvement was observed at year 1 in 25% of the patients allocated to routine treatment and in 39.9% of those allocated to the experimental arm (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1 3 to 3.1; adjusted OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.4 to 3.9). The difference remained statistically significant at year 2. No significant differences emerged for any of the other end points. However, patients with 1 or more other areas of improvement at year 1 and 2 showed a statistically significant social network improvement. Conclusions: The activation of social networks as an activity integrated with standard psychiatric care is practicable, without added economic and organizational costs, and appears to produce an effect persisting well beyond its implementation.

AB  - Introduction: Multiple stakeholders are increasing pressure to provide high quality outpatient care for older adults with mood disorders. Inpatient psychiatric care is expensive, and payers are scrutinizing the necessity of each inpatient day. Traditional outpatient programs that cater to people with non-commercial health insurance struggle to stay financially solvent. Unfortunately, the current intermediate levels of care such as intensive outpatient services and partial hospitalization programs present practical barriers for older adults. Those with multiple medical issues struggle to tolerate long, frequent therapy sessions, and the cost of care can be a barrier. To meet the needs of our older adults with significant impairment from mood and anxiety disorders, we designed the Bellefield Enhanced Supportive Team (BEST) in 2014. It is an ambulatory program with biweekly group therapy, weekly individual psychotherapy and frequent medication management visits. Method(s): Participants: Patients > 60 years of age with a primary diagnosis of a mood or anxiety disorder were referred from inpatient units, emergency rooms, or from traditional ambulatory clinics. Patients with primary psychotic illnesses, active substance use disorders, and those with cognitive impairment [Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) scores <20] were referred to other programs. Treatment Modality: Treatment consists of medication management, group interventions, and individual therapy visits. Group therapy is based on principles of Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy (IPSRT). Groups meet two times/week for 90 minutes each. One weekly group focuses on interpersonal issues and the other on promoting regularity of daily rhythms, although there is overlap in content and themes are reinforced. In addition, patients meet with individual therapists every week and have medication management appointments with a psychiatrist, typically about 2 times/month. Outcome(s):We assessed depressive symptoms using Quick Inventory of Depression Symptomology-Self Report (QIDS-SR) and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS).We assessed general physical and mental functioning using the Medical Outcome Survey- Short Form (SF-12). These were given to patients monthly while they were in the program. Throughout BEST, we monitored revenue and expense. Result(s): During the period from September 2014 until July 2017, 242 patients have participated in the BEST program; 35.6% (n = 87) of the sample was male. The mean age was 70.3 (range 52-92). Our presentation will include complete analyses of 242 patients.We will examine change in outcome measures (QIDS, SF-12, MOCA, and GDS) over time to better understand the functional forms of the trajectories of BEST participants (overall and by age group, gender, and diagnosis) to evaluate the effectiveness of our program.We will review the program's financial data from the period between September 2014 and July 2017. Conclusion(s): The BEST program has been providing a critically needed service to older adults with mood disorders. Preliminary data show that most patients improve while in BEST. Traditional outpatient mental health often struggles with being able to cover the costs. Using a mix of individual and group services has narrowed the gap between expenditures and expenses.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess effectiveness of the group psychoeducation program in euthymic bipolar disorder. Sixty patients with bipolar disorder followed at the Psychiatry Outpatient Clinic of Dışkapı Yıldırım Beyazıt Training and Research Hospital were enrolled into the study. The patients were randomly divided into two groups, 30 patients were followed with medical treatment while 30 patients participated in a group psychoeducation program along with medical therapy. The program consisted of sixteen weekly sessions and each session lasted 90 minutes. Hamilton Depression Scale, Young Mania Rating Scale, Bipolar Functional Scale, Global Assessment of Functioning Scale, Morisky Treatment Adherence Scale and The Scale for the Assessment of Insight scales were applied to the patients. Non-parametric Mann Whitney-U and Wilcoxon tests were used to assess effectiveness of the group psychoeducation program. There was no significant change in depression and mania scores with the administration of group psychoeducation, however, those included in group psychoeducation showed a significant increase in general functioning level, insight, and treatment adherence. In addition, psychoeducation program improved stigmatization, introversion, and daily functioning scores. Depression and mania scores were significantly higher at the 16th week compared to at baseline in the patients not applied group psychoeducation. Group psychoeducation program increased initiative and occupational functionality in this study. Group psychoeducation program increased the functionality and insight of the patients in this study. The administration of psychosocial interventions in clinical practice might improve the functionality of patients with bipolar disorder. Structured prospective studies are needed to evaluate the short and long-term effects of psychosocial interventions in bipolar disorder.

Dışkapı Yıldırım Beyazıt Eğitim ve Araştırma Hastanesi psikiyatri polikliniğinde bipolar bozukluk tanısı ile takip edilen 60 hasta çalışmaya dahil edilmiştir. Hastalar randomize olarak iki gruba ayrılmıştır, 30 hasta medikal tedavi ile takip edilirken 30 hastaya medikal tedavinin yanında grup psikoeğitimi uygulanmıştır. Psikoeğitim programı haftalık 16 seanstan oluşmuştur ve her seans 90 dakika sürmüştür. Tüm hastalara Hamilton Depresyon Derecelendirme Ölçeği (HAM-D), Young Mani Derecelendirme Ölçeği (YMRS), Bipolar Bozuklukta İşlevsellik Ölçeği (BBİ), İşlevselliğin Genel Değerlendirilmesi Ölçeği (IGD), İçgörünün Üç Bileşenini Değerlendirme Ölçeği (İÜBDÖ) ve Morisky Tedaviye Uyum Ölçeği uygulanmıştır. Grup psikoeğitim programının etkinliğini değerlendirmek için non-parametrik Mann Whitney-U ve Wilcoxon testleri kullanılmıştır. Grup psikoeğitimi uygulanan hastalarda depresyon ve mani skorlarında anlamlı bir değişiklik görülmezken işlevsellik düzeyi, içgörü ve tedaviye uyumu puanlarında anlamlı bir artış görülmüştür. Ayrıca, psikoeğitim programı sonunda damgalanma, içe dönüklük ve günlük işlevsellik puanlarında düzelme saptanmıştır. Grup psikoeğitimi uygulanmayan hastalarda depresyon ve mani puanları 16. haftadaki değerlendirmede başlangıca göre yüksek bulunmuştur. Grup psikoeğitim programı inisiyatif ve mesleki işlevsellik puanlarında artış ile ilişkili bulunmuştur. Bu çalışmada grup psikoeğitim programı bipolar hastaların işlevselliğini ve içgörü düzeyini arttırmıştır. Klinik pratikte ötimik bipolar bozukluğu olan hastalarda psikososyal müdahalelerin uygulanması hastaların günlük işlevselliğini arttırabilir. Bipolar bozuklukta psikososyal müdahalelerin kısa ve uzun süreli etkilerini değerlendirmek için yapılandırılmış prospektif çalışmalara ihtiyaç vardır.

AB  - Background Research has shown that of the myriad services available to veterans in the UK, very few have been independently evaluated. This report presents the results of a randomized controlled trial assessing the impact of Time Line Therapy™ delivered by the Warrior Programme (a third-sector organization). Aims This study was aimed to determine if the intervention is effective in reducing emotional and functional difficulties in ex-service personnel. Methods A mixed-design analysis of variance model was used to investigate whether the Warrior Programme had a statistically significant impact on self-reported scores. The intervention and control group provided data on measures prior to and immediately after the intervention, and at 3-month follow-up. Results Those in the intervention group (n = 23) reported statistically significant improvements in self-reported scores immediately following intervention: the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation (CORE) scores (CORE global distress mean difference [MD] = 45.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 31–60) (CORE subjective well-being MD = 5.9, 95% CI 3.5–8.3) (CORE functioning MD = 16.7, 95% CI 11.4–21.9) (CORE problems/symptoms MD = 19.4, 95% CI 13.1–25.7), general self-efficacy (MD = −9.8, 95% CI −13.6 to –6.8), anxiety (MD = 8.6, 95% CI 5.2–12.1), depression (MD = 10, 95% CI 6.6–13.5), post-traumatic stress disorder (MD = 26.3, 95% CI 17–25) and functional impairment (MD = 11.1, 95% CI 5.3–16.8) over time, compared to the control group (n = 29). However, score improvement was not sustained over time or statistically significant at follow-up. Conclusions The Warrior Programme was effective in reducing emotional and functional difficulties in ex-service personnel immediately after the intervention, but the effect was not sustained at 3-month follow-up.

AB  - Objective To compare outcomes of care from assertive community treatment teams with care by community mental health teams for people with serious mental illnesses. Design Non-blind randomised controlled trial. Setting Two inner London boroughs. Participants 251 men and women under the care of adult secondary mental health services with recent high use of inpatient care and difficulties engaging with community services. Interventions Treatment from assertive community treatment team (127 participants) or continuation of care from community mental health team (124 participants). Main outcome measures Primary outcome was inpatient bed use 18 months after randomisation. Secondary outcomes included symptoms, social function, client satisfaction, and engagement with services. Results No significant differences were found in inpatient bed use (median difference 1, 95% confidence interval -16 to 38) or in clinical or social outcomes for the two treatment groups. Clients who received care from the assertive community treatment team seemed better engaged (adapted homeless engagement acceptance schedule: difference in means 1.1, 1.0 to 1.9), and those who agreed to be interviewed were more satisfied with services (adapted client satisfaction questionnaire: difference in means 7.14, 0.9 to 13.4). Conclusions Community mental health teams are able to support people with serious mental illnesses as effectively as assertive community treatment teams, but assertive community treatment may be better at engaging clients and may lead to greater satisfaction with services.

AB  - Objective: A quasi-experimental study tested the effectiveness of the Trauma Recovery and Empowerment Model (TREM), a group intervention for women trauma survivors, in comparison to services as usual. Methods: Two hundred fifty-one women with histories of physical and/or sexual abuse and co-occurring serious mental illnesses and substance use disorders completed comprehensive study assessments at baseline and at 6 and 12 months. TREM groups were added to standard services at two community mental health agencies in Washington, DC (n = 153). Comparison group participants received usual services at two agencies in Baltimore, MD (n = 98). Results: TREM participants showed greater reductions in alcohol and drug abuse severity, anxiety symptoms, and current stressful events, and they showed greater increases in perceived personal safety. There were no group differences in change for posttraumatic stress disorder and global mental health symptoms, physical and mental health-related quality of life, and exposure to interpersonal abuse. Changes in trauma recovery skills were associated positively with gains in study outcomes for TREM group participants. Conclusions: Despite design limitations, this study provides preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of the TREM intervention for a heterogeneous population of women trauma survivors with co-occurring disorders when added to usual services.

AB  - This study examined whether acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) enhances treatment as usual (TAU) in improving treatment outcomes in patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and comorbid affective disorder. Fifty-two participants were included in the study, of whom 26 were patients with AUD and either depression or bipolar disorder treated with ACT group therapy in parallel with TAU (inpatient integrated treatment) and 26 were matched controls who had received TAU alone. Drinking and craving outcomes were total alcohol abstinence, cumulative abstinence duration (CAD) and Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS) scores at 3 and 6 months postintervention. Affective and anxiety outcomes were Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) scores at these follow-ups. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were similar in both groups. Retention rates were high: 100% of the ACT group were followed up at 3 and 6 months; 92.3% and 84.6% of the TAU alone group were followed up at 3 and 6 months, respectively. Patients in the ACT group reported significantly higher CAD at 3 and 6 months, significantly lower BDI and BAI scores at 3 and 6 months, and significantly lower OCDS scores at 3 months, than those who received only TAU. No other significant differences in treatment outcomes were found between the groups. ACT provides added benefit to TAU in improving drinking, craving, depression and anxiety outcomes in patients with AUD and comorbid affective disorder. Most treatment improvements were sustained over a 6-month follow-up period.

AB  - The present study was conducted to test the hypothesis that socially phobic alcoholics treated with Cognitive Behavioral therapy (CBT) will have better drinking outcomes than those treated with Twelve-Step Facilitation therapy (TSF). Three hundred ninety-seven treatment-seeking alcoholics with concurrent social phobia were compared retrospectively to a matched sample of 397 alcoholics without social phobia. Treatment was delivered in an outpatient setting, and patients were randomized to either CBT, TSF, or Motivational Enhancement therapy (MET). The groups were compared on self-reported drinking measures (e.g., quantity and frequency of drinking, and time-to-event measures) during treatment period and monthly for 1 year following treatment. Survival analyses revealed that female outpatients with social phobia showed delayed relapse to drinking when treated with CBT rather than TSF; the reverse was true for female outpatients without social phobia. Survival analyses in male outpatients with and without social phobia revealed an opposite trend, though it was not statistically significant. These data suggest that cognitive Behavioral therapy is superior to Twelve-Step Facilitation therapy for the treatment of alcohol problems in specific populations, namely socially phobic women seeking outpatient treatment.

AB  - Objective: This study investigated whether different alcoholism treatment approaches differentially impact social support scores in individuals with concurrent alcohol dependence and social phobia. Method: Individuals (N = 397) were selected retrospectively from a larger pool of participants enrolled in a multisite randomized clinical trial on treatment matching. Three standard treatments were delivered over 12 weeks: Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Twelve Step Facilitation Therapy (TSF), and Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET). Social support measures were analyzed to test the effects of treatment group and gender. Results: For men, there was significant improvement on two measures of social support regardless of treatment group. Women who received CBT or TSF had better support outcomes than women who received MET. Conclusions: These data suggest that social support can be improved through alcohol treatment in individuals with coexisting social phobia, particularly if social workers emphasize skills training and facilitating involvement in 12-step groups.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Antisocial personality disorder often co-exists with drug and alcohol use disorders., METHODS: This trial examined the effectiveness of offering psycho-education for antisocial personality disorder in community substance use disorder treatment centers in Denmark. A total of 176 patients were randomly allocated to treatment as usual (TAU, n = 80) or TAU plus a psycho-educative program, Impulsive Lifestyle Counselling (ILC, n = 96) delivered by site clinicians (n = 39). Using follow-up interviews 3 and 9 months after randomization, we examined changes in drug and alcohol use (Addiction Severity Index Composite Scores), percent days abstinent (PDA) within last month, and aggression as measured with the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire-Short Form and the Self-Report of Aggression and Social Behavior Measure., RESULTS: Overall engagement in psychological interventions was modest: 71 (76 %) of participants randomized to psycho-education attended at least one counselling session, and 21 (23 %) attended all six sessions. The Median number of sessions was 2. All patients reduced drug and alcohol problems at 9 months with small within-group effect sizes. Intention-to-treat analyses indicated significant differences between ILC and TAU in mean drugs composite score (p = .018) and in PDA (p = .041) at 3 months. Aggression declined in both groups, but no differences between ILC and TAU were observed in terms of alcohol problems or aggression at any follow-up., CONCLUSIONS: Moderate short-term improvements in substance use were associated with randomization to Impulsive Lifestyle Counselling. The findings support the usefulness of providing psycho-education to outpatients with antisocial personality disorder., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN registry, ISRCTN67266318 , 17/7/2012.

AB  - Patients with antisocial personality disorder in outpatient treatment for substance use disorders are at high risk of drop-out. Using a randomized design, this study tested the impact of adding a brief psycho-educational program, the Impulsive Lifestyle Counseling program, to outpatient substance abuse treatment in order to prevent treatment dropout. Patients (N=175) were recruited from 13 municipal treatment centers in Denmark, and assigned to treatment as usual or to the experimental condition. In all, 172 patients could be included in the analyses. In the intent-to-treat analysis, the risk of treatment dropout was reduced among patients randomized to the experimental program (hazard ratio=0.63, p=.031), after controlling for age, gender, and substitution treatment status. The study supported the efficacy of the Impulsive Lifestyle Counseling program as a method for preventing treatment dropout for patients with comorbid antisocial personality disorder in substance abuse treatment.

AB  - This study examined the potential differential benefits for patients with co-occurring psychiatric and substance use disorders (SUDs) entering treatment at one of three types of treatment programs: dual-diagnosis, SUD, and psychiatric treatment programs. This quasiexperimental study compared 6-month substance use and psychiatric symptom outcomes of 257 adults with co-occurring substance use and psychiatric disorders who had sought treatment at one of four outpatient treatment programs that used group treatment as the main treatment modality: a dual diagnosis, a psychiatric, or one of two SUD treatment programs. At treatment initiation, patients received a structured diagnostic interview and a survey assessing SUD and psychiatric symptoms; the survey was readministered 6 months later. Multiple and logistic regression analyses examined patient SUD and psychiatric outcome indicators to compare potential benefits of initiating treatment at a dual-diagnosis treatment program. At treatment entry, patients who entered the dual-diagnosis treatment program had a lower rate of abstinence for both alcohol and illicit drug use and had a higher rate of suicide attempt in the past 30 days than patients who entered SUD or psychiatric treatment programs. At 6-month follow-up, controlling for differences at treatment initiation, patients who initiated treatment at the dual-diagnosis treatment program no longer had a lower rate of abstinence for both alcohol and illicit drug use as compared with patients who entered SUD or psychiatric treatment programs; however, among subgroups of patients who continued to use substances, patients who initiated treatment at the dual-diagnosis treatment program had more days of heavy alcohol use and more days of illicit drug use. In addition, patients who initiated treatment at the dual-diagnosis treatment program were no longer characterized by a higher suicide attempt rate. There may be advantages for patients with co-occurring disorders to enter a dual-diagnosis treatment program rather than initiating treatment at an SUD or psychiatric program, especially in regard to managing suicidal behavior. Future studies are necessary to identify patient subgroups that might benefit most from initiating treatment at programs with a dual-diagnosis focus and to explore the key characteristics of effective dual-diagnosis programs. Furthermore, it may be important for dual-diagnosis treatment programs to monitor patient outcomes and focus resources on treating SUD issues among nonabstainers.

AB  - Background: This study implemented and evaluated procedures to help clinicians effectively refer dually diagnosed (substance use and psychiatric disorders) patients to dual-focused mutual-help groups (DFGs). Methods: Using a cohort cyclical turnover design, individuals with dual diagnoses beginning a new outpatient mental health treatment episode (N=287) entered a standard- or an intensive-referral condition. Participants provided self-reports of 12-step mutual-help (DFG and substance-focused group [SFG]) attendance and involvement and substance use and psychiatric symptoms at baseline and six-month follow-up. The intensive referral intervention focused on encouraging patients to attend DFG meetings. Results: Compared to patients in the standard condition, those in the intensive referral intervention were more likely to attend and be involved in DFGs and SFGs, and had less drug use and better psychiatric outcomes at follow-up. Attending more intensive-referral sessions was associated with more DFG and SFG meeting attendance. More need fulfillment in DFGs, and more readiness to participate in SFGs, were associated with better alcohol and psychiatric outcomes at six months. However, only 23% of patients in the intensive-referral group attended a DFG meeting during the six-month follow-up period. Conclusions: The intensive referral intervention enhanced participation in both DFGs and SFGs and was associated with better six-month outcomes. The findings suggest that intensive referral to mutual-help groups focus on its key components (e.g., linking patients to 12-step volunteers) rather than type of group.

AB  - Aims Many people who are homeless with severe mental illnesses are high users of healthcare services and social services, without reducing widen health inequalities in this vulnerable population. This study aimed to determine whether independent housing with mental health support teams with a recovery-oriented approach (Housing First (HF) program) for people who are homeless with severe mental disorders improves hospital and emergency department use. Methods We did a randomised controlled trial in four French cities: Lille, Marseille, Paris and Toulouse. Participants were eligible if they were 18 years or older, being absolutely homeless or precariously housed, with a diagnosis of schizophrenia (SCZ) or bipolar disorder (BD) and were required to have a high level of needs (moderate-to-severe disability and past hospitalisations over the last 5 years or comorbid alcohol or substance use disorder). Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to immediate access to independent housing and support from the Assertive Community Treatment team (social worker, nurse, doctor, psychiatrist and peer worker) (HF group) or treatment as usual (TAU group) namely pre-existing dedicated homeless-targeted programs and services. Participants and interviewers were unmasked to assignment. The primary outcomes were the number of emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalisation admissions and inpatient days at 24 months. Secondary outcomes were recovery (Recovery Assessment Scale), quality of life (SQOL and SF36), mental health symptoms, addiction issues, stably housed days and cost savings from a societal perspective. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed. Results Eligible patients were randomly assigned to the HF group (n= 353) or TAU group (n= 350). No differences were found in the number of hospital admissions (relative risk (95% CI), 0.96 (0.76-1.21)) or ED visits (0.89 (0.66-1.21)). Significantly less inpatient days were found for HFv.TAU (0.62 (0.48-0.80)). The HF group exhibited higher housing stability (difference in slope, 116 (103-128)) and higher scores for sub-dimensions of S-QOL scale (psychological well-being and autonomy). No differences were found for physical composite score SF36, mental health symptoms and rates of alcohol or substance dependence. Mean difference in costs was euro-217 per patient over 24 months in favour of the HF group. HF was associated with cost savings in healthcare costs (RR 0.62(0.48-0.78)) and residential costs (0.07 (0.05-0.11)). Conclusion An immediate access to independent housing and support from a mental health team resulted in decreased inpatient days, higher housing stability and cost savings in homeless persons with SCZ or BP disorders.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Although the importance of recovery-oriented care for people with severe mental illness (SMI) is widely acknowledged, essential elements such as personalization and involvement of significant others are not adequately implemented in practice. OBJECTIVE To determine whether using resource groups (RGs) within flexible assertive community treatment (FACT) has favorable effects on empowerment and recovery-related outcomes in people with SMI. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This assessor-blind, multisite randomized clinical trial was conducted from September 1, 2017, to September 30, 2020, with follow-up at 9 and 18 months. A total of 158 participants aged 18 to 65 years meeting the criteria for SMI were randomly allocated to FACT plus RG vs FACT as usual (1:1) in 20 FACT teams throughout the Netherlands. Data were analyzed from September 1, 2020, to January 31, 2021. The study was prespecified in the trial protocol and data from the intent-to-treat population were analyzed. INTERVENTIONS In the FACT plus RG condition, patients chose members from their informal and formal networks to form an RG that meets quarterly to discuss self-formulated recovery goals. The RG was integrated into the multidisciplinary support provided by the FACT team. In the FACT as-usual condition, empowerment (defined as overcoming powerlessness and gaining control of one's life) and involvement of significant others was also part of the provided care, but without the structure of the RG. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was self-reported empowerment, measured with the Netherlands Empowerment List. RESULTS A total of 158 participants with SMI (median age, 38 [median absolute deviation, 13] years; 93 men [58.9%]) were randomized to FACT plus RG (n = 80) or FACT as usual (n = 78) care. Intention-to-treat analyses showed that randomization to the RG condition was associated with a clinically significant increase in empowerment (Cohen d, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.21-0.86) and improved outcomes with small to medium effect sizes in terms of quality of life (Cohen d, 0.25; 95% CI, -0.07 to 0.56), personal recovery (Cohen d, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.06-0.69), quality of social contact (Cohen d, 0.24; 95% CI, -0.07 to 0.56), disability (Cohen d, 0.29; 95% CI, -0.03 to 0.60), general functioning (Cohen d, 0.30; 95% CI, -0.01 to 0.62), and social functioning (Cohen d, 0.28; 95% CI, -0.04 to 0.59). No differences between conditions were found regarding psychopathological symptoms, attachment, frequency of social contact, and employment. Compared with FACT as usual, participants who stayed with the assigned treatment in the RG condition were more satisfied with treatment at 9 (Cohen d = 0.45; t(135) = -2.62; P = .009) and 18 (Cohen d = 0.41; t(116) = -2.22; P = .02) months. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These findings show that working with RGs improves empowerment and other mental health outcomes in people with SMI who receive community-based mental health services. This method of network-oriented care empowers people with SMI within their own environment.

AB  - Objective: Trichotillomania is a psychiatric condition characterized by the chronic pulling and plucking of one's own hair Cognitive-behavioral therapy shows promise as a treatment for trichotillomania and might be preferable to pharmacotherapy However, there have been no randomized, controlled studies of the efficacy of group cognitive-behavioral therapy. Method: We evaluated 44 subjects, recruited from April 2009 to May 2010, all of whom met DSM-IV criteria for a diagnosis of trichotillomania. Subjects were randomized to receive 22 sessions of either group cognitive-behavioral therapy or group supportive therapy (control) Treatment evaluation was non-blind and used self-report scales. The primary outcome measure was the improvement of hair-plucking behavior as assessed by the Massachusetts General Hospital Hairpulling Scale Secondary measures included scores on the Beck Depression Inventory, the Beck Anxiety Inventory, and the Social Adjustment Scale-Self-Report. Results: Both groups showed significant posttreatment improvement in the scores from the Massachusetts General Hospital Hairpulling Scale (F = 23 762, P < 001) and the Beck Depression Inventory (F = 6 579, P = 003) The decrease in hair-plucking behavior over time was significantly greater in the study group than in the control group (F = 3 545, P < 038) There were no significant differences between the pretreatment and posttreatment time points or between the groups in the scores from the Beck Anxiety Inventory and the Social Adjustment Scale-Self-Report. Conclusions: We conclude that group cognitive behavioral therapy is a valid treatment for trichotillomania This treatment model should be further revised and expanded to address comorbidities such as anxiety and social maladjustment (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: This study assessed the effectiveness of Seeking Safety on depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with incarcerated women. Method: A randomized controlled trial (N = 40) was used to analyze Seeking Safety’s effectiveness compared to a treatment-as-usual control group. Analyses of covariance were used to assess differences at posttest (n = 33) and 4-month follow-up (n = 29) while repeated measures analysis of variance was used to assess the influence of the intervention on changes over time (n = 29). The researchers also analyzed individual participants’ scores from pretest to 4-month follow-up (n = 29). Results: Both groups decreased their scores on the Center for Epidemiology Studies–Depression Scale and the PTSD Checklist, although improvement was greater for treatment group participants except for depression at 4-month follow-up. Conclusion: Results support the continued use of Seeking Safety as a helpful corrections-based intervention for women, but more research with larger sample sizes is needed to consider it an effective intervention.

AB  - Both direct placement in supported community housing and pretreatment with time-limited residential treatment are used as approaches to helping chronically homeless adults exit from homelessness, but relative effectiveness and cost remains untested. The current observational study utilized data from a national, multisite housing project to determine whether clients who receive residential treatment or transitional housing before being placed into independent housing achieve superior outcomes than clients who are immediately placed into independent housing, and whether they incur greater health care costs. A total of 709 participants (131 and 578 participants in the respective groups) were assessed every 3 months for 2 years on housing outcomes, community adjustment, work and income, mental and physical health, and health service costs. Clients who received immediate, independent housing had more days in their own place, less days incarcerated, and reported having more choice over treatment, but no differences on other clinical or community adjustment outcomes. In this observational study, there were no clinical advantages for clients who had residential treatment or transitional housing prior to entry into community housing, but they incurred higher substance abuse service costs. Studies using randomized controlled trials of these conditions are needed to establish causation.

AB  - Supportive housing typically offers rental subsidies and individual intensive community-based case management and has become a predominant service model for homeless adults. Alternative case management models have not been adequately explored. This study evaluates satisfaction with a novel group-intensive peer support (GIPS) model of case management for the Housing and Urban Development-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) program. A total of 95 HUD-VASH clients rated their satisfaction with services and responded to open-ended questions about what they liked best and least about the program. Quantitative and qualitative analyses compared clients who attended groups as part of the GIPS model and those who did not. No significant difference in satisfaction between group and non-group attenders were found. Clients reported what they liked best about the program was the staff; those who attended groups reported what they liked best was the social interaction and peer support. These findings suggest clients who attend groups for their primary source of case management may be as satisfied as those who receive only individual case management. GIPS offers a feasible and acceptable service model and should be further explored along with other alternative models of care in supportive housing services. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Assessed the safety and efficacy of venlafaxine for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in 10 adults (mean age 34.5 yrs) with comorbid alcohol use disorders and cocaine abuse. The effects of venlafaxine treatment on alcohol craving and alcohol use was also assessed. Ss were seen weekly for the supportive psychotherapy and medication monitoring during weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 12. Alcohol or cocaine/dependence was determined by using the substance-abuse module of the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-III-Revised (DSM-III-R). Ss were allowed to participate in Alcoholics Anonymous and routine outpatient group and/or individual therapy for alcohol abuse/dependence. All but 1 S had significant decreases in substance use during the follow-up period, and 3 reported complete abstinence. The results of this preliminary study suggest that venlafaxine may be effective treatment for ADHD in adults with comorbid alcohol use disorders and may decrease alcohol craving frequency and intensity. The effect of cocaine use, if any, was difficult to interpret in this trial. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy and effectiveness of a theory‐driven multicomponent positive psychology intervention to improve well‐being for individuals with severe psychiatric conditions (SPCs) in comparison with treatment as usual (TAU). This intervention moves away from the traditional psychiatric perspectives that focused on symptoms and deficits, promoting a broader view of outcomes such as noncritical self‐acceptance, strengths, and positive relationships with others, among other things. METHOD: A two‐arm randomized and outcome‐blinded trial with pre‐post and 6‐month follow‐up evaluations was conducted to assess the intervention. A total of 141 participants were allocated to either the experimental condition or the waiting list group receiving their TAU. A mixed‐effect model was used to examine the efficacy of the intervention and a repeated‐measures Student's t‐test for the follow‐up effectiveness analysis. RESULTS: The intervention protocol was highly acceptable for participants, showing very high participant satisfaction as well as good attendance and adherence rates. At the end of the group therapy, participants reported a significant improvement in self‐acceptance and environmental mastery and, these changes were maintained in the follow‐up assessment after 6 months. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The results of this randomized control trial provide further evidence supporting that positive psychology approaches can be a powerful complementary strategy to promote more comprehensive psychiatric rehabilitation services for people with SPCs.

AB  - The study analyses the impact of an integrated therapy programme for schizophrenic patients, consisting of IPT (Brenner, Hodel, Roder & Corrigan 1992a), psychoeducation and behaviour therapy, on clinical and social levels of functioning. Subjects were 20 outpatients in therapy group and 15 in comparison group. Instruments were used to assess patient's clinical status and stress level, as well as family functioning, coping styles, and problem solving skills. Three assessments were undertaken before and once finished the therapy programme (12 months later), and at the end of a nine months follow-up period. Results indicate a clear improvement in clinical status and social functioning in the experimental group, as compared to comparison group.

AB  - This study focused on determining whether group social skills training (SST) or cognitive-behavioral group therapy (CBT) works best to treat social anxiety in psychiatric patients. Participants were psychiatric outpatients with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.) diagnosis of generalized social phobia (GSP). A matching procedure was used to obtain two equivalent samples in both conditions (N = 48). It was shown that both SST and CBT were effective in reducing social and general anxiety, decreasing the severity of psychopathology and increasing social skills and self-control. As for differential effects, patients participating in SST experienced a significantly greater reduction of social anxiety and a greater increase in social skills than those in CBT. Moreover, it was shown that social anxiety and social skills scores of the SST group at follow-up reached the level of a normal reference group, whereas those of the CBT participants improved only to that of nonsocially anxious patients with anxiety disorders. Finally, it was revealed that commitment to and satisfaction with treatment of participants in both conditions did not differ. Keeping in mind that this was a quasiexperimental study, the authors concluded that in a clinical setting, group SST may be the best way to treat psychiatric patients with GSP, where comorbidity is the rule rather than the exception.

AB  - Background: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) frequently co-occurs with Substance Use Disorders (SUDs). Standard ADHD pharmacotherapies are not effective in patients with this comorbidity and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has not been tested in this population. This RCT aimed to compare the efficacy of Integrated CBT (CBT/Integrated) directed at adult ADHD and SUD with CBT directed at SUD only (CBT/SUD) in patients with SUD and ADHD (SUD + ADHD). Method(s): Randomized clinical trial among 119 SUD + ADHD patients in a SUD treatment center. CBT/Integrated consisted of 15 individual sessions of motivational therapy, coping skills training and relapse prevention for SUD, and training of planning skills, problem-solving skills and dealing with emotions for ADHD. CBT/SUD consisted of 10 individual SUD treatment sessions only. Primary outcome was ADHD symptom severity according to the ADHD rating scale (ARS) at post-treatment. Secondary outcomes included ADHD symptom severity after two-month follow-up, and treatment response (>=30% ADHD symptom reduction), substance use, depressive or anxiety symptoms, and quality of life at post-treatment and follow-up. Result(s): CBT/Integrated was more effective than CBT/SUD in the reduction of ADHD symptoms post-treatment: ARS = 28.1 (SD 9.0) vs. 31.5 (SD 11.4) (F = 4.739, df = 1, 282, p =.030; d = 0.34). At follow-up, CBT/Integrated still resulted in lower ARS scores than CBT/SUD, but the difference was not significant at the 0.05 level. For other secondary outcomes, including substance use, no significant between-group differences were present. Conclusion(s): Compared to regular SUD cognitive behavioral therapy, integrated cognitive behavioral therapy resulted in a significant extra improvement in ADHD symptoms in SUD + ADHD patients.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Research on the effectiveness of peer-run services on the recovery of people with major psychiatric problems has been limited and poorly controlled. This study evaluated the effects of a 12-week peer-run course on recovery, 'Recovery Is Up to You.' METHODS: Recruitment of people with major psychiatric problems took place in the Netherlands between 2006 and 2008, and the effects of the peer-run intervention were evaluated in a randomized controlled trial. A total of 333 people were randomly assigned to the experimental (N=168) or control (N=165) condition. Self-report instruments used were the Herth Hope Index, the Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life, the Mental Health Confidence Scale, the Dutch Empowerment Scale, and the Loneliness Scale. Assessments took place at baseline, after three months (at the end of the course), and after six months. Data were analyzed by using linear mixed modeling. RESULTS: The intervention had a significant and positive effect on empowerment, hope, and self-efficacy beliefs but not on quality of life and loneliness. The effects of the intervention persisted three months after participants completed the course. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the peer-run course contributed to improvement in important domains of recovery. Peer-run services, such as 'Recovery Is Up to You,' add value to recovery-oriented mental health care because they offer participants an opportunity to make an active start on their recovery.

AB  - Background: Depressive symptoms in pregnant women, which are common and debilitating, are often co-morbid with other mental disorders (e.g. anxiety and personality disorders), and related to low socioeconomic status (SES). This situation may hamper treatment outcome, which has often been neglected in previous studies on the treatment of depression during pregnancy. We developed a new group-based multicomponent treatment (GMT) comprising cognitive behavioral therapy, psycho-education and body-oriented therapy and compared the effect on depressive symptoms with individual counseling (treatment as usual, TAU) in a heterogeneous group of pregnant women with co-morbid mental disorders and/or low SES.Methods: An outpatient sample from a university hospital of 158 pregnant women who met DSM-IV criteria for mental disorders were included and 99 participants were randomized to GMT or TAU from January 2010 until January 2013. The Edinburgh Depression Scale (EDS) was used at baseline, every 5 weeks during pregnancy and as the primary outcome measure of depressive symptoms at 6 weeks postpartum. Secondary outcome measures included the clinician-reported Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), obstetric outcomes and a 'Patient Satisfaction' questionnaire.Results: 155 participants were included the intention-to-treat (ITT)-analysis. GMT was not superior above TAU according to estimated EDS (β = 0.13, CI = - 0.46-0.71, p = 0.67) and HDRS scores (β = - 0.39, CI = - 0.82-0.05, p = 0.08) at 6 weeks postpartum. There were no differences in secondary outcomes between the GMT and TAU, nor between the randomized condition and patient-preference condition.Limitations: The ability to detect an effect of GMT may have been limited by sample size, missing data and the ceiling effect of TAU.Conclusions: GMT is an acceptable treatment for a heterogeneous group of pregnant women with depressive symptoms and co-morbid mental disorders and/or low SES, but not superior to TAU. Further research should focus on understanding and treating co-morbid disorders and psychosocial problems during pregnancy.Clinical Trials Registration: Dutch trial registry, www.trialregister.nl under reference number: NTR3015.

AB  - The current study assessed the effectiveness of a prison-based substance abuse treatment therapeutic community (TC) providing treatment to male inmates dually diagnosed with both substance abuse and mental health disorders. The findings show a short-term impact of the program on arrest after release, with program participants significantly less likely than comparison group offenders to be arrested or returned to prison within three months of release. Logistic regression analyses confirmed that program participants are more likely than the comparison group to be medication compliant, abstinent from substances, and more stable at three months after release. The analyses suggest that participation in the program increases the likelihood of medication compliance after release. The mediational model resulting from this study suggests that treatment participation directly impacts medication compliance. Medication compliance impacts substance use, and these two factors then combine to improve mental health stability. For this population, mental health stability leads to positive outcomes in the community. Medication compliance not only improves mental health stability, but also leads to a reduction or elimination of mental illness symptoms that decreases the need to self-medicate with substances. For these men, medication compliance is the pivotal factor in reducing recidivism after release. These outcome evaluation results indicate that program participation has a significant positive impact on the lives of participants after release. The primary outcome findings suggest that programs treating dually diagnosed offenders should continue to emphasize the importance of medication compliance. Medication compliance should be stressed not only during residential TC services, but during the provision of aftercare and outreach services as well. The current findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the treatment model for dually diagnosed offenders. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Homelessness among veterans has dropped dramatically since the expansion of services for homeless veterans in 2009, and now engaging homeless veterans in existing programs will be important to continuing to make progress. While one promising approach for engaging homeless veterans in care is involving peer mentors in integrated services, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may diminish the effects of peer mentorship. This mixed methods study examined how interpersonal and emotional processes in homeless veterans with and without PTSD impacted their capacity to engage in relationships with peer mentors. Four focus groups of 5-8 homeless male veterans (N = 22) were drawn from a larger multisite randomized trial. Qualitative analysis identified five primary themes: disconnectedness; anger, hostility, or resentment; connecting with others; positive view of self; and feeling like an outsider. Thematic comparisons between participants with and without a self-reported PTSD diagnosis, and between those who did and did not benefit from the peer mentor program, were validated by using quantitative methods. Disconnectedness was associated with self-reported PTSD diagnosis and with lack of program benefit; feeling like an outsider was associated with program benefit. Results suggest that disruption to the capacity to develop and maintain social bonds in PTSD may interfere with the capacity to benefit from peer mentorship. Social rules and basic strategies for navigating interpersonal relationships may differ somewhat within the homeless community and outside of it; for veterans who feel disconnected from the domiciled community, a formerly homeless veteran peer may serve as a critical "bridge" between the two social worlds.

AB  - Difficulty controlling anger is a significant concern among combat veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), yet few controlled studies have examined the efficacy of anger treatments for this population. This study examined the effects of a group cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention compared with a group present-centered therapy (PCT) control condition in male and female combat veterans with PTSD. Thirty-six combat veterans with PTSD and anger difficulties began group treatment (CBT, n = 19; PCT, n = 17). Separate multilevel models of self-rated anger, PTSD symptoms, and disability were conducted using data from baseline, each of 12 treatment sessions, posttreatment, and 3- and 6-month follow-up time points. Significant decreases in anger and PTSD symptoms were observed over time, but no significant differences between CBT and PCT were observed on these outcomes. A significant interaction of therapy by time favoring the PCT condition was observed on disability scores. Gender differences were observed in dropout rates (i.e., 100% of female participants dropped out of CBT). Findings suggest that both CBT and PCT group therapy may be effective in reducing anger in combat veterans with PTSD. Results also highlight potential gender differences in response to group anger treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The types of treatment for borderline personality disorder devised over the last few decades are often difficult to implement in therapy centres. stepps is a group treatment for this disorder which is easy to implement. AIM: To compare the efficacy of stepps supported by limited individual treatment with 'treatment as usual' (tau). METHOD: 79 patients with bpd were randomly assigned to stepps or to tau. Measurements were taken before and after the intervention and at one‐year follow‐up. Outcome measures were: borderline and general psychiatric symptomatology, suicide attempts, quality of life and use of care services. results stepps led to a larger reduction in symptoms than did tau, the difference being still significant at follow‐up. 70% of patients treated with stepps showed improvement compared to 47% of patients treated with tau. In both treatment groups the percentage of patients who recovered was small. There was no difference in the number of suicide attempts in each group. stepps led to a greater improvement in quality of life than did tau, particularly at follow‐up. Care service use seemed about equal. CONCLUSION: The efficacy of treatment for bpd can be improved by the introduction of stepps, which is relatively simple to implement.

AB  - Abstract: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic, recurrent, and often disabling disorder. Comorbid emotional and personality disorder are common and can serve to complicate both course of illness and treatment outcome. Controlled trials with adults have shown cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) that includes exposure and response prevention (ERP) to be highly effective for treating the disorder. It means exposing the patient to the very thing that causes fear and anxiety, and using all his strength to simply accept the experience instead of relying on compulsions to counteract it. The basic concept of CBT is: by changing the behavior, the patient eventually changes how he thinks and feels. CBT usually works fairly quickly, and it relies mostly on action, not insight. In this article we describe a cognitive-behavioral group treatment for both OCD symptoms and comorbid personality disorder. By an evaluable patient analysis; statistically and clinically significant pretreatment to posttreatment change occurred in OCD diagnostic status and severity. Some personality traits also changed. The results of this study, the first to evaluate this dimension of the personality disorders comorbidities in the OCD and their evolution with a behavioural and cognitive psychotherapy, are very encouraging. Indeed, evolution of the fields and facets of the personality changed positively.

Diverses techniques de psychothérapie sont utilisées parallèlement aux traitements médicamenteux. Parmi elles, les thérapies cognitivo-comportementales et notamment l’exposition avec prévention de la réponse (EPR) constituent une alternative certaine. Cette étude auprès d’un groupe de patients souffrant de TOC rapporte une expérience pratique de prise en charge en thérapie comportementale et cognitive (TCC) des symptômes obsessionnels mais aussi de certains traits pathologiques de personnalité comorbides au TOC. Les symptômes obsessionnels-compulsifs étaient évalués par l’échelle de Yale Brown (Y-BOCS). Les dimensions de la personnalité étaient mesurées par l’inventaire de personnalité révisé (NEO-PI-R). L’étude incluait un nombre total de dix patients qui ont bénéficié de dix séances d’une heure et demie chacune. La technique utilisée est celle de l’EPR. Une réduction significative a été notée sur les scores de la Y-BOCS de même qu’une réduction du névrosisme et de la conscience sur les facettes du NEO-PI-R. </ce:abst (French) [Copyright 2008 Elsevier] Copyright of Annales Medico Psychologiques is the property of Elsevier B.V. and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

AB  - Background: The existing literature on weight management interventions targeting physical activity and healthy eating in mental health care appears to provide only limited evidence. The aim of the study was to examine the effectiveness of a 10-week health promotion intervention, followed by a 6-month follow-up period in individuals with mental disorders living in sheltered housing in the Flanders region (Belgium). Methods: The study had a cluster preference randomized controlled design. Twenty-five sheltered housing organisations agreed to participate (16 in the intervention group, nine in the control group). In the intervention group, 225 individuals agreed to participate, while in the control group 99 individuals entered into the study. The main outcomes were changes in body weight, Body Mass Index, waist circumference and fat mass. Secondary outcomes consisted of changes in physical activity levels, eating habits, health-related quality of life and psychiatric symptom severity. Results: A significant difference was found between the intervention group and the control group regarding body weight (−0.35 vs. +0.22 kg; p=0.04), Body Mass Index (−0.12 vs. +0.08 kg/m2; p=0.04), waist circumference (−0.29 vs. + 0.55 cm; p<0.01), and fat mass (−0.99 vs. −0.12%; p<0.01). The decrease in these outcomes in the intervention group disappeared during the follow up period, except for fat mass. Within the intervention group, a larger decrease in the primary outcomes was found in the participants who completed the intervention. No significant differences between the two groups in changes in the secondary outcomes were found, except for the pedometer-determined steps/day. In the intervention group, the mean number of daily steps increased, while it decreased in the control group. Conclusions: The study demonstrated that small significant improvements in the primary outcomes are possible in individuals with mental disorders. Integration of health promotion activities targeting physical activity and healthy eating into daily care are, however, necessary to maintain the promising results.

AB  - Homeless youth represent a chronically vulnerable segment of society whose mental health needs, despite their acuity and complexity, are often unmet. This article describes the development and implementation of a pilot mental health group intervention, the Housing Outreach Project-Collaborative Wellness and Mindfulness Group, for young people in their first year of transitioning from homelessness/precarious housing to independent living. The intervention aimed to provide evidence-based mental health support to a traditionally difficult to engage population. The development of group framework and content, implementation, resultant client engagement, and perceived successes and challenges are described. Considerations for future mental health interventions and research with this population are discussed.

However, data on the effects of structured reading rehabilitation activities, in both hospital and community settings for patients with psychosis, are still scarce. Our aim was to investigate the effects on clinical status, disability, psychosocial functioning and cognitive functioning of a structured group reading activity, in a sample of hospitalized patients with psychosis. Methods We enrolled 41 consecutive patients with psychosis and randomly assigned them to a structured group reading programme. For all included patients, we psychometrically evaluated clinical symptomatology, psychosocial functioning and disability, as well as cognitive functioning. All evaluations were repeated at a 6-month follow-up. Repeated-measure multiple analyses of variance were used to test the effect of the group reading activities on the clinical, psychosocial and cognitive measures. Results We found that, after 6 months from discharge, structured group reading activities induced a statistically significant improvement of cognitive ( p < 0.007) and psychosocial ( p < 0.008) functioning in patients with psychosis and reduced their disability ( p < 0.005), with respect to the control group. Furthermore, such programmes are easy to implement and were perceived as extremely 'interesting' and 'useful' by patients with psychosis. Conclusions Rehabilitation programmes focusing on group reading activities should be regarded as a valid psychosocial rehabilitation tool for psychotic patients with severe mental disability. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Key Practitioner Message A structured group reading programme induced a significant symptomatological cognitive and psychosocial amelioration in hospitalized patients with psychosis., The improvement was sustained also at the 6-month follow-up, with respect to the control group., Structured group reading activities are perceived, by severely ill psychiatric patients, as highly useful, interesting and pleasant, while they are relatively easy to implement.

AB  - This study uses 1,995 Medicaid-paid claims from Georgia to examine factors influencing the provision of psychotherapy services to patients with schizophrenia. Measures of services included individual and group psychotherapy and were derived using the Physician's Current Procedural Terminology, 4th edition (CPT-4) codes. Approximately one in four patients received psychotherapy during the study period. When controlling for other factors, psychotherapy use was less likely for African American than White patients and more likely for women, those with comorbid substance abuse, and those with severe physical comorbidities. Compared with those not treated with an antipsychotic, those being treated with typical antipsychotics did not differ in psychotherapy use, but those treated with atypical antipsychotics were significantly more likely also to be receiving psychotherapy. Among psychotherapy users, individual psychotherapy alone was most common. Compared with those receiving only individual psychotherapy, the probability of receiving additional group therapy or group therapy alone was elevated for African American patients, those in metropolitan areas, and those with comorbid substance abuse.

AB  - Effects of Exposure in Cognitive Behavior Therapy of Panic Disorder: Duration Matters! Background: A large number of empirical studies demonstrated the efficiency of cognitive behavioral therapy in the treatment of panic disorders. Treatment packages typically include components such as education, corrective information, cognitive restructuring and exposure to fear provoking stimuli. Treatment procedures range from simply providing a self-help manual with minimal therapeutic contact to intensive exposure training. Over the last 2 decades, cognitive therapy became more and more important in the treatment of panic disorders, and today is often regarded as even more important than exposure treatment. Other studies show that even minimal exposure interventions can lead to treatment effects. There is a lack of knowledge concerning if and how much exposure is needed for effective treatment. The aim of the present study is to assess the outcome of a group oriented cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) approach and the effect of increasing the time of exposure exercises. Methods: 2 groups of patients with panic disorder (diagnosed by structured interviews) were compared. Both groups took part in an inpatient standardized behavior group therapy program. One group (n = 81) received 1 day of therapist-accompanied exposure, the other group (n = 88) received 2 days. The course of symptomatic variables, level of depression and psychosocial impairment were assessed before and after treatment and 1 year later. Results: At the end of treatment both groups showed striking benefits and treatment response was comparable between the groups. However, the prolonged exposure group showed significantly more reduction of symptoms in the follow-up (1 year). Conclusion: Exposure is an essential component of CBT. The effects of increasing exposure can primarily be seen in the long term. It is assumed that extending exposure time facilitates generalization of treatment gain.

AB  - Abstract: The aim of this present study is to examine the efficacy of attribution retraining group therapy (ARGT) and to compare the responses of outpatients with major depression disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). We carried out a prospective uncontrolled intervention study with a 8-weeks of ARGT on sixty three outpatients with MDD, GAD or OCD. Hamilton rating scale for depression, Hamilton rating scale for anxiety, Yale-Brown obsessive-compulsive scale, attribution style questionnaire, self-esteem scale, index of well-being, and social disability screening schedule were administered before and after treatment. Significant improvement in symptoms and psychological and social functions from pre-to posttreatment occurred for all participants. The changes favored MDD patients. Our study suggested that ARGT may improve the symptoms and psychological-social functions of MDD, GAD, and OCD patients. MDD patients showed the best response.

AB  - Mindfulness‐based interventions have been increasingly evidenced to be effective in different mental illnesses but limited in schizophrenia. This single‐blind, multisite randomized controlled trial tested the effects of a mindfulness‐based psychoeducation group program (MPGP in addition to usual care) versus a conventional psychoeducation group program (CPGP) versus treatment‐as‐usual (TAU) alone, in schizophrenia spectrum disorders over a 6‐month follow‐up. In each of the two study sites (outpatient clinics), 69 outpatients with schizophrenia or its subtypes (N=138) were randomly allocated to one of the three study groups (n=46) after baseline measurements and underwent 6 months of intervention. Primary outcomes including patients' mental state and rehospitalization rate and other secondary outcomes were assessed at entry and at 1 week and 6 months. One hundred and thirty‐one (95%) participants completed the interventions assigned and one to two post‐tests. Multivariate analyses of variance (followed by univariate contrast tests) indicated that the MPGP participants reported greater reductions in their psychotic symptoms (P=0.003) and length/duration of rehospitalizations (P=0.005) at 6‐month follow‐up. Patients in the MPGP group also reported greater improvements in their insight into illness/treatment (P=0.0008) and level of functioning (P=0.002) than the CPGP and TAU alone at the 1‐week and 6‐month follow‐up. Overall, the findings suggest that MPGP can be useful in improving the short‐ to medium‐term clinical outcomes of outpatients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, not only in terms of their mental state and risk of relapse but also their insight into illness/treatment and psychosocial functioning.

Taylor was incorrect. The correct affiliation is presented in the erratum.] This paper describes the importance of a life management enhancement (LME) group intervention for older minority women in developing personal control and self-confidence in social relationships as they overcome homelessness. Women in the treatment group showed significantly greater personal control and higher levels of self-confidence following the six-week intervention than women in the control group. Increasing personal control and developing self-confidence in social relationships can help individuals achieve desired outcomes as a result of their actions, efforts, and abilities. These attributes can help women increase and sustain appropriate coping methods and overcome homelessness. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is one of the most common anxiety disorders. The efficacy of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) has been examined but to date its effects on Quality of Life (QoL) have not been appropriately evaluated especially in the long term. The study aimed to examine, in the long term, what aspects of Quality of Life (QoL) changed among social anxiety disorder (SAD) patients treated with group cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and what predictors at baseline were associated with QoL. Methods: Outpatients diagnosed with SAD were enrolled into group CBT, and assessed at follow-ups for up to 12 months in a typical clinical setting. QoL was evaluated using the Short Form 36. Various aspects of SAD symptomatology were also assessed. Each of the QoL domains and scores on symptomatology were quantified and compared with those at baseline. Baseline predictors of QoL outcomes at follow-up were investigated. Results: Fifty-seven outpatients were enrolled into group CBT for SAD, 48 completed the whole program, and 44 and 40 completed assessments at the 3-month and 12-month follow-ups, respectively. All aspects of SAD symptomatology and psychological subscales of the QoL showed statistically significant improvement throughout follow-ups for up to 12 months. In terms of social functioning, no statistically significant improvement was observed at either follow-up point except for post-treatment. No consistently significant pre-treatment predictors were observed. Conclusions: After group CBT, SAD symptomatology and some aspects of QoL improved and this improvement was maintained for up to 12 months, but the social functioning domain did not prove any significant change statistically. Considering the limited effects of CBT on QoL, especially for social functioning, more powerful treatments are needed.

AB  - Context: Although depression frequently co-occurs with substance abuse, few individuals entering substance abuse treatment have access to effective depression treatment. Objective: The Building Recovery by Improving Goals, Habits, and Thoughts (BRIGHT) study is a community-based effectiveness trial that compared residential substance abuse treatment with residential treatment plus group cognitive behavioral therapy for depression delivered by substance abuse treatment counselors. We hypothesized that intervention clients would have improved depression and substance use outcomes compared with those of clients receiving usual care. Design: A nonrandomized controlled trial using a quasi-experimental intent-to-treat design in which 4 sites were assigned to alternate between the intervention and usual care conditions every 4 months for 2(1)/(2) years. Setting: Four treatment programs in Los Angeles County. Participants: We screened 1262 clients for persistent depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory-II score > 17). We assigned 299 clients to receive either usual care (n=159) or usual care plus the intervention (n=140). Follow-up rates at 3 and 6 months after the baseline interview were 88.1% and 86.2%, respectively, for usual care and 85.7% and 85.0%, respectively, for the intervention group. Intervention: Sixteen 2-hour group sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy for depression. Main Outcome Measures: Change in depression symptoms, mental health functioning, and days of alcohol and problem substance use. Results: Intervention clients reported significantly fewer depressive symptoms (P < .001 at 3 and 6 months) and had improved mental health functioning (P < .001 at 3 months and P < .01 at 6 months). At 6 months, intervention clients reported fewer drinking days (P < .05) and fewer days of problem substance use (P < .05) on days available. Conclusions: Providing group cognitive behavioral therapy for depression to clients with persistent depressive symptoms receiving residential substance abuse treatment is associated with improved depression and substance use outcomes. These results provide support for a new model of integrated care.

AB  - Objective: The BRIGHT (Building Recovery by Improving Goals, Habits, and Thoughts) study was a community-based effectiveness trial that compared residential substance abuse treatment with residential treatment plus group cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for depression. This brief report focuses on the subgroup of participants with major depression. Methods: The authors used a quasi-experimental design and an intent-to-treat analysis. Out of 299 participants enrolled, 135 had major depression. Primary outcomes were change in depression symptoms, mental health functioning, and days of alcohol use and problematic substance use. Results: At the three-month follow-up, participants with major depression reported less severe depression and better functioning, compared with participants with major depression who received usual care. At six months, functioning continued to be higher and problem substance use was lower. Conclusions: Group CBT was an effective treatment for major depression for clients in residential substance abuse treatment. These results extend the effectiveness of group CBT for major depression to a new setting, patient population, and type of provider.

AB  - Background: Triply diagnosed patients, who live with HIV and diagnosed mental health and substance abuse disorders, account for at least 13% of all HIV patients. This vulnerable population has substantial gaps in their care, attributable in part to the need for treatment for three illnesses from three types of providers. Aims of the study: The HIV/AIDS Treatment Adherence, Health Outcomes and Cost study (HIV Cost Study) sought to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of integrated HIV primary care, mental health, and substance abuse services among triply diagnosed patients. The analysis was conducted from a health sector budget perspective. Methods: Patients from four sites were randomly assigned to intervention group (n=232) or control group (n=199) that received care-as-usual. Health service costs were measured at baseline and three, six, nine and 12 months and included hospital stays, emergency room visits, outpatient visits, residential treatment, formal long-term care, case management, and both prescribed and over-the-counter medications. Costs for each service were the product of self-reported data on utilization and unit costs based on national data (2002 dollars). Quality of life was measured at baseline and six and 12 months using the SF-6D, as well as the SF36 physical composite score (PCS) and mental composite score (MCS). Results: During the 12 months of the trial, total average monthly cost of health services for the intervention group decreased from $3235 to $3052 and for the control group decreased from $3556 to $3271, but the decreases were not significant. For both groups, the percentage attributable to hospital care decreased significantly. There were no significant differences in annual cost of health services, SF-6D, PCS or MCS between the intervention and control group. Implications for Health Care Provision and Use: The results of this randomized controlled trial did not demonstrate that the integrated interventions significantly affected the health service costs or quality of life of triply diagnosed patients. Professionals could pursue coordination or integration of care guided by the evidence that it does not increase the cost of care. The results do not however, provide an imperative to introduce multi-disciplinary care teams, adherence counseling, or personalized nursing services as implemented in this study. Implications for Health Policies: There is not enough evidence to either limit continued exploration of integration of care for triply diagnosed patients or adopt policies to encourage it, such as financial reimbursement, grants regulation or licensing. Implications for Further Research: Future trials with interventions with lower baseline levels of integration, longer duration and larger sample sizes may show improvement or slow the decline in quality of life. Future researchers should collect comprehensive cost data, because significant decreases in the cost of hospital care did not necessarily lead to significant decreases in the total cost of health services.

AB  - Introduction. - Depression is a highly prevalent mental illness that is associated with high rates of morbidity and functional impairment. At the psychiatric unit of the University Hospital of Strasbourg, France, we have developed an open group that combines psychoeducation and cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT), the information, discovery, exchange and mobilization for depression group (IDEM-depression). IDEM-depression is composed of 17 thematic, structured, and independent sessions, which address different aspects of depression (i.e., rumination, pharmacological treatments). Because of its flexible format, patients with varying degrees of depression severity (from remission up to severe depressive symptoms) and whose depression might be bipolar or unipolar, are able to participate in the group. Thus, the group is well suited to a large number of patients with major depression. In the present study we aimed at describing the IDEM-depression group and presenting results regarding patients' overall satisfaction, assessed via two self-report questionnaires (the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire, the CSQ-8, and the IDEM ad hoc questionnaire), as well as its effect on mood following each session assessed via a visual analog scale (VAS) ranging from 0 up to 100. Method. - Sixty-five patients participated in 50 sessions of the IDEM-depression group in two hospitals in Alsace. 61% of the patients had bipolar disorder, and 41% of them were inpatients. Sessions took place on a weekly basis, lasted 2 hours and were proposed by a CBT-trained clinical psychologist. Patients were asked to fill-out the VAS at the beginning and at the end of each session. Moreover, they were asked to fill-out the CSQ-8 and the IDEM ad hoc questionnaire when they left the group. Other than one session ("yoga and mindfulness"), all the sessions (16 out of 17) were structured on a Powerpoint((c)) Presentation. During the first hour information was given regarding the topic (i.e., rumination), and a shared CBT conceptualization of the topic was formulated by the participants and the psychologist. For most sessions, the first hour was therefore communication and information-based, whereas during the second hour participants were asked to participate in in-session behavioral experiments and/or to evaluate specific aspects of their behavior (thoughts, emotions, activity, mindful behavior) during the last few days. The therapist manual and the slides for each session are available via e-mail to the first author. Results. - Regarding the results, self -reported mood on the VAS was compared between the onset (225 VAS) and the end (225 VAS) of each session. Overall, results suggest that self -reported mood is significantly improved following the participation in sessions (t=-5. 87, P<0.001). Moreover, mean results on the CSQ-8 suggest that patients are highly satisfied with the group (M = 24.46, SD = 6.42). Among them, 82% reported a moderate -high satisfaction with the group. On the IDEM ad hoc questionnaire, patients reported an overall high satisfaction level regarding (i) the content of sessions, (ii) the duration of sessions, (iii) the frequency of sessions, (iv) how much they felt they could express themselves during sessions. In the qualitative comments of this questionnaire, patients reported that the group helped them to gain an understanding of the mechanisms involved in depression; to feel less isolated and guilty; and to learn about specific psychotherapeutic tools (i.e., mindfulness) and to try to implement them. Conclusion. - Our results suggest that an IDEM-depression group is well suited to a wide -array of clinical pictures associated with depression (varying severity, bipolar or unipolar, inpatients and outpatients). This is probably due to its open -group format which is particularly well -adapted to the dynamic symptomatology associated with major depression, and may stimulate decentering in patients who have different levels of severity of symptoms but participate in the same session. Moreover, its impact on mood improvement, and the high satisfaction level reported by patients, seem to be related to its CBT and psychoeducation-based content on the one hand, which has shown its efficacy in depression. On the other hand, IDEM's structured open -group format might have also contributed to the improvement in mood and the overall good satisfaction reported by patients, through the social support provided by the group, improved feeling of self -efficiency, and its effect on stigmatization. Thus, IDEM-depression group is an efficacious, flexible, low-cost, and easy to implement (in different clinical settings) psychotherapeutic option for major depression. (C) 2016 L'Encephale, Paris.

AB  - Although bipolar disorder is the Axis I disorder associated with the highest risk of having a coexisting substance use disorder, no specific treatment approaches for this dually diagnosed patient population have thus far been developed. This paper describes a 20-session relapse prevention group therapy that the authors have developed for the treatment of patients with coexisting bipolar disorder and substance use disorder. The treatment uses an integrated approach by discussing topics that are relevant to both disorders and by highlighting common aspects of recovery from and relapse to each disorder.

AB  - The authors' goal was to pilot test a newly developed manual-based group psychotherapy, called Integrated Group Therapy (IGT), for patients with bipolar disorder and substance dependence. In this open trial, patients (mean age 36.2 yrs) with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV) bipolar disorder and substance dependence (N = 45) were recruited in sequential blocks to receive either group therapy (N = 21) or 6 monthly assessments, but no experimental treatment (N = 24). When compared with patients who did not receive group therapy, patients who received IGT had significantly better outcomes on the Addiction Severity Index drug composite score (p < .03), percentage of months abstinent (p < .01), and likelihood of achieving 2 (p < .002) or 3 (p < .004) consecutive abstinent months. IGT is a promising treatment for patients with bipolar disorder and substance dependence, who have traditionally had poor outcomes. It is unclear, however, how much of the improvement among the group therapy patients is attributable to the specific content of the treatment. A study comparing this treatment with another active psychotherapy treatment is warranted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although bipolar disorder and substance use disorder frequently co-occur, there is little information on the effectiveness of behavioral treatment for this population. Integrated group therapy, which addresses the two disorders simultaneously, was compared with group drug counseling, which focuses on substance use. The authors hypothesized that patients receiving integrated group therapy would have fewer days of substance use and fewer weeks ill with bipolar disorder., METHOD: A randomized controlled trial compared 20 weeks of integrated group therapy or group drug counseling with 3 months of posttreatment follow-up. Sixty-two patients with bipolar disorder and current substance dependence, treated with mood stabilizers for >or=2 weeks, were randomly assigned to integrated group therapy (N=31) or group drug counseling (N=31). The primary outcome measure was the number of days of substance use. The primary mood outcome was the number of weeks ill with a mood episode., RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analysis revealed significantly fewer days of substance use for integrated group therapy patients during treatment and follow-up. Groups were similar in the number of weeks ill with bipolar disorder during treatment and follow-up, although integrated group therapy patients had more depressive and manic symptoms., CONCLUSIONS: Integrated group therapy, a new treatment developed specifically for patients with bipolar disorder and substance dependence, appears to be a promising approach to reduce substance use in this population.

AB  - Background: Integrated group therapy, a new treatment for patients with bipolar disorder and substance use disorder, has previously been found to be efficacious in reducing substance use, but its length (20 sessions) and need for highly trained therapists may limit its adoption in substance use disorder community treatment programs. This paper compares a briefer (12 session) version of integrated group therapy, led by substance use disorder counselors without previous cognitive-behavioral training or bipolar disorder experience, to group drug counseling.Methods: Sixty-one patients with bipolar disorder and substance dependence, taking mood stabilizers, were randomized to 12 sessions of integrated group therapy (n=31) or group drug counseling (n=30).Results: Analyses of primary outcomes showed trends favoring integrated group therapy, with greater reduction in substance use during follow-up and a greater decline in risk of mood episodes during treatment. Secondary analyses favored integrated group therapy, with a significantly greater likelihood of achieving total abstinence, a significantly shorter time to the first abstinent month, and a significantly greater likelihood of achieving a "good clinical outcome" (a composite measure encompassing both substance use and mood simultaneously).Conclusions: A shortened version of integrated group therapy can be delivered successfully by substance use disorder counselors, with better overall outcomes than those achieved with group drug counseling.

AB  - Objective: Although integrating motivational interviewing (MI) and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been recommended for treating anxiety, few well-controlled tests of such integration exist. Method: In the present randomized trial for severe generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), we compared the efficacy of 15 sessions of CBT alone (N = 43) versus 4 MI sessions followed by 11 CBT sessions integrated with MI to address client resistance/ambivalence (N = 42). Clients were adults, predominantly female and Caucasian, with a high rate of diagnostic comorbidity. To control for allegiance, therapists were nested within treatment group and supervised separately by experts in the respective treatments. Results: Piecewise multilevel models revealed no between-groups differences in outcomes from pre- to posttreatment; however, there were treatment effects over the follow-up period with MI-CBT clients demonstrating a steeper rate of worry decline (&gamma; = -0.13, p = .03) and general distress reduction (&gamma; = -0.12, p = .01) than CBT alone clients. Also, the odds of no longer meeting GAD diagnostic criteria were ~5 times higher at 12-months for clients receiving MI-CBT compared with CBT alone. There were also twice as many dropouts in CBT alone compared with MI-CBT (23% vs. 10%); a difference that approached significance (p = .09). The treatments were competently delivered, and intraclass correlations revealed negligible between-therapist effects on the outcomes. Conclusions: The findings support the integration of MI with CBT for severe GAD and point to the importance of training therapists in appropriate responsivity to in-session markers of resistance and ambivalence.

AB  - Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is associated with depression. Although attendance at Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings predicts reductions in drinking, results have been mixed about the salutary effects of AA on reducing depressive symptoms. In this single-group study, early AA affiliates (n = 253) were recruited, consented, and assessed at baseline, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months. Lagged growth models were used to investigate the predictive effect of AA attendance on depression, controlling for concurrent drinking and treatment attendance. Depression was measured using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and was administered at baseline 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Additional predictors of depression tested included spiritual gains (Religious Background and Behavior questionnaire [RBB]) and completion of 12-step work (Alcoholics Anonymous Inventory [AAI]). Eighty-five percent of the original sample provided follow-up data at 24 months. Overall, depression decreased over the 24 month follow-up period. AA attendance predicted later reductions in depression (slope = -3.40, p = .01) even after controlling for concurrent drinking and formal treatment attendance. Finally, increased spiritual gains (RBB) also predicted later reductions in depression (slope = -0.10, p = .02) after controlling for concurrent drinking, treatment, and AA attendance. In summary, reductions in alcohol consumption partially explained decreases in depression in this sample of early AA affiliates, and other factors such as AA attendance and increased spiritual practices also accounted for reductions in depression beyond that explained by drinking.

AB  - Motivational interviewing (MI) is a directive, client-centered intervention to elicit behavior change by assisting clients in the exploration and resolution of ambivalence toward change. MI-inspired approaches have been used in an attempt to facilitate change in a wide variety of domains including alcohol and drug abuse, safe water handling practices, dual diagnoses, gambling, spousal abuse, health related areas, mood and anxiety disorders, and parental engagement. MI seeks to resolve ambivalence in the direction of change by increasing the client's self-efficacy. This is accomplished by combining client-centered (e.g., reflective listening) and directive strategies (e.g., attending selectively to change statements). The origins of MI are in the substance abuse field where it provided an alternative to harsher strategies among a population that is often described as treatment resistant. The goal of the current study was to assess the effectiveness of motivational enhancement therapy applied in a group setting in a community substance abuse treatment agency. Group treatment involved eight sessions, each lasting 90 minutes, focused on the following topics: lifestyles, stages of change, ambivalence surrounding change, developing discrepancy, pros and cons of changing, values, self-efficacy, and planning for change. Self-report measures from 82 individuals (70.7% male, mean age of 31) who received treatment were analyzed to determine what impact the treatment had on current substance use, self-efficacy, ambivalence toward a change in use, and the presence of change talk. Participants did not report a significant decrease in their substance use during the treatment, but the results approached a significant trend suggestive of decreased use. In addition, no statistically significant changes in participants' self-reported readiness to change or in their self-efficacy were observed. However, a statistically significant increase in change oriented talk was observed. Specifically, results suggested an increase in statements indicating a desire and intention to decrease substance use. This uncontrolled effectiveness study of a motivational enhancement intervention in a community substance abuse clinic produced mixed results. The implications for the practice of motivational enhancement interventions in the community, the place of these data in the empirical literature, and how the findings fit with the theorized mechanisms of action are discussed.

AB  - Objective: We compared mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) with both cognitive psychological education (CPE) and treatment as usual (TAU) in preventing relapse to major depressive disorder (MDD) in people currently in remission following at least 3 previous episodes. Method: A randomized controlled trial in which 274 participants were allocated in the ratio 2:2:1 to MBCT plus TAU, CPE plus TAU, and TAU alone, and data were analyzed for the 255 (93%; MBCT = 99, CPE = 103, TAU = 53) retained to follow-up. MBCT was delivered in accordance with its published manual, modified to address suicidal cognitions; CPE was modeled on MBCT, but without training in meditation. Both treatments were delivered through 8 weekly classes. Results: Allocated treatment had no significant effect on risk of relapse to MDD over 12 months follow-up, hazard ratio for MBCT vs. CPE = 0.88, 95% CI [0.58, 1.35]; for MBCT vs. TAU = 0.69, 95% CI [0.42, 1.12]. However, severity of childhood trauma affected relapse, hazard ratio for increase of 1 standard deviation = 1.26 (95% CI [1.05, 1.50]), and significantly interacted with allocated treatment. Among participants above median severity, the hazard ratio was 0.61, 95% CI [0.34, 1.09], for MBCT vs. CPE, and 0.43, 95% CI [0.22, 0.87], for MBCT vs. TAU. For those below median severity, there were no such differences between treatment groups. Conclusion: MBCT provided significant protection against relapse for participants with increased vulnerability due to history of childhood trauma, but showed no significant advantage in comparison to an active control treatment and usual care over the whole group of patients with recurrent depression.

AB  - Forty-one DSM-III-R schizophrenic subjects on constant, low-dose maintenance neuroleptic drug therapy (5-10 mg of fluphenazine decanoate intramuscularly every 2 weeks) were randomly assigned to structured and modularized skills training or to supportive group psychotherapy. The skills training was designed by using cognitive and behavioral methods to compensate for the learning disabilities that plague many schizophrenic patients. Skill acquisition was assessed by using quantified performance on standardized role-play tests. Subjects who received skills training made significant gains in each of the areas taught, whereas those who participated in the control psychotherapy group did not. The knowledge and skills learned during training were retained without significant erosion over a 1-year followup period. These results suggest that the use of structured principles of learning and cognitive therapy can effectively train schizophrenics in skill areas pertinent to the self-management of their illness.

AB  - Background: Schizophrenia is a chronic and disabling mental health condition. The early application of cognitive remediation interventions has provided some of the greatest hope of reducing long-term disability in the condition. Cognitive Enhancement Therapy (CET) is a particularly promising approach to cognitive remediation that integrates both computerbased neurocognitive training and structured social-cognitive groups. In 2009, Eack and colleagues demonstrated evidence that CET significantly improved cognitive and functional outcomes among individuals in the early course of schizophrenia (N = 58). The current study seeks to confirm these effects in the early course of the condition in a larger multi-site clinical trial. Method(s): A total of 106 (Pittsburgh: n = 54; Boston: n = 52) early course schizophrenia outpatients were randomized to either 18 months of CET (n = 61) or an Enriched Supportive Therapy (EST; n = 45) comparison treatment. Patients completed a comprehensive battery of cognitive, functional, and clinical assessments at baseline, 9 (mid-treatment), and 18 months (end of treatment). Composite indexes were calculated for neurocognition, social cognition, functional outcome, and symptomatology. Intent-to-treat linear mixed-effects models, adjusted for potential demographic and antipsychotic dose confounding effects, were used to investigate differential change trajectories in outcomes between CET and EST. The group (CET vs. EST) x time (baseline, 9, and 18 months) interaction was the effect of interest. Result(s): No significant group x time interactions were observed for either neurocognition (F2,88 = .30, p = .742) or clinical symptoms (F2,88 = .13, p = .874). CET demonstrated particularly favorable effects on social cognition and functional outcomes. Over the 18 months of treatment, relative to the patients in the EST treatment group, those in CET had significantly greater linear gains in social-cognitive abilities (F2,88 = 3.62, p = .031, d = .64) and functional outcome (F2,88 = 4.18, p = .019, d = .37). Discussion(s): These results support CET as an effective treatment for improving social cognitive and functional outcomes in the early course of schizophrenia, largely confirming the findings from the initial trial (Eack et al., 2009). Such evidence underscores the impact of CET on reducing disability when applied as an early course intervention.

AB  - A controlled trial of Seeking Safety (SS) and Male-Trauma Recovery Empowerment Model (M-TREM) examined implementation and effectiveness of integrated group therapy for comorbid post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance use disorder (SUD) on PTSD and mental health symptoms plus self-esteem and efficacy for incarcerated men. The study sample (n = 230) was male inmates 18 years or older who were primarily non-white, high school graduates or equivalents, had childhood trauma histories, committed violent crimes, had serious mental illnesses, and resided in a maximum security prison. Incarcerated men, who screened positive for PTSD and SUD, were assigned randomly (n = 142) or by preference (n = 88) to receive SS or M-TREM, with a waitlist group of (n = 93). Manualized interventions were group-administered for 14 weeks. Primary outcomes were PTSD and other mental health symptoms. Secondary outcomes were self-esteem, coping, and self-efficacy. SUD outcomes cannot be measured in a correctional setting. Implementation feasibility was exhibited by the ability to recruit, screen, assign, and retain participants. Effectiveness findings depended on sample, design, and method for analysis. Using a waitlist control group and no follow-up period, we found no aggregate effect of treatment on PTSD symptoms, although, when disaggregated, M-TREM was found to improve PTSD severity and SS improved general mental health symptoms and psychological functioning. Using intent-to-treat and completer analyses, no significant differences were found in the relative performance between SS and M-TREM on primary or secondary outcomes. When longitudinal data were maximized and modeled in ways that reflect the hierarchical nature of the data, we found that SS and M-TREM performed better than no treatment on PTSD severity and secondary outcomes, and that treatment benefits endured. Findings cautiously support implementing either Seeking Safety or M-TREM to treat incarcerated men with co-morbid PTSD and addiction problems.

AB  - Objective: Anxiety and substance use disorders are highly comorbid and mutually maintain each other. Treatments for anxiety disorders that are well integrated into substance use disorder treatment have the potential to improve both anxiety and substance use outcomes. Method: Ninety-seven individuals seeking treatment at a community-based, evidence-based intensive outpatient program for substance use disorders who also had anxiety disorders were randomized to either (a) usual care (UC) at the intensive outpatient program; or (b) UC + coordinated anxiety learning and management for addiction recovery centers (CALM ARC), a 7-session, group-based, computer-assisted but therapist-directed treatment for anxiety disorders adapted for individuals with anxiety disorder and substance use disorder comorbidity. Results: CALM ARC + UC outperformed UC on measures of anxiety and substance use at posttreatment and at a 6-month follow-up. Conclusions: Adding CALM ARC to UC for patients with comorbid anxiety disorders and substance use disorders is superior to UC alone. Implications for future research and clinical practice are discussed.

AB  - Social anxiety disorder (SAD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD) are highly comorbid and this comorbidity is associated with poorer clinical outcomes. Integrating exposure-based treatment for SAD into the context of typical AUD treatment programs should improve engagement and treatment outcomes for this population. After initial development of a fully integrated, intensive outpatient program (IOP) for individuals with comorbid SAD and AUD, patients with SAD and AUD were recruited from a community-based SUD specialty clinic (N = 56) and randomized to either (a) usual care (UC), consisting of the evidence-based Matrix Model of Addiction IOP; or (b) the Fully Integrated Treatment (FIT) for comorbid SAD and AUD IOP. Participants were assessed on indices of social anxiety and alcohol use. By the 6-month follow-up, those in FIT showed superior improvement to UC on number of drinking days in the past 30 days and social anxiety severity at follow-up, but there were no differences between groups on quantity of alcohol consumed on drinking days. Alcohol-related problems improved in both groups, with no statistically significant differences. Within-group improvement was observed in FIT (but not in UC) on drinking to cope with social anxiety and avoidance of social situations without alcohol, but between-group effects were non-significant. In sum, the integrated treatment of SAD and AUD led to greater reductions in both the frequency of drinking and in social anxiety symptoms than usual care. Targeting social anxiety in the context of AUD treatment is a promising approach to improving the treatment of this common comorbidity. • Combining social anxiety and alcohol treatment improved social anxiety more than standard alcohol treatment. • Combining social anxiety and alcohol treatment also improved alcohol use more than alcohol treatment. • There were no differences between groups on treatment engagement outcomes.

AB  - Introduction: Poor sleep quality is widely reported among patients with psychiatric conditions. While sleep problem is mostly treatable by cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia (CBT‐I), the access to expert‐conducted individual CBT‐I sessions remains low. We here investigate the effectiveness of a 2‐session CBT‐I group treatment ran by trained low‐intensity worker under supervision. Materials and methods: Participants (n=49, aged 18‐70, 66% female) were all attending routine clinical psychological services for mental health conditions at a community out‐patient clinic of a public hospital. They were recruited if they self‐reported poor sleep quality, measured by a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) global score >5. The CBT‐I group was primarily conducted by a trained low‐intensity worker, while a clinical psychologist would sit in the treatment session to ensure quality treatment delivery and handle enquiry. There were two 90‐120 minute sessions, separated by a week. There were 6‐12 participants in each group. Treatment component includes Stimulus control therapy, relaxation training, and psychoeducation regarding homeostatic and circadian factors affecting sleep and wake condition. Participants completed the PSQI and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale at the referral, pre‐ and post‐treatment day for evaluation of treatment impact on sleep quality and negative mood. Results: Results from paired‐sample t‐tests showed that, compared to baseline performance at the date of referral, after the treatment, participants had significantly improved habitual sleep efficiency, t(47)=‐2.961, p=.005, cohen's d=‐.399 and increased actual sleep time, t(47)=‐2.371, p=.022, d=‐.335, measured by the PSQI, though there was no significant difference on the PSQI global score, t(46)=1.678, p=.100 . There was also a trend of improvement in depressive symptoms, t(36)=1.869, p=.070. Conclusions: While our findings inclined to suggest that a 2‐session CBT‐I group ran by a low‐intensity worker had significant positive impact on psychiatric patient's self‐reported sleep efficiency and sleep duration, we called for future CBT‐I intervention study conducted by low‐intensity worker, especially randomized control trials for further verification of the effectiveness and feasibility of this mode of treatment delivery which appears to improve the access to CBT‐I.

AB  - Although strengthening the family relations of individuals with severe mental illness has been identified as an important objective for community based case management programs, little is known about the impact of such programs on patterns of family relations over lime. This study assesses longitudinally the family support of a large sample of homeless mentally ill individuals participating in a supported housing program. The program randomly assigned participants to one of four experimental conditions created by varying the level of access to independent housing and the intensify of case management services provided. Substantial improvements were found during the 3-year follow-up period for frequency of family interaction, perceived availability, and satisfaction with family. Regression analyses were used to model factors correlated with change. improvement in support was not associated with housing or case management conditions. Increased levels of family support were associated with housing status and mental health status. Clients in stable independent and community housing showed greater improvement than a group of clients living an art unstable housing environment. Substantial gains in family relations also occurred among a subgroup who did not achieve housing stability, but received family housing assistance during follow-up. The lack of relationship between the experimental intervention and change in support is discussed. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - The present research tested the effectiveness of adding an interpersonal, interactive, experiential training programme to addictions treatment that enhances motivation, cognitive-behavioural coping skills, social support, and group cohesiveness. The research was conducted in a co-educational, long-term residential treatment facility for addictive disorders (alcohol and other substances, sexual addiction, eating disorders, compulsive shopping, and gambling) and concomitant psychiatric diagnoses. The added training is co-created by participants. They choose challenging situations important in their lives that are played out as ‘movies’ in which they play and experience all the parts. Motivation for change, skills to implement positive changes, self-efficacy, empathy, positive support, and group cohesiveness are rooted in their own experiences and the feedback they receive from others, as they behave in empowering and disempowering ways. The training resulted in significant increases in empowering communication, self-esteem and quality of group life in the treatment group and in the family. Many of these results have large effect sizes and are consistent with the findings from prior studies. The results obtained in this study suggest that Say It Straight training can be an effective addition to the treatment of addictions in residential treatment. Future research is needed to determine the long-term effects of this training on relapse.

AB  - Patients with comorbid substance use disorder (SUD) and depression incur greater treatment costs than those with either disorder alone. Integrated treatment targeting both issues concurrently has been shown to reduce substance use and depression in this population, but little is known about the effects of such treatment on the utilization of costly health services. This study compared 18-month patterns of service utilization for 236 veterans with comorbid SUD depression randomly assigned to 6 months of either Integrated Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (ICBT) or Twelve-Step Facilitation Therapy. Treatment group differences were found for the utilization of psychotropic medication services and inpatient hospitalization. Higher rates of therapy attendance, lower baseline depression, and receiving ICBT all predicted shorter admissions for those hospitalized during treatment. Ethnicity and gender predicted medication service use both during and following treatment. The findings provide evidence supporting the long-term cost-effectiveness of integrated treatment for this high-risk population.

AB  - This study examined the longitudinal association between substance use and depressive symptoms in veterans receiving outpatient treatment for comorbid substance use disorder and major depression. Veterans (N = 237, mean age = 48.2 years, 90% male, 70% Caucasian) received either 6 months of group integrated cognitive-behavioral therapy or twelve-step facilitation. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores and percent days using any substance were assessed every 3 months up to 1 year posttreatment. Greater substance use predicted time-varying elevations in depression above individual patterns of change in depression. Moreover, change in depressive symptoms was associated with change in both the likelihood of any substance use and the frequency of use during the treatment and follow-up periods. Changes in these symptoms appear to be linked, such that individuals with greater reductions in substance use have greater reductions in depressive symptoms (and vice versa).

AB  - Background: Among individuals diagnosed with substance dependence, major depressive disorder (MDD) is the most common co-occurring Axis I disorder and is associated with greater treatment costs and poor treatment response. Recently revised models recognize substance use behaviors as a complex interplay of distal risk, proximal risks, intrapersonal processes, and contextual factors but few studies have examined mediators and moderators of change in this population, which would inform the development and delivery of clinical interventions. Methods: Veterans (N = 209) meeting DSM-IV criteria for substance dependence with recent use and substance-independent MDD with current depressive symptoms received group Twelve-Step Facilitation (TSF) or Integrated Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (ICBT). Both groups received adjunct pharmacotherapy. Measures were assessed at baseline and at 3-month intervals during 6 months of treatment and 12 months of follow-up. Outcomes were percent days drinking and percent days using drugs. Results: In Study 1 TSF had superior improvement in depression during treatment, which was mediated by greater Alcoholics/Narcotics Anonymous (AA/NA) meeting attendance. In both groups the effects of AA/NA attendance on future drinking were mediated through depression. In Study 2 TSF was significantly higher than ICBT on AA/NA attendance and affiliation at end-of-treatment, but during follow-up TSF had greater decreases in AA/NA attendance and affiliation, which mediated greater increases in drinking. In Study 3 greater self-efficacy and lower social network drinking/drug use predicted lower future drinking and drug use. Social network effects were moderated by context, with greater effects of social networks for veterans with less time in constrained environments. In Study 4 greater neurocognitive impairment predicted greater drinking and drug use indirectly through lower self-efficacy, lower AA/NA affiliation, and greater depressive symptoms. Furthermore, AA/NA affiliation interacted with depression and neurocognitive impairment to predict future drinking, such that the effects of 12-step affiliation were strongest for those with severe neurocognitive impairment when they were severely depressed. Discussion: In adults receiving treatment for co-occurring substance dependence and major depression, negative affect, AA/NA attendance, self-efficacy, and social network substance use are key proximal factors linked to drinking and drug use outcomes, and severity of neurocognitive impairment impacts treatment through indirect associations with these proximal variables (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Co-morbid anxiety and depression in older adults is associated with worse physical and mental health outcomes and poorer response to psychological and pharmacological treatments in older adults. However, there is a paucity of research focused on testing the efficacy of the co-morbid treatment of anxiety and depression in older adults using psychological interventions. Accordingly, the primary objective of the current study was to test the effects of a group cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) program in treating co-morbid anxiety and depression in a sample of older age adults. Method: A total of 133 community-dwelling participants aged ≥60 years (mean age = 67.35, S.D. = 5.44, male = 59) with both an anxiety disorder and unipolar mood disorder, as assessed on the Anxiety Disorder Interview Schedule (ADIS), were randomly allocated to an 11-week CBT group or discussion group. Participants with Mini-Mental State Examination scores <26 were excluded. Participants were assessed pre-treatment, post-treatment and at 6 months follow-up on the ADIS, a brief measure of well-being, Geriatric Anxiety Inventory and Geriatric Depression Scale. Results: Both conditions resulted in significant improvements over time on all diagnostic, symptom and wellbeing measures. Significant group × time interaction effects emerged at post-treatment only for diagnostic severity of the primary disorder, mean severity of all anxiety disorders, mood disorders, and all disorders, and recovery rates on primary disorder. Conclusion: Group CBT produced faster and sustained improvements in anxiety and depression on diagnostic severity and recovery rates compared to an active control in older adults.

AB  - Background Integrated Treatment (IT) has proved effective in treating patients with Substance Use Disorders (SUD) co-occurring with severe Mental Disorders (MD), less is known about the effectiveness of IT for patients with SUD co-occurring with less severe MD. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of IT for patients with SUD co- occurring with anxiety and/or depression on the following parameters: 1. The use of substances, as measured by the Alcohol Use Identification Test (AUDIT), the Drug Use Identification Test (DUDIT), and the Addiction Severity Index (EuropASI). 2. The severity of psychiatric symptoms, as measured by the Symptom Check List 90 r (SCL 90R). 3. The client's motivation for changing his/her substance use behaviour, as measured by the Substance Abuse Treatment Scale (SATSr). Methods This is a group randomized clinical trial comparing the effectiveness of IT to treatment as usual in Community Mental Health Centres (CMHCs). Five CMHCs were drawn to the Intervention Group (IG) and four CMHCs to the Control Group (CG). The allocation to treatment conditions was not blinded. New referrals were screened with the AUDIT and the DUDIT. Those who scored above the cut-off level of these instruments were assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV 1 and 2. We included patients with anxiety and/or depression together with one or more SUDs. Results We included 55 patients in the IG and 21 in the CG. A linear multilevel model was used. Both groups reduced their alcohol and substance use during the trial, while there was no change in psychiatric symptoms in either group. However, the IG had a greater increase in motivation for substance use treatment after 12 months than had the CG with an estimate of 1.76, p = 0.043, CI 95% (0.08; 3.44) (adjusted analyses). There were no adverse events. Conclusion Integrated treatment is effective in increasing the motivation for treatment amongst patients with anxiety and/or depression together with SUD in outpatient clinics.

AB  - Background and Aims: Patients with co‐occurring substance use and other mental disorders are vulnerable to crime victimization, yet no evidence‐based preventive interventions exist. Our aim was to test the efficacy of a new intervention, Self‐wise, Other‐wise, Streetwise training (SOS training), to prevent victimization in these dual‐diagnosis patients as an add‐on to care as usual. Design Multi‐site single‐blind parallel randomized controlled trial. Setting: Three sites within one psychiatric service in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Participants: Adult in‐patients and out‐patients with dual diagnosis (n = 250), who were predominantly male (70.4%), aged on average 42.1 years, and diagnosed with 3.7 DSM‐IV disorders. Intervention and comparator: Care as usual, consisting of pharmacotherapy combined with individual psychotherapy, group psychotherapy and/or supportive counselling (n = 125) was compared with care as usual plus SOS training: a 6‐week, 12‐session manualized group training focused on enhancing emotion regulation skills, conflict resolution skills and street skills (n = 125). Measurements: Victimization was assessed with the Safety Monitor, the Dutch equivalent of the International Crime Victims Survey, in a face‐to‐face assessment. The primary outcome measure was treatment response (yes/no), with 'yes' defined as reporting at least a 50% reduction in the number of past‐year victimization incidents at the 14‐month follow‐up compared with baseline. Analyses were performed according to the intention‐to‐treat principle. Findings: The proportion of participants achieving treatment response for total victimization was 54.0% in the control group and 67.6% in the experimental group, a significant difference [odds ratio (OR) = 1.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.02–3.11, P = 0.042]. Treatment response for violent victimization was achieved by 68.7% of the control group and 79.3% of the experimental group (OR = 1.75, 95% CI = 0.91–3.34, P = 0.092). With a Bayes factor of 2.26, this result was inconclusive. Conclusions: Among dual‐diagnosis patients, care as usual plus Self‐wise, Other‐wise, Streetwise training was more effective in preventing victimization than care as usual alone.

AB  - Elevated internalized stigma is common and is linked to subjective and objective outcomes for severe mental illness. The authors developed a manualized group-based intervention (Narrative Enhancement/Cognitive Therapy; NECT) to address internalized stigma in severe mental illness. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of NECT. In total, 144 individuals were screened at two sites to evaluate if they met criteria for 'elevated' internalized stigma; 39 and were eligible were randomized to NECT or to treatment as usual (TAU) and were assessed at baseline, posttreatment, and 3-month follow-up. Fifteen of the 21 individuals assigned to NECT were classified as 'exposed' to treatment. Intent-to-treat analyses found no significant difference between the NECT and TAU groups. A comparison of exposed versus unexposed participants noted trends for exposed participants to have improved more in two aspects of self-stigma as well as insight. We conclude that NECT is feasible and tolerable, but findings did not support the hypothesis that NECT was more effective than TAU, although small sample size and significant dropout may have restricted the ability to detect an effect.

AB  - PURPOSE: A substantial body of research indicates that self‐stigma is associated with poorer outcomes related to recovery among people with severe mental illnesses. Narrative Enhancement and Cognitive Therapy (NECT) is a structured, group‐based approach which targets the effects of self‐stigma. A randomized‐controlled trial was conducted to examine the efficacy of NECT. METHODS: One hundred and seventy persons, recruited from both outpatient and comprehensive treatment settings, meeting criteria for schizophrenia‐spectrum disorders and moderate‐to‐elevated self‐stigma, were randomly assigned to NECT or supportive group therapy and assessed at four time points over the course of nearly a year. Participants completed measures of self‐stigma, hope, self‐esteem, functioning, psychiatric symptoms, coping with symptoms, and narrative insight. RESULTS: Analyses indicated that NECT participants in outpatient sites improved significantly more over time in self‐stigma compared to supportive group therapy participants in outpatient sites, while NECT participants in comprehensive (including day treatment and psychiatric rehabilitation program) sites improved significantly more in hopelessness and narrative insight than other participants. NECT participants as a group showed decreases in the social withdrawal component of self‐stigma, decreased in their use of avoidant coping strategies, and were more engaged in treatment than supportive group therapy participants. There was no evidence for effects of NECT on social functioning or psychiatric symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that NECT primarily impacts self‐stigma and related outcomes, and that the degree of its effects is partially dependent on the treatment context in which it is offered.

AB  - BackgroundAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by high rates of co-morbid psychopathology. Randomized controlled trials of multimodal interventions, combining pharmacological and psychological treatments, have shown a robust treatment effect for ADHD symptoms but outcomes for co-morbid symptoms have been mixed. This may be accounted for by the type of intervention selected and/or by methodological problems including lack of follow-up and low power. The current study addressed these limitations in a parallel-group randomized controlled trial conducted in Iceland.MethodA total of 95 adult ADHD patients who were already being treated with medication (MED) were randomly assigned to receive treatment as usual (TAU/MED) or 15 sessions of cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT/MED) using the R&R2ADHD intervention which employs both group and individual modalities. Primary measures of ADHD symptoms and severity of illness, and secondary measures of anxiety, depression and quality of life were given at baseline, end of treatment and 3-month follow-up. Primary outcomes were rated by clinicians blind to treatment condition assignment.ResultsCBT/MED showed overall (combined outcome at end of treatment and 3-month follow-up) significantly greater reduction in primary outcomes for clinician-rated and self-rated ADHD symptoms. Treatment effect of primary outcomes was maintained at follow-up, which suggests robust and lasting findings. In contrast to the primary outcomes, the secondary outcomes showed significant improvement over time.ConclusionsThe study provides evidence for the effectiveness of R&R2ADHD and demonstrates that there are differential effects over time for ADHD symptoms versus co-morbid problems, the latter taking longer to show positive effects.

AB  - This randomized controlled pilot study compared a cognitive-behavioral therapy (Seeking Safety; SS) plus treatment-as-usual (TAU) to TAU-alone in 49 incarcerated women with substance use disorder (SUD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; full or subthreshold). Seeking Safety consisted of a voluntary group treatment during incarceration and individual treatment after prison release. TAU was required in the prison and comprised 180 to 240 hours of individual and group treatment over 6 to 8 weeks. Assessments occurred at intake, 12 weeks after intake, and 3 and 6 months after release from prison. There were no significant differences between conditions on all key domains (PTSD, SUD, psychopathology, and legal problems); but both conditions showed significant improvements from intake to later time points on all of these outcomes across time. Secondary analyses at follow-up found trends for SS participants improving on clinician-rated PTSD symptoms and TAU participants worsening on self-reported PTSD symptoms. Also, SS demonstrated continued improvement on psychopathology at 3 and 6 months, whereas TAU did not. However, alcohol use improved more for TAU during follow-up. Satisfaction with SS was high, and a greater number of SS sessions was associated with greater improvement on PTSD and drug use. Six months after release from prison, 53% of the women in both conditions reported a remission in PTSD. Study limitations include lack of assessment of SS outcomes at end of group treatment; lack of blind assessment; omission of the SS case management component; and possible contamination between the two conditions. The complex needs of this population are discussed.

AB  - Background: Anxiety and depressive disorders are common mental disorders. A substantial part of patients does not achieve symptomatic remission after treatment in specialized services. Current care as usual (CAU) for these patients consists of long-term supportive contacts. Termination of CAU is often not considered to be an option due to persistent symptoms, a low level of functioning, and the absence of further treatment options. A new intervention, ZemCAD, offers a program focused on rehabilitation and self-management, followed by referral back to primary care. Methods: This multicenter randomized controlled trial was carried out in twelve specialized outpatient mental health care services in the Netherlands. Consenting and eligible patients were invited for the MINI interview and the baseline questionnaire. Assessments were done at 6 (T1), 12 (T2) and 18 (T3) months post baseline. We used linear mixed model analysis (LMM) to ascertain the effectiveness of the ZemCAD group relative to the CAU group on quality of life, symptom severity and empowerment. Results: In total 141 patients were included. The results at 18-month follow-up regarding to quality of life and symptom severity, showed no significant differences between the ZemCAD group and the CAU group, except on the 'social relationships'-domain (d = 0.37). With regard to empowerment a significant difference between both groups was observed in the total empowerment score and one empowerment dimension (d = 0.45 and d = 0.39, respectively). After the ZemCAD intervention, more patients went from specialized outpatient mental health services back to a less specialized health care setting with less intensive treatment, such as primary care. Conclusion: The findings in this study suggest that patients with chronic and treatment-resistant anxiety and depression using the ZemCAD intervention improve on empowerment but not on symptom severity or quality of life. Since little is known about the effects of rehabilitation and self-management in patients with chronic and treatment resistant anxiety and depressive disorders, this is a first attempt to provide a proof-of-concept study in this under-researched but important field.

AB  - Background: This project studies the effect of group-based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) following Attention Bias Modification (ABM) on residual symptoms in recurrent depression. ACT is a cognitive-behavioral intervention combining acceptance and mindfulness processes with commitment and behavior-change processes. ACT enjoys modest empirical support in treating depression and has also shown promising results in secondary prevention of depression. The experimental cognitive bias modification (ABM) procedure has been shown to reduce surrogate markers of depression vulnerability in patients in remission from depression. The aim of the current project is to investigate if the effect of group-based ACT on reducing residual depressive symptoms can be enhanced by preceding it with ABM. Also, assessment of the relationship between conceptually relevant therapeutic processes and outcome will be investigated.Methods/design: An invitation to participate in this project was extended to 120 individuals within a larger sample who had just completed a separate randomized, multisite, clinical trial (referred to hereafter as Phase 1) in which they received either ABM (n = 60) or a control condition without bias modification (n = 60). This larger Phase-1 sample consisted of 220 persons with a history of at least two episodes of major depression who were currently in remission or not fulfilling the criteria of major depression. After its inclusion, Phase-1 participants from the Sørlandet site (n = 120) were also recruited for this study in which they received an 8-week group-based ACT intervention. Measures will be taken immediately after Phase 1, 1 month, 2 months, 6 months, and 1 year after the conclusion of Phase 1.Discussion: This study sequentially combines acceptable, nondrug interventions from neuropsychology and cognitive-behavioral psychology in treating residual symptoms in depression. The results will provide information about the effectiveness of treatment and on mechanisms and processes of change that may be valuable in understanding and further developing ABM and ACT, combined and alone.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, Identifier: NCT02648165 .

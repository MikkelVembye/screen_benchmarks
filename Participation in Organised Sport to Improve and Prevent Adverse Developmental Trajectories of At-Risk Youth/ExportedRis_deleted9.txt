AB  - Background: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT). NAFLD is associated with insulin resistance and hepatic inflammation. Similarly, patients with depression exhibit insulin resistance and increased inflammatory markers. However, no study has shown a clear association between elevated ALT and the development of depression. The aim of the study was to test whether elevated ALT, a surrogate marker for NAFLD, predicts the development of depression. Method: The present prospective cohort study investigated 12180 employed adults referred for health examinations that included fasting blood tests and anthropometric measurements between 2003 and 2010. Exclusion criteria were: baseline minor/major depression, excessive alcohol consumption and other causes for ALT elevation. Depression was evaluated by the eight-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) score. Results: The final cohort included 5984 subjects [69.4% men, aged 45.0 (s.D. = 10.24) years]. The incidence rate of minor and major depression was 3.8% and 1.4%, respectively. Elevated ALT was a significant independent predictor for the occurrence of minor [odds ratio (OR) 2.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.40-2.92] and major (OR 3.132, 95% CI 1.81-5.40) depression after adjusting for age, gender, body mass index, education level, serum levels of lipids, glucose, smoking and physical activity. Adding subjective health and affective state parameters (sleep disturbances, self-rated health, anxiety and burnout) as potential mediators only slightly ameliorated the association. Persistently elevated ALT was associated with the greatest risk for minor or major depression as compared with elevation only at baseline or follow-up (p for trend < 0.001). Conclusions: Elevated ALT was associated with developing depressive symptoms, thus suggesting that NAFLD may represent an independent modifiable risk factor for depression.

AB  - Educational reform efforts emphasize empowerment and engagement, but these concepts are rarely translated into policy or classroom practice. This inquiry explores how schools can become places where students take ownership over their own learning. Phase 1 of this inquiry, a survey of students from diverse high schools, examines pathways to school engagement. Results indicated that youth voice in decision-making, particularly when the experience is situated within supportive adult relationships and a sense of safety, significantly predicts emotional and cognitive engagement. Phase 2, a case study of an exemplary high school, sought to explain these pathways. Grounded in the theoretical perspectives of "empowered community settings" and "youth-adult partnership," analyses highlighted the importance of a shared belief system and core instructional activities that were student-centered, affirmative, and strength-based. Within this context, the opportunity role structure allowed students to exercise voice in creating their own educational program. The relational environment offered partnership and safety for academic risk-taking. Teachers broke down traditional roles and power hierarchies in ways that helped students discover their own sources of engagement. The article identifies ways that community psychologists, as policy framers and as researchers, can help schools become places of empowerment and engagement.

AB  - Adolescent sleep disturbances and affective disorders are common and co-occurring problems. There is a complex relationship between the developmental changes in sleep, the importance of sleep for this particular age-group, the development of affective disorders, and the changes in sleep associated with affective disorders. The purpose of the current study was to test preliminarily the efficacy of a mindfulness-based relaxation exercise for the improvement of sleep quality among a sample of normative adolescents. An experimental design was utilized and consisted of two conditions: mindfulness-based relaxation exercise and no change to sleep routine. A multi-method approach to sleep assessment was used such that sleep disturbance was self-reported by participants via electronic daily diary across seven days but also measured objectively using actigraphy to facilitate a more comprehensive assessment of sleep difficulties. Self-report measures collected at baseline and daily abbreviated versions of these measures assessed sleep quality, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, affect, worry, rumination, and mindfulness. Hierarchical linear modeling was utilized to examine whether the mindfulness-based relaxation exercise (a) improved sleep quality; (b) influenced affect; and (c) influenced rumination and worry. Primary analyses yielded no significant effects. However, moderation analyses revealed that mindfulness-based intervention appeared to have an impact on those individuals experiencing worse overall sleep quality, higher depressive symptoms, and higher trait-like ruminative tendencies across indices of sleep duration and sleep time. Gender analyses revealed improvements on sleep indices for females in the mindfulness-based intervention condition but detriment to sleep for males. Further research is needed with at-risk adolescent samples. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: Self-criticism has been proposed as a transdiagnostic predictor of disordered eating and nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI). First, this study explored cross-sectional associations of multiple disordered eating behaviors, NSSI, and self-criticism. Second, it tested longitudinal relations of self-criticism with disordered eating and NSSI, adjusting for baseline levels of both behaviors. Methods: In Sub-study 1, undergraduates (N = 251, 79.5% female, Mage = 19.1 years) completed self-report measures of disordered eating, NSSI, and self-criticism at baseline and after 8 weeks. In Sub-study 2, community-based young adults with histories of disordered eating, NSSI, or both (N = 517, 88.8% female, Mage = 24.7 years) completed measures of disordered eating, NSSI, and self-criticism at baseline and after 4 weeks. All measures were completed online. Results: In Sub-study 1, both disordered eating and NSSI showed significant crosssectional associations with self-criticism, and self-criticism was significantly related to binge eating, fasting, and NSSI at follow-up. In Sub-study 2, both behaviors again showed significant cross-sectional associations with self-criticism. Self-criticism showed significant longitudinal relations with fasting, purging, and excessive exercise. Longitudinal relations of self-criticism with NSSI varied across disordered eating behaviors. Discussion: NSSI showed cross-sectional associations with a range of disordered eating behaviors. Self-criticism reflects a common correlate of both disordered eating and NSSI. Evidence supported transdiagnostic longitudinal impact of self-criticism across multiple forms of disordered eating but provided more limited support for impacts on NSSI.

AB  - Objective Comorbidity of disordered eating (DE) behaviors and nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is linked to increased functional impairment. The present study identified subtypes of DE and NSSI comorbidity in a non-Western, low- and middle-income country where there has been particularly little research in this area. Method Latent profile analyses (LPA) were conducted to identify patterns of subgroup comorbidity in self-reported DE behaviors and NSSI behaviors, in a sample of Vietnamese high-school students (N = 1451, 51% female). Parallel-process LPA was used to predict NSSI subgroup membership from DE subgroup membership. Results A seven-class LPA model was identified for DE: (1) Low frequencies of all DE behaviors; (2) Frequent levels of all DE behaviors; (3) Frequent fasting and purging behaviors; (4) Frequent binge eating only; (5) Moderate binge eating; (6) Moderate fasting and purging behaviors; (7) Exercise and fasting. A two-class (high versus low) model was identified for NSSI. Odds of membership in the high-NSSI class were significantly increased for all DE classes except the class characterized by moderate binge eating. Odds of belonging to the high-NSSI class were highest for those in DE classes involving purging behaviors. Males predominated in classes characterized by high behavior dysregulation. Discussion DE and NSSI represent important clinical concerns among Vietnamese youth in urban contexts, and males may show particular vulnerability for certain risk behaviors. The association of classes of DE behaviors to NSSI was particularly strong for classes that involved purging, highlighting the importance of this specific behavior for understanding comorbidity of DE and NSSI. Public Significance Disordered eating and nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI; hurting oneself without intending to die) commonly co-occur. There has been less research on disordered eating and NSSI among individuals from non-Western or low/middle-income countries. We examined patterns of these behaviors in a school-based sample of Vietnamese adolescents. We found that patterns of disordered eating distinguished by purging showed particular links to NSSI, which could have implications for screening and treatment.

AB  - Objective:It is asserted that the more immediate and observable consequences of pediatric obesity are psychosocial in nature. This study examines the peer relations of clinically referred obese youth compared to demographically comparable nonoverweight peers within the classroom environment.Methods and Procedures:Peer-, teacher-, and self-reports of behavioral reputation (Revised Class Play (RCP)), and peer reports of social acceptance, nonsocial attributes (attractiveness, athleticism, academic competence), and health interference (school absence, illness, fatigue) were obtained regarding 90 obese youth (BMI > 95th percentile; 8-16 years, 57% girls, 50% African American) and 76 nonoverweight demographically similar comparison classmates. Result(s):Relative to comparison peers, obese children were nominated significantly less often as a best friend and rated lower in peer acceptance, although the two groups did not differ in the number of reciprocated friendships. Obese youth were described by peer, teacher, and self-report as more socially withdrawn and by peers as displaying less leadership and greater aggressive-disruptive behavior. Peers also described obese youth as less physically attractive, less athletic, more sick, tired, and absent from school. Being seen as less attractive and less athletic by peers helped to explain differences in obese and nonoverweight youth's levels of peer acceptance. Discussion(s):Clinically referred obese youth are characterized by peer relations that differ from those of nonoverweight youth. The peer environment provides a rich context to understand the social consequences of pediatric obesity as well as factors that could be targeted in intervention to promote more positive health and psychosocial outcomes. © 2008 The Obesity Society.

AB  - Objective: It is asserted that the more immediate and observable consequences of pediatric obesity are psychosocial in nature. This study examines the peer relations of clinically referred obese youth compared to demographically comparable nonoverweight peers within the classroom environment. Methods and Procedures: Peer-, teacher-, and self-reports of behavioral reputation (Revised Class Play (RCP)), and peer reports of social acceptance, nonsocial attributes (attractiveness, athleticism, academic competence), and health interference (school absence, illness, fatigue) were obtained regarding 90 obese youth (BMI > 95th percentile; 8-16 years, 57% girls, 50% African American) and 76 nonoverweight demographically similar comparison classmates. Results: Relative to comparison peers, obese children were nominated significantly less often as a best friend and rated lower in peer acceptance, although the two groups did not differ in the number of reciprocated friendships. Obese youth were described by peer, teacher, and self-report as more socially withdrawn and by peers as displaying less leadership and greater aggressive-disruptive behavior. Peers also described obese youth as less physically attractive, less athletic, more sick, tired, and absent from school. Being seen as less attractive and less athletic by peers helped to explain differences in obese and nonoverweight youth's levels of peer acceptance. Discussion: Clinically referred obese youth are characterized by peer relations that differ from those of nonoverweight youth. The peer environment provides a rich context to understand the social consequences of pediatric obesity as well as factors that could be targeted in intervention to promote more positive health and psychosocial outcomes.

AB  - The point was not to score runs, not from the girls' perspective, but to allow that special boy to make an out with you. To make him feel superior, to allow him to feel his prowess, was to make him fall in love with you. We didn't use words like "prowess" or even phrases like "falling in love" back then; we called it "liking" and "winning" as in "Teddy likes you (giggle, giggle) and he'll like you more if you let him win." I remember the first time she punched me in the stomach and knocked the wind out of me. She helped me off the ground and smiled. We were friends from that day afterward. There was something crazily likable about [Vicky]. I knew, I sensed, that she rarely punched anyone that she didn't like. Maybe we weren't good friends, but friends nonetheless, and I wanted to be her friend more than I wanted to be her enemy; embarrassment was better than pain. I knew that she would never hurt me again, she would never punch me again with quite the same, well, gusto as she did that first time. I understood something about Vicky; she was trying to make contact, trying to make friends, saying with her punches: we're not so different you and me, even though I'm gigantic and you're small, you can still feel my fist in your stomach. A fist in the stomach? A hug? What's the difference? Touch connects. Vicky's punch connected us. Still, I did not have the courage to approach Vicky about her counterproductive kickball habits. No one else did either. Vicky pushed [Lynne Stark] out of the way and kept running. All of us on the sidelines started yelling "Vicky you've got to go to the nurse, stop running around the bases. Vicky, GO TO THE NURSE!" We yelled it like it was the end of the world. We yelled it like it was a house on fire. We yelled it like it was a disease. "VICKY, GO TO THE NURSE!!!" How could we have known then that someday we would call our periods a "friend," a companion to usher away the terror of unwanted pregnancy?

AB  - Regular exercise plays an important preventive and therapeutic role in heart and vascular diseases, and beneficially affects brain function. In blood, the effects of exercise appear to be very complex and could include protection of vascular endothelial cells via neurotrophic factors and decreased oxidative stress. The purpose of this study was to identify the age-related changes in peripheral brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its relationship to oxidative damage and conventional cardiovascular disease (CVD) biomarkers, such as atherogenic index, C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and oxidized LDL (oxLDL), in active and inactive men. Seventeen elderly males (61–80 years) and 17 young males (20–24 years) participated in this study. According to the 6-min Åstrand-Rhyming bike test, the subjects were classified into active and inactive groups. The young and elderly active men had a significantly better lipoprotein profile and antioxidant status, as well as reduced oxidative damage and inflammatory state. The active young and elderly men had significantly higher plasma BDNF levels compared to their inactive peers. BDNF was correlated with VO₂max (r = 0.765, P < 0.001). In addition, we observed a significant inverse correlation of BDNF with atherogenic index (TC/HDL), hsCRP and oxLDL. The findings demonstrate that a high level of cardiorespiratory fitness reflected in VO₂max was associated with a higher level of circulating BDNF, which in turn was related to common CVD risk factors and oxidative damage markers in young and elderly men.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Poland's 2016 Report Card on Physical Activity for Children and Youth is the first assessment of child and youth physical activity (PA) in Poland using the Active Healthy Kids Global Alliance grading system. The main goal was to summarize and describe the current state of child and youth PA to increase awareness and surveillance., METHODS: The systematic methodology that underpins the Active Healthy Kids Canada Report Card was adapted and applied to the Polish report card. The best available data were consolidated, reviewed by a group of experts, and used to assign the letter grades to 9 core PA indicators on a scale ranging from A (highest) to F (lowest)., RESULTS: The 9 indicators were graded as such: 1) Overall Physical Activity (D), 2) Organized Sport Participation (C), 3) Active Play (INC), 4) Active Transportation (C), 5) Sedentary Behaviors (D), 6) Family and Peers (C), 7) School (B), 8) Community and the Built Environment (C), and 9) Government Strategies and Investments (C)., CONCLUSIONS: The final grades show a strong role of school in providing PA for children and youth in Poland. However, promotion of school-based sport participation appears to be insufficient by itself to sustainably promote PA in this group.

AB  - This article examines the potential and limitations of pedagogy of discomfort in a classroom of 10- and 11-year-old students of an integrated school in Northern Ireland. At the centre of the analysis are the students' and the teacher's emotional experiences and the resulting consequences when a discomforting pedagogical activity (an adaptation of the classic 'Blue-Eyed, Brown-Eyed' exercise) is implemented to teach students about social injustice. The theoretical framework that informs this investigation is grounded in the notion of 'pedagogy of discomfort'. A qualitative, ethnographic perspective forms the basis for the data collection and analysis. The findings show that the pedagogical exercise does not have the same impact on all participants, yet it contains several risks, most notably those of differential power and privilege between teacher and students and the ethical implications of putting some children (even temporarily) in a disadvantaged place. The implications are discussed in terms of teaching and learning through discomfort.

AB  - Objective: To identify predictors of persistent concussion symptoms (PCS) in children following concussion. Data Sources: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library to April 2012. Study Selection: A systematic review of the literature to identify prognosticators of PCS following pediatric concussion was conducted. Studies evaluating patients aged 2 years to 18 years with PCS were eligible. Main Outcome Measures: The association of clinically available factors with PCS development. Results: A literature search yielded 824 records; 561 remained after removal of duplicates. Fifteen studies were included in descriptive analysis; heterogeneity precluded a meta-analysis. Larger prospective studies concluded that the risk for PCS was increased in older children with loss of consciousness, headache, and/or nausea/vomiting. Smaller studies noted that initial dizziness may predict PCS. Patients with premorbid conditions (eg, previous head injury, learning difficulties, or behavioral problems) may also have increased risk. Conclusions: Minimal, and at times contradictory, evidence exists to associate clinically available factors with eventual development of PCS in children. Future trials must be adequately powered to determine which variables best predict the time to full symptom resolution. Expert consensus should delineate which postconcussion assessment measures are preferred to reduce heterogeneity going forward. Research to improve care for the epidemic of pediatric concussion depends on early identification of those most in need of intervention. JAMA Pediatr. 2013;167(3):259-265.

AB  - Introduction: Persistent postconcussive symptoms (PCSs) is the persistence of somatic, cognitive, physical, psychological and/or behavioural changes lasting more than 1 month following concussion. Persistent concussion impacts the quality of life through impaired cognition, memory and attention affecting school performance, mood and social engagement. No large epidemiological studies have determined the true prevalence of persistent concussion symptoms. Validated, easy-to-use prognosticators do not exist for clinicians to identify children at highest risk. The goal of Predicting and Preventing Postconcussive Problems in Pediatrics study is to derive a clinical prediction rule for the development of persistent postconcussion symptoms in children and adolescents presenting to emergency department following acute head injury. Methods and analysis: This study is a prospective, multicentre cohort study across nine academic Canadian paediatric emergency departments. We will recruit the largest prospective epidemiological cohort of children with concussion. Eligible children will be followed using Post-Concussion Symptom Inventory, a validated tool in children as young as 5 years. Patients will follow-up at 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks postinjury. The main outcome will be the presence/absence of PCSs defined as three or more persistent concussion symptoms 1 month following the injury. 1792 patients provide adequate power to derive a clinical decision rule using multivariate analyses to find predictor variables sensitive for detecting cases of persistent postconcussion symptoms. Ethics and dissemination: Results of this large prospective study will enable clinicians to identify children at highest risk, optimise treatment and provide families with realistic and appropriate anticipatory guidance. Ethics has been obtained through the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Research Ethics Board. Results will be disseminated at international conferences and in four manuscripts to peer-reviewed journals.

AB  - Objective: To assess the knowledge of paediatric concussion diagnosis and management among front-line primary care providers. Methods: Experts from the Concussions Ontario Diagnosis and Early Education Working Group developed a 34-item survey incorporating case vignettes with the collaboration of experts in medical education. Electronic surveys were distributed via FluidSurveys using a modified version of Dillman's tailored design method. The survey was distributed to five Ontario professional associations. The target participants were front-line health care providers (family physicians, emergency medicine physicians, general paediatricians, nurse practitioners and physician assistants) in Ontario; only providers who diagnose and/or manage paediatric concussions were eligible to participate. Results: The survey was fully completed by 577 health care providers who treat paediatric concussion. Of the respondents, 78% (95% CI 74% to 81%) reported diagnosing >= 5 concussions annually. Physicians and nonphysicians equally recognized concussion (90% [95% CI 86% to 92%]; 85% [95% CI 77% to 90%], respectively). Only 37% (95% CI 32% to 41%) of physicians correctly applied graduated return to play guidelines. Return to learn recommendations were also insufficient: 53% (95% CI 49% to 58%) neglected to recommend school absence and 40% (95% CI (35% to 44%) did not recommend schoolwork accommodations. Only 26% (95% CI 22% to 30%) of physicians reported regular use of concussion scoring scales. Conclusions: Considerable gaps in knowledge exist in front-line primary care providers with inadequate application of graduated return to play and return to learn following concussion, as demonstrated by the present broad population-based survey. Consistent application of best evidence-based management using comprehensive guidelines may help to reduce the impact of concussion and persistent postconcussive problems in children and adolescents.

AB  - Introduction: The diagnosis of concussion is a critical step in the appropriate management of patients following minor head trauma. The authors hypothesized that wide practice variation exists among pediatric emergency medicine physicians in the application of physical and cognitive rest recommendations following an acute concussion. Methods: The authors developed a 35-item questionnaire incorporating case vignettes to examine pediatric emergency physician knowledge of concussion diagnosis, understanding of initial management using return-to-play/school/work guidelines, use of existing concussion protocols, and perceived barriers to protocol use. Using a modified Dillman technique, the authors distributed an online survey to members of Pediatric Emergency Research Canada, a national association of pediatric emergency physicians. Results: Of 176 potential participants, 115 (65%) responded to the questionnaire, 89% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.81, 0.93) of whom reported having diagnosed 20 or more concussions annually. Although 90% (95% CI: 0.83, 0.94) of respondents adequately diagnosed concussion, only 64% (95% CI: 0.54, 0.72) correctly applied graduated return-to-play guidelines. Cognitive rest recommendations were also frequently limited: 40% (95% CI: 0.31, 0.49) did not recommend school absence, 30% (95% CI: 0.22, 0.39) did not recommend schoolwork reduction, and 35% (95% CI: 0.27, 0.45) did not recommend limiting screen time. Eighty percent (95% CI: 0.72, 0.87) of respondents reported having used guidelines frequently or always to guide clinical decisions regarding concussion. Conclusion: Despite a proficiency in the diagnosis of concussion, pediatric emergency physicians exhibit wide variation in recommending the graduated return to play and cognitive rest following concussion.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Approximately one-third of children experiencing acute concussion experience ongoing somatic, cognitive, and psychological or behavioral symptoms, referred to as persistent postconcussion symptoms (PPCS). However, validated and pragmatic tools enabling clinicians to identify patients at risk for PPCS do not exist. OBJECTIVE To derive and validate a clinical risk score for PPCS among children presenting to the emergency department. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Prospective, multicenter cohort study (Predicting and Preventing Postconcussive Problems in Pediatrics [5P]) enrolled young patients (aged 5-<18 years) who presented within 48 hours of an acute head injury at 1 of 9 pediatric emergency departments within the Pediatric Emergency Research Canada (PERC) network from August 2013 through September 2014 (derivation cohort) and from October 2014 through June 2015 (validation cohort). Participants completed follow-up 28 days after the injury. EXPOSURES All eligible patients had concussions consistent with the Zurich consensus diagnostic criteria. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomewas PPCS risk score at 28 days, which was defined as 3 or more new or worsening symptoms using the patient-reported Postconcussion Symptom Inventory compared with recalled state of being prior to the injury. RESULTS In total, 3063 patients (median age, 12.0 years [interquartile range, 9.2-14.6 years]; 1205 [39.3%] girls) were enrolled (n = 2006 in the derivation cohort; n = 1057 in the validation cohort) and 2584 of whom (n = 1701 [85%] in the derivation cohort; n = 883 [84%] in the validation cohort) completed follow-up at 28 days after the injury. Persistent postconcussion symptoms were present in 801 patients (31.0%) (n = 510 [30.0%] in the derivation cohort and n = 291 [33.0%] in the validation cohort). The 12-point PPCS risk score model for the derivation cohort included the variables of female sex, age of 13 years or older, physician-diagnosed migraine history, prior concussion with symptoms lasting longer than 1 week, headache, sensitivity to noise, fatigue, answering questions slowly, and 4 or more errors on the Balance Error Scoring System tandem stance. The area under the curve was 0.71 (95% CI, 0.69-0.74) for the derivation cohort and 0.68 (95% CI, 0.65-0.72) for the validation cohort. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A clinical risk score developed among children presenting to the emergency department with concussion and head injury within the previous 48 hours had modest discrimination to stratify PPCS risk at 28 days. Before this score is adopted in clinical practice, further research is needed for external validation, assessment of accuracy in an office setting, and determination of clinical utility.

AB  - Objectives: The multimedia technology integrates texts, images, graphics, and audio and video information by computers, so that they can establish the logical connection, integrate into an interactive system, and can acquire, compress, encode, edit, process, store and display various media information. The multimedia technology reflects the needs of the development of the modern education and the teaching technology, helps stimulate the students' interests in sports learning, promotes the correct understanding of the concepts of actions, and plays an important role in improving the effect of the physical education teaching. This paper analyses the necessity of the multimedia technology teaching in the badminton teaching, and puts forward a series of the implementation strategies, in order to provide the useful reference for promoting the effect of the badminton teaching. Methods : Although the multimedia teaching has many advantages, some of its shortcomings are often the advantages of the traditional teaching. To improve the quality of the multimedia teaching, the preferred method is to promote the organic combination of the multimedia teaching and the traditional teaching, to realize the grafting of the information technology and the traditional teaching mode, so as to complement each other's advantages and avoid the disadvantages. The vast majority of the teachers have accumulated a lot of the valuable experience in the long-term traditional teaching process, and they still need to play a full role in the modern multimedia teaching. For example, in the traditional teaching process, the body language plays a positive role in the teaching effect. The so-called body language, including the appearance temperament, behaviors, voices, smiles and emotions and other beautiful body languages can enable the students to better communicate with the teachers. The correct use of the multimedia means with the teachers' body language can better improve the teaching effect. We must not read the texts according to the computers rigidly, so that the computer teaching becomes a modern version of the "copy-based propaganda" type of teaching. Results : The multimedia assisted instruction plays the leading role of the teachers and the main role of the students, improves students' imagination, and cultivates their thinking abilities and the ability to analyze and solve problems. In the process of our learning, students use the visual and vivid simulation steps to understand and master the relevant knowledge of skills and tactics learned, and practice to complete the learning tasks. This way of the teachers and the students participating in the teaching feedback the information of the teaching and the learning, communicate the feelings of the teachers and the students, can give full play to the leading role of the teachers and the main role of the students, and achieve the good teaching purposes. The multimedia-assisted teaching can help the students understand and memorize the information technological knowledge, establish the image thinking, and improve the ability to analyze and solve problems. The multimedia-assisted teaching enriches the teaching methods, enables the students to accurately grasp the concepts of actions, and effectively improve the sports skills. The multimedia teaching solves the problems that the theoretical and practical knowledge cannot be well combined in the conventional badminton teaching. In the process of explaining the badminton techniques and tactics, it is difficult to describe some technical actions in words, and especially those completed instantaneously. Then, the use of the multimedia courseware can get rid of the influence of the time and space factors on the teachers, positioning the instantaneous completed action process in time and space, highlighting the importance and difficulties, so that students can establish a correct visual and dynamic representation, so as to grasp the correct concepts of the technical actions, and effectively improve the technical skills. Conclusions : The multimedia-assisted instruction (MAI) is an intuitive and vivid, which can arouse the enthusiasms of their learning and broaden the students' horizons and improve the rate of the resource sharing. The new, vivid and intuitive MAI has innovated the traditional teaching mode. Using the multimedia to create a better situation and the emotional experience can mobilize the students' multi-sensory participation in the teaching activities, create a learning atmosphere, stimulate the students' enthusiasms for the active learning, and achieve the purpose of improving the classroom teaching efficiency. All levels of the learners and the educators can quickly access and share various kinds of the rich educational information through the network.

AB  - Using the Adapted Questionnaire of Soccer Athlete's Motivation and Health Related Behaviors[superscript -Chinese Version] (AQSAMHRB), this study examined essential factors that motivate youth athletes to participate in soccer practices and competitions. Participants included 98 male soccer athletes (aged 14-15) from 10 middle schools of Jiangsu province, China. Data analysis included descriptive statistics and a 2 (Supporting: By Parents or By School) × 2 (Goal-Setting: For Professional or For Non-Professional) MANOVA. The top three scores from the 18 motivation factors (MFs) in the AQSAMHRB included MF1, high technical content and unique value, M = 4.73; MF4, to meet friends, M = 4.42; and MF2, for fun, M = 4.34. The 2 × 2 MANOVA revealed no significant difference in Supporting, p > 0.32, ? = 0.79, F = 1.16, but a significant difference in Goal-Setting, p < 0.00, ? = 0.03, F = 143.61. The follow-up MANOVA discovered that 12 of the 18 MF comparisons in Goal-Setting showed significant difference at p < 0.05, with For Professional scoring higher than For Non-Professional (e.g., MF6, to contest winners; MF7, to shape the body; MF9, to become a professional; and MF17, to become a coach). In brief, intrinsic and extrinsic MFs significantly affected these soccer athletes' motivations. It did not matter who supported their participation, but it was their Goal-Setting on becoming a Professional or Non-Professional athlete that mattered. On the other hand, for the 27 health-related behaviors in the AQSAMHRB, frequency and percentage data were analyzed and summarized. Findings from this aspect provide firsthand information about the youth soccer athletes' eating habits, nutrition knowledge and status, risk behaviors, and hygiene behaviors. A meaningful discussion from an educational perspective has also been provided.

AB  - Instructors of introductory college physics courses are in a unique position to explain the physics of skateboarding and its associated risks. A field trip to a skate park to explore the law of conservation of energy and measure the impact forces can enhance student analytical thinking skills and their appreciation of physics in everyday life. Through the measurement of the impact forces and student discussions of their own skateboarding experiences, students are better prepared to protect themselves from skateboarding-related physical injuries.

AB  - Introduction: Traumatic dislocation of the hip is a serious lesion, and its obturator variety is rarely reported. It always reflects a high-energy trauma and represents a therapeutic emergency that requires a reduction in less than 6 h due to the risk of aseptic necrosis of the femoral head in the long term. Case report: We reported 2 cases of hip obturator dislocation in patients aged 21 and 45 years respectively, which occurred following a road accident, received for pain and functional impairment of the hip, and in a typical attitude with hip flexion, abduction, rotation and knee flexion with no downstream limb vascular-nervous injury. The emergency reduction in <6 h, in two cases, followed by functional treatment by offloading for 8 weeks and support of the limb with the resumption of walking had been authorized at 3 months with a return to sport at 16 weeks; made it possible to obtain satisfactory results at 18 months of follow-up, with an absence of a functional gene, stiffness and without signs of necrosis of the femoral head. Discussion and conclusion: Traumatic obturator dislocation of the hip constitutes serious lesions and requires early and appropriate management, reduced to closed focus, treated functionally give excellent results in the medium term. The patient must be carefully monitored over the long term and be warned of the risks he runs.Copyright © 2022

AB  - Religiousness is rarely studied as protective factor against substance use and misuse in sport. Further, we have found no investigation where college-age athletes were sampled and studied accordingly. The aim of the present study was to identify gender-specific protective effects of the religiousness (measured by Santa Clara Questionnaire) and other social, educational, and sport variables as a potential factors of hesitation against doping behaviors in sport-science-students from Mostar, Bosnia, and Herzegovina (51 women and 111 men; age range, 18-26). The gender differences for the non-parametric variables were established by Kruskall-Wallis test, while for the parametric variables the t-test for independent samples was used. Multiple regression calculations revealed religiousness as the most significant predictor of the social, health, sport and legal factors of hesitation against doping behaviors in both genders. However, the differential influence of the social, educational, sport and religious factors in relation to negative consequences of the doping behaviors is found for men and women. Such differential influence must be emphasized in tailoring the anti-doping policy and interventions.

AB  - Objective: The community of residence (ie, urban vs rural) is one of the known factors of influence on substance use and misuse (SUM). The aim of this study was to explore the community-specific prevalence of SUM and the associations that exist between scholastic, familial, sports and sociodemographic factors with SUM in adolescents from Bosnia and Herzegovina. Method(s): In this cross-sectional study, which was completed between November and December 2014, the participants were 957 adolescents (aged 17 to 18 years) from Bosnia and Herzegovina (485; 50.6% females). The independent variables were sociodemographic, academic, sport and familial factors. The dependent variables consisted of questions on cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption. We have calculated differences between groups of participants (gender, community), while the logistic regressions were applied to define associations between the independent and dependent variables. Result(s): In the urban community, cigarette smoking is more prevalent in girls (OR=2.05; 95% CI 1.27 to 3.35), while harmful drinking is more prevalent in boys (OR=2.07; 95% CI 1.59 to 2.73). When data are weighted by gender and community, harmful drinking is more prevalent in urban boys (OR=1.97; 95% CI 1.31 to 2.95), cigarette smoking is more frequent in rural boys (OR=1.61; 95% CI 1.04 to 2.39), and urban girls misuse substances to a greater extent than rural girls (OR=1.70; 95% CI 1.16 to 2.51,OR=2.85; 95% CI 1.88 to 4.31,OR=2.78; 95% CI 1.67 to 4.61 for cigarette smoking, harmful drinking and simultaneous smoking-drinking, respectively). Academic failure is strongly associated with a higher likelihood of SUM. The associations between parental factors and SUM are more evident in urban youth. Sports factors are specifically correlated with SUM for urban girls. Conclusion(s): Living in an urban environment should be considered as a higher risk factor for SUM in girls. Parental variables are more strongly associated with SUM among urban youth, most probably because of the higher parental involvement in children' personal lives in urban communities (ie, college plans, for example). Specific indicators should be monitored in the prevention of SUM.Copyright © 2020 SAE International. All rights reserved.

AB  - Insufficient physical activity and alcohol consumption (AC) are important health-threat-ening behaviors in adolescence, but there are controversial findings regarding the association that may exist between AC and physical activity levels (PALs) at this age. This study aimed to prospec-tively examine the relationship that may exist between AC and PAL in younger adolescence, con-sidering the potential confounding effect of sports participation. The participants (n = 669, 337 fe-males) were adolescents from Bosnia and Herzegovina who were tested on two occasions, at baseline (14 years of age) and again at follow-up (16 years of age). The variables included AC (as indicated by the AUDIT questionnaire), sports participation, age, gender (predictors), and PAL (ob-tained by the PAQ-A questionnaire) criterion. The results indicated that PAL at baseline was higher in those adolescents (boys) with a higher AUDIT score, but this association was partially con-founded by sports participation. Multinomial regression indicated a higher risk of a decline in PAL over the study course in adolescents with a higher AUDIT score at baseline (OR = 1.32, 95%CI: 1.11- 1.54 for being in the high-risk group for a decline in PAL). The most probable explanation is likely found in the high drop-out from sports in the studied period and earlier initiation of AC in adolescents involved in sports. Public health and sports authorities should urgently act preventively and develop educational programs against alcohol drinking in youth athletes.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Environments that make it easier for people to incorporate physical activity into their daily life may help to reduce high rates of cardiometabolic conditions. Local zoning codes are a policy and planning tool to create more walkable and bikeable environments. This study evaluated relationships between active living-oriented zoning code environments and cardiometabolic conditions (body mass index, hyperlipidemia, hypertension). The study used county identifiers to link electronic health record and other administrative data for a sample of patients utilizing primary care services between 2012 and 2016 with county-aggregated zoning code data and built environment data. The analytic sample included 7,441,991 patients living in 292 counties in 44 states. Latent class analysis was used to summarize municipal- and unincorporated county-level data on seven zoning provisions (e.g., sidewalks, trails, street connectivity, mixed land use), resulting in classes that differed in strength of the zoning provisions. Based on the probability of class membership, counties were categorized as one of four classes. Linear and logistic regression models estimated cross-sectional associations with each cardiometabolic condition. Models were fit separately for youth (aged 5-19), adults (aged 20-59), and older adults (aged 60+). Little evidence was found that body mass index in youth, adults, or older adults or the odds of hyperlipidemia or hypertension in adults or older adults differed according to the strength of active living-oriented zoning. More research is needed to identify the health impacts of zoning codes and whether alterations to these codes would improve population health over the long term.

AB  - Background: Unprotected sexual intercourse can lead to serious and long-lasting effects, most notably unplanned pregnancy and STI transmission. Increasing rates among people in their twenties indicate that young adults are just as vulnerable to the consequences of unprotected sex as sexually-active teenagers. Additionally, there is strong support for the inclusion of men in reproductive health and STI research. The presence of males in these studies is imperative to gaining a comprehensive view of the most relevant factors influencing decisions of barrier protection during penile-vaginal sex. This dissertation aims to examine the associations of reproductive health factors on consistent condom use among U.S. young adult men. Methods: Data originated from interviews conducted for the 2006-2008 cycle of the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG). Respondents were sexually active 18-29 year old males who were not currently trying to impregnate a female partner (N = 2,010 total sample). Multinomial logistic regressions, adjusting for age, marital status, race/ethnicity, work status and educational level, assessed the likelihood of consistent condom use in the past four weeks (n = 1,512) and in the past 12 months (n = 1,856). Mediation analyses, using binary variables, investigated the potential mediating effects of fertility desires and HIV concerns on consistent condom use. Results: Older age at sex debut, current pregnancy, multiple female partners, female contraceptive use at last sex, a high chance of feeling less physical pleasure, concerns about HIV, and ever having tested for HIV were significantly associated with both outcomes assessing consistent condom use. Fertility desires did not serve as a mediator on either association of parity and consistent condom use. Males with multiple female partners in the past 12 months were more likely to have HIV concerns but those with HIV concerns were less likely to wear condoms consistently. Conclusions: Evidence from this study suggests that various reproductive health factors are associated with consistent condom use among males.

AB  - Background/Diagnosis: Like most people who live with a chronic illness and/or autoimmune disease, my story started long before I realized. Symptoms came and went throughout my life without any answers. I headed to nursing school during college and things really went south after I was hit by a truck as a pedestrian, run over while I was crossing a street. I believe if I could survive that, there isn't much else life can throw at me that could get me down! At the age of 23, I was diagnosed with Lupus after I suffered a small stroke and had a variety of classic symptoms come out at once. When you are in your twenties, receiving a diagnosis of a disease that has no cure and can be life-threatening is frightening and leaves you with a sense of uncertainty. I had never met anyone else with Lupus and most people were unfamiliar with it. Over the years, the disease has taught me so much about how strong I truly am. It has also shaped my character and personality. Today I am even more motivated to accomplish my dreams because I know how quickly life can be taken away. I am dedicated, even more, compassionate towards others, and have a deeper focus on the important things in life. Treatment: Through dietary changes and exercise and complementary therapies, I have been able to decrease certain lupus symptoms, increase energy, and improve my overall quality of life. Working with an allergist and nutritionist helped me determine what I was allergic to, and also how to add anti-inflammatory foods into my diet. Eating cleaner, preparing my own meals, and juicing increase my energy and even improved some of my vitamin and mineral levels in my blood work over the past few years. Adding restorative yoga when I am feeling well has helped me with anxiety and the overall stress of living with a chronic illness. It has also made my body feel stronger and in more control. Last, adding functional medicine supplements and working with a functional medicine doctor as part of my healthcare team, I have been able to increase energy and decrease some inflammation thanks to different herbal compounds and supplements. Maintenance: Above and beyond my regular treatments for lupus, I am also the founder and editor in chief of "LupusChick", an online nonprofit that has been a tremendous source of hope and support for me and those in our community. Being surrounded by and having contact with a half a million people per month who are living with lupus and other chronic illnesses, who "get it", help me get through the difficult moments, flare-ups, and daily struggles that my medical team sometimes doesn't personally understand. Quality of Life: All of this in combination with my regular medication, rest, and a positive attitude has made quite a difference in my life. *AstraZeneca has provided sponsorship to cover the cost of the submission of this poster to the ACR, as well as travel and subsistence for the presenting author. AstraZeneca has had no involvement or input into the content or development of the poster, with the exception of support for layout and design.

AB  - Eating disorders are extremely common and carry a high degree of medical and psychiatric morbidity. These disorders are challenging to treat because many patients deny their symptoms, have poor motivation to change, and can become frustrating to the clinician. Case identification based upon suggested screening questions and ongoing management of medical consequences are important roles for the obstetrician/gynecologist involved in the care of these patients. This chapter discusses the benefits and limitations of contemporary treatment, special populations at risk (e.g. athletes, diabetics), and screening guidelines for office practice. Signs, symptoms, laboratory abnormalities, and the perils of associated psychiatric illness are briefly reviewed. Patients do respond to a comprehensive, integrated treatment plan that includes nutritional stabilization, psychotherapy, and pharmacotherapy. Collaboration between all professionals involved in the patient's care is essential for state-of-the-art care. Those patients who become pregnant or wish to become pregnant pose certain additional treatment considerations. Ongoing and future research aimed at understanding how eating disorders develop - and may be prevented by early identification and education - will result in enhanced knowledge of these life-threatening and often chronic illnesses in the 21st century.

AB  - This social psychological laboratory activity permits the systematic observation of spontaneous human behavior as simulated on television and provides one way to effectively demonstrate and compare time sampling, event sampling, and trait rating techniques. The preparation involves videotaping a popular television show that depicts observable interpersonal behaviors. The entire lab exercise involves a lecture, the lab activity, and class discussion. A lecture about the guidelines, advantages, disadvantages, and data analysis of structured observational techniques is given. The class "walks through" the preparation, development, and completion of each technique. The class is then divided into three groups, each of which is responsible for the development of all components of one structured technique . The class reconvenes to observe the taped program with each student independently recording samples of behavior, using the method and data sheets constructed by their subgroup. Group reliability coefficients are calculated. The class then discusses the relative advantages/disadvantages of each method, the importance of precise operational definitions on the precision of inter-rater agreement, and the defining characteristics of scientific observation. This is an excellent activity for an in-class comparison of different structured observational techniques. Students have responded well to it and many reported a better comprehension of the methods.

AB  - Intensive gymnastics training places the skeletally immature athlete at risk for certain acute and overuse injuries. An understanding of the sport of gymnastics is essential in dealing with the young gymnast. This article summarizes the changes that have occurred in the sport and how these changes may affect the risk for injuries. Diagnosis and management of common acute and overuse injuries of the extremities and spine are reviewed. The female athlete triad (disordered eating, amenorrhea, and osteoporosis) is discussed in the context of gymnastics.

AB  - Primary objective: We assess the potential of a panel of serum biomarkers to identify chronic neuronal injury in amateur boxers as compared to healthy controls without any history of head trauma. Research design: Observational case-control study. Methods and procedures: A panel of serum biomarkers was measured by a novel biochip array technique on the Evidence Investigator. Serum samples were taken after a 2-month period of nonparticipation in boxing. Main outcomes and results: Boxers had higher serum levels of neuron-specific enolase (NSE, median [range] 11 [2.3-41] ng/mL) than controls (4.8 [0.78-27] ng/mL, p = 0.014) but unchanged levels of the other brain damage biomarker candidates, S-100B, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and heart-type fatty acid binding protein. Conclusions: The more than doubled median serum level of NSE in boxers after an extended resting period suggests that repetitive head trauma results in sustained release of this brain-specific protein to the peripheral circulation.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Even though child bicyclists are highly vulnerable in traffic only few studies focused on providing child bicyclists with means to enhance their abilities to deal with the complexity of dynamic traffic situations. The current study therefore evaluated whether a brief hazard perception intervention might be effective to improve hazard perception skills in child bicyclists towards a level more comparable to adult bicyclists., METHODS: Eighty children of the fourth grade (9.03+/-0.43 years; 34 girls) and forty-six adults (34.67+/-14.25 years age; 24 woman) first performed a Hazard Perception test for bicyclists. Response rate, reaction times, first fixation, duration of the first fixation, dwell time and total number of fixations on the events were measured. Next, the children took part in the HP intervention in which video clips of dangerous traffic situations were presented. The intervention comprised two classroom sessions of one hour (1/week). A post-test was performed one day after and the retention-test three weeks after the intervention., RESULTS: Children responded to more covert hazards immediately after the intervention (p<0.05), but did not improve their response rate for overt hazards. Reaction times for the covert hazards improved on the post-test (p<0.001) compared to the pre-test but this effect was reduced on the retention test. There was no effect of the intervention for entry time of the first fixation but the duration of the first fixation increased for the covert hazards (p<0.05). Children made fewer fixations on the event compared to adults (p<0.001), except for the covert hazards on the retention-test. The training also increased the number of fixations for the overt hazards on the post-test (p<0.001) and the retention-test (p<0.001) but only increased on the retention test for the covert hazards (p<0.001)., CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that a brief intervention for training hazard perception skills in child bicyclists is able to improve children's situation awareness and hazard perception for potential dangerous situations. The training, however, was too short to improve children to higher adult levels.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - For the eleventh consecutive year, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) compiled this statistical report regarding student-athlete race, ethnicity and resident alien status in intercollegiate athletics at its member institutions. This information provides a general view of recent historical student-athlete race and ethnicity trends by gender, sport and division. The first section of this report describes factors that affect the data, offers suggestions for the reader, defines the race and ethnicity categories and provides findings by division. The second section provides student-athlete race and ethnicity percentages for each sport in separate tables by year, division and for the NCAA overall. Next, the percentages in those tables are illustrated via graphs overall and by division. Separate graphs for the minority categories only are also in this section. Following the graphs section, estimated frequency tables are presented in the same format as the percentages tables. The last two sections restate the nine year's worth of percentage and estimated frequency data in separate tables for each sport. For the 2006-07 through the current report, tables were added detailing the resident alien status of the student athletes separately from their race/ ethnicity. Previously these categories were combined, but now have been separated for greater accuracy in reporting. Therefore, because of the removal of resident alien as a choice among ethnic categories, the other ethnicities will increase accordingly. Student-athletes whose ethnicities were previously identified as nonresident alien are now identified with an ethnic category and identified separately as nonresident aliens. This is particularly relevant in certain sports such as tennis, skiing, squash and ice hockey which each have over 20 percent of total participants identified as having nonresident alien status. So some increases in ethnic percentages can be attributed to this change in methodology.

AB  - Background: Since coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, its terrible infectiousness has caused great panic, anxiety and poor sleep quality to the vulnerable adolescent populations. Methods: This cross-sectional online survey recruited 10 569 Chinese junior and senior high school adolescents during 31 January to 9 February 2020. Basic socio-demographic information, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Fear of negative evaluation (FNE) were included in the survey. The chi(2) and logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors correlated with poor sleep quality. Results: The prevalence of poor sleep quality was 18.6% in the Chinese adolescent population. The average score of PSQI was 3.39 (SD = 2.64), which was significantly correlated with scores for anxiety (r = 0.50, p < 0.01), and FNE (r = 0.36, p < 0.01). Adjusted logistic regression indicated that gender (females) and education (senior high school) were associated with poor sleep quality, while living in Hubei Province and time spent on the COVID-19 information were inversely associated with poor sleep quality. Having a family member or friend infected/suspected and spending time on electronics were associated with higher odds of having poor sleep quality. Adolescents with anxiety were 8 times, and those with FNE were three times more likely than ones without anxiety or FNE to have poor sleep quality. In addition, the number of meals, exercise time and diet quality were also significantly associated with sleep quality. (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Poor sleep quality was common during the COVID-19 pandemic in Chinese adolescents. Understanding several factors associated with the poor sleep quality will offer some important insights into determining potential interventions to improve sleep quality during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Background: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is an important indicator when evaluating prognosis and disease-related treatments. Our current knowledge of the HRQoL outcomes of unruptured intracranial aneurysm (UIA) patients treated by the endovascular intervention appeared to be very limited. To fill this gap, the present study investigated the HRQoL outcomes and identified the influencing factors in UIA patients treated by endovascular intervention. Methods: We conducted a single-center cross-sectional study on patients who underwent endovascular treatment for UIAs. HRQoL outcomes were assessed by the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). The SF-36 results of the Chinese reference population were used as the reference data. The independent variables with a univariate analysis result of P < 0.05 were included in the multivariate analysis. Finally, multivariable linear regression analysis was performed to identify the factors influencing HRQoL. Bonferroni correction was utilized for multiple testing correction. Results: A total of 200 patients (83 males and 117 females, mean age of 55.2 ± 9.48 years) with UIAs treated by endovascular intervention were enrolled. The scores of SF-36 in 8 domains for UIA patients treated by endovascular intervention did not all reach the average level of the Chinese reference population after an average recovery period of 30.67 ± 8.6 months. Ischemic cerebrovascular disease history, advanced age, and mRS progression at discharge were independent risk factors of HRQoL for UIA patients treated by endovascular intervention, but physical exercise at least once a week and daily sleep time no < 6 h were independent protective factors. Conclusion: The HRQoL of UIA patients treated by the endovascular intervention was decreased to varying degrees compared with those of the Chinese reference population. The influencing factors of HRQoL explored by this study provide insights for improving the clinical management and daily lives of these patients. HRQoL assessment should be included in future aneurysm prognostic studies to provide better evidence. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Introduction: Ankle injury is an acute soft tissue pathology where the ankle ligaments are distended, lacerated, or ruptured due to violence during sport. This joint is also one of the most vulnerable in sports. After an injury, immediate and adequate care is significant in reducing pain and complication. Objective: Statistically analyze the sports injuries of the ankle cases, determining the principal reasons for injury and outlining preventive measures. Methods: A statistical investigation on the sports injuries of 275 Qiqihar higher education students was performed with questionnaires and teaching practice methods. The research was focused on the injured structures and the injury causes analysis. In parallel, corresponding proposals aimed at preventing these sports injuries were raised. Results: Joint injuries and ankle sprains followed by hematomas represented the most significant proportion of ankle injuries.The reasons are lack of physical fitness, lack of awareness of self-protection, inadequate preparation in the sporting environment facilities, and performing tasks outside what the superior specified was specified. Conclusion: Medical work needs to increase dissemination so that people realize the causes of sports injuries. At the same time, it helps people master the care measures before and after the injury. This reduces the incidence of sports injuries and reduces the occurrence of complications.

AB  - Statistics is a critical tool for robustness analysis, measurement system error analysis, test data analysis, probabilistic risk assessment, and many other fields in the engineering world. Traditionally, however, statistics is not extensively used in undergraduate engineering technology (ET) programs, resulting in a major disconnect from industry expectations. The research question: How to effectively integrate statistics into the curricula of ET programs, is in the foundation of this paper. Based on the best practices identified in the literature, a unique "learning-by-using" approach was deployed for the Electronics Engineering Technology Program at Texas A&M University. Simple statistical concepts such as standard deviation of measurements, signal to noise ratio, and Six Sigma were introduced to students in different courses. Design of experiments (DOE), regression, and the Monte Carlo method were illustrated with practical examples before the students applied the newly understood tools to specific problems faced in their engineering projects. Industry standard software was used to conduct statistical analysis on real results from lab exercises. The result from a pilot project at Texas A&M University indicates a significant increase in using statistics tools in course projects by students. Data from student surveys in selected classes indicate that students gained more confidence in statistics. These preliminary results show that the new approach is very effective in applying statistics to engineering technology programs.

AB  - Background: Limited evidence to show the longitudinal associations between maternal dietary patterns and antenatal depression (AD) from cohort studies across the entire gestation period. Methods: Data came from the Chinese Pregnant Women Cohort Study. The qualitative food frequency questionnaire (Q-FFQ) and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) were used to collect diet and depression data. Dietary patterns were derived by using factor analysis. Generalized estimating equation models were used to analyze the association between diet and AD. Results: A total of 4139 participants finishing 3-wave of follow-up were finally included. Four constant diets were identified, namely plant-based, animal-protein, vitamin-rich and oily-fatty patterns. The prevalence of depression was 23.89%, 21.12% and 22.42% for the first, second and third trimesters. There were reverse associations of plant-based pattern (OR:0.85, 95%CI:0.75–0.97), animal-protein pattern (OR:0.85, 95%CI:0.74–0.99) and vitamin-rich pattern (OR:0.58, 95%CI:0.50–0.67) with AD, while a positive association between oily-fatty pattern and AD (OR:1.47, 95%CI:1.29–1.68). Except for the plant-based pattern, other patterns had linear trend relationships with AD (Ptrend < 0.05). Moreover, a 1-SD increase in vitamin-rich pattern scores was associated with a 20% lower AD risk (OR:0.80, 95%CI:0.76–0.84), while a 1-SD increase in oily-fatty pattern scores was associated with a 19% higher risk (OR:1.19, 95%CI:1.13–1.24). Interactions between dietary patterns and lifestyle habits were observed. Limitations: The self-reported Q-FFQ and EPDS may cause recall bias. Conclusions: There are longitudinal associations between maternal dietary patterns and antenatal depression. Our findings are expected to provide evidence for a dietary therapy strategy to improve or prevent depression during pregnancy. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Aim: To explore the effectiveness of group counseling on promoting interpersonal abilities of poverty undergraduates. Method(s): With scales and clinical structured interviews including 6 items, 32 poverty undergraduates were chosen from a science college in Jiangsu province during April 2004.The subjects were matched into 2 groups: experiment group with 16 people, who joined the training activity, equilibrium control group with 16 people, who did not join the training activity, and non-equilibrium control group with 20 people, who were not poverty students. All the students were measured with scales to test the psychological training. (1) Buss Shyness Scale (RSS) (13 items) was performed to assess the shyness in undergraduates assessed by a 5-Likert scale, and high score meant high shyness degree. (2) Self-esteem Inventory (SEI) (58 items)was conducted to evaluate the self-esteem in undergraduates. Narrated by the first person. Every one of which was selected between "like me" and "unlike me" and the former scores 1 and the latter scores 0. The former represented high self-esteem;the latter represented low self-esteem. (3) Personal Emotion Inventory (PEI) (54 items) was performed to test self-confidence in undergraduates, including 6 dimensions: Academic work, athletic sports, look, love relation, social interaction and talking with people assessed by a 4-Likert scale, the higher score meant the higher self-confidence. 4 Emotional and Social Loneliness Scale (ESLS) (10 items) was conducted to measure social loneliness and emotional loneliness used 5 grade assessment, the high score represented the high loneliness. Group counseling was composed of 6 stages. All groups were administrated with four scales before experiment.Experiment group was retested with the same scales after group counseling and the other groups at the same time. Result(s): Fifty-two undergraduates were all completed tests, and i nvolved in the result analysis. (1) After group counseling changes of shyness in undergraduates of every group:The RSS had significant group and training effects, and existed the interaction (F=10.24,P < 0.001). The score on shyness after training was lower significantly than that before training [(43.86 +/-12.38), (37.94+/-8.56),F(1,51)=12.57,P < 0.001]. (2) Changes of self-esteem after group counseling: There were obviously group and training effects, and existed interaction (F(2,50)=10.04,P < 0.001). After training, the self-esteem in experiment group was apparently higher than that before training [(41.72+/-12.89), (33.54+/-33.54)F(1,51)=13.43,P < 0.001]. (3) Changes of self-confidence after group counseling:There were significantly group and training effects, and the interaction existed (F(2.50)=12.30,P < 0.001). After training it was remarkably higher in the experiment group than that before training [(98.64+/-20.41), (75.38+/-12.47),F (1,51)=14.62,P < 0.001]. 4 Changes of ESLS after group counseling: There were significantly group and training active effects, and interaction existed (F(2,50)=13.10,P < 0.001). After training it was lower significantly in the experiment group than that before training [(36.42+/-10.32), (41.25+/-12.34)F(1,51)=11.24,P < 0.001]. Conclusion(s): The shyness, self-esteem and self-confidence with e motional and social loneliness in the experiment group are improved significantly as compared with the equilibrium control group in poverty students, and have insignificant difference with non-poverty students in the non-equilibrium control group, which indicates that group psychological counseling is an effective way on improving interpersonal abilities of poverty undergraduates.

AB  - Aim: To observe the changes of the swimming velocity of rats after paradoxical sleep deprivation(PSD), so as to provide certain scientific methods for exercise training. Method(s): Rat models of 24, 48 and 72-hour PSD were established by using the flower pot technique in the Department of Anatomy, Lanzhou Medical College in April 2003. The swimming velocity of rats was recorded automatically with the Morris water maze test system. The data were analyzed with the one-way analysis of variance(ANOVA) with completely randomized design followed by a student-Newman-Keuls(SNK) for subsequent multiple comparisons between groups. Result(s): The swimming velocities of rats in the 24, 48 and 72-hour PSD groups[(24.79 +/- 1.50), (27.73 +/- 4.89), (28.21 +/- 2.95) cm/s] were significantly higher than those in the large platform group [(20.85 +/- 3.49), (21.13 +/- 2.78), (19.85 +/- 3.64) cm/s] and normal control group [(19.95 +/- 3.19), (20.13 +/- 6.13), (22.94 +/- 3.91) cm/s], and kept at higher levels (P < 0.05). The swimming velocity was gradually increased while the increasing range was gradually reduced with the increase of deprivation time among the 24, 48 and 72-hour PSD groups. Conclusion(s): During a certain period, PSD can improve the swimming velocity of rats.

AB  - Background: Given the increasing importance of obesity in China, prevention interventions encouraging physical activity by middle school students are needed. The purpose of this study is to illustrate how a rapid elicitation method can be used to identify salient consequences, referents, and circumstances about physical activity as perceived by middle school students and to provide suggestions for interventions and quantitative research. Method: A theory-based qualitative study using a self-completion elicitation was conducted with 155 students from two middle schools in Beijing, China. Following the Theory of Planned Behavior, six open-ended questions asked students for their perceptions about performing physical activity at least 60 minutes each day: advantages of participating in physical activity; disadvantages of doing so; people who approve of participation; people who disapprove; things that make it easy; and things that make it hard. Content analysis revealed categories of salient consequences, reference groups, and circumstances. Results: While the three most frequently mentioned advantages elicited from the students were physical health consequences (e. g., will strengthen my body (58.7%)), four of the salient advantages were not (e. g., will improve my grades (12.2%)). Parents were the most frequently mentioned social referent (42.6% as approving; 27.7% as disapproving) when students were asked who might approve or disapprove of their participation. Circumstances perceived to hinder daily physical activity included having too many assignments and not having enough time. Conclusion: While many of the beliefs about physical activity elicited from this study were similar to those found with students from England and the US, several were unique to these students from Beijing. The results of this qualitative research suggest that interventions to encourage physical activity among middle school students should address: perceived consequences of physical activity on academic achievement and other factors beyond physical health; barriers of not having enough time and having too many assignments perceived to hinder frequent physical activity; and parental approval. More rigorous research on psychosocial determinants with close-ended items developed from these open-ended data and with larger sample sizes of students is necessary. Research with parents and school staff will be needed to understand the perceptions of these stakeholder groups key to creating the students' social environment.

AB  - [Ching Kwan Lee]'s inquiry begins with a puzzle she has observed in Liaoning and Guandong where she conducted her fieldwork. Both places have witnessed massive labour unrest, yet the form and content of the protests are strikingly different. In Liaoning where the socialist planned economy is dying and workers are left stranded in a wasteland of bankrupt factories, veteran workers take their grievances to the street and make moral claims for their basic survival rights. They engage in a particular form of political bargaining by shaming local corrupt officials and by disrupting traffic and public order in order to gain societal attention. She terms this type of action "protests of desperation" in a Polanyian sense because the driving force behind this collective mobilization is to resist the commodification of labour brought by the privatization policy and to reject their abandonment by the state. Lee argues that the basis of this kind of labour activism still rests upon the notion of "social contract" formed in the socialist system. Workers thus see the state as the holder of moral responsibility to take care of its people, especially the working class that was once the core constituency of the socialist regime. These workers have a strong sense of social entitlement even though historical conditions have changed. In their struggles, laid-off workers often invoke Maoist notions of working-class status and social entitlements, and rarely make use of the legal system to solve their problems. Lee's book provides a detailed account of three types of protests: nonpayment protests involving unpaid pensions and wages, neighbourhood protests involving substandard community services and forced relocation, and bankruptcy protests involving disputes over compensation and corruption. What makes her account powerful and convincing are the rich personal narratives by factory workers who delineate their struggle, plight, and interpretation of the changing situation and their fate. Lee further explores what kinds of insurgent identities or subjectivities are created in this process. Her analysis suggests that workers do not rely on a single form of identity but draw from a repertoire of multiple subject positions, which includes class, citizens, and the masses. They make claims based on their workers' position that assumed a master status in society under socialism, or as citizens gongmin) with basic rights, or as the disadvantaged working masses (gongren qunzhong). The co-existence of multiple positions allows workers to use different strategies depending on the specific situations facing them. Turning to the Sunbelt in the south, we witness another wave of labour protests staged by younger migrant workers in global sweatshops. Lee terms this kind of labour unrest "protests against discrimination." Here the social contract sanctioned by socialism has been largely replaced by the legal contract between labour and capital. The primary goal of workers' struggles is to resist harsh conditions of capitalist production and labour exploitation, rather than to claim social entitlements. Pun Ngai's ethnography, Made in China, echoes this account by providing another in-depth account of the subjective experiences of labour discipline among young migrant women (dagong mei) working in capitalist factories of the south. In contrast with laid-off workers in the north, migrant workers frequently seek legal mobilization to settle their problems by turning to the labour bureau and the court. Petitions and lawsuits become a preferred weapon of the weak against their powerful employers and corporations. Lee has identified three types of common grievance among migrant workers. The most prominent problem is centred on unpaid wages or illegal deduction of payment. The second is harsh labour discipline and physical violence imposed on workers' bodies. The last type involves work-related injuries and the lack of compensation. One of the most interesting findings in this book is contrary to the experience of veteran workers in the north, class consciousness is almost muted among migrant workers because they rarely view themselves as a unified class with shared interests and solidarity. Rather, they tend to see themselves as second-class citizens (outsiders in the city) and subalterns (ruoshi qunti). Lee's account demonstrates that while "the rule of law" has become a dominant official discourse, migrant workers are able to appropriate this language for their own struggle. It is in this context that the notion of "against the law" becomes a common idiom for workers to demand social justice and contest unfair treatment.

AB  - Background: There are wide-ranging differences in human growth, not only between ethnic groups but also between regions. Shandong is one of the most populous provinces in China, with inequalities of regional economic status. However, no studies on the differences in development among children and adolescents in different districts have been reported. Aim: This study assessed the differences in height, weight and prevalence of obesity among children and adolescents of different socioeconomic status (SES) districts in Shandong, China. Subjects and methods: Data for this study were obtained from a large cross-sectional survey of schoolchildren. A total of 42 286 students (21 222 boys and 21 064 girls) aged 7-18 years from 16 districts participated in this study. Height and weight of all subjects were measured and BMI was calculated from their height and weight. Prevalence rates of obesity and overweight were determined by comparing calculated BMIs (kg/m(2)) to International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) cut-offs. Each of the 16 districts was assigned an SES ranking (low, moderate, high) based on per capita GDP and income in urban and rural areas. Comparisons of height, weight and the prevalence of overweight and obesity among different groups were made. Results: Significant differences between SES groups were observed for height, weight and the prevalence of overweight and obesity. Boys and girls from high SES group were taller, heavier and more likely to be obese than their peers from moderate and low SES groups. The prevalences of combined overweight and obesity in the three SES groups were 18.46%, 21.08% and 27.31% in boys and 10.43%, 12.42% and 15.18% in girls, respectively. Conclusion: There have been obvious regional variations in development and the prevalence of obesity in children and adolescents in Shandong, China, These variations in development and prevalence of obesity in children and adolescents among different SES districts being related to the local SES, process of urbanization, living environments, nutritional status, dietary pattern, physical activity and public health.

AB  - Policing has profound health implications for people who use illicit drugs. Among Aboriginal communities, distrust of police is common, due partly to legacies of colonial policing. In response to the paucity of research among Aboriginal people who use drugs, this paper aims to: (1) Describe the policing experiences of young Aboriginal people who use drugs; (2) Identify policing activities associated with unsafe injection practices; and (3) Elucidate barriers to positive police relations. The Cedar Project is a cohort study involving young Aboriginal people in Vancouver and Prince George, British Columbia, who use illicit drugs. This mixed-methods study (N =372) used period prevalence from 2007 to 2010 to describe policing experiences, mixed effects regression models to identify correlates of policing activities, and thematic qualitative analysis to assess attitudes to police relations. Many participants were stopped by police (73%), experienced physical force by police (28%), had drug equipment confiscated (31%), and changed location of drug use because of police (43%). Participants who reported dealing drugs (40%) were significantly more likely to experience police engagement. Among participants in Prince George, 4% reported to have had non-consensual sex with members of the criminal justice system. Policing activity was significantly associated with syringe sharing, rushed injection, and reused syringe. Due to personal experience, practical concerns, and intergenerational legacies of unfair policing practices, most participants did not want a positive relationship with police (57%). Desire for a positive relationship with police was directly associated with being helped by police, and inversely associated with being stopped by police and experiencing physical force by police. Policing activities may be impacting the well-being of Aboriginal people who use drugs. Due to focused prosecution of street-level drug dealing, some police may favor enforcement over harm reduction. Positive police engagement and less aggressive policing may enhance perceptions of police among young Aboriginal people who use drugs. Reprinted by permission of Elsevier Science Inc.

AB  - To evaluate the clinical and radiographic outcomes of headless compression screws for Lisfranc joint injuries. A retrospective analysis was made on clinical data of 34 patients (36 feet) with Lisfranc joint injuries who underwent open reduction and internal fixation with headless compression screws between January 2006 and January 2012. There were 22 males (24 feet) and 12 females (12 feet), aged 21-73 years (mean, 38.9 years). The causes of injury included traffic accident in 16 cases (17 feet), falling from height in 11 cases (12 feet), crushing in 5 cases (5 feet), and sports in 2 cases (2 feet). Of them, there were 19 cases (20 feet) of closed injury and 15 cases (16 feet) of open injury; there were 7 cases (8 feet) of pure dislocations of tarsometatarsal joints and ligamentous Lisfranc injuries (LD), 22 cases (23 feet) of Lisfranc joint fracture dislocations (LFD), 5 cases (5 feet) of combined Chopart-LFD (CLFD). According to Myerson classification, 5 cases (5 feet) were rated as type A, 7 cases (8 feet) as type B1, 14 cases (15 feet) as type B2, 5 cases (5 feet) as type C1, and 3 cases (3 feet) as type C2. Associated fractures included 12 cases (13 feet) of metatarsal shaft fracture, 4 cases (4 feet) of cuboid fracture, 4 cases (4 feet) of navicular bone fracture, 6 cases (7 feet) of coneiform bone fracture/dislocation, 8 cases (10 feet) of ipsilateral lower limb multiple fracture, and 4 cases (4 feet) of contralateral lower limb multiple fracture. The clinical outcomes were evaluated according to American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score and visual analogue scale (VAS) score. Postoperative X-ray films were taken to assess the reduction, internal fixation, and the foot arch height. All patients were followed up 1 year to 5 years and 2 months (mean, 3.5 years). X-ray films showed anatomical reduction in 31 cases (33 feet, 91.7%). At last follow-up, AOFAS score and VAS score averaged 80.6 (range, 60-100) and 2.3 (range, 0-6), respectively; the AOFAS score was significantly higher in patients having anatomical reduction than the patients having no anatomical reduction, in patients with LD and LFD than in patients with CLFD, and in patients without cuneiform bone fracture/dislocation than in patients with cuneiform bone fracture/dislocation (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the talus-first metatarsal angle, the distance between the lateral edge of the base of the first metatarsal bone and the medial edge of the base of the second metatarsal bone, and the arch height between the injured foot and normal foot (P > 0.05). Reduction loss was observed in 1 case (1 foot) because of early weight bearing; post-traumatic arthritis developed in 9 patients (10 feet). The incidence of post-traumatic osteoarthritis was higher in the patients with non-anatomic reduction, coneiform bone fracture/dislocation, comminuted intra-articular fractures of Lisfranc joints, the injury types (P < 0.05). Headless compression screws for fixation of Lisfranc joint injuries can provide satisfactory short- and mid-term clinical and radiographic outcomes. During surgery, the precise anatomic reduction and stable fixation should be paid attention to, especially in patients with CLFD, coneiform bone fracture/dislocation, and comminuted intra-articular fractures of Lisfranc joints so as to control the incidence of the post-traumatic osteoarthritis.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the characteristics of health related risk behaviors in adolescents with anorexia nervosa. Methods: Thirty-three adolescents meeting the criteria of anorexia nervosa of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problem, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) and 66 normal controls were enrolled. They were assessed with the Questionnaire for Adolescents Health related Risk Behavior Inventory. The subjects' parents completed the Questionnaire for Adolescents Health related Risk Behavior Inventory for Parent. Results: The anorexia nervosa group got lower scores in factors of rule breaking and illegal behavior[(2.1 ± 1.6) vs. (2.7 ± 1.7) and higher scores in factor of suicide and self-injury[(2.2 ± 2.6) vs. (1.2 ± 2.2)] than the normal control group. The anorexia nervosa group had lower scores in items of 'not eating breakfast' and 'whether to lie to family members', and higher scores in items of 'binge eating or overeating and then vomiting out', 'physical discomfort caused by extremely restricted dieting', 'suicidal thoughts', 'suicidal plan' and 'suicidal behavior' than the normal control group (Ps < 0.05). The scores of self assessment in factor of 'unhealthy diet and lack of physical activity' was lower than that of parents' assessment (3.7 ± 2.5) vs. (6.8 ± 3.6) P < 0.01], The scores of self assessment were lower in items of 'not eating breakfast' [(0.2 ± 0.5) vs. (1.4 ± 1 3)] and 'not drinking milk' [(1.2 ± 1.3) vs. (1.8 ± 0.2)], and higher in 'whether cheating or plagiarism' [(0.6 ± 0.9) vs. (0.2 ± 0.4)]than that of parents'assessment (Ps < 0.05). Conclusion: Children and adolescents with anorexia nervosa may have more self-injury behavior, suicidal thoughts, suicidal plan, suicidal behavior, binge eating or overeating and then vomiting out, physical discomfort caused by extremely restricted dieting, but less rule breaking behavior, illegal behavior, and lying to family members.

AB  - Since the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) was introduced in China about 30 years ago, most studies with the instrument were conducted among clinical samples. This study tried to explore factor structure in a non-clinical and college student sample. We also planned to find if the SCL-90 scores are correlated with any school performance of the college students, such as grades and extra curriculum activities. The instrument together with a full-length questionnaire was administered to 1125 undergraduate students in a four-year university in China. Principal component factor analyses yielded a factor structure with some differences from those previously reported for other populations. We only derived four distinct factors: depression, somatization, obsessive–compulsive, and phobic anxiety. interpersonal sensitivity, anxiety, hostility, paranoid ideation, and psychoticism all failed to yield. Reliability and validity tests proved that SCL-90 could be used on the sample of Chinese college students. Results showed that Rural/urban location, the only child status, attending sports competition, and wining an award in publishing articles are significantly associated with the SCL-90 scores. Students who attended sports competition had lower SCL-90 scores while students who won an award from publishing articles had higher SCL-90 scores than students who did not.

AB  - The QT interval on the surface electrocardiogram (ECG) represents the time from onset of ventricular depolarization (onset of the Q wave) to the completion of repolarization (end of the T wave). Extremely abnormal prolongation or reduction of the QT interval duration, such that seen in individuals with Mendelian forms of long QT syndrome or short QT syndrome, is associated with malignant ventricular arrhythmias, total and cardiovascular mortality. However, the clinical significance of less extreme variations in QT interval is unclear due to inconsistent results from previous studies. The main objective of this study is to access the association between QT interval duration and mortality endpoints, as well as to investigate determinants of QT interval durations. First, we conducted a systematic review of the available literature on the association of QT interval duration with the risk of total, cardiovascular, and coronary heart disease mortality, and with sudden cardiac death in the general population. Twenty-three observational studies were eligible and included in the final meta-analysis. Prolonged QT interval was associated with increased risk of total, cardiovascular, coronary, and sudden cardiac death mortality. Second, we investigated the prospective associations between QT interval and mortality endpoints in 7,828 men and women 40 years and older who participated in NHANES III. After an average follow-up of 13.7 years, we found a U-shaped association of QT interval with cardiovascular and coronary mortality. Both shortened and prolonged QT interval duration, even within normal limits, are associated with increased mortality risk in the general population. Third, we investigated the association between QT interval duration and cardiac arrhythmic event in 544 high risk patients with LVEF≤35% and placement of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death. After a median follow-up of 3.6 years, QT interval duration was positively associated with an increased risk of cardiac arrhythmic event, particularly in those with QRS <120 ms. Prolonged QT interval was also associated with all-cause mortality in QRS <120 ms. Fourth, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 727 men from NHANES III, and 2,942 men and 1,885 postmenopausal women from MESA, to evaluate the effect of sex hormones on QT interval duration, since women on average had longer QT intervals than men. We found an inverse association between QT interval duration and testosterone levels in men, but not in postmenopausal women. Estradiol levels were not associated with QT interval duration in men, but there was a marginally significant positive association in postmenopausal women. Fifth, we examined the relationship of QT interval with 25-hydroxy vitamin D, calcium, and phosphorus in 7,312 men and women from NHANES III, and 14,825 men. QT interval duration was inversely associated with serum total and ionized calcium concentration and positively associated with serum phosphorus. No association was found between 25-hydroxy vitamin D and QT interval. Finally, we investigated the effect of modifiable factors such as coffee intake, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity on QT interval duration in 7,795 men and women from NHANES III. Binge drinking was associated with longer QT interval, particularly in men. QT interval duration was not associated with other modifiable factors including coffee and tea intake, smoking, or physical activity. In conclusion, QT interval is a risk marker for total and cardiovascular mortality, both in the general population and in high risk patients with structural heart disease. Serum testosterone, calcium, and phosphorus levels are important determinants of the variations in QT interval duration. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: To quantify the association between a combination of healthy lifestyle factors before pregnancy (healthy body weight, healthy diet, regular exercise, and not smoking) and the risk of gestational diabetes. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Nurses’ Health Study II, United States. Participants: 20 136 singleton live births in 14 437 women without chronic disease. Main outcome measure: Self reported incident gestational diabetes diagnosed by a physician, validated by medical records in a previous study. Results: Incident first time gestational diabetes was reported in 823 pregnancies. Each lifestyle factor measured was independently and significantly associated with risk of gestational diabetes. The combination of three low risk factors (non-smoker, ≥150 minutes a week of moderate to vigorous physical activity, and healthy eating (top two fifths of Alternate Healthy Eating Index-2010 adherence score)) was associated with a 41% lower risk of gestational diabetes compared with all other pregnancies (relative risk 0.59, 95% confidence interval 0.48 to 0.71). Addition of body mass index (BMI) <25 before pregnancy (giving a combination of four low risk factors) was associated with a 52% lower risk of gestational diabetes compared with all other pregnancies (relative risk 0.48, 0.38 to 0.61). Compared with pregnancies in women who did not meet any of the low risk lifestyle factors, those meeting all four criteria had an 83% lower risk of gestational diabetes (relative risk 0.17, 0.12 to 0.25). The population attributable risk percentage of the four risk factors in combination (smoking, inactivity, overweight, and poor diet) was 47.5% (95% confidence interval 35.6% to 56.6%). A similar population attributable risk percentage (49.2%) was observed when the distributions of the four low risk factors from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2007-10) data were applied to the calculation. Conclusions: Adherence to a low risk lifestyle before pregnancy is associated with a low risk of gestational diabetes and could be an effective strategy for the prevention of gestational diabetes.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that birth weight and other birth characteristics may be associated with risk for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) later in life; however, results using large US national survey data are limited. Our goal was to determine the aforementioned associations using nationally representative data. We studied children and adolescents 6–15 years using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey cycles 2001–2010. Survey and examination data included demographic and early childhood characteristics, current health status, physical activity information, anthropometric measurements, dietary data (total energy, saturated fat, sodium, and sugar intakes), biomarkers related to selected risk factors of CVD [systolic blood pressure (SBP), plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) and lipid profiles], and type 2 diabetes [fasting glucose, insulin, and homeostasis model assessment (HOMA)]. Birth weight (proxy-reported) was inversely associated with SBP among girls; SBP levels increased 1.4 mmHg for each 1,000 g decrease in birth weight (p = 0.003) after controlling for potential confounders. Birth weight was not associated with levels of CRP or lipid profiles across the three racial groups. In addition, birth weight was inversely related to levels of fasting insulin and HOMA among non-Hispanic Whites; for each 1,000 g decrease in birth weight, fasting insulin levels increased 9.1 % (p = 0.007) and HOMA scores increased 9.8 % (p = 0.007). Birth weight was inversely associated with the levels of SBP, fasting insulin, and HOMA. These results support a role for birth weight, independent of the strong effects of current body weight status, in increasing risk for CVD and type 2 diabetes.

AB  - A high prevalence of obesity and cardiometabolic conditions has been increasingly recognized in childhood cancer survivors. In particular, survivors of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia have been found to be at risk of becoming overweight or obese early in treatment, with increases in weight maintained throughout treatment and beyond. Nutrition plays an important role in the etiology of obesity and cardiometabolic conditions and is among the few modifiable factors that can prevent or delay the early onset of these chronic conditions. However, nutritional intake in childhood cancer survivors has not been adequately examined and the evidence is built on data from small cohorts of survivors. In addition, the long-term impact of cancer diagnosis and treatment on survivors' nutritional intake as well as how survivors' nutritional intake is associated with chronic health conditions have not been well quantified in large-scale studies. Promoting family-based healthy lifestyles, preferably at a sensitive window of unhealthy weight gain, is a priority for preventing the early onset of obesity and cardiometabolic conditions in childhood cancer survivors.

AB  - Introduction A growing body of literature reveals the causal pathways between physical activity and brain function, indicating that increasing physical activity among children could improve rather than undermine their scholastic performance. However, past studies of physical activity and scholastic performance among students often relied on parent-reported grade information, and did not explore whether the association varied among different levels of scholastic performance. Our study among fifth-grade students in Shanghai sought to determine the association between regular physical activity and teacher-reported academic performance scores (APS), with special attention to the differential associational patterns across different strata of scholastic performance. Method A total of 2,225 students were chosen through a stratified random sampling, and a complete sample of 1470 observations were used for analysis. We used a quantile regression analysis to explore whether the association between physical activity and teacher-reported APS differs by distribution of APS. Results Minimal-intensity physical activity such as walking was positively associated with academic performance scores (beta = 0.13, SE = 0.04). The magnitude of the association tends to be larger at the lower end of the APS distribution (beta = 0.24, SE = 0.08) than in the higher end of the distribution (beta = 0.00, SE = 0.07). Conclusion Based upon teacher-reported student academic performance, there is no evidence that spending time on frequent physical activity would undermine student' s APS. Those students who are below the average in their academic performance could be worse off in academic performance if they give up minimal-intensity physical activity. Therefore, cutting physical activity time in schools could hurt the scholastic performance among those students who were already at higher risk for dropping out due to inadequate APS.Copyright © 2015 Zhang et al.

AB  - Despite the physical and mental health benefits of leisure-time physical activity (LTPA), only about half of college students participate in the recommended amount of LTPA. While college students are avid users of social network sites (SNSs), whether SNSs would be an effective channel for promoting LTPA through peer social support is unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the effects of social support from students' contacts on SNSs on their intention to participate in LTPA, applying the Theory of Planned Behavior. Participants were recruited through a mass e-mail sent to undergraduate students at a large Midwestern university in fall 2011. In total, 439 surveys were analyzed. Descriptive analyses and analysis for mediating effects were conducted. Social support about LTPA from contacts on SNSs has indirect effect on intention through affective attitude, instrumental attitude, and perceived behavioral control (PBC). The results indicate that social support about LTPA from contacts on SNSs might not be effective to change students' intention unless attitudes and PBC are changed. Future interventions aiming to promote students' intention to participate in LTPA by increasing support from contacts on SNSs should increase affective attitude, instrumental attitude, and PBC at the same time.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the roles of physical activity (exercise) and sociodemographic factors in depressive symptoms among men and women in the United States. Data Source: 2011 U.S. Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Study Design: Patient Health Questionnaire Depression Scale (PHQ‐8) scores are aggregated and divided into five categories. An ordered switching probability model with binary endogenous physical activity is developed to accommodate ordinality of depression categories and ameliorate statistical biases due to endogeneity of physical activity. Principal Findings: Average treatment effects suggest physical activity ameliorates depressive symptoms among mildly and moderately depressed individuals, most notably among mildly depressed women. Gender differences exist in the roles of sociodemographic factors, with age, income, race, education, employment status, and recent mental health condition playing differentiated roles in affecting depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Regular physical activity reduces depressive symptoms among both men and women with mild to moderate depression, notably among women.

AB  - Objective: This secondary data analysis sought to determine what mediated reductions in self-reported sexual initiation over the 24-month postintervention period in early adolescents who received 'Promoting Health among Teens,' a theory-based, abstinence-only intervention (Jemmott, Jemmott, & Fong, 2010). Method: African American Grade 6 and 7 students at inner-city public middle schools were randomized to 1 of 5 interventions grounded in social–cognitive theory and the theory of reasoned action: 8-hr abstinence-only targeting reduced sexual intercourse; 8-hr safer-sex-only targeting increased condom use; 8-hr and 12-hr comprehensive interventions targeting sexual intercourse and condom use; 8-hr control intervention targeting physical activity and diet. Primary outcome was self-report of vaginal intercourse by 24 months postintervention. Potential mediators, assessed immediately postintervention, were theory-of-reasoned-action variables, including behavioral beliefs about positive consequences of abstinence and negative consequences of sex, intention to have sex, normative beliefs about sex, and HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) knowledge. We tested single and serial mediation models using the product-of-coefficients approach. Results: Of 509 students reporting never having vaginal intercourse at baseline (324 girls and 185 boys; mean age = 11.8 years, SD = 0.8), 500 or 98.2% were included in serial mediation analyses. Consistent with the theory of reasoned action, the abstinence-only intervention increased positive behavioral beliefs about abstinence, which reduced intention to have sex, which in turn reduced sexual initiation. Negative behavioral beliefs about sex, normative beliefs about sex, and HIV/STI knowledge were not mediators. Conclusions: Abstinence-only interventions should stress the gains to be realized from abstinence rather than the deleterious consequences of sexual involvement.

AB  - Background: Concussion injuries have been highlighted to the American public through media and research. While recent studies have shown increased traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) diagnosed in emergency departments across the United States, no studies have evaluated trends in concussion diagnoses across the general US population in various age groups. Purpose: To evaluate the current incidence and trends in concussions diagnosed across varying age groups and health care settings in a large cross-sectional population. Study Design: Descriptive epidemiological study. Methods: Administrative health records of 8,828,248 members of a large private-payer insurance group in the United States were queried. Patients diagnosed with concussion from years 2007 through 2014 were stratified by year of diagnosis, age group, sex, classification of concussion, and health care setting of diagnosis (eg, emergency department vs physician's office). Chi-square testing was used for statistical analysis. Results: From a cohort of 8,828,248 patients, 43,884 patients were diagnosed with a concussion. Of these patients, 55% were male and over 32% were in the adolescent age group (10-19 years old). The highest incidence of concussion was seen in patients aged 15 to 19 years (16.5/1000 patients), followed by those aged 10 to 14 years (10.5/1000 patients), 20 to 24 years (5.2/1000 patients), and 5 to 9 years (3.5/1000 patients). Overall, there was a 60% increase in concussion incidence from 2007 to 2014. The largest increases were in the 10- to 14-year (143%) and 15- to 19-year (87%) age groups. Based on International Classification of Disease-9th Revision classification, 29% of concussions were associated with some form of loss of consciousness. Finally, 56% of concussions were diagnosed in the emergency department and 29% in a physician's office, with the remainder in urgent care clinics or inpatient settings. Conclusion: The incidence of concussion diagnosed in the general US population is increasing, driven largely by a substantial rise in the adolescent age group. The youth population should be prioritized for ongoing work in concussion education, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Clinical Relevance: The rise of concussions in the adolescent age group across the general population is concerning, and clinical efforts to prevent these injuries are needed.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To discuss the diagnosis, differential diagnosis, classification methods and treatment of the capitellar fractures of the distal humerus., METHODS: In the study, 28 adult patients with the capitellar fractures were treated in Beijing Jishuitan Hospital from Sep. 2008 to Jan. 2014. There were 10 females and 18 males with an average age of 34 years (range: 14-66 years). According to Dubberley classification: IA type in 6 cases, IB type in 2 cases, IIA type in 8 cases, IIB type in 4 cases, IIIA type in 4 cases, and IIIB type in 4 cases. Sixteen patients were treated with a single Kochr approach, 1 with a lateral approach combined with a medial approach, 2 combined with anterior elbow approach and 9 combined with posterior median approach. All of the fractures were fixed with Herbert screws, 7 cases with support plates, and 4 cases with the hinged elbow external fixator. All of the patients were followed up for clinical examination and radiograph check. They were evaluated with Broberg-Morrey score system., RESULTS: The average follow-up time was 28.5 months (range 12-72 months). The average bone union time was 8 weeks. The average ulnohumeral motion was 112degree(60degree-150degree) and forearm rotation was 145degree(100degree-170degree). The average Broberg-Morrey score was 92.5 points (range: 62-100 points). The excellent and good rate was 91.8%. The complications of traumatic arthritis was in 2 cases and elbow stiffness was in 2 cases., CONCLUSION: Attention should be paid to the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of capitellar fractures without missing the combined injury. According to Dubberley classification, appropriate surgical approach and the internal and external fixed methods could be chosen. Early postoperative, reasonable and effective exercise is helpful to the recovery of elbow joint function.

AB  - Decentering, the ability to observe one's thoughts and feelings from a detached view, has gained increased attention in recent years. With this renewed interest comes a need for a reliable and valid tool to measure decentering in sport contexts. Therefore, in this multi-study paper we report the development and initial validation of a sport-specific self-report measure of decentering, the Decentering Scale for Sport (DSS). Based on an initial pool of context-specific items with acceptable content validity, a unidimensional decentering construct was confirmed in four independent athletic samples (n = 1255). Satisfactory internal consistency reliability and partial measurement invariance across gender and sport type was demonstrated. Convergent and concurrent validity of the DSS was established by showing positive and medium to large associations with mindfulness, well-being, flow, vitality, enjoyment and positive affect, and negative and medium to large associations with cognitive fusion, experiential avoidance, anxiety and negative affect. Discriminant validity of decentering with mindfulness and self-compassion was also established. Findings suggest that the DSS is a reliable and valid measure of decentering in sport contexts, and can be applied in future research and applied practice to measure decentering.

AB  - METHOD: Ten focus group meetings with 76 adolescents, ages 12 to 17 years, were conducted at community-based organizations in Chicago's Chinatown. The research team transcribed the recording and analyzed the transcripts using ATLAS.ti., RESULTS: Chinese adolescents are using different social network sites for various topics of health information including food, physical activity, and so on. Adolescents would share useful and/or interesting health information. Many adolescents raised credibility concerns regarding health information and suggested evaluating the information based on self-experience or intuition, word-of-mouth, or information online., CONCLUSION: The findings shed lights on future intervention using social network sites to promote health among Chinese adolescents in the United States., IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Future interventions should provide adolescents with interesting and culturally sensitive health information and educate them to critically evaluate health information on social network sites., PURPOSE: This exploratory qualitative study examines Chinese adolescents' health information sharing habits on social network sites.

AB  - Objective: To study the degree to which individuals in different trajectories of cigarette smoking from adolescence to the early forties are similar or different in terms of lack of preventive health behaviors (e.g., underuse of preventive health services, unhealthy eating habits) in early midlife. Methods: Participants came from a community-based random sample of residents in two upstate New York counties (N = 548). Data were collected from adolescence to early midlife (mean age = 43 years, standard deviation [SD] = 2.8) at seven time points. Using growth mixture modeling, we statistically identified the number of smoking trajectories. Logistic regression analysis was used to study the relationship between the probabilities of participants' smoking trajectory group membership and lack of preventive behaviors in early midlife. Results: Five trajectory groups of cigarette smokers were identified. With controls, as compared with the nonsmoker trajectory group, higher probabilities of belonging to the heavy/continuous smoker trajectory group and the late starter trajectory groups were significantly associated with a higher likelihood of lack of preventive health behaviors (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 3.49 and 4.02 respectively). In addition, as compared to the quitter/decreaser trajectory group, higher probabilities of belonging to the heavy/continuous smoker trajectory group and the late starter trajectory group were also significantly associated with a higher likelihood of lack of preventive health behaviors (AOR = 3.51 and 4.04 respectively). Conclusions: Intervention programs may consider focusing on heavy/continuous smokers and late starters in programs designed to promote adequate use of preventive health services and healthy general lifestyles in early midlife.

AB  - Background: Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the most prevalent type of cardiac disease among adults worldwide, including those in Singapore. Most of its risk factors, such as smoking, physical inactivity and high blood pressure, are preventable. mHealth has improved in the last decade, showing promising results in chronic disease prevention and health promotion worldwide. Our aim was to develop and examine the effect of a 4-week Smartphone-Based Coronary Heart Disease Prevention (SBCHDP) programme in improving awareness and knowledge of CHD, perceived stress as well as cardiac-related lifestyle behaviours in the working population of Singapore. Methods: The smartphone app 'Care4Heart' was developed as the main component of the programme. App content was reviewed and validated by a panel of experts, including two cardiologists and two experienced cardiology-trained nurses. A pilot randomised controlled trial was conducted. Eighty working people were recruited and randomised to either the intervention group (n = 40) or the control group (n = 40). The intervention group underwent a 4-week SBCHDP programme, whereas the control group were offered health promotion websites only. The participants’ CHD knowledge, perceived stress and behavioural risk factors were measured at baseline and on the 4th week using the Heart Disease Fact Questionnaire-2, Perceived Stress Scale, and Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System. Results: After the SBCHDP programme, participants in the intervention group had a better awareness of CHD being the second leading cause of death in Singapore (X² = 6.486, p = 0.039), a better overall CHD knowledge level (t = 3.171, p = 0.002), and better behaviour concerning blood cholesterol control (X² = 4.54, p = 0.033) than participants in the control group. Conclusion: This pilot study partially confirmed the positive effects of the SBCHDP programme in improving awareness and knowledge of CHD among the working population. Due to the small sample size and short follow-up period, this study was underpowered to detect significant differences between groups. A full-scale longitudinal study is required in the future to confirm the effectiveness of the SBCHDP programme. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Dehydration may affect cognitive performances as water accounts for 75% of brain mass. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of dehydration and water supplementation on cognitive performances, and to explore the changes of brain structures and functions using MRI. Methods and Analysis: A double-blinded randomized controlled trial has been designed and will be implemented among 64 college students aged 18-23 years from Baoding, China. Subjects will be asked to restrict water for 36 h. The first morning urine will be collected and urine osmolality measured. The fasting blood samples will be collected and osmolality and copeptin will be measured. Three MRI sequences, including fMRI, ASL and 3D BRAVO will be taken to observe the changes of whole brain volume, ventricular volume, BOLD response and the cortex thickness. Cognitive performances and mood will be performed with software and questionnaires, respectively. Subjects in the water supplementation groups 1, 2, 3 will drink 200, 500 and 1000 mL of water, respectively, while subjects in the no water supplementation group will not drink any water. After 90 min, urine and blood samples, MRI scans, cognitive performances and mood will be performed. One-way ANOVA will be used to study the differences among groups. Ethics and Dissemination: The study protocol has been approved by the Peking University Institutional Review Committee. Ethical approval project identification code is IRB00001052-16071. Results will be published according to the CONSORT statement and will be reported in peer-reviewed journals.

AB  - Despite significant health benefits of regular physical activity, over 60 percent of college women do not meet recommended physical activity guidelines to promote their health and health-related quality of life (HRQoL), a comprehensive construct including physical and psychosocial health functioning. The major purpose of this study was to examine the influences of individual (e.g., self-efficacy, enjoyment), social (e.g., family and friend support), and physical environmental factors (e.g., crime safety) on college women's physical activity and HRQoL. Participants were 235 (Mean age =21.0years) college women from a public research university located in the southwest region of the United States. They completed validated surveys assessing their perceptions of physical activity, HRQoL, and social ecological factors during the spring semester of 2012. The findings of three multiple linear regressions, entering individual factors first, followed by social and physical environmental factors, revealed that self-efficacy and crime safety were significantly related to physical activity. For HRQoL-physical functioning, significant factors were self-efficacy, enjoyment, and crime safety. Enjoyment was the only factor related to HRQoL-psychosocial functioning. These findings indicated that physical activity professionals need to foster safe environments, enhance self-efficacy, and provide enjoyable activities to promote college women's physical activity and HRQoL.

AB  - Although the prevalence of overweight and obesity among Chinese youth with higher socioeconomic status (SES) has been increasing, few studies have explored the mechanisms through which SES influences Chinese adolescents' weight status. Using data from the 2004, 2006, 2009, and 2011 China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS), this study aims to explore possible pathways through which SES may affect Chinese adolescents' risk of being overweight. Results from pathway analyses in a structural equation modeling framework indicate that indirect pathways, such as food intake and physical activities, partially explain the association between SES and Chinese adolescents' weight status, while weight-related attitudes do not. The pathways identified in this study can aid targeted intervention programs to alleviate the prevalence of adolescent obesity in China.

AB  - Background: This was a cross-sectional survey to investigate the relationship of age, parent education, sleep duration, physical activity, and dietary habits with overweight or obesity in school-age children in Shanghai. Methods: The survey gathered information from 13,001 children in grades 1 through 5 (age 6 to 10 years) among 26 elementary schools in 7 districts. Activity level was evaluated using the International Children's Leisure Activities Study Survey Questionnaire (CLASS-C). The definitions of normal, overweight, and obese were adjusted for each age. Results: Logistic regression analysis indicated that age, being male, having =10 hours of sleep on non-school days, eating =1 vegetable/day, or drinking =1 sugar-sweetened drink/day increased the risk for a child being overweight or obese compared with having >10 hours of sleep or =3 vegetables or =3 sugar-sweetened drinks/month (p = 0.008). Having >2 hours of outdoor activities on non-school days reduced the risk of being overweight or obese compared with =2 hours of outdoor activities on non-school days (p < 0.001). Conclusions: We found that age, sex, sleep, and some dietary habits impacted weight, and suggests that specific cultural and economic factors may impact risk of a child being overweight or obese.

AB  - Mindfulness has drawn increased attention in prevention programs targeting parents. Commonly, mindfulness-based programs are provided to reduce parental stress and improve child outcomes. Less often, researchers incorporate a mindfulness-informed approach, integrating a low dose of mindfulness exercises into an existing evidence-based parent training model. Little is known about participant engagement with mindfulness exercises in such programs. This non-experimental study focuses on families who are at risk for impaired parenting due to the unique stressor of a parent’s deployment to war. The goal is to examine military parents’ online engagement in mindfulness exercises and associations between engagement and dispositional mindfulness within a web-enhanced parent training program. Online tracking records and self-reported data were obtained from 370 military parents (207 families) who were assigned to the program; at 6-month follow-up, 68.6% of these parents were retained (at least one parent reported from 75.4% of families). Results showed that nearly half (44.6%) of the parents engaged with the exercises. Participants who attended face-to-face group sessions (i.e., attendees) engaged throughout the intervention period, whereas participants who never attended group sessions (i.e., non-attendees) mostly engaged during the first month in the program. Attendees and mothers engaged more than non-attendees and fathers. While engaged parents self-reported increased dispositional mindfulness at 6-month follow-up compared to baseline, only mothers’ engagement accounted for a significant proportion of the variance (3%) in dispositional mindfulness at 6-month follow-up, after controlling for covariates. Implications for incorporating online mindfulness exercises into parent training are discussed in the context of programming for military families.

AB  - Objective: To describe the prevalence rate of prenatal anxiety and depression among pregnant women in a prospective cohort study and to explore the relevant factors of anxiety and depression during each trimester. Methods: Pregnant women were recruited into the Zhoushan Pregnant Women Cohort at Zhoushan Maternal and Child Care Hospital from September 2011 to March 2015. A self-made questionnaire was used to collect information about social demography, reproductive history, physical activity, and life behaviour at the first, second and third trimester, respectively. The Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) were used to assess anxiety and depression status at each trimester, respectively. Prevalence rates of prenatal anxiety and depression at each trimester were described. Results: The prevalence of anxiety status was 22.7%, 17.4% and 20.8% in the first, second and third trimester, respectively. The corresponding prevalence rate of depression status was 35.7%, 24.0% and 26.1%, respectively. Furthermore, women with a lower education level (junior high school or below) and a more physical occupation had higher prevalence of anxiety and depression status. Conclusions: The prevalence of prenatal anxiety and depression status was very common during pregnancy among pregnant women. Lower educational level and more physical occupations were associated with higher prevalence of anxiety and depression status. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Despite significant health benefits of regular physical activity, over 60 percent of college women do not meet recommended physical activity guidelines to promote their health and health-related quality of life (HRQoL), a comprehensive construct including physical and psychosocial health functioning. The major purpose of this study was to examine the influences of individual (e.g., self-efficacy, enjoyment), social (e.g., family and friend support), and physical environmental factors (e.g., crime safety) on college women’s physical activity and HRQoL. Participants were 235 (Mean age = 21.0 years) college women from a public research university located in the southwest region of the United States. They completed validated surveys assessing their perceptions of physical activity, HRQoL, and social ecological factors during the spring semester of 2012. The findings of three multiple linear regressions, entering individual factors first, followed by social and physical environmental factors, revealed that self-efficacy and crime safety were significantly related to physical activity. For HRQoL-physical functioning, significant factors were self-efficacy, enjoyment, and crime safety. Enjoyment was the only factor related to HRQoL-psychosocial functioning. These findings indicated that physical activity professionals need to foster safe environments, enhance self-efficacy, and provide enjoyable activities to promote college women’s physical activity and HRQoL.

AB  - A major concern of social equity and environmental justice is whether urban green resources are equitably distributed across the compact megacities of China. Many previous studies have evaluated the disparities in park access among various social groups, but few researchers have considered the heterogeneity of the built environment in residential communities. This study revisits an increasingly popular Gaussian-two-step floating catchment area (G2SFCA) model and mainly improves its two core parameters, the comprehensive supply indicator and variable catchment, in order to realistically evaluate park accessibility under different travel modes. We choose Nanjing city, China, as the study case in which to evaluate differences in public park access with respect to gated and open communities using our improved model. Moreover, gated communities have been further divided into three categories, which represent differences in a community's ability to provide daily physical activities, to more deeply explore disparities in public park services. The results show that (1) the spatial accessibility of parks in Nanjing city is not evenly distributed, with communities located north of the Yangtze River having inferior park accessibility; (2) residents who live in open communities are more restricted with regard to access to parks than those in gated communities, although they experience relatively small differences under the walking mode; (3) gated communities with no internal park ("club park") enjoy better public park services; and (4) residents living in 105 open communities and 167 gated communities without a club park can be regarded as the most vulnerable groups based on the lack of park services. The results of this study can provide a scientific basis for policy makers to target specific communities of vulnerable groups for further urban park development.

AB  - Guided by the theory of planned behavior (TPB), this study examined the relationships between three constructs of TPB (attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control [PBC]) and physical activity intention and behavior among Chinese female college students, and evaluated whether the relationships differed between healthy and vulnerable individuals within this population. Participants included 436 female college students (301 healthy and 135 vulnerable; Mean age = 19.24 years; SD = 0.97 years) recruited from five universities in China, and the data collection was completed in Fall 2015. Path analysis supported the direct and indirect relations of TPB constructs to physical activity intention and behavior among female college students, and the path model was invariant across the two groups. The vulnerable group reported significantly lower attitude, subjective norm, intention, and physical activity behavior than the healthy group but not for PBC. These findings suggest fostering positive attitudes and intention toward physical activity are important among Chinese female college students, regardless of their health status.

AB  - Water accounts for 75% of brain mass. Associations may exist between hydration and cognitive performance. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of dehydration and rehydration on cognitive performance and mood. In this self-control trial, 12 men were recruited from a medical college in Cangzhou, China. After 12 h of overnight fasting, the participants took baseline tests at 8:00 AM on day 2. First morning urine and blood osmolality were analyzed to determine hydration state. Height, weight, and blood pressure were measured following standardized procedures. A visual analog scale for the subjective sensation of thirst was applied, and a profile of mood states questionnaire was applied. Tests were conducted for cognitive performance, including a test of digit span forward and backward, digit-symbol substitutions, dose-work, and stroop effects. Participants were required not to drink water for 36 h but were given three meals on day 3. On day 4, the same indexes were tested as a baseline test. At 8:30 AM, participants drank 1500 mL of purified water over 15 min. After a 1 h interval, the same measurements were performed. Compared with baseline test results, during the dehydration test, participants had lower scores of vigor (11.9 vs. 8.8, %, p = 0.007) and esteem-related affect (8.2 vs. 5.7, %, p = 0.006), lower total scores of digit span (14.3 vs. 13.3, %, p = 0.004), and higher error rates for dose-work (0.01 vs. 0.16, %, p = 0.005). Compared with the dehydration test scores, rehydration test scores showed that fatigue (4.3 vs. 2.1, %, p = 0.005) and total mood disturbance (TMD) (99.0 vs. 90.2, %, p = 0.008) improved, and scores of forward, backward, and total digit span increased (7.7 vs. 8.6, p = 0.014; 5.7 vs. 1.2, p = 0.019; 13.3 vs. 15.4, p = 0.001). Increases were also noted in correct number of digit symbol substitutions, reading speed, and mental work ability (70.8 vs. 75.4, p < 0.001; 339.3 vs. 486.4, n/min, p < 0.001; 356.1 vs. 450.2, p < 0.001), and reaction time decreased (30.2 vs. 28.7, s, p = 0.002). As a conclusion, dehydration had negative effects on vigor, esteem-related affect, short-term memory, and attention. Rehydration after water supplementation alleviated fatigue and improved TMD, short-term memory, attention, and reaction.

AB  - Chronic stress, a characteristic of modern time, has a significant impact on general health. In the context of psychiatric disorders, insufficient coping behavior under chronic stress has been linked to higher rates of (1) depressive symptoms among subjects of the general population, (2) relapse among patients under treatment for clinical depression, and (3) negative symptoms among subjects with an elevated vulnerability to psychosis. In this normative study we assessed basic coping behavior among 461 Chinese freshman university students along with their consumption behavior and general health in terms of regular exercises, physical health, psychosomatic disturbances, and mental health. The assessments relied on two instruments that have already demonstrated their capability of (1) reliably detecting insufficient coping behavior under chronic stress and (2) reliably quantifying the interrelation between coping behavior and mental health in the Western world. Thus, we aimed to complement existing data and to develop a generally available, socioculturally independent tool that can be used for the early detection of subjects with an elevated risk of mental health problems. Structural analyses yielded essentially the same scales "activity" and "defeatism" as previous studies on 2,500 students from Switzerland, Italy, Spain, the USA, and Argentina. These scales explained 74.3% of the observed variance in coping behavior among the 461 Chinese students. We found highly significant correlations (p < 0.0001) between the "defeatism" scale on the one hand, and the scales "regular use of medicine," "psychosomatic disturbances," and "impaired mental health" on the other. Particularly intriguing was the finding that a neural net classifier could be constructed to identify students with the highest contributions to the interrelation between "coping behavior" and "mental health," yielding a correlation coefficient as high as r = 0.597 for the respective subgroup. Based on the normative data, an online tool for risk assessments was developed with immediate feedback to users. This study provided another piece of evidence regarding the close link between basic coping behavior and mental health, across cultures and ethnicities. In consequence, our approach to quantifying basic coping behavior, along with other risk factors, can be expected to clear the way for an "early" detection of students with an elevated risk of stress-related mental health problems, nota bene prior to the development of clinically relevant symptoms. The socioeconomic impact of the potential prevention of depressive -disorders, and psychiatric disorders in general, may be enormous.

AB  - Objective: Transport-related cycling can contribute to employees’ increased physical activities in their daily lives, with potential health and environmental benefits. Still, a theoretical understanding of the links between the perceptions of physical environment and transport-related cycling through social cognitive theories is unclear. In addition, there is a lack of understanding on the moderating effects of the perceived physical environment on social cognitive pathways when predicting transport-related cycling. The purpose of this study was to apply the theory of planned behavior (TPB) framework to determine (a) whether TPB mediates the effects between the perceived physical environment and transport-related cycling and (b) whether the perceived physical environment moderates TPB-cycling relations. Methods: Using a prospective design, Chinese employees (N = 193) self-reported their perceived physical environment of their workplace neighborhood (i.e., residential density, land-use diversity, land-use accessibility, street connectivity, infrastructures, aesthetics, traffic-related safety, and crime-related safety), attitudes, subjective norm, perceived behavior control (PBC), intention, and duration and frequency of transport-related cycling in the last week. One month later, self-reported cycling for transport was again collected from a subset sample of employees (N = 98). Mediation and moderation structural equation models linking perceived physical environment, TPB constructs, and transport-related cycling were tested. Results: The effects from residential density to attitudes and subjective norm, from land-use diversity and street connectivity to subjective norm and PBC, and from aesthetics and crime-related safety to attitudes, were found significant and positive. Attitudes, subjective norm, and PBC predicted intention, in which intention further predicted employee’s future transport-related cycling one month later. Importantly, attitudes, subjective norm, and PBC mediated the relations from land-use diversity and street connectivity to intention, while intention mediated the effect from PBC to employee’s future transport-related cycling. Past behavior showed significant effects on attitudes, subjective norm, PBC, intention, and employee’s future transport-related cycling. The effect from past behavior to intention was mediated by the social cognitive variables of attitudes, subjective norm, and PBC. However, no moderating effects of perceived physical environments on the TPB-cycling relations were found, except the moderating effect of crime-related safety on the path from PBC to cycling. Conclusion: Current results indicate that Chinese employees’ transport-related cycling are a function of environmental (i.e., perceived physical environmental attributes) and social cognitive (i.e., attitudes, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and intention) factors. Findings of the current study can inform the development of multi-component behavioral change interventions targeting the improvement of transport-related cycling for employees.

AB  - Background: Research on neighbourhood environments and depression has concentrated on public health in developed countries. This study aims to enrich the discourse on geographic characteristics and depression by providing new evidence of direct and indirect associations between suburban neighbourhood environments and depression in urban China. Methods: Panyu in Guangzhou, a suburban district restructured by the speedy expansion of private housing, was selected as the case study area. Given the wide variety of influential factors of neighbourhood environments on depression, multivariate statistical analysis was performed using a two-stage model: 1) Binary Logistic Regression to evaluate the direct associations between neighbourhood environmental factors and depression; 2) Path Analysis to assess the indirect relationships between neighbourhood environmental attributes, physical activity and depression. Results: We found that population density, sufficiency of public space, land use mix level and street connectivity had direct impacts on depressive symptoms. Land use mix, street connectivity and destination accessibility had indirect effects on depressive symptoms through influencing time spent on public transport and driving time. However, no significant effect of social capital on depression was found. Conclusion: Environmental factors and mechanisms negatively affecting depressive symptoms in the specific suburban context of Guangzhou, China, are found to be the unsatisfactory public space and community facility provision, and land use mix. This study particularly identifies the mediation effect of time spent on public transit and driving time on depressive symptoms, enriching the debates in the extant literature on mediating effects of utilitarian physical activity in suburban China. It was also ascertained that interventions that create comfortable, convenient, appropriate, and active built environment can reduce depression symptoms.

AB  - Objective: This study investigates how daily consumer-oriented behaviors affect the prevalence of obesity in the older population in China. The demographic characteristics and living standard indicators are considered to capture the effects of various factors on obesity. Methods: This study employs the discrete choice regressions to investigate the associations among 18 influential covariates and obesity for aging adults in China in 2013. The multi-level nature of collected data is also considered by utilizing mixed-effects models. The data set, including 18,617 randomly chosen observations from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Survey 2013 is used in the regressions. Results: This study concerns the diversity of covariates representing the various daily consuming behaviors relating to the evolving living standard. A statistically significant association was found between the sedentary behavior and obesity for the aged people in China. The result also shows that aging women in China may have an increased propensity toward obesity compared to men. Conclusion: Daily consumer-oriented behaviors, including their influence on physical activity, can significantly reduce the risk of obesity; moreover, some sedentary behaviors, such as prolonged Internet use, likely will increase it. Important behaviors contributing to obesity are identified. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is impossible to detect with standard neuroradiological assessment such as structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Injury does, however, disrupt the dynamic repertoire of neural activity indexed by neural oscillations. In particular, beta oscillations are reliable predictors of cognitive, perceptual, and motor system functioning, as well as correlating highly with underlying myelin architecture and brain connectivity-all factors particularly susceptible to dysregulation after mTBI. We measured local and large-scale neural circuit function by magnetoencephalography (MEG) with a data-driven model fit approach using the fitting oscillations and one-over f algorithm in a group of young adult men with mTBI and a matched healthy control group. We quantified band-limited regional power and functional connectivity between brain regions. We found reduced regional power and deficits in functional connectivity across brain areas, which pointed to the well-characterized thalamocortical dysconnectivity associated with mTBI. Furthermore, our results suggested that beta functional connectivity data reached the best mTBI classification performance compared with regional power and symptom severity [measured with Sport Concussion Assessment Tool 2 (SCAT2)]. The present study reveals the relevance of beta oscillations as a window into neurophysiological dysfunction in mTBI and also highlights the reliability of neural synchrony biomarkers in disorder classification. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) disrupts the dynamic repertoire of neural oscillations, but so far beta activity has not been studied. In mTBI, we found reductions in frontal beta and large-scale beta networks, indicative of thalamocortical dysconnectivity and disrupted information flow through cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic circuits. Relatively, connectivity more accurately classifies individual mTBI cases compared with regional power. We show the relevance of beta oscillations in mTBI and the reliability of these markers in classification.

AB  - Promoting physical activity (PA) and eliminating health disparities among underserved minority children is a public health priority. The main purpose of this study was to examine the relationship of actual motor competence (a set of object control skills) and perceived motor competence with PA participation and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among underserved Hispanic children who were born in the U.S. Guided by Stodden et al.'s conceptual model, we tested the direct and indirect effects (mediational model) of actual motor competence on health-related outcomes (PA and HRQoL) through perceived motor competence. Participants were 215 underserved Hispanic children (M-age = 10.55 years, SD = 0.53 [age range 10-12]; 51.6% boys), recruited from four elementary schools in the southwestern U.S., who completed validated questionnaires assessing their perceived motor competence, PA, and HRQoL. Their actual motor skills were assessed using PE Metrics(TM). After examining the associations among the variables, we tested the hypothesized model using structural equation modeling (SEM; AMOS 25). The hypothesized model indicated a good fit (chi (2)/df = 38.427/24 = 1.60 < 5; non-normed fit index (NFI) = 0.93; comparative fit index (CFI) = 0.968; root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = 0.053 [0.016, 0.083]). The effect of actual motor competence on PA and HRQoL was fully mediated by perceived motor competence. The findings demonstrated the mediating role of perceived motor competence between actual motor competence and health-related outcomes (PA and HRQoL) among underserved Hispanic children. The results highlight that actual motor competence significantly predicted underserved Hispanic children' perceived motor competence, which in turn positively predicted their PA and HRQoL. These findings have significant practical implications for future intervention strategies of randomized clinical trials in schools aimed at promoting PA and HRQoL and eliminating health disparities among underserved Hispanic children.

AB  - Aim: Using a longitudinal design, the purpose of this study was to test a model integrating perceptions of the school neighbourhood environment with constructs from the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) to predict transport-related cycling among Chinese college students. Methods: A sample of 630 (M-age = 18.95 years; SD = 1.16) Chinese college students completed baseline measures that included perceptions of the school neighbourhood environment, TPB constructs, transport-related cycling, and covariates. Of those, 547 students (M-age = 18.90 years; SD = 0.92) also completed measures of transport-related cycling one month later. Results: Findings showed that intention had a direct effect on students' transport-related cycling, while attitudes, subjective norm, and perceived behavioural control predicted cycling indirectly via intention. Perceptions of the school neighbourhood environment did not provide an indirect effect on cycling via the TPB constructs, although some perceived environmental factors had indirect effects on intention via attitudes and subjective norm. Further, those who perceived better street connectivity showed a larger intention-cycling relationship than those who perceived less street connectivity. Conclusions: Findings of this study highlight the importance of integrating perceptions of the school neighbourhood environment with the TPB constructs to explain transport-related cycling through both intention formation and action control (i.e. translating intention into behaviour). The identified moderator of perceived street connectivity on the intention-cycling relationship suggests that efficient cycling routes may impact action control of cycling. Future research applying dual process and action control models beyond TPB may contribute to the identification of the multilevel determinants of transport-related cycling.

AB  - Objective There is an increasing number of studies on the post-traumatic growth (PTG) of cancer survivors worldwide. However, few Chinese studies have reported about PTG in cancer survivors because of the underdevelopment of community health services. This study aimed to evaluate the level of PTG in China and explore related factors among a large sample of survivors of more than 12 cancer types. Methods We recruited 1236 survivors from 14 sites of the Beijing Cancer Rehabilitation Association. Survivors completed standardized questionnaires assessing PTG, social support, coping styles, demographic characteristics, and clinical conditions. Multivariate linear regression was used to evaluate potential predictive factors of PTG. Results A total of 1221 (98.7%) subjects completed the questionnaires. The average PTG score was 61.15 +/- 20.26. Seven variables were included in the final regression model: social support, coping style, time after treatment, exercise, BMI, work status, and economic income (P < .05). Survivors who had low levels of social support, had negative coping strategies, had a time after treatment of less than 5 years, exercised irregularly, had an abnormal BMI, were unemployed, or had low economic income had lower PTG levels. Conclusions PTG levels among Chinese cancer survivors are associated with social support, coping style, time after treatment, exercise, BMI, work status, and economic income. Strategies tailored to Chinese survivors should be developed to promote their PTG and improve their physical and psychological well-being.

AB  - Objective The purpose of this study was to examine the potential differences in knowledge and behaviors related to active living between two schools with contrasting socioeconomic status (SES) and racial characteristics. Design The sample involved 523 adolescents from two public middle schools in a southern US state including 243 Black (46.5%), 223 White (42.6%), and 67 others (12.8%). Physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) were measured using the validated Youth Activity Profile (YAP), while knowledge of physical activity and fitness (PAF knowledge) was measured using the grade-appropriate PE Metrics written test. Socio-demographic characteristics were self-reported or obtained via secondary government database. Results The medium SES school showed higher PA outside of school (Delta M = 0.27, d = 0.26), lower SB (Delta M = - 0.35, d = - 0.45), and higher PAF knowledge (Delta M = 8.3%, d = 0.54) than the low SES school. Statistically significant differences were observed for after-school PA, evening PA, weekend PA, TV viewing, video games, and cell phone use (d = - 0.38 to 0.39). Group difference by race was also found with White participants demonstrating higher PA outside of school, lower SB, and higher PAK knowledge than Black participants (d = - 0.43 to 0.57). Conclusions The lower SES school (mostly Black) showed less favorable PA, SB, and knowledge results than the higher SES school. SES is a significant school-level characteristic influencing the determinants (i.e., knowledge and behaviors) of the active living habit in youth.

AB  - Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is impossible to detect using standard neuroradiological assessment such as structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Injury does however disrupt the dynamic repertoire of neural activity indexed by neural oscillations. In particular, beta oscillations are reliable predictors of cognitive, perceptual and motor system functioning, as well as correlate highly with underlying myelin architecture and brain connectivity - all factors particularly susceptible to dysregulation after mTBI. METHOD(S): We measured local and large-scale neural circuit function using MEG (magnetoencephalography) with a data-driven model fit approach using the Fitting Oscillations & One-Over F algorithm, in a group of young adult males with mTBI and a matched healthy control group. We quantified band-limited regional power and functional connectivity between brain regions. RESULT(S): We found reduced regional power and deficits in functional connectivity across brain areas, which pointed to the well-characterized thalamocortical dysconnectivity associated with mTBI. Furthermore, our results suggested beta functional connectivity data reached the best mTBI classification performance when compared with regional power and symptom severity (measured using SCAT2, or Sport Concussion Assessment Tool 2). CONCLUSION(S): The current study revealed the relevance of beta oscillations as a window into neurophysiological dysfunction in mTBI, and also highlights the reliability of neural synchrony biomarkers in disorder classification.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Examining associations of mother's behaviors and home/neighborhood physical activity (PA) environments with preschoolers' PA and screen time. DESIGN: Cross-sectional online survey. SETTING: Mothers with a 2 to 5 years old preschooler were recruited from the US panel members of Survey Sampling International. PARTICIPANTS: Five hundred thirty-one mothers with a preschool child aged 2 to 5 years old. OUTCOME MEASURE: Child daily screen time and PA, mother-child inside- and outside-home co-PA. ANALYSIS: K-mean cluster analysis and Logit and negative binomial regressions. RESULT(S): Mothers' healthy behaviors, such as decreased screen time, healthy eating habits, and increased PA, and perceived importance for PA were significantly (P < .05) associated with preschoolers' decreased screen time and increased PA. Available toys (P < .01) and maternal perceived neighborhood safety (P < .05) were negatively correlated with preschoolers' screen time, while available room space (P < .01) was positively correlated with preschoolers' PA. Variables positively correlated with mother-child co-PA included mothers' PA (P < .001) and healthy eating habits (P < .05), and home room space (P < .05) for inside-home, and yard space and quality (P < .05) for outside-home. CONCLUSION(S): Mother's role modeling and home PA environment were positively associated with preschoolers' PA behavior.

AB  - Background: Snapping triceps tendon is an increasingly recognized clinical entity, which is associated with a variety of pathologic factors. The causative factors include inherited structural or developmental variations, post-traumatic malalignment, and other reasons. The main complaint of patients with snapping lateral triceps are the snapping sensation, mild muscle weakness of elbow extension, with or without tenderness in distal triceps tendon. Many treatment options have been reported previously, including tendon resection and redirection. Case presentation: We present the case of a 19-year-old boy with post-traumatic distal lateral head of triceps tendon dislocation who complained of extension weakness and snapping sensation in his left elbow. Then, we used two-strand-overhand locking (TSOL) knot combined with double pulley technique to redirect the snapping triceps tendon. Conclusion(s): The patient recovered well after the operation without complaining of discomfort. This fixing and redirection tendon technique, described previously for repairing rotator cuff tears, may be applied in a similar fashion for the snapping triceps tendon with promising clinical results.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Physical activity behaviors children developed during their childhood have a long-term impact on their lifelong physical activity habits and healthy development, the increased levels of sedentary behavior and obesity call for immediate actions, especially during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (Sallis et al., 2020). The COVID-19 pandemic can lead to mental health problems such as acute stress disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as well as other physical health problems such as obesity and a sedentary lifestyle (Margaritis et al., 2020). Exposure to this traumatic COVID-19 pandemic especially impacts health and behavioral outcomes for school-aged children (Rundle et al., 2020). Thus, youth sport programs should provide favorable environments that introduce school-aged children to beneficial lifestyle behaviors and encourage them to engage in regular physical activity with appropriate social distancing (Chen et al., 2020). Furthermore, positive motivation in youth sport programs could prompt children to adopt physically active and healthy lifestyles as adults (Chen et al., 2020; Gu & Zhang, 2016; Shen et al., 2020). Despite the assertion that youth sport programs can play an important role in the promotion of children's physical activity and health-related outcomes (i.e., physical health, mental health, social health, and cognitive health), to date scholars and researchers have not systematically investigated the environmental and psychosocial factors that influence physical activity and health-related outcomes within youth sport settings during the COVID-19 pandemic (Moore et al., 2020). To encourage school-aged children to adopt a healthy and physically active lifestyle during the COVID-19 pandemic (Gu et al., 2018; Sallis et al., 2020), a clear understanding of the environmental and psychosocial factors that support children's motivation becomes an important issue for promotion of physical activity and health-related outcomes such as health-related physical fitness, cognition, quality of life, and well-being (Gu et al., 2012).

AB  - Latino adolescents face challenges to performing energy balance–related behaviors (EBRBs) to prevent childhood obesity, including healthy dietary intake, adequate physical activity, and limited screen time. Fathers are underrepresented in family-based obesity interventions but could be influential in shaping the EBRBs of Latino children. Three types of parenting practices (setting expectations/limits, role modeling, managing availability and accessibility) have shown relatively consistent positive relationships with children’s EBRBs in studies that have mostly involved mothers. The purpose of this study was to develop measures to assess Latino fathers’ parenting practices based on existing measurement instruments, focus groups and cognitive testing. Criterion validity of the measures (40 items) was examined with Latino fathers and their early adolescents (10-14 years old, n = 96 dyads) who were predominantly from low-income, two-parent households. Criterion validity was indicated by significantly higher intakes of fruit and vegetables; lower intakes of sugar-sweetened beverages, sweets/salty snacks and fast foods; more weekly physical activity hours; and fewer daily screen time hours among adolescents who reported high versus low levels/frequencies of supportive parenting practices. In addition, nearly all scales of adolescent-reported paternal behavioral modeling and availability/accessibility practices were significantly correlated with adolescents’ corresponding EBRBs (r = 0.22 to 0.54). However, poor validity and agreement with early adolescents’ reports were found for most father-reported parenting practices. Overall, this study indicated that the measures were acceptable for assessing adolescents’ report of Latino fathers’ parenting practices around EBRBs. The findings also indicate the importance of including early adolescents’ reports in measuring paternal parenting practices. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study conducted a comprehensive review of work conditions and health risks/problems for various hospitality workers and summarized the various health and wellness promotion programs available in the workplace with the aim of identifying the key elements of successful employee wellness programs. In this review, physical health problems, such as musculoskeletal disorders, lung diseases, and dermatologic diseases, as well as mental health problems that are common among hospitality employees were discussed. In addition, different types of wellness programs that may help employees to overcome these health problems were included. In the next stage, interviews with hotel staff holding multiple positions were conducted to identify the most significant health challenges and assess their preference for various types of wellness initiatives. Using MAXQDA Pro, health-related categories and themes were extracted from the interviews. Participants believed that the lack of time, physical challenges and stress are the top three wellness challenges in the hospitality industry. In order to tackle the challenges, they stated that hospitality businesses should provide various wellness initiatives including healthy eating and weight management, smoking cessation, stress management, exercise programs, and fitbits or other wellness tracker devices.

AB  - The brain is approximately 75% water. Therefore, insufficient water intake may affect the cognitive performance of humans. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of water restriction and supplementation on cognitive performances and mood, and the optimum amount of water to alleviate the detrimental effects of dehydration, among young adults. A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 76 young, healthy adults aged 18-23 years old from Baoding, China. After fasting overnight for 12 h, at 8:00 a.m. of day 2, the osmolality of the first morning urine and blood, cognitive performance, and mood were measured as a baseline test. After water restriction for 24 h, at 8:00 a.m. of day 3, the same indexes were measured as a dehydration test. Participants were randomly assigned into four groups: water supplementation group (WS group) 1, 2, or 3 (given 1000, 500, or 200 mL purified water), and the no water supplementation group (NW group). Furthermore, participants were instructed to drink all the water within 10 min. Ninety minutes later, the same measurements were performed as a rehydration test. Compared with the baseline test, participants were all in dehydration and their scores on the portrait memory test, vigor, and self-esteem decreased (34 vs. 27, p < 0.001; 11.8 vs. 9.2, p < 0.001; 7.8 vs. 6.4, p < 0.001). Fatigue and TMD (total mood disturbance) increased (3.6 vs. 4.8, p = 0.004; 95.7 vs. 101.8, p < 0.001) in the dehydration test. Significant interactions between time and volume were found in hydration status, fatigue, vigor, TMD, symbol search test, and operation span test (F = 6.302, p = 0.001; F = 3.118, p = 0.029; F = 2.849, p = 0.043; F = 2.859, p = 0.043; F = 3.463, p = 0.021) when comparing the rehydration and dehydration test. Furthermore, the hydration status was better in WS group 1 compared to WS group 2; the fatigue and TMD scores decreased, and the symbol search test and operation span test scores increased, only in WS group 1 and WS group 2 (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference between them (p > 0.05). Dehydration impaired episodic memory and mood. Water supplementation improved processing speed, working memory, and mood, and 1000 mL was the optimum volume.

AB  - Background Social support is an important health determinant and may affect dietary behaviors. The purpose of this study was to examine the relations between perceived social support and the Chinese Diet Balance Index-16 (DBI-16) among ethnic minority groups in Southwest China. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted between May 2019 and August 2020 among six ethnic minority groups native to Yunnan Province (n = 3564). Perceived social support from family, friends and significant others were measured with the Multi-dimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). Dietary data were obtained using a 100-item Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) and a lifestyle questionnaire. Lower Bound Score (LBS), Higher Bound Score (HBS) and Diet Quality Distance (DQD) which represent inadequate, excessive and unbalanced food intake respectively were calculated to measure the compliance with the recommendations of the Dietary Guidelines for Chinese 2016. Results One thousand four hundred ninety-six men and two thousand sixty-eight women were included. 51.2% of the subjects had moderate or high levels of inadequate intake; 21.3% had moderate or high levels of excessive intake; and 74.0% had moderate or high levels of unbalanced dietary intake. With potential confounders adjusted, support from family was negatively associated with inadequate intake, while support from friends was positively associated with inadequate and excessive intake. No significant associations were found between perceived social support from significant others and diet quality indicators. Conclusions An unbalanced diet is common among adults of the ethnic minority groups in Yunnan Province, Southwest China. Social support should be taken into account in designing nutrition interventions rather than focusing solely on individuals.

AB  - In this study, we had two inter-related goals: (a) to examine sex and minority status differences on children's motivation for physical education (PE; i.e., their expectancy beliefs, subjective task values, and situational interest) and their psychomotor learning outcomes (i.e., motor competence, cardiorespiratory fitness, and in-class physical activity); and (b) to examine the relationships between children's motivation and their psychomotor learning outcomes while testing the moderation effects of sex and minority status. We recruited 195 fourth and fifth-grade students (101 boys; 94 girls; M-age = 10.7, SD = 0.7 years) from three elementary schools in North Texas. Using multivariate analysis of variance, we identified a significant sex difference that favored boys in motivation and psychomotor learning outcomes, with no significant minority status difference in relation to these variables. Regression analysis revealed that children's expectancy beliefs were significantly associated with both motor competence (R-2 = 11%) and cardiorespiratory fitness (R-2 = 16%), while both situational interest and sex were associated with in-class physical activity (R-2 = 18%). Thus, improving children's expectancy beliefs may be a means of enhancing psychomotor learning outcomes in PE, especially for girls. Enhancing children's beliefs in their own ability and offering diversified PE content so as to generate greater interest may facilitate psychomotor learning.

AB  - Background and Aim: The association of sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption and takeaway dietary pattern with psychological problems in Chinese children and adolescents has not been concretely reported. Our study aimed to investigate the association between SSB consumption, takeaway dietary pattern, and psychological and behavioral problems (PBPs). Methods: Cluster sampling method has been adopted from April to May 2019 to conduct a questionnaire survey among 30,188 children and adolescents in grades 1 to 12 from 14 schools in six streets in Bao'an District of Shenzhen. This cross-sectional study investigated the association of consumption of SSBs and takeaway patterns with PBPs, and PBPs were measured by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) in primary, junior, and senior high school students. Results: A total of 33,801 primary, junior, and senior high school students (mean age = 12.44, SD = 3.47) ranging from 6 to 18 years old were recruited in this study using a health survey of children and adolescents in junior and senior high schools (grades 1-12), and 30,188 students with no missing data were finally analyzed (questionnaires with missing value > 5% were excluded). The top three SSBs in the intake frequency were milk beverage drinks (not milk), vegetable protein drinks, and fruit and vegetable juice drinks. Adjusted for demographic factors, the higher the frequency of students consuming SSBs who have significantly higher PBPs, the higher the frequency of students with takeaway dietary patterns who also have significantly higher PBPs. More frequent intake of SSBs [odds ratio (OR) = 2.23, 95%CI = 2.0-2.47, p < 0.01] and higher takeaway dietary patterns (OR = 2.34, 95%CI = 1.81-3.03, p < 0.01) were associated with higher SDQ total difficulties scores. When low and medium consumption of SSB was compared, children and adolescents who have high SSB intake were more associated with total difficulties score (OR = 3.10, 95%CI = 2.67-3.59, p < 0.01), and when low and medium takeaway dietary patterns were compared, children and adolescents who have high takeaway dietary patterns were more associated with total difficulties score. The joint associations of SSBs and takeaway pattern with SDQ were stronger than the associations individually. Conclusions: Students consuming higher SSBs and having takeaway dietary pattern are associated with increased levels of PBPs individually and interactively. These results may have implications for mental health prevention in adolescents.

AB  - Performing high-intensity exercise (HIE) in the morning under sleep deprivation may harm the health benefits related to sufficient sleep and HIE. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the effects of acute-partial sleep deprivation on HIE performance and cardiac autonomic activity by monitoring heart rate variability (HRV) indices. Twenty-nine healthy male adolescents in college were recruited to perform a one-time HIE session on the treadmill (Bruce protocol) after >= 7 h of normal control sleep (control) and after <= 4 h of acute-partial sleep deprivation (SD). At the beginning of control and SD periods and after exercising under the two sleep conditions, heart rate (HR), standard deviation of normal to normal (SDNN), square root of the mean squared differences of successive NN intervals (RMSSD), normalized low frequency power (LFn), normalized high frequency power (HFn), number of pairs adjacent NN intervals differing by >= 50 ms in the entire recording count divided by the total number of all NN intervals (pNN50), and short axis and long axis value in Poincare plot (SD1 and SD2) were measured at rest in an upright sitting position. The participants slept 7.63 +/- 0.52 and 3.78 +/- 0.69 h during control and SD periods, respectively (p < 0.001). Compared with the control participants, those suffering sleep deprivation experienced a significant decrease in exercise duration, RMSSD, HFn, SD1, and pNN50 as well as a significant increase in maximum heart rate during exercise (p < 0.05). SDNN, RMSSD, HFn, SD1, and pNN50 decreased significantly after exercise (p < 0.05 and 0.01 and 0.001, respectively). In summary, acute-partial sleep deprivation affected aerobic exercise performance the next morning and led to decreased cardiac vagus activity and cardiac autonomic dysfunction.

AB  - Background: COVID-19 is a highly contagious and highly pathogenic disease caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, and it has become a pandemic. As a vulnerable population, university students are at high risk during the epidemic, as they have high mobility and often overlook the severity of the disease because they receive incomplete information about the epidemic. In addition to the risk of death from infection, the epidemic has placed substantial psychological pressure on the public. In this respect, university students are more prone to psychological problems induced by the epidemic compared to the general population because for most students, university life is their first time outside the structure of the family, and their mental development is still immature. Internal and external expectations and academic stress lead to excessive pressure on students, and unhealthy lifestyles also deteriorate their mental health. The outbreak of COVID-19 was a significant social event, and it could potentially have a great impact on the life and the mental health of university students. Therefore, it is of importance to investigate university students' mental health status during the outbreak of COVID-19. Objective: The principal objective of this study was to investigate the influencing factors of the psychological responses of Chinese university students during the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: This study used data from a survey conducted in China between February 21 and 24, 2020, and the data set contains demographic information and psychological measures including the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, the Self-Rating Depression Scale, and the compulsive behaviors portion of the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale. A total of 2284 questionnaires were returned, and 2270 of them were valid and were used for analysis. The Mann-Whitney U test for two independent samples and binary logistic regression models were used for statistical analysis. Results: Our study surveyed 563 medical students and 1707 nonmedical students. Among them, 251/2270 students (11.06%) had mental health issues. The results showed that contact history of similar infectious disease (odds ratio [OR] 3.363, P=.02), past medical history (OR 3.282, P<.001), and compulsive behaviors (OR 3.525, P<.001) contributed to the risk of mental health issues. Older students (OR 0.928, P=.02), regular daily life during the epidemic outbreak (OR 0.410, P<.001), exercise during the epidemic outbreak (OR 0.456, P<.001), and concern related to COVID-19 (OR 0.638, P=.002) were protective factors for Conclusions: According to the study results, mental health issues have seriously affected university students, and our results are beneficial for identifying groups of university students who are at risk for possible mental health issues so that universities and families can prevent or intervene in the development of potential mental health issues at the early stage of their development.

AB  - The relationship between childhood socioeconomic status (SES) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) remains inconclusive, and the pathways and mechanisms driving this relationship have yet to be clarified. This study aimed to examine the pathways linking childhood SES to T2D prevalence in mid-late adulthood in a low- and middle-income country. The incidence of T2D diagnosed in mid-late Chinese adulthood was assessed using self-reports from the Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). Childhood SES was assessed by the education, occupation, survivorship of the parents and the financial situation of the family, whereas adulthood SES was assessed by education and wage. This study performed structural equation modeling to clarify the direct and indirect pathways from childhood SES to T2D via childhood health, childhood food shortage, adulthood SES and physical activity. A total of 15,132 participants were included, and the prevalence of T2D was 5.24%. This study found that childhood SES was directly associated with T2D in mid-late adulthood, the probability of developing T2D increased by 9.20% of the standard deviation for each decrease in standard deviation in childhood SES. Childhood SES was indirectly associated with T2D via adulthood SES, physical activity, childhood health and food shortage. Adulthood SES and physical activity mainly mediated the indirect pathway from childhood SES and T2D. This study showed direct and indirect pathways from disadvantaged childhood SES to increased risk of T2D in mid-late Chinese adulthood. Childhood SES, adulthood SES, physical activity, childhood health and food shortage were identified as life-course interventional targets that should be considered in the development of effective strategies to reduce the burden of T2D and SES-related health inequities in childhood.

AB  - Objective: We aim to provide early evidence of mental distress and its associated predictors among adults one month into the COVID-19 crisis in Brazil. Methods: We conducted an online survey of 638 adults in Brazil on March 25–28, 2020, about one month (32 days) cross-sectionally after the first COVID-19 case in South America was confirmed in São Paulo. The 638 adults were in 25 states out of the 26 Brazilian states, with the only exception being Roraima, the least populated state in the Amazon. Of all the participating adults, 24%, 20%, and 18% of them were located in Rio de Janeiro state, Santa Catarina state, and São Paulo state respectively. Results: In Brazil, 52% (332) of the sampled adults experienced mild or moderate distress, and 18.8% (120) suffered severe distress. Adults who were female, younger, more educated, and exercised less reported higher levels of distress. Each individual's distance from the Brazilian epicenter of São Paulo interacted with age and workplace attendance to predict the level of distress. The "typhoon eye effect" was stronger for people who were older or attended their workplace less. The most vulnerable adults were those who were far from the epicenter and did not go to their workplace in the week before the survey. Conclusion: Identifying the predictors of distress enables mental health services to better target finding and helping the more mentally vulnerable adults during the ongoing COVID-19 crisis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) is a highly contagious and highly pathogenic disease caused by a novel coronavirus(SARS-CoV-2)and has become a pandemic. As a vulnerable population, university students are at high-risk during the epidemic because they have high mobility and often overlook the severity of the disease due to incomplete information about the epidemic. The epidemic has brought not only the risk of death from infection but also unbearable psychological pressure. In this respect, university students are prone to psychological problems induced by the epidemic compared to the general population, because the university life is the first time out of the structure of family for most students and their mental development is still immature. The internal and external expectations and academic stress lead to excessive pressure, and unhealthy lifestyle also deteriorate their mental health. The outbreak of COVID-19 was a significant social event, and it could potentially have a great impact on the life and the mental health of the university students. Therefore, it is of importance to investigate university students' mental health status during the outbreak of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE(S): The principal objective of this project was to investigate the influencing factors of psychological responses for Chinese university students on COVID-19 outbreak. METHOD(S): This study used survey data conducted in China between 21 and 24 February 2020, and the dataset contains demographic information and psychological measures including the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), and the compulsive behaviors part of the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOCS). A total of 2284 valid questionnaires were returned, and 2270 of them are valid and used for analysis. Mann-Whitney-U Test for two independent samples and binary logistic regression models were used for statistical analysis. RESULT(S): Our study surveyed 563 medical students and 1707 non-medical students. Of these, 251 out of 2270 students (11.06%) had mental health issues. The results showed that contact history of similar infectious disease (OR=3.363, P=.015), PMH (OR=3.282, P<.001), and compulsive behaviors (OR =3.525, P<.001) contributed to the risk of mental health. Older students (OR=0.928, P=.021), regular daily life during the epidemic outbreak (OR=0.410, P<.001), exercise during the epidemic outbreak (OR=0.456, P<.001), and concern on COVID-19 (OR=0.638, P=.002) were protective factors for mental health issues. CONCLUSION(S): According to the study, the mental health issues have seriously affected university students, and our results are benefit for identifying the risky group of universities students on the possible mental health so that universities and families could prevent or intervene the potential mental health development at the early stage of the disease development.

AB  - Purpose: To investigate the incidence, characteristics, and risk factors of sports-related eye injuries among athletes in Tianjin, China. Method(s): A cross-sectional study was carried out from March 2018 to October 2018. In this study, the athletes from Tianjin University of Sports, Tianjin Vocational College of Sports, and Tianjin provincial sports teams were selected for general investigation. In total, 1,673 athletes were invited and 1,413 participated in the study (response rate of 84.5%). Result(s): In total, 1,413 athletes were enrolled; 151 had suffered from sports-related eye injuries, with an incidence of 10.7% (95% CI: 9.1-12.0%). Handball (38.5%) was the sport with the highest incidence of eye injuries, followed by water polo (36.4%) and diving (26.7%). Overall, 42.4% of the athletes were injured by ball and 22.5% of injuries came from teammates. The eye injuries usually occurred during training (64.2%) and competitions (14.6%). Adnexa wound (51.7%) was the most common type of injury. About 11.9% of the athletes with eye injuries had the impaired vision; 66.7% failed to see doctors on time. The athletes <18 years of age had a higher risk of eye injuries (odds ratio [OR] =1.60, 95% CI: 1.06-2.40). The athletes with lower family income (<1,000 RMB) were at risk population for sports-related eye injuries (OR = 3.91, 95% CI: 2.24-6.82). Training >4 h a day increased the risk of eye injuries (OR = 2.21, 95% CI: 1.42-3.43). Conclusion(s): The incidence of sports-related eye injuries among athletes was 10.7% in Tianjin, China. Handball, water polo, and diving were the most common activities of injury. Age, family income, and training time were the risk factors for sports-related eye injuries.© Copyright © 2021 Zhang, Zhu, Sun, Wang, Sun, Li, Huang, Wang, Xie, Han, Zhao, Song, Guo, Yang, Zhang, He, Li, Lei, Zhu, Cui, Miao, Huang, Brant and Yan.

AB  - In this study, we had two inter-related goals: (a) to examine sex and minority status differences on children's motivation for physical education (PE; i.e., their expectancy beliefs, subjective task values, and situational interest) and their psychomotor learning outcomes (i.e., motor competence, cardiorespiratory fitness, and in-class physical activity); and (b) to examine the relationships between children's motivation and their psychomotor learning outcomes while testing the moderation effects of sex and minority status. We recruited 195 fourth and fifth-grade students (101 boys; 94 girls; Mage=10.7, SD = 0.7years) from three elementary schools in North Texas. Using multivariate analysis of variance, we identified a significant sex difference that favored boys in motivation and psychomotor learning outcomes, with no significant minority status difference in relation to these variables. Regression analysis revealed that children's expectancy beliefs were significantly associated with both motor competence (R2=11%) and cardiorespiratory fitness (R2=16%), while both situational interest and sex were associated with in-class physical activity (R2=18%). Thus, improving children's expectancy beliefs may be a means of enhancing psychomotor learning outcomes in PE, especially for girls. Enhancing children's beliefs in their own ability and offering diversified PE content so as to generate greater interest may facilitate psychomotor learning.

AB  - Background: COVID-19 is a highly contagious and highly pathogenic disease caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, and it has become a pandemic. As a vulnerable population, university students are at high risk during the epidemic, as they have high mobility and often overlook the severity of the disease because they receive incomplete information about the epidemic. In addition to the risk of death from infection, the epidemic has placed substantial psychological pressure on the public. In this respect, university students are more prone to psychological problems induced by the epidemic compared to the general population because for most students, university life is their first time outside the structure of the family, and their mental development is still immature. Internal and external expectations and academic stress lead to excessive pressure on students, and unhealthy lifestyles also deteriorate their mental health. The outbreak of COVID-19 was a significant social event, and it could potentially have a great impact on the life and the mental health of university students. Therefore, it is of importance to investigate university students' mental health status during the outbreak of COVID-19. Objective(s): The principal objective of this study was to investigate the influencing factors of the psychological responses of Chinese university students during the COVID-19 outbreak. Method(s): This study used data from a survey conducted in China between February 21 and 24, 2020, and the data set contains demographic information and psychological measures including the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, the Self-Rating Depression Scale, and the compulsive behaviors portion of the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale. A total of 2284 questionnaires were returned, and 2270 of them were valid and were used for analysis. The Mann-Whitney U test for two independent samples and binary logistic regression models were used for statistical analysis. Result(s): Our study surveyed 563 medical students and 1707 nonmedical students. Among them, 251/2270 students (11.06%) had mental health issues. The results showed that contact history of similar infectious disease (odds ratio [OR] 3.363, P=.02), past medical history (OR 3.282, P<.001), and compulsive behaviors (OR 3.525, P<.001) contributed to the risk of mental health issues. Older students (OR 0.928, P=.02), regular daily life during the epidemic outbreak (OR 0.410, P<.001), exercise during the epidemic outbreak (OR 0.456, P<.001), and concern related to COVID-19 (OR 0.638, P=.002) were protective factors for mental health issues. Conclusion(s): According to the study results, mental health issues have seriously affected university students, and our results are beneficial for identifying groups of university students who are at risk for possible mental health issues so that universities and families can prevent or intervene in the development of potential mental health issues at the early stage of their development.Copyright © Xudong Zhang, Xin Shi, Yang Wang, Huiquan Jing, Qingqing Zhai, Kunhang Li, Dan Zhao, Shiyu Zhong, Yuequn Song, Feng Zhang, Yijun Bao.

AB  - Objective: We aim to provide early evidence of mental distress and its associated predictors among adults one month into the COVID-19 crisis in Brazil. Method(s): We conducted an online survey of 638 adults in Brazil on March 25-28, 2020, about one month (32 days) cross-sectionally after the first COVID-19 case in South America was confirmed in Sao Paulo. The 638 adults were in 25 states out of the 26 Brazilian states, with the only exception being Roraima, the least populated state in the Amazon. Of all the participating adults, 24%, 20%, and 18% of them were located in Rio de Janeiro state, Santa Catarina state, and Sao Paulo state respectively. Result(s): In Brazil, 52% (332) of the sampled adults experienced mild or moderate distress, and 18.8% (120) suffered severe distress. Adults who were female, younger, more educated, and exercised less reported higher levels of distress. Each individual's distance from the Brazilian epicenter of Sao Paulo interacted with age and workplace attendance to predict the level of distress. The "typhoon eye effect" was stronger for people who were older or attended their workplace less. The most vulnerable adults were those who were far from the epicenter and did not go to their workplace in the week before the survey. Conclusion(s): Identifying the predictors of distress enables mental health services to better target finding and helping the more mentally vulnerable adults during the ongoing COVID-19 crisis.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Although regular physical exercise has multiple positive benefits for the general population, excessive exercise may lead to exercise dependence (EXD), which is harmful to one's physical and mental health. Increasing evidence suggests that stress is a potential risk factor for the onset and development of EXD. However, little is known about the neural substrates of EXD and the underlying neuropsychological mechanism by which stress affects EXD. Herein, we investigate these issues in 86 individuals who exercise regularly by estimating their cortical gray matter volume (GMV) utilizing a voxel‐based morphometry method based on structural magnetic resonance imaging. Whole‐brain correlation analyses and prediction analyses showed negative relationships between EXD and GMV of the right orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), left subgenual cingulate gyrus (sgCG), and left inferior parietal lobe (IPL). Furthermore, mediation analyses found that the GMV of the right OFC was an important mediator between stress and EXD. Importantly, these results remained significant even when adjusting for sex, age, body mass index, family socioeconomic status, general intelligence and total intracranial volume, as well as depression and anxiety. Collectively, the results of the present study provide crucial evidence of the neuroanatomical basis of EXD and reveal a potential neuropsychological pathway in predicting EXD in which GMV mediates the relationship between stress and EXD.

AB  - Guided by the socio-ecological model, the aim of this study was to investigate the predictive strengths of individual, social, and physical environmental factors toward different intensities of physical activity (PA; vigorous PA, moderate PA, walking) and sedentary behavior (SB) among college students. A cross-sectional research design was used. There were 287 college students (M-age = 20.75 +/- 2.91; 54% female) recruited from a public research university in the Southwestern United States. Participants completed previously validated questionnaires assessing their PA, SB, and perceptions of self-efficacy, social support, and physical environment variables. Correlation and hierarchical regression analyses were performed to examine the associations and the relative contributions of those individual, social, and physical environmental factors to PA and SB, respectively. The findings indicated that self-efficacy, social support from friends, and convenience of using exercise facilities were positively correlated with vigorous PA. Self-efficacy and physical environmental factor such as convenience of using exercise facilities were significantly associated with students' moderate PA. Physical environmental factors, including convenience of using exercise facilities, satisfaction with neighborhood services, ease of walking to public transportation stop, and detached single-family residence were significantly related to walking, while only detached single-family residence was associated to SB. The results highlight PA interventions may do well to focus on the promotion of individual and environmental variables to increase PA in college students. More evidence is needed to determine the relationships between social ecological factors and SB.

AB  - Physical activity (PA) and sleep are both important to mental health. However, their joint effects on mental distress have not been well explored. The aim of this study was to investigate the joint effects of PA and sleep on mental health, as well as the dose-response relationships between PA and mental health under different sleep health statuses. A longitudinal panel study was adopted to evaluate the relationship between PA, sleep, and mental health among 66 healthy Chinese college students with four online questionnaire surveys. A mixed-effect model with individual-level random effect was used to analyze the interactive regulation effect of PA and sleep on mental health, and a generalized additive model with splines was further fitted to analyze dose-response relationships between variables. When sleep was at a healthy level, no significant difference in mental health was observed between different levels of PA (p > 0.05). However, poor sleepers with moderate and high PA levels indicated significantly fewer negative emotions than those with low PA levels (p = 0.001, p = 0.004). Likewise, poor sleepers who engaged in more moderate intensity PA could significantly reduce negative emotions (beta = -0.470, p = 0.011) in a near-linear trend. In summary, both sleep and PA benefit mental health, and they probably regulate mental health through an interactive compensation mode. For good and poor sleepers, PA plays a different role in maintaining and improving mental health. Increasing moderate intensity PA up to moderate-and-high levels is recommended for those who simultaneously suffer from sleep and psychological health problems.

AB  - Metabolic disorder is globally prevalent in children and adolescents, and physical activity may have a protective role against metabolic disorder. However, the association between metabolic equivalent (MET) and visceral adiposity index (VAI) among children and adolescents remains unclear. This study aimed to address this concern. Data were retrieved from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), which used the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire to assess the physical activity levels. VAI was calculated according to body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), triglyceride (TG), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Linear regression was adopted to assess the association between MET and VAI. Restricted cubic spline regression was used to further explore the nonlinear relationship, Interaction effect analysis was conducted to identify whether the sample characteristic could modify the effect of MET on VAI. After data cleansing, a total of 3402 participants aged<18 years were enrolled. In the fully adjusted linear regression model, the beta for VAI was 0.01 (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.08, 0.09) for the second tertile and-0.11 (95% CI: -0.20, -0.03) for the third tertile. A linear downward trend was found in the restricted cubic spline regression (overall P<.05). Interaction effect analysis revealed no significant effects of age, gender, race, income poverty ratio, and insurance (all P for interaction>0.05). High physical activity intensity is associated with decreased VAI scores in children and adolescents.

AB  - Background: Cervical cancer screening is vital for its prevention. Adherence is a crucial indicator that implies the individual willingness to take cervical cancer screening. We aimed to estimate the global and regional adherence rates of cervical cancer screening in 2019 and identify its associated factors among general women. Method(s): We searched studies in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Database, ProQuest theses database and Google Web, without a lower time limit and until 23 June, 2021. Survey studies were considered eligible if they investigated cervical cancer screening adherence among general women, with data on sample size, the number of adherent subjects, and/or adherence rate. Random-effects were used to pool the odds ratios (ORs) of associated factors of adherence. Using modelling analysis, we estimated 2019 overall and age-specific adherence rates at the global and regional levels in women aged 20-69 years. Result(s): Eight thousand two hundred ninety records were identified, and 153 articles were included. Being married (vs not married: OR, 1.34; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.23-1.46), higher educational attainment (higher than high school vs less than high school: OR, 1.44; 95% CI: 1.35-1.53), having healthcare (OR, 1.64; 95% CI: 1.43-1.88), former smoking (OR, 1.20; 95% CI: 1.07-1.34), physical activity (OR, 1.19; 95% CI: 1.05-1.36), parity (OR, 1.07; 95% CI: 1.01-1.12), and chronic disease (OR, 1.17; 95% CI: 1.04-1.32) were associated with better adherence, whereas obesity (vs normal: OR, 0.85; 95% CI: 0.74-0.97) and current smoking (vs former/never: OR, 0.64; 95% CI: 0.54-0.76) were associated with worse adherence. In 2019, the adherence was at 33.66% (95% CI: 23.34-39.30%) worldwide, and was higher in high-income countries (HICs) (75.66, 95% CI: 66.74-82.81%) than in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) (24.91, 95% CI: 14.30-30.24%). It varied across regions, the highest in the European region (65.36, 95% CI: 55.40-74.19%), but the lowest in the African region (5.28, 95% CI: 3.43-8.03%). Conclusion(s): Cervical cancer screening adherence remained low globally, exhibiting geographical discrepancy with HICs higher than LMICs. Further implementations of screening programs should comprehensively consider the local economy, social benefits, and demographic structure to adapt delivery for vulnerable or underserved women to boost screening adherence.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Promoting adequate physical activity (PA) such as walking and cycling is essential to cope with the global health challenge of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Much research has been conducted to analyze how the built environment can promote PA, but the results are not consistent. Some scholars found that certain built environments such as green spaces generated positive impacts on PA, while some other studies showed no correlations. We suspected that the built environment should be measured in a deeply holistic nuanced way in order to properly reflect its impact on PA. Therefore, our research adopted an integral urban-analysis comparing three typical neighborhoods in Beijing, China. Our data show that the highest PA occurs in the neighborhood with the lowest density, amount of green space and street connectivity, apparently compensated by its low-rise housing type and high appreciation of the quality of sidewalks and street safety. This indicates that dimensions impacting PA have to be considered in context, and the peoples' perception of the built environment matters.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) generally have worse educational and psychosocial outcomes compared with their healthy peers. This can impair their ability to manage their treatment, which in turn can have long-term health consequences through to adulthood. We attempted to capture the experiences of children with CKD and to describe the perspectives of their parents and caregivers on access to educational and psychosocial support. Method(s): Children with CKD (n = 34) and their caregivers (n = 62) were sampled via focus groups from pediatric hospitals in Australia, Canada, and the USA. Sixteen focus groups were convened and the transcripts were analyzed thematically. Result(s): We identified four themes: disruption to self-esteem and identity (emotional turmoil of adolescence, wrestling with the sick self, powerlessness to alleviate child's suffering, balancing normality and protection); disadvantaged by lack of empathy and acceptance (alienated by ignorance, bearing the burden alone); a hidden and inaccessible support system (excluded from formal psychological support, falling behind due to being denied special considerations); and building resilience (finding partners in the journey, moving towards acceptance of the illness, re-establishing childhood). Conclusion(s): Children with CKD and their caregivers encountered many barriers in accessing psychosocial and educational support and felt extremely disempowered and isolated as a consequence. Improved availability and access to psychosocial and educational interventions are needed to improve the wellbeing and educational advancement of children with CKD.

AB  - To compare the difference in the self-rated health status of students from the military university and non-military colleges by questionnaires. Method(s): By random cluster sampling, 820 on-campus students from one military university and two non-military colleges in Guangzhou city were selected as the subjects to assess their self-rated health status with the Self-Rated Health Measurement Scale (SRHMS V1.0). The SRHMS V1.0 was consisted of 3 subscales of physical health, psychosocial health and social health, totally 48 items in 9 dimensions of physical symptom and organic function, daily physical activity, physical mobility, positive emotion, psychosocial symptom and negative emotion, cognitive function, role activity and social adaptability, social resource and social contact, social support. The analyzed indices included the final scores of the three subscales, 9 dimensions and SRHMS V1.0, with the calculated formula: final score=original score of dimension/the theoretically highest score of corresponding dimensionx100. The higher score of SRHMS V1.0 indicated the better self-rated health status. The self-compiled questionnaires were used to investigate the subjects' general conditions, including gender, age, nationality, marital status and education background, et al. The uniform-printed questionnaires were sent out, and in the uniform instruction, the subjects were required to independently finish the questionnaires, which were taken back on the spot. Result(s): Totally 820 questionnaires were sent out and 795 ones were reclaimed with the retrieving rate of 96.9%. Among the reclaimed questionnaires, there were 773 completely finished questionnaires with the finishing rate of 97.2%. 1 For the students of non-military colleges, the final scores of 3 subscales, 9 dimensions and SRHMS V1.0 ranged from 61.10 to 97.55, among which the comparatively higher score was 83.68 of the physical health subscale, and below 70 in 4 dimensions of physical symptom and organic function, psychosocial symptom and negative emotion, cognitive function and social support. 2 The final scores of 3 subscales, 9 dimensions and SRHMS V1.0 of students from non-military colleges were higher than those of students from military university, with the significant difference in the scores of physical, psychosocial subscales and SRHMS V1.0 [(83.01+/-6.60),(84.41+/-6.46),t=2.879, P < 0.05];[(66.05+/-14.05),(68.82 +/-12.97),t=2.777,P < 0.05];[(74.33+/-8.76), (76.09+/-8.89),t=2.599,P < 0.05], while there was no significant difference in the score of social health subscale between the two groups. In the 3 dimensions of physical symptom and organic function, positive emotion and social support, the final scores had significant differences between the two groups [(64.47+/-12.57),(67.30 +/-12.82),t=3.050,P < 0.05];[(73.17+/-16.26),(77.19+/-14.10),t=3.642,P < 0.05]; [(64.28+/-17.41),(67.58+/-15.95),t=2.733,P < 0.05](P < 0.05),while there was no significant difference in the final scores of other dimensions, including daily physical activity, physical mobility, psychosocial symptom and negative emotion, cognitive function, role activity ands social adaptability, social resource and social contact(P > 0.05). Conclusion(s): The self-rated health status of students from military university and non-military colleges are both generally good, and the students from non-military colleges are significantly better than those from military university, especially in the aspects of physical health, psychologic health and general self-rated health. Great efforts should be put into the improvement of psychologic health status among the military university students.

AB  - Objective: To examine the association between shift work and unhealthy weight among female nurses and midwives. Methods: A cross-sectional study. Measurement outcomes included shift work, unhealthy weight (underweight: body mass index [BMI] < 18.5; overweight: BMI 25.0 to 29.9; obesity: BMI > 30.0), diet quality, physical-activity level, alcohol consumption, and smoking status. Results: Among the 2494 participants (1259 day and 1235 shift workers), only 1% of the participants were underweight, 31.8% were overweight, and 26.9% were obese. After adjusting the selected confounders, shift workers were 1.15 times more likely to be overweight/obese than day workers (P = 0.013, 95% confidence interval, 1.03 to 1.28; P = 0.02, 95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.30, respectively). Conclusions: Shift work is associated with higher risk of being overweight/obese. Longitudinal studies are being undertaken to better understand the causal relationship between shift work and unhealthy weight. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Unhealthy lifestyle behaviors during pregnancy often predispose women to multiple risks including adverse pregnancy outcomes and impaired health status for mothers. This study assessed the trends in the prevalence of health-related behavioral risk factors over time among U.S. pregnant women. Methods: Data from 22,604 pregnant women aged 18–44 years who participated in the 2001–2009 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System were analyzed to assess the trends in the prevalence of behavioral risk factors. Correlates of having individual or clustering healthy behaviors were also assessed among 2295 pregnant women in the 2009 survey. Results: From 2001 to 2009, among pregnant women, the age-adjusted prevalence of engaging in leisure-time exercise and receiving influenza vaccination increased significantly (p < 0.05 for linear trends); the prevalence of any alcohol consumption decreased marginally (p = 0.065 for linear trend); and the prevalence of binge drinking, smoking, and consuming fruits and vegetables ≥ 5 times/day varied little. Over the 9 years, the percentages of pregnant women who reported having all four healthy behaviors (i.e., not currently smoking, no alcohol consumption, engaging in leisure-time exercise, and receiving influenza vaccination) increased linearly from 7.3% in 2001 to 21.2% in 2009 (p < 0.001). Sociodemographic characteristics, perceived health status, and health-care availability were differentially associated with certain individual or clustered healthy behaviors. Conclusions: Increased efforts emphasizing multiple health-related behavioral risk factors including reducing alcohol use, binge drinking, and smoking and improving fruit and vegetable consumption during pregnancy are needed.

AB  - Purpose: Evidence suggests that high-risk lifestyle behaviors exacerbate the health of cancer survivors and increase cancer mortality. This study examined the prevalence of lifestyle related risk factors among female breast cancer survivors by duration of survivorship in the United States. Methods: We analyzed data from 7,443 women aged ≥18-years who participated in the 2009 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and reported having ever-diagnosed breast cancer. Adjusted prevalence with 95 % confidence interval for lifestyle-related risk factors (including current smoking, excessive alcohol drinking, obesity, engaging in physical activity ≥150 min/week, and consuming fruits and vegetables ≥5 times/day) was estimated using log-linear regression while controlling for confounders. Results: Overall, the prevalence estimates for lifestyle-related risk factors were 10.2 % for current smoking, 6.8 % for excessive alcohol drinking, 24.7 % for obesity, 53.8 % for engaging in physical activity ≥150 min/week, and 33.9 % for consuming fruits and vegetables ≥5 times/day among female breast cancer survivors. After adjustment for covariates, with increasing years of survivorship, a linearly increasing trend was observed for current smoking (P=0.038), and quadratic trends were observed for excessive alcohol drinking (P<0.001) and obesity (P=0.048). The adjusted prevalence estimates for engaging in physical activity ≥150- min/week and consuming fruits and vegetables ≥5 times/day did not vary significantly by duration of survivorship. Conclusion: Continuing efforts on counseling and encouraging breast cancer survivors to adopt healthy lifestyles are needed to improve their health. Implications for cancer survivors: Understanding the trends of modifiable lifestyle-related risk factors among breast cancer survivors with varying duration of survivorship may assist health care providers to provide appropriate counseling for breast cancer patients to improve their health. Clinical and public health intervention programs should seek to maximize the number of recommended healthy behaviors especially in those women who are at high risk for failing to comply with the healthy lifestyle guidelines.

AB  - Parental illness and death due to human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) impose challenges to children's psychological adjustment. Positive psychology emphasizes individual's resilience in the face of adversity, trauma, and tragedy. Limited data are available regarding the factors that can cultivate resilience of children affected by HIV/AIDS. This study aims to examine the role of extracurricular interest in strengthening resilience among children affected by HIV/AIDS. Participants included 755 children orphaned by parental HIV/AIDS, 466 vulnerable children living with HIV-positive parent(s), and 404 comparison children from HIV-free families in the same community in rural China. The measures include extracurricular interest (i.e., reading, sports, music, painting, science, and playing chess) and indicators of psychological adjustment (i.e., depression, loneliness, and self-esteem). Having extracurricular interest was positively associated with self-esteem and negatively associated with depression and loneliness. Having extracurricular interest attenuated the negative effect of parental HIV/AIDS on children's self-esteem and loneliness, after controlling for children's age, gender, and family socioeconomic status. The findings underscore the importance of nurturing extracurricular interest and make available of such activities to promote resilience for children affected by HIV/AIDS in resource-limited settings.

AB  - Objectives: To examine the individual, parental, and neighborhood environment correlates of children’s physical activity and risk of obesity. Methods: Secondary data of 1514 children drawn from the Delaware Survey of Children’s Health were used for analysis. A conceptual framework was developed based on the Social Determinants of Health and Environmental Health Promotion model and tested using structural equation modeling. Results: Findings confirmed that parental support on physical activity and a favorable neighborhood environment predicted children’s physical activity. However, the risk of overweight and obesity was not associated with parental support of physical activity and children’s physical activity. Conclusions: Future preventive practice requires a multifaceted approach incorporating both individual and environmental changes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: To investigate the application value of three-dimensional (3-D) printing technology in the operation of distal tibia fracture involving epiphyseal plate injury for teenagers., Methods: The retrospective analysis was conducted on the clinical data of 16 cases of children patients with distal tibia fracture involving epiphyseal plate injury undergoing the operation by using of 3-D printing technology between January 2014 and December 2015. There were 12 males and 4 females with an age of 9-14 years (mean, 12.8 years). The causes of injury included traffic accident injury in 9 cases, heavy pound injury in 3 cases, and sport injury in 4 cases. The time from injury to operation was 3-92 hours (mean, 25.8 hours). According to Salter-Harris typing standard, the typing for epiphyseal injury was classified as type II in 11 cases, type III in 4 cases, and type IV in 1 case. The thin slice CT scan on the affected limb was performed before operation, and the Mimics14.0 medical software was applied for the design and the 1:1 fracture model was printed by the 3-D printer; the stimulation of operative reduction was made in the fracture model, and bone plate, Kirschner wire, and hollow screw with the appropriate size were chosen, then the complete operative approach and method were designed and the internal fixator regimen was chosen, then the practical operation was performed based on the preoperative design regimen., Results: The operation time was 40-68 minutes (mean, 59.1 minutes); the intraoperative blood loss was 5-102 mL (mean, 35 mL); the intraoperative fluoroscopy times was 2-6 times (mean, 2.8 times). All the patiens were followed up 12-24 months (mean, 15 months). The fracture of 15 cases reached anatomic reduction, and 1 cases had no anatomic reduction with the displaced end less than 1 mm. All the fractures reached bony union with the healing time of 2-4 months (mean, 2.6 months). There was no deep vein thrombosis, premature epiphyseal closure and oblique, or uneven ankle surface occurred, and there was no complication such as osteomyelitis, varus or valgus of ankle joint, joint stiffness, traumatic arthritis. Helfet scores of ankle function were measured at 12 months after operation, the results were excellent in 15 cases and good in 1 case. The angulation of introversion and extroversion for the affected limb was (6.56+/-2.48)degree, and the growth length was (4.44+/-2.31) mm, and there was no significant difference ( t=0.086, P=0.932; t=0.392, P=0.697) when compared with the uninjured side [(6.50+/-1.51)degree, (4.69+/-1.08) mm]., Conclusion: As the assistive technology, 3-D printing technology has a certain clinical application value in improving the effectiveness of distal tibia fracture involving epiphyseal plate injury.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Acute abdominal pain can be a surgical emergency. However, benign etiologies, such as epiploic appendagitis (EA), can present with similar symptoms. We report a case of an otherwise healthy woman, on oral contraceptives (OCP), presenting with severe abdominal pain related to epiploic appendagitis. Timely recognition of this condition is important to avoid misdiagnosis and unnecessary surgical interventions. CASE DESCRIPTION/METHODS: A 44-year-old woman with a past medical history of ovarian cyst and BMI 25 presented to the Emergency Department with a three-day history of sharp left lower quadrant (LLQ) pain. Patient reported that she started a vigorous aerobic exercise regimen 6 weeks before. Only medication was norgestimate-ethinyl estradiol for contraception. Vital signs normal. Physical exam showed tender LLQ without rebound tenderness or rigidity. Initial testing including complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, pregnancy test, urinalysis, and vaginitis panel were unremarkable. Given worsening pain, CT scan of abdomen and pelvis with contrast was obtained showing an encapsulated oval, pericolonic fatty nodule adjacent to the sigmoid colon, with surrounding fat stranding consistent with EA. Patient was discharged home with conservative pain management. Her OCP was discontinued. She had no symptom recurrence within a 3-year period. DISCUSSION: EA is an uncommon cause of acute abdominal pain that mimics serious medical or surgical emergencies such as acute diverticulitis, appendicitis, or, gynecological emergencies such as ruptured ectopic pregnancy. It is, generally, a self-limited ischemic infarction involving the epiploic appendices, which are normal outpouching fat of the lower colon and rectum. EA can be divided into primary versus secondary. The primary form is caused by either torsion or spontaneous venous thrombosis of an epiploic appendage central draining vein. It commonly occurs in men aged 20-50. Risk factors include obesity, hernia, and rigorous exercise. Secondary form is related to inflammation of adjacent organs. Although our patient does not match the typical profile for EA, rigorous exercise and probably OCP usage, a risk factor for thromboembolic phenomena, may have triggered this episode. Diagnosis of EA is by imaging via ultrasound or CT scan, and complete resolution typically occurs within two weeks with conservative management. Prompt identification of EA is essential in patients at risk, to avoid unnecessary surgical procedures. (Figure Presented).

AB  - Objectives : college students, as builders and successors of socialist society, their own health status is not only closely related to their own happy life, but also closely related to the rise and fall of the country, social stability and harmony. The study on the health of college students' "otaku" cannot only correctly understand the phenomenon of "otaku" of college students, and guide the college students to healthy " get out of curtilage", but also promote the construction of harmonious society. Methods : by the methods of questionnaire investigation, interview and logical analysis of college students in Harbin "otaku" health has carried on the investigation and study. Take the principle of convenience sampling, select 11 universities in the city of Harbin, and randomly select college students as their subjects. A total of 1266 questionnaires were issued and the effective questionnaire was 1199, and the questionnaire rate was 94.71%. Through investigation, it is found that the health problems of college students' "otaku" are closely related to sports culture, Internet subculture, and the communication between family and school. Results : 1. Sports consciousness and there is a close relationship between college students' "otaku", the formation of good sports consciousness help behavior, which directly affect the personal health. 2. Positive network subculture can be accepted by network mainstream culture and become an important part of network mainstream culture. A negative network subculture can have a negative effect on people, and in certain cases may even result in its illegal crime, hindering the growth and development of individuals. Conclusion : Long- term "indoor- living" has a negative impact on the physical and mental health of college students, hindering their future growth and development. The way out of "otaku" of college students can be started from leading the public opinion, strengthening the two- way communication between family and school, promoting students' self- correction and so on, and improving the health level of college students by helping them to treat "otaku" reasonably. Make it a social and national talent available.

AB  - Objectives Youth with obesity have been shown to have significant deficits in health-related quality of life (HRQOL). However, scarce research has been conducted on HRQOL in children with obesity and documented cardiometabolic risk, especially in children ages 8-12. Our study aims to compare HRQOL between children with obesity and at risk for type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and children from the general population in addition to analyzing how children and parents perceive childrens' HRQOL. Methods Forty-five children and adolescents ages 8-18 with obesity and at risk for T2DM (fasting glucose >=100 mg/dL, 2 hour oral glucose tolerance test [OGTT] blood glucose level >=140 mg/dL, fasting insulin >16 uIU/mL, insulin peak post-OGTT load >150 uIU/mL, or insulin level at 120 minutes of OGTT >75 uIU/mL) were recruited. The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Version 4.0 and the Family Nutrition Physical Activity (FNPA) tool, which studies obesogenic environments and practices, were utilized. A lower FNPA score is associated with more obesogenic environment. Results Parents of the children recruited reported significant decreases in total, physical and emotional HRQOL in comparison to the general population (all p-values <0.005). These decreases remained significant when examining subsets of the children by age group (8-12 and 13-18 years). The children themselves also reported significant decreases in total, physical and emotional HRQOL (all p-values <0.04). However, these decreases in the overall sample were driven by significantly lower scores in the 13-18 age group (all p-values <0.05, n=25). Adolescents 13-18 also self-reported significantly decreased school functioning HRQOL (p=0.025). In addition, adolescents had significantly lower total FNPA scores compared to children (p=0.003), as well as significantly lower scores in the "Beverage Choices" (p=0.006) and "Healthy Environment" (p=0.024) FNPA subcategories. When comparing children with obesity (n=27) and severe obesity (BMI >=99thpercentile for age, n=18), parent-reported total, physical, and social HRQOL (all p-values<0.03) were significantly decreased in the severe obesity group. Conclusions Youth, especially adolescents, with obesity and at risk for T2DM experience significant decreases in quality of life compared to the general population. Targeted interventions based on observed disparities in age and category of obesity are needed.

AB  - Digital data trails from disparate sources covering different aspects of student life are stored daily in most modern university campuses. However, it remains challenging to (i) combine these data to obtain a holistic view of a student, (ii) use these data to accurately predict academic performance, and (iii) use such predictions to promote positive student engagement with the university. To initially alleviate this problem, in this article, a model named Augmented Education (AugmentED) is proposed. In our study, (1) first, an experiment is conducted based on a real-world campus dataset of college students (N =156) that aggregates multisource behavioral data covering not only online and offline learning but also behaviors inside and outside of the classroom. Specifically, to gain in-depth insight into the features leading to excellent or poor performance, metrics measuring the linear and nonlinear behavioral changes (e.g., regularity and stability) of campus lifestyles are estimated; furthermore, features representing dynamic changes in temporal lifestyle patterns are extracted by the means of long short-term memory (LSTM). (2) Second, machine learning-based classification algorithms are developed to predict academic performance. (3) Finally, visualized feedback enabling students (especially at-risk students) to potentially optimize their interactions with the university and achieve a study-life balance is designed. The experiments show that the AugmentED model can predict students' academic performance with high accuracy.

AB  - Health insurance coverage has increased overtime in the US. This study examined the associations between health insurance status and adoption of health-related behaviors among US adults. Using data collected through the 2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System on health insurance coverage and type of insurance, we examined four health-related behaviors (i.e., no tobacco use, nondrinking or moderate drinking, meeting aerobic physical activity recommendations, and having a healthy body weight) and their associations with health insurance status. We conducted log-linear regression analyses to assess the associations with adjustment for potential confounders. Results showed the percentages of adults who reported no tobacco use or meeting physical activity recommendations were significantly higher, and the percentages of adults with a healthy body weight were significantly lower among those who were insured versus uninsured, or among adults with private insurance versus uninsured. Adults with health insurance also had a higher prevalence of reporting all 4 health-related behaviors than those uninsured. These patterns persisted after multivariable adjustment for potential confounders including sociodemographics, routine checkup, and number of chronic diseases. Adults with public insurance were 7% more likely to report no tobacco use than adults who were uninsured. Additionally, adults with private insurance were 8% and 7% more likely to report no tobacco use and meeting physical activity recommendations, respectively, but 10% less likely to report nondrinking or moderate drinking than adults with public insurance. In conclusion, we found significant associations existed between having health insurance coverage and engaging in some health-related behaviors among US adults.

AB  - Background: COVID-19 is still spreading worldwide and posing a threat to individuals’ physical and mental health including problematic internet use (PIU). A potentially high-risk group for PIU are those with symptoms of attention deficit and hyperactivity (ADHD symptoms), because of restrictions in their physical activity levels and engagement in computer diversions requiring only short attention spans. Methods: We used convenience sampling in a cross-sectional survey of university students from 30 universities in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. We assessed PIU using the Internet Addiction Test and ADHD symptoms using the WHO Adult ADHD Self-Report Screening Scale. Using logistic regression and linear regression analyses we adjusted for demographic, epidemic-related and psychological covariates in models of the association between ADHD symptoms and PIU. Results: Among 11,254 participants, we found a 28.4% (95% CI, 27.5%-29.2%) prevalence of PIU, relatively higher than before the pandemic. In our final logistic regression model, participants with ADHD symptoms had approximately two times the risk for PIU (OR: 2.31, 95% CI: 1.89-2.83). Similarly, individuals with depression, anxiety, insomnia, PTSD symptoms and feeling stress during the pandemic had a higher risk of PIU, while those exercising regularly during the pandemic had a lower risk. Limitations: The cross-sectional design and reliance on internet based self-reports for ADHD symptoms and PIU assessments, without direct structured interviews for validation, are limitations. Conclusions: The prevalence of PIU was high during COVID-19, and those people with ADHD symptoms and other mental illness symptoms appear to be at higher risk of PIU. Regular exercise may reduce that PIU risk and hence should be recommended during the COVID-19 pandemic. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Aims Exercise promotes functional recovery among stroke survivors and is recommended to be commenced as soon as is feasible. However, little is known about stroke survivors' perception of participation in exercise or sitting Tai Chi, a more culturally appropriate and popular movement in China. To explore Chinese stroke survivors' perceptions of participation in exercise or sitting Tai Chi. Methods Face-to-face semi-structured interviews and content analysis of transcripts were conducted with a purposive and results sample of 30 stroke survivors. The qualitative study explored perceptions of post-stroke participation in exercise or sitting Tai Chi. The consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research checklist was used to report findings. Perceived facilitators of exercise participation were healthcare professionals' encouragement and recommendations, family and peer support and survivors' motivation, intention, and self-perceived benefits. Perceived barriers were fear of falling, physical discomfort, and challenges in standing. Despite some reservations, most participants were willing to try sitting Tai Chi. Conclusions Encouragement and support, motivation, and perceived benefits were important for exercise participation after stroke. With the premise that all medical and nursing students in China are trained in Tai Chi, for stroke survivors with no access to formal exercise programmes, sitting Tai Chi may offer an appropriate alternative.Copyright Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

AB  - This article examines the historical formation of local masculine identity in the city of Dalian in north-east China. I argue that the experiences of Dalian-Chinese men under Japanese colonialism (190545) established a model of masculine identity based on bodily resistance. The article explores Dalian men's encounter with colonialism by comparing two different forms of bodily experience: military calisthenics in Japanese-run schools for Chinese boys and street soccer. On the one hand, military calisthenics impressed Chinese schoolboys with a sense of subjugation focused on the body. Bodily movements were performed under the strict scrutiny of Japanese drill masters and formed an integral part of everyday rituals of obedience. On the other hand, street soccer emerged as a popular and potentially creative activity among Chinese schoolboys. In contrast with the controlled motions of military calisthenics, soccer offered a sense of freedom in its unrestricted and improvised movements. Matches against Japanese teams even more explicitly infused soccer with a spirit of nationalistic resistance. In conclusion, I argue that these bodily experiences are crucial to understanding the historical reformations of Dalian male gender identity.

AB  - This study examines the interactive contextual effect of income inequality on health. Specifically, we hypothesize that income inequality will moderate the relationships between individual-level risk factors and health. Using National Health Interview Survey data 1984−2007 (n = 607,959) and U.S. Census data, this paper estimates the effect of the dramatic increase in income inequality in the U.S. over the past two decades on the gradient of socioeconomic status on two measures of health (i.e., physical functioning and activity limitations). Results indicate that increasing income inequality strengthens the protective effects of family income, employment, college education, and marriage on these two measures of health. In contrast, high school education’s protective effect (relative to less than a high school education) weakens in the context of increasing income inequality. In addition, we find that increasing income inequality exacerbates men’s disadvantages in physical functioning and activity limitations. These findings shed light on research about growing health disparities in the U.S. in the last several decades. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - A "poverty belt" surrounding Beijing has formed/consisting of 2.7 million rural residents who live below the poverty line residing in nearly 4,000 villages of 32 Hebei counties adjacent to Beijing. This study examined disparities in dietary habits and anthropometric indicators between Chinese students living in Beijing metropolitan area and those in the rural "poverty belt" surrounding Beijing. Multivariate linear, negative binomial, and logistic regressions were conducted to estimate differences in dietary habits and anthropometric indicators between urban and rural students. Students (N = 646) from four primary and middle schools were surveyed, two located in Beijing metropolitan area and the other two within the rural "poverty belt" surrounding Beijing. Rural students on average consumed fruit and vegetables 1.93 times less than their urban counter parts in the past week; whereas they consumed sugar-sweetened beverages 1.30 times and junk foods 4.98 times more than their urban counterparts in the past week. The waist-to-hip ratio of rural students was on average 0.04 higher than that of their urban counterparts. In subgroup analysis by sex, no urban-rural differences in body mass index, overweight/obesity rate, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, or body fat percentage were identified among boys; whereas the waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio of rural girls were on average 5 cm and 0.06 higher than urban girls, respectively. In conclusion, rural students had noticeably poorer dietary habits and worse weight-related health indicators than their urban counterparts. Improving diet quality among Chinese rural students is essential in reducing rural-urban health disparities.

AB  - Osteochondritis dissecans and cartilage injuries of the knee are among the most challenging clinical entities that pediatric sports medicine specialists encounter. As a weight-bearing joint with significant long-term implications on mobility and overall physical health, the knee also happens to be the most injured or adversely affected joint in preadolescent and adolescent athletes. However, cartilage injuries are unique among other musculoskeletal pathologies in children, in that the healing potential of articular cartilage tissue is limited, and minor injuries or small focal defects can have devastating implications on the lifelong health of the joint. Although the most common form of degenerative joint disease affecting the general population is, of course, osteoarthritis, other conditions such as osteochondritis dissecans or acute, traumatic osteochondral shear injuries can activate their own arthritic pathway, whereby focal injuries precipitate an eventual cascade of diffuse degeneration. Thus, it is important for sports medicine and pediatric orthopaedic specialists alike to understand, diagnose, and initiate early, evidence-based management for cartilage conditions of the knee in pediatric patients. This chapter reviews principles of diagnosis and management of both knee osteochondritis dissecans (a chronic condition of subchondral bone that often secondarily affects the articular cartilage) and acute traumatic cartilage shear injuries. Although the two entities are quite different from an etiologic standpoint, there is significant overlap in technical considerations and treatment principles between these two conditions.

AB  - PurposeTo determine the association between poor visual acuity, the use of digital devices and physical activity (PA) during the COVID-19 pandemic. MethodsA total of 327,646 Chinese children and adolescents were included in the analysis using a cluster random sampling method; this is a case-control study, of those 144,708 children and adolescents with poor visual acuity were included in the case group, while 182,938 who did not have poor visual acuity were included in the control group. A logistic regression model was used to assess the contribution of PA and the use of digital devices to poor visual acuity. ResultsA total of 144,708 children and adolescents experienced poor visual acuity during the COVID-19 pandemic; 54.8% were male, and 55.2% live in rural areas. Compared to controls, children and adolescents with poor visual acuity exhibited more time for the use of digital devices (4.51 +/- 2.44 vs. 3.79 +/- 2.34 for cases and controls, respectively; P < 0.001) and PA (3.07 +/- 0.92 vs. 2.85 +/- 1.00 for cases and controls, respectively; P < 0.001). During the COVID-19 pandemic, risk factors related to poor visual acuity among children and adolescents included the use of digital devices (OR 1.135; 95% CI 1.132-1.139), and PA (OR 1.269; 95%CI 1.259-1.278). The results of interaction analysis show that for children and adolescents aged 12 to 17, the positive association between the use of digital devices and poor visual acuity decreased. The interaction effect between PA and digital devices is 0.987. ConclusionsChildren and adolescents were at risk of poor visual acuity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Extended use of the digital devices increased the risk of poor visual acuity, especially for children aged 6-11 years. But the risk of poor visual acuity among children and adolescents decreases as the time spent on PA increases.

Compared to controls, children and adolescents with poor visual acuity exhibited more time for the use of digital devices (4.51 +/- 2.44 vs. 3.79 +/- 2.34 for cases and controls, respectively; P < 0.001) and PA (3.07 +/- 0.92 vs. 2.85 +/- 1.00 for cases and controls, respectively; P < 0.001). During the COVID-19 pandemic, risk factors related to poor visual acuity among children and adolescents included the use of digital devices (OR 1.135; 95% CI 1.132-1.139), and PA (OR 1.269; 95%CI 1.259-1.278). The results of interaction analysis show that for children and adolescents aged 12 to 17, the positive association between the use of digital devices and poor visual acuity decreased. The interaction effect between PA and digital devices is 0.987. Conclusion(s): Children and adolescents were at risk of poor visual acuity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Extended use of the digital devices increased the risk of poor visual acuity, especially for children aged 6-11 years. But the risk of poor visual acuity among children and adolescents decreases as the time spent on PA increases.Copyright © 2022 Zheng, Shi, Ou, Xue, Xu, Xue, Zhang, Liang, Huang, Qin and Zhang.

AB  - Objective: The aim of our case-control study was to find the influence of lifestyle and comorbidities on COVID-19 susceptibility, identify risk factors and protective factors, and identify ways to encourage people to adopt a healthy lifestyle. Methods: Patients with COVID-19 were matched with non-COVID-19 participants in a ratio of 1:2. Univariate analysis was performed using the chi-square test, and multivariate analysis was performed using conditional logistic regression. Results: Multivariate analysis using conditional logistic regression found that alcohol consumption (AC) and a bland diet increased the risk of COVID-19, while college degrees and above, smoking, drinking tea, and exercise, especially walking, significantly reduced the risk of COVID-19. Conclusion: After removing the effects of demographic factors, the study demonstrated that AC significantly reduced the ability of the body to resist COVID-19 infection. Moreover, following a bland diet increased the susceptibility to COVID-19. Notably, people who drank tea and performed regular exercises, especially walking, were significantly less likely to be infected with COVID-19. College degree or above relative illiteracy is COVID-19 protective factors of infection. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: The development of near infrared spectroscopy realizes the continuous, real time, rapid and non-traumatic detection of skeletal muscle oxygen content changes. Objective(s): To analyze change characteristics of muscle oxygen content during incremental exercises detected by near infrared spectroscopy and the relationship between it and the individual lactate threshold. Design, time and setting: Contrast observation was conducted in 2005 at the Experimental Center, Wuhan Institute of Physical Education College of Health Sciences. Participant(s): The trial group included 23 young male mid-long athletes from Wuhan Institute of Physical Education College of Health Sciences, and the control group included 23 male undergraduates from the same school without normal exercise training, the ages of the students in the two groups were similar [(21+/-2) (20+/-1) years, P =0.215]. Participants were informed and agreed to the trial. Method(s): Participants did incremental exercises on bicycle ergometer, load increased gradually until they exhausted. We detected the muscle oxygen content changes of participant light vastus lateralis with continuous-wave near infrared spectroscopy, at the same time, exhaled air was analyzed, remote monitoring of heart rate was done during the whole course, and finger peripheral blood lactate concentrations were measured at rest, immediately and 2, 5, 10 minutes after each grade of load exercise. We used the method labeled individual lactate threshold on the blood lactate curve to find participant individual lactate threshold. Main Outcome Measure(s): The muscle oxygen content changes of two groups during incremental exercises and the relationship between the changes and the individual lactate threshold. Result(s): During the incremental exercises, the muscle oxygen content changed slightly within certain exercise intensity range (control group 50-150W, trial group 50-200W); the muscle oxygen content changed obviously when the exercise intensity exceeded a certain value (control group 150 W, trial group 200 W). The mean decrease amplitude of muscle oxygen content of participants in the trial group was larger than that of participants in the control group (P < 0.05). The changes of muscle oxygen content sensitively reflected the changes of exercise intensity, and was negatively correlated with blood lactate concentration change curve (correlation coefficient r=-0.960, P < 0.01), when the turning point of sharp decrease abruptly appeared, the corresponding exercise intensity was basically consistent with individual lactate threshold. Conclusion(s): The changes of muscle oxygen content sensitively reflected the changes of exercise intensity, and when the turning point of sharp decrease abruptly appeared, the corresponding exercise intensity was significantly correlated with individual lactate threshold.

AB  - This study compares lifestyle behaviors and related factors between Asian American and white adults with self-reported prediabetes and identifies covariates/predictors for regular physical activity and adequate intake of fruits/vegetables. Using data from the United States of America Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 302 Asian Americans and 9558 white adults were analyzed. There were no significant differences for participating in regular physical activity or consumption of adequate fruits/vegetables between the two groups. Overall, 40% of the respondents engaged in regular physical activity, whereas less than 25% reported an adequate intake of fruits/vegetables. In the adjusted models, compared to white, Asian Americans were less likely to have impaired physical (OR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.36 0.80) or mental health (OR = 0.36, 95% CI: 0.21, 0.61), or cardiovascular diseases (OR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.41, 0.87). The covariates/predictors that relate to the behaviors differed between the groups. We conclude that interventions to increase physical activity and healthy eating for Asian American and white adults with prediabetes should address the different covariates/ predictors for each group.

AB  - Purposes: The purposes of this study were to assess differences in lifestyle behaviors and other health-related factors between black and white adults with pre-diabetes and to identify predictors for lifestyle behaviors. Methods: Using the 2007 and 2009 data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), an annual cross-sectional survey of randomly selected samples from each state, black (n = 1156) and white (n = 9539) adults with pre-diabetes were compared on lifestyle behaviors, general health practices, perceptions of health, chronic diseases, and access to care. Predictors for participating in regular physical activity and adequate intake of fruits and vegetables were identified for each racial and gender group using multiple regression procedures. Results: Less than 40% of the adults with pre-diabetes participated in regular physical activity, and less than a quarter had adequate intake of fruits and vegetables; only 20% met the body weight recommendations. Compared to whites, blacks were more likely to be overweight/obese (86% vs 79%) and less likely to engage in regular physical activity (29% vs 40%). Except for adequate intake of fruits and vegetables, each racial and gender group had different predictors for regular physical activity. For black males, the predictors included impaired physical health and coronary heart disease/stroke. For black females, the predictors were younger age and routine checkup. Conclusions: Significant disparities exist between blacks and whites in lifestyle behaviors and other health-related factors. Targeted intervention strategies are needed to motivate blacks to modify behaviors to prevent or delay the development of diabetes. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective. To determine the perceived neighborhood environment (NE) variables that are associated with physical activity (PA) in urban areas in China. Methods. Parents of students at two junior high schools in Shanghai, one downtown and the other in the suburbs, were recruited to participate in the study. They completed an International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and Neighborhood Environment Walkability Scale-Abbreviated (NEWS-A) survey. Participant physical activity was also objectively measured using accelerometers. Results. Participants from downtown areas were more positively associated with transportation PA and leisure-time PA than respondents living in the suburbs. Residential density was found to be a significant positive predictor of recreational or leisure-based PA. Street connectivity was negatively associated with leisure time PA for respondents. Moderate-vigorous PA was found to be negatively associated with traffic safety. There were no significant associations between environmental factors and transportation PA. Women had higher levels of moderate-vigorous PA than men. Conclusions. The results of this study demonstrate that residential density, street connectivity, and traffic safety have a significant impact on Chinese middle-aged adults' PA, suggesting urban planning strategies for promoting positive public health outcomes. © 2013 Rena Zhou et al.

AB  - CONTEXT: While road traffic mortality has been reported to be seriously undercounted by the police in China, non-police-reported data have not been explored previously to examine vulnerable road user mortality., OBJECTIVE: To examine changes in bicyclist mortality between 2006 and 2010 in China, using the Disease Surveillance Points (DSP) data of China., DESIGN, SETTING AND DATA SOURCE: Mortality data of 2006-2010 from DSP data, covering 73 million population, was analysed. Poisson regression was used to examine the significance of year after controlling for sex, age and urban/rural location., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Mortality rate and mortality rate ratio (MRR)., RESULTS: Between 2006 and 2010, the mortality rate for bicyclists increased from 1.1 to 1.6 per 100 000 population according to DSP data. Between 2006 and 2010, more than 90% of bicyclist deaths were undercounted by the police compared to the findings from DSP data. Contrary to the 34% increase between 2006 and 2010 reflected by DSP data (adjusted MRR: 1.34, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.46), police data revealed a 64% decrease in bicyclist mortality (unadjusted MRR: 0.36, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.40) in the study time period., CONCLUSIONS: Health data should be used to assess the road traffic injuries in China. The recent increase in bicyclist mortality merits attention from policy makers and researchers.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of the study was to examine the longitudinal influence of sedentary behavior on the development of metabolic syndrome (MS) and cardiometabolic risk in professional workers. Methods: Study participants were 203 professional workers (55.6% female; mean age = 41.9, SD = 11.2,) in low physical activity occupations. Participants’ height, weight, waist circumference, fasting plasma glucose, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein were measured at the baseline and follow-up over 12 months. Accelerometry was used to assess the sedentary time and moderate and vigorous physical activity. Results: High level of sedentary behavior at baseline significantly predicted incident MS (odds ratio 4.07, 95% confidence interval 1.69 to 9.76) at follow-up. Similarly, the change in sedentary behavior significantly predicted the change in the cardiometabolic risk score (B = 0.12, SE = 0.06, P = 0.03) from baseline to the follow-up. Conclusion: Professional workers in low physical activity occupations were engaged in an excessive amount of sedentary behavior that predisposed them to an increased risk of developing cardiometabolic disorders.

AB  - Research indicates that university student sportspeople are a high‐risk subgroup for hazardous alcohol consumption. Adopting a social identity perspective, we explored the social and psychological processes linking sports participation and alcohol use. Twenty‐two individual semi‐structured interviews were conducted with UK student sportspeople (male: 12; female: 10). A deductive thematic analysis identified three core themes: social identification and sports group membership, identity processes in (alcohol) behaviours and sport context‐specific significance of alcohol. Results suggest that the consumptive practices among student sportspeople were strategic activities underpinned by social identity processes, and which served to provide a positive sports experience at the group level. Our findings highlight the interactions between the sport environment, the social structure of sport participation and the multipurpose function of alcohol in this context. We discuss the implications of these results in support of a social identity approach to sport‐related drinking. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The adolescent brain is vulnerable to long-lasting cognitive disturbances resulting from nicotine exposure. Although exercise has been used as an intervention for ameliorating cognitive deficits in various disorders, the effect on cognitive changes induced by nicotine exposure and its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of exercise on nicotine reward-associated cognitive behaviors in adolescent rats subjected to nicotine conditioned place preference paradigm (CPP). Male adolescent rats were trained on the Go/NoGo task, then subjected to nicotine CPP, and then randomly separated into four groups: sedentary (SED), high- (HE), moderate- (ME), and low-intensity (LE) exercise. Rats in exercise groups performed treadmill running 30min daily for 10 days. Results showed that MEs had shorter escape latencies in the Morris water maze (MWM) test compared to SEDs. Although time spent and distance swam in the target quadrant significantly increased in both the MEs and HEs, the number of target quadrant crosses increased significantly only in MEs. MEs and HEs showed higher performance accuracy on NoGo and lower scores on CPP tasks. Expression of 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and downstream signaling molecules increased in MEs in prefrontal cortex but not hippocampus, with 7 nAChRs expression positively associated with NoGo accuracy and MWM probe test performance, but negatively correlated with CPP scores. The findings of this study suggest that moderate-intensity exercise can improve nicotine induced cognitive behaviors, and implicates prefrontal cortical 7 nAChR-mediated signal transduction as a possible mechanism.

AB  - Objectives: Female youth ice hockey players are an overlooked population. No national study has established incidence rates for injuries in female youth ice hockey. The objective of this study was to establish incidence rates by injury location, diagnosis, and mechanism of injury using USA Hockey sanctioned age divisions. Method(s): The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) was queried for all ice hockey injuries (product code 1279) from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2016. Cases involving players over the age of 19 and males were excluded. Each injury's narrative text field was reviewed to determine mechanism of injury. Data was analyzed using (IBM, v24). Comparisons of incidence by age were made using student's two sample t-test with 95% confidence interval. Trend analyses were performed using a linear regression. USA Hockey membership statistics were used to establish population at risk and calculate incidence rates. All incidence rates were reported per 10,000 person-years. Result(s): A total of 384 patients, representing an estimated 10,398 ice hockey-related injuries, presented to NEISSparticipating United States emergency departments. During the study period, female youth ice hockey players increased significantly from 44,678 in 2007 to 57,792 in 2016 (p=3.9x10-5, R-squared=0.89, beta =0.94). The overall number of injuries, however, only slightly increased from 992 in 2007 to 1,042 in 2016 (p=ns). Thus, the incidence rate (IR) of injuries fell from 222.1 to 180.2 during the study period. The most commonly injured body parts were the head (n=3048, IR=554.5), trunk (n=1399, IR=256.4), knee (n=1127, IR=169), shoulder (n=704, IR=153.3) and ankle (n=591, IR=120.2). The most common diagnoses were strain/sprain (n=2002, IR=417.7), contusion (n=1877, IR= 348), internal organ injury (n=1863, IR=320), concussion (n=1112, IR=218) and fracture (n=1255, IR=202). The top mechanisms of injury were player-to-player contact (n= 3016, IR=535), falls (n=2249, IR=380.9), and contact with boards (n=942, IR=165.8). The incidence rate of injuries increased with age; The 0-8, 9-10, 11-12, 13-14, 15-16 and 17-19 age divisions had IR's of 24, 84, 226, 381, 360, and 750, respectively. The player-to-player mechanism of injury also increased with age. The largest IR gap between ages fell between the 11-12 and 13-14 age groups, similar to what has been observed in male ice hockey studies. Player-to-player contact is the leading mechanism of injury in all age groups except the 0-8 age group. Head injuries increased with age division: 0-8 (n=15, IR=1), 9-10 (n=153, IR=17.4), 11-12 (n=598, IR=67.2), 13-14 (n=885, IR=115.1), 15-16 (n=650, IR=121.6) and 17-19 (n=746, IR=232.2). The two most common diagnoses of head injuries were concussion (36%) and internal organ injury (61%), both of these diagnoses increasing with age. In fact, concussion diagnosis increased significantly between each age group (p<0.01). Conclusion(s): We established the first collection of injury incidence rates for female ice hockey gleaned from a national database. Though body checking is illegal at all levels of women's ice hockey, player-to-player contact prevailed as the leading mechanism of injury in all but the 0-8 age division. It was also the leading mechanism for the most common injury sites, including the head. This study laid bare an unspoken but long understood fact of the girl's game that body checking is common and major contributor to the game's injury burden.

AB  - Purpose: Drug addiction is characterised by overvaluation of drug-related rewards and undervaluation of 'natural', non-drug-related rewards. Methamphetamine (MA) is the second largest illegally abused drug in the world. Studies have shown that acute aerobic exercise can reduce the incidence of MA-dependent individuals' craving for drug-related cues, but the impact of exercise on food reward in this population has yet to be established. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of moderate and high-intensity acute aerobic exercise on food reward and subjective feelings of appetite in MA-dependent populations. Methods: Forty-four men, who met the DSM-V criteria for MA dependence, with BMI of 24.7 ± 3.1 kg/m² and age of 31.9 ± 3.8 years, were randomly assigned to two exercise training groups: moderate- (n = 22; 65%~75% HRmax) or high- (n = 22; ≥ 85% HRmax) intensity. Each group performed a resting control or exercise session for 35 min, 1wk apart, in a counterbalanced order. Food reward (explicit liking, implicit wanting and relative preference) for high or low fat and sweet or savoury food images was assessed by the Leeds Food Preference Questionnaire and subjective feelings of appetite were measured by VAS. Results: Greater relative preference (high: P = .018; moderate: P = .034) and implicit wanting (high: P = .018; moderate: P = .034) for high-fat savoury foods was noted following acute aerobic exercise compared to the control session. Exercise also increased subjective sensations of hunger (F (1,42) =8.28, P = .006). Conclusions: The current study provides the first evidence that acute aerobic exercise can increase reward for high fat savoury foods and stimulate appetite in MA-dependent individuals. In the context of exercise as a therapeutic option for MA dependence, these changes suggest an improvement in responsiveness to natural, non-drug rewards.

AB  - The aim of this study was to gain insight into the sleep quality of college students and related factors from a new perspective by using Latent Class Analysis (LCA). A total of 1,288 college students from four universities in Wuhu city participated in the study. LCA was used to identify the classes of sleep behaviors. Differences in class membership related to selected research factors were examined using multinomial logistic regression analysis. Four distinct classes of behaviors were identified: (1) good sleep (Class 1, 31.8%), (2) prolonged sleep latency (Class 2, 49.1%), (3) sleep disturbances and daytime dysfunction (Class 3, 6.8%), (4) multiple poor sleep behavior (Class 4, 12.3%). The latent classes of sleep behavior were correlated with the DBAS-16 total score (rs = −0.109, P < 0.001). Learning pressure and mental state during the day could affect overall sleep (Class 2, Class 3 and Class 4), and female students were at higher risk of severe sleep problems (Class 3 and Class 4), while bedtime exercised could improve mild sleep problems (Class 2). The sleep behavior of college students in Wuhu city has obvious class heterogeneity, and different influencing factors may affect sleep to varying degrees. In addition, our research provides a basis for targeted intervnetion in college student’s sleep. . (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is a major public health emergency. However, little is known about the psychological impact of this pandemic on adolescents. We aim to assess the prevalence and influencing factors of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic growth (PTG) among adolescents in a large sample study.Methods: This cross-sectional study collected demographic data and mental health measurements from 175,416 adolescents covering 31 provinces, centrally administered municipalities, and autonomous regions in mainland China from February 23 to March 8, 2020. The status of depression, anxiety, and PTG was assessed by the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire, seven-item generalized anxiety disorder questionnaire, and post-traumatic growth inventory.Results: The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and PTG in adolescents was 35.9, 28.0, and 45.6%, respectively. The prevalence of depression and anxiety in the slight or severe epidemic areas was similar. Regression analysis showed that female sex and older age were associated with higher levels of depression, anxiety, and lower levels of PTG. Symptoms related to COVID-19, excessive attention to epidemic information, living in urban or severe epidemic areas, and conflicts with parents during home quarantine were risk factors for depression, anxiety, and PTG. Frequent communication with peers, exercise, and receiving public welfare psychological assistance were protective factors. Poor family economic status was a significant risk factor for depression and PTG.Conclusion: Our findings suggested that positive and negative psychological reactions coexist in adolescents faced with the pandemic. The factors associated with psychological problems and PTG provide strategic guidance for maintaining adolescents' mental health in China and worldwide during any pandemic such as COVID-19.

AB  - Background: To identify distinct trajectories of body mass index (BMI) in a large sample of Chinese children by urban-rural and sex disparities. Methods: Data for this study were obtained from the National Surveys on Chinese Students' Constitution and Health among 16,060 children aged 6-11 years. Weight and height data were used to calculate BMI. Group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) was used to identify distinct BMI trajectories. Results: Seven distinct trajectories were identified, "sustained healthy weight " (46.01%), "sustained obesity " (17.26%), "sustained underweight " (4.50%), "obesity to overweight " (6.45%), "obesity to healthy weight " (11.75%), "healthy weight to overweight " (8.67%), and "healthy weight to obesity " (5.36%). The proportions of "sustained obesity, " "healthy weight to obesity, " and "healthy weight to overweight " trajectories were much higher among boys compared with girls (P < 0.001). Meanwhile, children living in rural areas were more represented in the "healthy weight to obesity " trajectory (P < 0.001). Conclusion: In this study, the proportions of BMI development trajectories among 6-11-year-old children varied by sex and urban-rural areas, which may require tailored interventions specifically toward these at-risk trajectories.

Result(s): The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and PTG in adolescents was 35.9, 28.0, and 45.6%, respectively. The prevalence of depression and anxiety in the slight or severe epidemic areas was similar. Regression analysis showed that female sex and older age were associated with higher levels of depression, anxiety, and lower levels of PTG. Symptoms related to COVID-19, excessive attention to epidemic information, living in urban or severe epidemic areas, and conflicts with parents during home quarantine were risk factors for depression, anxiety, and PTG. Frequent communication with peers, exercise, and receiving public welfare psychological assistance were protective factors. Poor family economic status was a significant risk factor for depression and PTG. Conclusion(s): Our findings suggested that positive and negative psychological reactions coexist in adolescents faced with the pandemic. The factors associated with psychological problems and PTG provide strategic guidance for maintaining adolescents' mental health in China and worldwide during any pandemic such as COVID-19.Copyright © 2021 Zhou, Wang, Bu, Zhang, Chu, Li, He, Zhang, Liu, Qiao, Yang and Yang.

AB  - This study aims to explore the entrepreneurial psychology of physical Education (PE) students under the 'Internet+'environment, to cultivate and improve the entrepreneurial consciousness of PE students, taking the realization of students’ sense of self-efficacy as an intermediary factor. The new educational technology in modern PE is analyzed first. Specifically, the motion sensing technology based on human-computer natural interaction can be used for training, so that learners can effectively improve their physical skills. Subsequently, the current entrepreneurial situation of PE majors is discussed, with 188 students from Tianjin University of Sport and Guangzhou Sport University selected as research subjects. It is found that 62.2% of students have never been exposed to online entrepreneurship, and they are more afraid of entrepreneurial risks. In terms of entrepreneurial motivation, most students choose to start a business because of 'personal ideals,' and only 40 people choose to start a business because of economic factors. There is a significant positive correlation between entrepreneurial self-efficacy and entrepreneurial intention of college students majoring in PE, and the correlation coefficient is 0.488. At present, the teaching mode of sports universities focuses on the teaching of professional courses. However, students generally believe that the professional knowledge learned is not useful for future entrepreneurship. The entrepreneurial self-efficacy of college students tends to be positive, and there are notable differences in the entrepreneurial self-efficacy between boys and girls. The regression analysis of entrepreneurial self-efficacy and entrepreneurial intention of college students shows that entrepreneurial self-efficacy can effectively predict entrepreneurial intention. This research promotes the innovation and development of the sports industry under the background of 'Internet+'. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Although children and adolescents with hearing impairment are at risks of falls from balance problems, reliable information on effects of interventions are scare. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to systematically summarize studies on the evidence of interventions to improve balance ability in children and adolescents with hearing impairment. A systematic literature search was conducted on five major electronic databases. Studies were included if: 1) interventions or trials focusing on improving balance in children and adolescents with hearing impairment; 2) research targeting children with hearing impairment (samples with a mean age below 18 years); 3) studies were published in English peer-reviewed journals due to language barriers and resource limitations; and 4) study designs were randomized controlled trial or quasi-experiment. A nine-item tool adapted from the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials Statement was used to assess the quality of the studies. Through the search strategy, 373 articles were identified, and 15 studies published between 1981 and 2021 met the inclusion criteria. Most of the studies reviewed were categorized as medium or low quality, and only three were identified as high quality. Exercise interventions were adopted in 80% of the included studies, whereas studies that employed music + vibration, motor, and game as the intervention modalities accounted for the remaining 20.0%. The results of this review showed that the included trials with exercise interventions had a positive influence on the balance among children and adolescents with hearing impairment (the post-intervention scores were significantly higher than the pre-intervention or the control group scores). In addition, the interventions with duration of 8-16 weeks were more effective than those with less than 8 weeks. However, due to most of the reviewed studies were of low methodological quality, the trials results analyzed by this systematic review should be interpreted with caution. Further investigations of high-quality studies are therefore needed to prove the effectiveness of interventions on improving balance performance in children and adolescents with hearing impairment.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Common symptoms for patients with narcolepsy can have a significant impact on social health. As one peak for symptom onset is adolescence, these symptoms impact social relationships during a critical developmental period. Much of the existing literature in this domain has relied on broad questionnaires, with less insight into the nuances of patients' potential social struggles. METHOD(S): Adolescents (aged 12-17 years) with narcolepsy and their parents individually completed a semistructured interview (n = 14 dyads). Interview transcripts were analyzed using a multistage thematic analysis. RESULT(S): An overarching theme was the difficulty adolescents experienced trying to balance narcolepsy symptom management with engaging in social activities in a meaningful way. Narcolepsy affected social relationships in 3 primary domains: mood, physical activities, and driving. Adolescents reported that they were frustrated with feeling as though narcolepsy sometimes defined their social lives. Adolescents and parents expressed a desire for medical providers to better understand their evolving priorities, to validate their social limitations, and to provide more information around the social implications of narcolepsy and its treatment. CONCLUSION(S): Narcolepsy has a significant impact on social relationships in adolescents, one that is not adequately managed in current clinical care models. A routine, structured assessment of social health is a vital first step for providers treating adolescents with narcolepsy. Medical centers and patient organizations can play an important role in facilitating social opportunities for this underserved population.

AB  - Background: Children's physical inactivity and obesity are growing public health problems in the U.S., especially among low-income, minority populations. Walking to school may help address these problems. Methods: This cross-sectional study examined disparities in the environmental support for walking around 73 public elementary schools in Austin TX. GIS was used to measure the neighborhood-level walkability and safety. Field audits were conducted to assess the street-level walkability. Analyses of variance and regressions were performed to analyze economic and ethnic disparities. Results: For the top-quartile schools with higher poverty or Hispanic student percentages, the surroundings showed higher neighborhood-level walkability with shorter distances to school and more sidewalks compared with the bottom quartile. These areas, however, also had higher crash and crime rates and lower street-level walkability captured by visual quality, physical amenities, maintenance, and perceived safety. In predictions of environmental conditions using poverty and Hispanic student percentages, poverty was associated with many adverse conditions on the street level and with only two favorable situations, shorter distances to school and lower traffic volumes, on the neighborhood level. The Hispanic student percentage did not correlate with most street-level variables, but predicted both increased dangers from traffic and crime and higher neighborhood-level walkability with more sidewalks, greater density, and mixed land uses. Conclusions: Economic and ethnic disparities exist in the environmental support for walking, suggesting the need for tailored interventions in promoting active living. Low-income, Hispanic children are more likely to live in unsafe areas with poor street environments but with some favorable neighborhood-level conditions.

AB  - Objective: To explore the characteristics of behavioral problems and self-concept level in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) accompanying anxiety disorder. Methods: With stratified random sampling method, a sampling survey was made in 9495 children (aged 5-17 years) from 6 regions of Hunan province together. Using the two stage epidemiologic research method, three groups, including control group (214 cases), pure ADHD (219 cases) and ADHD accompanying anxiety disorder (111 cases) were determined as the subjects. All the subjects completed the Children's Self-Concept Scale (CSCS), and the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) was completed by their parents. Results: (1) Compared to the control group, the pure ADHD group scored higher in CBCL [e.g., the total score; (30.35 ± 24.32) vs. (16.97 ± 14.86)], and scored lower in CSCS [e.g., total score; (50.85 ± 9.98) vs. (57.46 ± 10.80), P < 0.05]. (2) Compared to the control group, children with ADHD accompanying anxiety disorder scored higher in CBCL [e.g., total score; (41.66 ± 28.07), P < 0.01], and in CSCS except physical activities (Ps < 0.05). (3) Compared to the pure ADHD group, ADHD accompanying anxiety disorder group scored higher in CBCL and lower in CSCS [behavior; (10.44 ± 3.17) vs. (11.55 ± 2.80); anxiety; (8.06 ± 2.61) vs. (9.21 ± 2.61), gregariousness; (7.42 ± 2.22) vs. (8.16 ± 1.89); total score; (47.25 ± 9.93) vs. (50.85 ± 9.98); Ps < 0.05] .Conclusion: ADHD children have more behavioral problems and lower level of self-concept than normal children, and children with ADHD accompanying anxiety disorder have more prominent presence of behavioral problems and lower self-concept rating than children with pure ADHD.

AB  - Using three waves of data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health (Add Health) multiple regression and binary logistic regression analyses were conducted on adolescent girls, ages 12 to 18 years old, to examine weight change over time. The focus was on the effects of their female friends at school at Wave 1 on short and long-term weight change and the likelihood of being overweight or obese at Wave 2 and Wave 3 respectively. Weight, weight perception, and weight-related behaviors of friendship groups, as well as a girls relative weight position among her friends, were hypothesized to significantly influence a girl's weight outcome. Hypotheses based on reference group and early socialization theoretical frameworks were supported by the findings of this dissertation. The results indicated that being the lightest among friends at school increased the chance of weight gain over time. In addition, both body weight and body weight perception of school friends significantly influenced adolescent girls' weight over time and these effects remained significant into young adulthood; however, the proportion of school friends who were trying to lose weight was not found to significantly affect adolescent girls' weight over time. Other factors such as individual physical exercise, sedentary activities (TV watching), weight management, parental obesity status, parental education, family/household income and residential mobility mediated the effects of school friends on individual weight change but school friends still significantly and independently impacted young female's weight change. In addition, when it came to the likelihood of obesity, mean body mass index of friends seemed to have stronger effects on girl's weight than mean body weight perception.

AB  - Purpose: Unhealthy habits and risk behaviors like smoking, teenage pregnancy, drug and alcohol use in youth are associated with serious health problems such as psychological disorders, cardiac and respiratory diseases, cancer, complicated pregnancies and deliveries in later life. GAPS or the Guidelines for Adolescent Preventive Services, developed by the American Medical Association, is a validated and standardized screening tool for healthcare providers to assess adolescents for health risk behaviors. Research shows that anxiety and depression are common among teens in Hong Kong. In a recent study, university students in Hong Kong reported problems in the last five years with school issues (18.6%), depression (17.1%), body image (16.8%), and internet overuse (11.3%). However, their providers only infrequently asked or provided counseling about these issues during clinical encounters. The purpose of this study was to validate a Chinese version of the Guidelines for Adolescent Preventive Services (GAPS) questionnaire, to use it to examine the general health risk behaviors among undergraduate students at a public university in Hong Kong, and to assess for depressive symptoms and associated factors. Method(s): A valid translation process including forward translation, back translation and pretesting was performed to obtain the final Chinese version of the GAPS questionnaire. A cross-sectional study was then conducted using a convenience sample (n = 400) of undergraduate students presenting to the university health service center. The anonymous self-administered Chinese version of the GAPS questionnairewas given to students waiting for medical care. Data analysis was performed using descriptive statistics, correlation test and stepwise logistic regression in SPSS. Result(s): Of the 400 students who completed the questionnaires, 109 (27.3%) were males and 291 (72.8%) were females. Overall, participants reported a number of health risk behaviors including inadequate physical activity (73.2%), disordered eating (50.6%), and depressive symptoms (29.3%). In addition, respondents reported getting drunk in the past month (28.3%), engaging in sexually activity (13.3%), and having suicide attempts (7.3%). Using self-reported depressive symptoms as the outcome, multivariable regression results indicated that history of sexual or physical abuse (OR = 3.66), lack of parental support (OR = 2.86), ever been told that they have a learning problem (OR = 2.62), and body image disturbance (OR = 1.87) were strongly related to self-reported depressive symptoms among students. Conclusion(s): The GAPS (Guidelines for Adolescent Preventive Services) is a useful tool for healthcare providers to assess adolescent health risk behaviors. The main self-reported risks in this study were inadequate physical activity, disordered eating and depression. Further interventions at the university setting could include using GAPS for routine student health visits and providing targeted counseling for issues such as depression. Since the questionnaire has been validated in Chinese and shown to be feasible in clinical settings, it could be used in the future to help health professionals to identify specific risk behaviors and improve the quality of care for adolescents in Hong Kong and China.

AB  - Objective: To investigate whether greater cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is associated with better cognitive function 25 years later. Methods: We studied 2,747 participants in the community-based Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study of black and white men and women aged 18 to 30 years at recruitment in 1985–1986 (baseline year 0). Symptom-limited maximal treadmill test durations at years 0 and 20 provided measures of CRF. Cognitive tests at year 25 measured verbal memory (Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test [RAVLT]), psychomotor speed (Digit Symbol Substitution Test [DSST]), and executive function (Stroop Test). Results: Per minute of baseline CRF, the RAVLT was 0.12 words recalled higher (standard error [SE] = 0.03, p < 0.0001), the DSST was 0.92 digits higher (SE = 0.13, p < 0.0001), and the Stroop Test score was 0.52 lower (better performance, SE = 0.11, p < 0.0001), after accounting for race, sex, age, education, and clinical center. Compared with the lowest quartile of CRF, each cognitive test was 21%to 34%of an SD better in the highest CRF quartile. Further adjustment for lifestyle and clinical measures attenuated coefficients for RAVLT and DSST slightly, while the coefficient predicting the Stroop Test lost more than half its value (p = 0.07). Analysis in the subset of 1,957 participants who also completed the year-20 treadmill test showed that 20-year change in CRF was positively associated only with DSST (p < 0.001).

AB  - Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is a well known important predictor of cardiovascular disease and overall mortality. CRF is of interest as a factor that could be intervened upon to promote health given it can be modified mainly through exercise. However, whether CRF is associated with cognitive function, brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) findings, and overall Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in middle-aged adults is unknown. The first manuscript tested the hypothesis that greater CRF was associated with better cognitive function 25 years later using data from the community-based Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study of black and white men and women aged 18-30 at recruitment in 1985-86 (year 0). Per minute of maximal treadmill duration (Maxdur) of a symptom-limited treadmill test , the Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test (measuring verbal memory) was 0.12 words recalled higher (P<0.0001), the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (measuring psychomotor speed) was 0.92 digits higher (P<0.0001), and the Stroop Test score (measuring executive function) was 0.52 lower (better performance, P<0.0001). So, better cognitive function at ages 43-55 years was clearly associated with better CRF 25 years earlier. The second manuscript evaluated the hypothesis that greater CRF is associated with lower odds of having unfavorable brain MRI findings. In the CARDIA study, the odds ratio (OR) for having less whole brain volume was 0.82 per minute higher Maxdur (P=0.002) and for having low white matter integrity was 0.85 (P=0.03). No significant associations were observed between Max dur and normal and abnormal white matter tissue volume. Therefore, greater CRF was associated with less brain atrophy and greater white matter integrity measured 5 years later. The third manuscript examined the hypothesis that CRF is associated with mental and physical HRQOL and individual questions contributing to the HRQOL scores. In the CARDIA study, Maxdur was inversely associated with low HRQOL at year 25 with the OR for having low Mental Component Summary score (<1SD below the average in the general U.S. population) of 0.88 per minute higher of Maxdur (P<0.0001) and the OR for having low Physical Component Summary score of 0.69 (P<0.0001). High Maxdur was related to each but one individual question contributing to the HRQOL. The projects in this dissertation support the hypothesis that CRF is associated with cognitive function, brain atrophy, white matter integrity and HRQOL, which make it possible to better identify individuals at risk for these conditions at young to middle adulthood and further suggest ways to prevent deterioration of cognition, brain structure and function, and HRQOL later in life. The findings in this project contribute evidence to the impact of CRF on brain aging and overall health in middle aged adults. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Current diagnosis and monitoring of sports-related concussion rely on clinical signs and symptoms, and balance, vestibular, and neuropsychological examinations. Conventional brain imaging often does not reveal abnormalities. We sought to assess if the longitudinal change of functional and structural connectivity of the default-mode network (DMN) can serve as a potential biomarker. Eight concussed Division I collegiate football student-athletes in season (one participated twice) and 11 control subjects participated in this study. ImPACT (Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing) was administered over the course of recovery. High-resolution three dimensional T-1-weighted, T-2*-weighted diffusion-tensor images and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) scans were collected from each subject within 24 h, 7 +/- 1 d and 30 +/- 1 d after concussion. Both network based and whole-brain based functional correlation analyses on DMN were performed. ImPACT findings demonstrated significant cognitive impairment across multiple categories and a significant increase of symptom severity on Day 1 following a concussion but full recovery by 6.0 +/- 2.4 d. While the structural connectivity within DMN and gross anatomy appeared unchanged, a significantly reduced functional connectivity within DMN from Day 1 to Day 7 was found in the concussed group in this small pilot study. This reduction was seen in eight of our nine concussion cases. Compared with the control group, there appears a general trend of increased DMN functional connectivity on Day 1, a significant drop on Day 7, and partial recovery on Day 30. The results of this pilot study suggest that the functional connectivity of DMN measured with longitudinal rs-fMRI can serve as a potential biomarker to monitor the dynamically changing brain function after sports-related concussion, even in patients who have shown clinical improvement.

AB  - AIM: To explore associations between the number of natural teeth and metabolic syndrome in adults., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cross-sectional data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005-2008 were used. Eligible adults (n = 5511) were classified into four groups by their number of natural teeth (excluding third molars): full dentition, 21-27 teeth, 1-20 teeth, or edentulous. Metabolic syndrome was defined by diagnostic guidelines from the American Heart Association and National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Associations were analysed by survey logistic regression. Biometric and metabolic parameters in different dentition groups were compared., RESULTS: Adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, ratio of family income to poverty, physical activity, smoking, and energy intake, tooth loss was significantly associated with metabolic syndrome (p = 0.002). Compared to participants with full dentition, the odds were 32% higher in those with 21-27 teeth, 55% higher in those with 1-20 teeth and 79% higher in edentulous participants. The number of natural teeth was inversely associated with body mass index, waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose and insulin concentrations (p < 0.01 for all); it was positively associated with serum HDL cholesterol concentration (p = 0.003)., CONCLUSIONS: The number of natural teeth is inversely associated with the presence of metabolic syndrome in adults.Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB  - Objective: We hypothesized that greater cardiorespiratory fitness is associated with lower odds of having unfavorable brain MRI findings. Methods: We studied 565 healthy, middle-aged, black and white men and women in the CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) Study. The fitness measure was symptomlimited maximal treadmill test duration (Maxdur); brain MRI was measured 5 years later. Brain MRI measures were analyzed as means and as proportions below the 15th percentile (above the 85th percentile for white matter abnormal tissue volume). Results: Per 1-minute-higher Maxdur, the odds ratio for having less whole brain volume was 0.85 (p 5 0.04) and for having low white matter integrity was 0.80 (p = 0.02), adjusted for age, race, sex, clinic, body mass index, smoking, alcohol, diet, physical activity, education, blood pressure, diabetes, total cholesterol, and lung function (plus intracranial volume for white matter integrity). No significant associations were observed between Maxdur and abnormal tissue volume or blood flow in white matter. Findings were similar for associations with continuous brain MRI measures. Conclusions: Greater physical fitness was associated with more brain volume and greater white matter integrity measured 5 years later in middle-aged adults.

AB  - Background: A much higher prevalence of alexithymia has been reported in medical students compared with the general population, and alexithymia is a risk factor that increases vulnerability to mental disorders. Our aim was to evaluate the level of alexithymia in Chinese medical students and to explore its influencing factors. Methods: A cross-sectional study of 1,950 medical students at Shenyang Medical College was conducted in May 2014 to evaluate alexithymia in medical students using the Chinese version of the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20). The reliability of the questionnaire was assessed by Cronbach's a coefficient and mean inter-item correlations. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to evaluate construct validity. The relationships between alexithymia and influencing factors were examined using Student's t-test, analysis of variance, and multiple linear regression analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 21.0. Results: Of the 1,950 medical students, 1,886 (96.7%) completed questionnaires. Overall, Cronbach's a coefficient of the TAS-20 questionnaire was 0.868. The results of CFA showed that the original three-factor structure produced an acceptable fit to the data. By univariate analysis, gender, grade (academic year of study), smoking behavior, alcohol use, physical activity, history of living with parents during childhood, and childhood trauma were influencing factors of TAS-20 scores (p < 0.05). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that gender, physical activity, grade, living with parents, and childhood trauma also had statistically significant association with total TAS-20 score (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Gender, physical activity, grade, history of living with parents during childhood, and childhood trauma were all factors determining the level of alexithymia. To prevent alexithymia, it will be advisable to promote adequate physical activity and pay greater attention to male medical students and those who are in the final year of training.

AB  - The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on physical and mental health-related behaviors among children and adolescents are likely to be profound and long-lasting. This study aimed to investigate the changes in lifestyle and social support and their associations with negative impacts due to the pandemic. A classroom survey using stratified random sampling and structured questionnaire was conducted among Hong Kong primary and secondary school students. The paper-and-pen survey, administered by well-trained research assistants, was completed by 2863 participants aged 9-17 years old (M = 12.6, SD = 1.3) at a brief school reopening six months after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. About 48% and 37% of the participants stated that they paid increased attention to physical and mental health, respectively. About 20% to 40% stated that they found more support from their friends and family members; only a small percentage reported decreased social support. Around 25% to 50% spent more time to rest, relax, and exercise. The aforementioned changes varied among genders, education groups, and socio-economic status. In general, higher perceived vulnerability, feeling more stressed, apprehensive, and helpless were associated with more reported positive lifestyle changes, including more social/family support, increased mental health awareness, and a positive lifestyle. These positive changes serve as important cushions against the negative impacts of COVID-19.

AB  - In order to understand the mental health status of contemporary college students, the research team of "College Students' psychological quality training" conducted mental health examination on nearly 6000 Chinese college students from 23 colleges and universities across the country. The results showed that about 16.51% of Chinese college graduates had serious mental health problems. The results of several recent studies on the mental health status of college graduates across the country show that the accuracy rate of mental behavior examination among college graduates across the country is about 16%, and the rate of people with unsound psychology or in a state of mental sub-health is higher, and there has been a psychological poverty group among college students. A large number of educational facts and scientific research have confirmed that sports are one of the most effective ways to promote students' physical and mental development, and it can be said that there is a very close relationship between college sports and the physical and mental health of college graduates. In order to promote the organic combination of college mental health education and college physical education, the research results will be based on in-depth investigation and understanding of the current situation of college students' psychological development under the new situation, and a systematic study of the relationship between college graduates' physical, sports, mental health knowledge, and psychological level. This paper establishes a theoretical model for the organic combination of mental health education and physical education in colleges and universities, and provides specific countermeasures for integrating psychological teaching into college physical education courses, providing a theoretical basis and reference for developing college physical education courses and improving psychological teaching.

AB  - In order to understand the mental health status of contemporary college students, the research team of "College Students' psychological quality training" conducted mental health examination on nearly 6000 Chinese college students from 23 colleges and universities across the country. The results showed that about 16.51% of Chinese college graduates had serious mental health problems. The results of several recent studies on the mental health status of college graduates across the country show that the accuracy rate of mental behavior examination among college graduates across the country is about 16%, and the rate of people with unsound psychology or in a state of mental sub-health is higher, and there has been a psychological poverty group among college students. A large number of educational facts and scientific research have confirmed that sports are one of the most effective ways to promote students' physical and mental development, and it can be said that there is a very close relationship between college sports and the physical and mental health of college graduates. In order to promote the organic combination of college mental health education and college physical education, the research results will be based on in-depth investigation and understanding of the current situation of college students' psychological development under the new situation, and a systematic study of the relationship between college graduates' physical, sports, mental health knowledge, and psychological level. This paper establishes a theoretical model for the organic combination of mental health education and physical education in colleges and universities, and provides specific countermeasures for integrating psychological teaching into college physical education courses, providing a theoretical basis and reference for developing college physical education courses and improving psychological teaching.Copyright © 2022 Wei Zhu and Jinhong Li.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the effects of long-term home quarantine on the mental health of people during the COVID-19 epidemic in Shanghai. We conducted an online questionnaire survey on March 26 2020 and collected data on demographics, level of physical activity (PA), and mental health status of the participants. We assessed the mental health status using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), whereas PA was assessed using International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form (IPAQ-SF). Of all 2,409 valid samples, participants reported performing a total of 2015.20 metabolic equivalent of task (MET)-minutes/week of total PA before the outbreak period and 1720.29 MET-minutes/week of total PA during the outbreak period (p < 0.001). Participants who spent a longer time at home reported to have a better performance on the PHQ-9 (p = 0.087) and GAD-7 (p < 0.001). A high level of PA was considered an protective factor against depression (OR = 0.755, 95% CI 0.603–0.944, p < 0.001). Additionally, a high level of PA had a preventative effect on anxiety (OR = 0.741, 95% CI 0.568–0.967, p < 0.001), and a longer working period during the outbreak was shown to be a risk factor for anxiety (11–29 days, OR 1.455, 95% CI 1.110–1.909; 30–60 days OR 1.619, 95% CI 1.227–2.316). Home confinement during the pandemic might not have a negative effect on mental health provided that people engage in more PA indoors. This study encourages interventions for mental health problems through physical exercise. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In 2018, a consortium of government bodies in China led by the Ministry of Education released the Comprehensive Plan to Prevent Nearsightedness among Children and Teenagers (CPPNCT), aiming to reduce the incidence of myopia and control myopic progression in China. Recommendations span from home-based to school-based interventions, including time outdoors, physical activity, light exposure, near-work activity, screen time, Chinese eye exercises, diet and sleep. To date, the levels of evidence for this suite of interventions have not been thoroughly investigated. This review has summarised the evidence of the interventions recommended by the CPPNCT in myopia prevention and control. Thus, the following statements are supposed by the evidence: (1) Increasing time outdoors and reducing near-work time are effective in lowering incident myopia in school-aged children. (2) All interventions have a limited effect on myopia progression. Ongoing research may lead to a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of myopia development, the interaction of different interventions and recommendations, confounding variables and their true effect on myopia prevention, and the identification of those most likely to respond to specific interventions. This field may also benefit from longer-term studies of the various interventions or strategies covered within this review article, to better understand the persistence of treatment effects over time and explore more novel approaches to myopia control.

AB  - The results of a statistical study of 3881 cases of sports injuries are summarized in the paper. Among all types of traumatism, the sports injuries average 2,6% or 2,0 per 1000 population. A frank tendency of increase of the application index for sports injuries up to the adolescent age, and its sharp decrease in adults was found. The maximum intensive index of sports traumatism was observed in juveniles - 12,9 per 1000 of 15-17-year old boys. The highest percentage (44,4%) of sports injuries is connected with fall of the injured. The second place (24,9%) belongs to injuries obtained as the result of counter-blow, in 'rigid' play or rudeness of the sports rival. In the third place (14,8%) are traumas caused by overstress in harsh motions, and in the fourth - wounds by cutting or thrust objects (10,1%). An enumeration of the basic functions of medical workers in the control of sports traumatism is presented.

AB  - Background: Low Back Pain (LBP) is a major public health problem and is classified by the Global Burden of Disease Study among the ten diseases most responsible for Disability-Adjusted Life Years worldwide. All ages may be affected, mostly young adults, with a prevalence going up to 50%. Medical students may be particularly vulnerable due to sedentary lifestyle and high stress levels. Objective(s): The primary objective is to evaluate the prevalence of LBP in Lebanese medical students. The secondary objective is to identify predictive factors associated with LBP and to identify prevalence and components of inflammatory back pain (IBP). Method(s): PAX-I is a cross-sectional study, completed at the St-Joseph University of Beirut from April to June 2016. All students from the first to the sixth year of medicine were invited to fill a questionnaire about their demographic data, lifestyle habits, Patient Health Questionnaire for Depression and Anxiety (PHQ4) and LBP characteristics, including components of IBP as per ASAS criteria. Student test and ANOVA were used for quantitative variables, chi-square test was used for qualitative variables and logistic regression was used for predictive factors for low back pain. Analysis were performed on IBM SPSS Statistics 23. Result(s): Response rate was 51.3% (258/502). Mean age was 20.86 years (SD 1.92). 54.3% were female, 76.7% drank caffeine, 66.3% had a regular sports activity and 9.7% were smokers. 38% had the habit of walking while studying. All habits were similar across years of studying except for sports activities which decreased over the years (p 0.018). 80% were satisfied with their studies. Only 46% were satisfied with their quality of sleep. Mean PHQ4 score was 7.17 and increased with the years of studies (p 0.045). 55.8% of students reported a LBP event during the past year, with a mean number of 3.6 episodes per year. 91% of these students had LBP while studying, with high reported intensity (5.18/10), 62.5% reported LBP after exercise. 80% had episodes of less than one month and 7% of more than three months duration. 12% had IBP according to the ASAS criteria (Details of IBP in Figure 1). Predictive factors for LBP in univariate analysis were: smoking (p 0.040), alcohol consumption (p 0.005), caffeine consumption (p 0.041), television watching (p 0.042) -positive association-, and number of hours of sleep (p 0.011) and satisfaction with sleep quality-negative association- (p 0.017). Satisfaction with sleep quality remained the only significant association in multivariate analysis (p 0.014). Conclusion(s): LBP is a frequent problem among medical students with high intensity, especially when studying, and a high recurrence rate. The main predictive factor was poor satisfaction with sleep quality. A significant percentage fulfills IBP criteria by auto-questionnaire and should benefit from further investigation.

AB  - Background/Purpose: Low Back Pain (LBP) is a major public health problem affecting all ages, mostly young adults. University students may be vulnerable due to sedentary lifestyle and high stress levels. LBP is usually selflimited but a small proportion may have inflammatory back pain (IBP), a cornerstone symptom of axial spondyloarthritis, often overlooked. The objective of the study is to test an auto-questionnaire for IBP screening in educated young individuals, compared with the rheumatologist consultation as gold standard. Method(s): University students of three faculties (Medicine, Engineering and Sciences at Saint-Joseph University) were invited to respond to an auto-questionnaire about the presence and characteristics of LBP. Items related to IBP from the ASAS, Calin and Berlin criteria were collected. The students were then invited to a rheumatology consultation. Correlations between IBP score according to ASAS, Calin and Berlin criteria were studied between the auto-questionnaire and the rheumatology consultation. Result(s): 611 students completed the auto-questionnaire (66.5%). 154 (25.2%) gave their consent to be contacted, 85 (55.2%) could be reached for consultation at the time of this report. Responders differed from non-responders by LBP (presence), age (older), BMI (higher), year of study (higher), habits such as smoking, alcohol consumption, caffeine consumption and sports activities (higher). 44% of students reported having at least one LBP episode during the past year (59.5% in medicine vs 25.5% in others, p<0.001). LBP correlated with specialty, caffeine consumption, sleep hours, walking when studying and anxiety in multivariate analysis. 8.6% of LBP were chronic, 84.8% were recurrent (>2/year) and 31.6% were highly recurrent (>4/year). IBP was found in 17.5% (ASAS), 12.3% (Calin) and 8.8% (Berlin) of interviewed LBP. The correlation with the medical interview was acceptable, with agreement ranging from 73.68 to 85.96%. Conclusion(s): LBP is more frequent in medical university students compared to others. The correlation between the auto-questionnaire and the rheumatology consultation was acceptable, which makes the auto-questionnaire a suitable screening tool in educated individuals.

AB  - In view of the risks involved in relying on a professional career in football as a way of making a future living, most players of Swiss national youth football teams pursue some form of vocational training at the same time. This paper investigates the question under what conditions a successful football career is possible when faced with such a dual burden. In order to examine the development process as holistically as possible, a person-oriented approach was chosen. 159 former Swiss national youth team players were retrospectively interviewed about their careers, and the data were analysed using the LICUR method (Bergman, Magnusson & El-Khouri, 2003). This involves identifying certain patterns in the relevant variables of sports career, vocational career and family support, and then comparing these with the performance at the age of peak performance. Through this, it was possible to identify promising patterns of development. It turns out that the critical transition, at the age of about 15-16 years, is characterised overall by stability. The most successful patterns display above-average family support accompanied by above-average professional talent promotion in the clubs. In this constellation, the football players who are later successful pursue vocational training courses leading to low levels of educational qualification.

AB  - We expand the search for modifiable features of neighborhood environments that alter obesity risk in two ways. First, we examine residents' access to neighborhood retail food options in combination with neighborhood features that facilitate physical activity. Second, we evaluate neighborhood features for both low income and non-low income neighborhoods (bottom quartile of median neighborhood income versus the top three quartiles).Our analyses use data from the Utah Population Database merged with U.S. Census data and Dun & Bradstreet business data for Salt Lake County, Utah. Linear regressions for BMI and logistic regressions for the likelihood of being obese are estimated using various measures of the individual's neighborhood food options and walkability features. As expected, walkability indicators of older neighborhoods and neighborhoods where a higher fraction of the population walks to work is related to a lower BMI/obesity risk, although the strength of the effects varies by neighborhood income. Surprisingly, the walkability indicator of neighborhoods with higher intersection density was linked to higher BMI/obesity risk. The expected inverse relationship between the walkability indicator of population density and BMI/obesity risk is found only in low income neighborhoods. We find a strong association between neighborhood retail food options and BMI/obesity risk with the magnitude of the effects again varying by neighborhood income. For individuals living in non-low income neighborhoods, having one or more convenience stores, full-service restaurants, or fast food restaurants is associated with reduced BMI/obesity risk, compared to having no neighborhood food outlets. The presence of at least one healthy grocery option in low income neighborhoods is also associated with a reduction in BMI/obesity risk relative to no food outlets. Finally, multiple food options within a neighborhood reduce BMI/obesity risk, relative to no food options, for individuals living in either low-income or non-low neighborhoods.

AB  - Physical inactivity is estimated to be the fourth leading cause of global mortality. Strategies to increase physical activity (PA) increasingly emphasize environmental and policy changes including the modification of neighborhood environments to promote walking and other forms of healthy activity. Open Streets (OS) initiatives, an important and growing strategy to modify neighborhood environments for PA, create temporary parks for recreational activity by closing streets to motor vehicle traffic, thereby offering health and community building benefits. We used the Stanford Neighborhood Discovery Tool (DT)-photo/voice software on a tablet-to train neighborhood residents to act as "citizen scientist" observers of the local built environment on a non-event day and during an OS initiative. The purposes of this project were as follows: (1) to assess adult residents' perceptions of neighborhood characteristics of the OS initiative in three socioeconomically diverse sites and (2) to test the DT for use in three international urban settings with OS initiatives; Bogota, Colombia; San Francisco, USA; and Temuco, Chile, among a multigenerational, multiethnic sample of adults including, for the first time, a vulnerable population of homeless adults (Bogota). Using the DT, participants walked an OS route taking photos and recording reasons for the photos, then completed a 25-item demographic/environmental observation survey and a 16-item Reflection Survey on perceived environmental changes. A total of 18 themes were reported by participants with areas of overlapping themes (e.g., Community and Social Connectedness) and areas where a single site reported a theme (e.g., Social Isolation in Older Adults). Ten of the 18 themes were identified by at least two sites including "Bike Resources" and "Services", indicating the value of programming at OS initiatives. The themes of "Festive Environment" and "Family Friendly Environment" reflect the quality of the overall environment for participants. Four themes (Community and Social Connectedness, Family Friendly Environment, PA, and Safety) were reported by all sites. Three of the four unifying themes were also ranked among the highest reported categories of "seemed better" on the Reflection Survey (Ease of Walking, Overall Safety of Neighborhood, and Friendliness of Environment), providing additional confirmation of the shared experience of social, health, and psychological benefits from OS initiatives. OS initiatives offer a global strategy for increasing neighborhood opportunities for PA and a potential site for training citizen scientists to document environmental influences on PA.

AB  - This is a qualitative interview study of the experiences of student writers in classrooms designed within a constructivist writing process framework as advocated by, among others, Moffett, Britton, and Elbow. The participants were ten 12th-grade students in a suburban high school who had in earlier grades been taught by the researcher but were not at the time of the study. A central focus was the student writers' sense of audience. The most strongly voiced theme to emerge from the interview data concerned students' negative feelings about peer response groups. Participants generally found these of little value when they were assigned to groups not of their choosing. They disliked sharing their personal writing with any but trusted audiences. Feedback was most frequently sought by these student writers from teachers, parents (particularly mothers), and trusted friends. Students wished to control how, when, and with whom sharing took place. Additional findings indicated that some participants viewed themselves as audience and others created an imaginary audience. These students preferred such writing assignments as research papers when these were accompanied by clear guidelines because these assignments often afforded a choice of topic and student control over the research process. Poetry was described as a short, rule-free and thus relatively risk-free exercise. Many of the students expressed concern about their handwriting because of early unhappy experiences with handwriting instruction. Several only felt comfortable handing in work that had been done on the word processor. Participants also expressed concerns about reading their work aloud. Several read everything out loud before sharing it with anyone; others said they were embarrassed to hear their own voice reading their words even in a room alone. These views seemed part of a larger issue having to do with self-presentation and personal feelings of self-confidence. Writing was regarded as a private activity (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Purpose: This study examined potential links between dietary intakes, body fatness, menstrual status, and hematological and serum iron status in 21 competitive female figure skaters aged 11-16 yr. Method(s): Attitudes toward dieting were assessed using the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT). Dietary intakes were based on 3-d food records. Percent body fat was calculated using measures of triceps, subscapular, suprailiac, pectoral, axillary, abdominal, and thigh skinfold measures. Blood iron status was measured using hematocrit (Hct), hemoglobin (Hgb), total iron binding capacity (TIBC), and serum iron. Menstrual status was based on a self-report questionnaire. Result(s): Body weights and estimated energy intakes were all within normal range for this age group. Higher EAT scores were associated with lower micronutrient, but not lower energy intakes. Menstrual status and iron status were normal. No significant correlations between measures of body fatness, menstrual status, and hematological or serum iron status were observed. Conclusion(s): Although the measured indices of nutritional status were normal, adolescent athletes have higher energy needs than does the general population. Depending on energy expenditure levels, energy and nutrition intakes in the low normal range may put some athletes at risk for undernutrition.

AB  - We evaluated dyspnea perception in cystic fibrosis patients compared with normal subjects, during an inspiratory resistive loading test and 6-min walk test. We also evaluated the correlation between dyspnea scores induced by resistive loads and by the 6-min walk test. In this prospective, cross-sectional study, 31 patients with cystic fibrosis (≥ 15 years of age) and 31 age-, gender-, and ethnicity-matched healthy volunteers (20 females and 11 males per group) underwent inspiratory resistive loading, spirometry, and the 6-min walk test. As the magnitude of the inspiratory loads increased, dyspnea scores increased (P < 0.001), but there was no difference between groups in dyspnea score (P = 0.654). Twenty-six (84%) normal subjects completed all the resistive loads, compared with only 12 (39%) cystic fibrosis patients (P < 0.001). Dyspnea scores were higher after the 6-min walk test than at rest (P < 0.001), but did not differ between groups (P = 0.080). Post-6-min walk test dyspnea scores correlated significantly with dyspnea scores induced by resistive loads. We conclude that dyspnea perception induced in cystic fibrosis patients by inspiratory resistive loading and by 6-min walk test did not differ from that induced in normal subjects. However, cystic fibrosis patients discontinued inspiratory resistive loading more frequently. There were significant correlations between dyspnea perception scores induced by inspiratory resistance loading and by the 6-min walk test. This study should alert clinicians to the fact that some cystic fibrosis patients fail to discriminate dyspnea perception and could be at risk for delay in seeking medical care.

AB  - Background: The incidence of type 1 diabetes mellitus in childhood and adolescence is steadily rising and now stands at 22.9 new cases per year per 100 000 persons up to age 15. Methods: This review is based on pertinent publications retrieved by a selective literature search, with special attention to the current German S3 guideline on diabetes in childhood and adolescence. Results: Polydipsia, polyuria, and weight loss are the characteristic presenting symptoms of diabetes mellitus. The acutely presenting patient needs immediate stabilization because of the danger of rapid metabolic decompensation (risk of ketoacidosis, 21.1%). Long-term insulin therapy can be delivered either by subcutaneous injection or by an insulin pump. The goals of treatment are the near-normalization of glucose metabolism (HbA1c <7.5%), the avoidance of acute complications (hypoglycemia and ketoacidosis), the reduction of diabetes-specific sequelae (retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia), unrestricted participation in age-appropriate everyday activities, and normal physical and psychosocial development. Children and adolescents with diabetes need individualized treatment with frequent adjustments and holistic overall care so that these goals can be effectively met. Conclusion: Every physician must be able to diagnose the initial presentation of diabetes and to initiate the first steps in its management. The patient should be referred as soon as possible to a diabetes team that has experience in the treatment of children and adolescents.

AB  - Sleep deprivation can have deleterious effects on cognitive function and mental health. Moderate exercise training has myriad beneficial effects on cognition and mental health. However, physiological and behavioral effects of chronic moderate sleep restriction and its interaction with common activities, such as moderate exercise training, have received little investigation. The aims of this study were to examine the effects of chronic moderate sleep restriction and moderate exercise training on anxiety-related behavior, spatial memory, and neurobiological correlates in mice. Male mice were randomized to one of four 11-week treatments in a 2 [sleep restriction (similar to 4h loss/day) vs. ad libitum sleep] x 2 [exercise (1 h/day/6 d/wk) vs. sedentary activity] experimental design. Anxiety-related behavior was assessed with the elevated-plus maze, and spatial learning and memory were assessed with the Morris water maze. Chronic moderate sleep restriction did not alter anxiety-related behavior, but exercise training significantly attenuated anxiety-related behavior. Spatial learning and recall, hippocampal cell activity (i.e., number of c-Fos positive cells), and brain derived neurotrophic factor were significantly lower after chronic moderate sleep restriction, but higher after exercise training. Further, the benefit of exercise training for some memory variables was evident under normal sleep, but not chronic moderate sleep restriction conditions. These data indicate clear detrimental effects of chronic moderate sleep restriction on spatial memory and that the benefits of exercise training were impaired after chronic moderate sleep restriction.

AB  - Maximizing bone mass in youth is touted as the best strategy to offset the natural losses of aging and the menopausal transition. Not achieving maximum peak bone mineral density (BMD) is an independent risk factor for osteoporosis and thus a public health concern. Adolescence is a critical time of bone mineralization mediated by endogenous estradiol. Research has shown that the highest velocity of bone mass accrual occurs 1 year before menarche and after the first 3 years. Low-peak attainment of BMD in young women is associated with contributing factors such as diets low in calcium, eating disorders, lack of exercise, smoking, and low estrogen states. Oral contraceptives (OCs) suppress endogenous estradiol production by suppressing the hypothalamic–pituitary–ovarian axis. Thus, OCs, by replacing endogenous estradiol with ethinyl estradiol (EE), establish and maintain new hormone levels. The early initiation and the use of very low dose of EE raises the possibility that bone mass accrual at a critical time of bone mineralization in young women or adolescents may be jeopardized. This review examines the studies of BMD in adolescents and young women that use combination hormonal contraception. Some studies had inherent limitations, such as small trial, poor control of confounders, failure to exclude women with prior use of hormonal contraceptives, or prior pregnancy from control groups. The vast majority of reviewed studies showed OCs containing 20 to 30 µg of EE interfere with acquisition of peak BMD. Limited numbers of studies examine the effects of OCs containing 35 µg on adolescents and young adults. Additionally, studies are needed evaluating the progestin component of OCs as their differing androgenic properties may affect bone mineralization as well.

AB  - Numerous outcome studies have found fatigue to be a common problem following traumatic brain injury (TBI). This study examined the magnitude, causes and impact of fatigue following TBI using three subjective fatigue scales, and investigated its relationship with demographic and injury-related factors, and mood. Forty-nine controls and 49 TBI participants (36.2% with GCS score of 13-15, 29.8% with GCS score of 9-12, and 34% with GCS score of 3-8) were seen at a mean of approximately 8 months post injury. All participants completed three subjective fatigue measures, including the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Visual Analogue Scale-Fatigue (VAS-F) and Causes of Fatigue Questionnaire (COF). TBI participants reported a significantly greater impact of fatigue on their lifestyle on the FSS relative to controls, and reported activities requiring physical and mental effort as more frequent causes of fatigue on the COF. There were, however, no significant group differences on subscales of the VAS-F. Greater time since injury and higher education levels were associated with higher fatigue levels, independent of the effects of mood. Injury severity and age were not found to be significant predictors of subjective fatigue severity in TBI participants. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In order to provide data to help schools respond to the diversity in the backgrounds and educational needs of children entering school, a U.S. Department of Education study asked parents of 3- to 5-year-old children who had not yet started kindergarten about their children's accomplishments that indicated emerging literacy and numeracy skills and their children's difficulties in physical activity or attention. Results indicated that the percentage of children displaying signs of emerging literacy and small-motor skills increased with age. Developmental difficulties showed small changes across ages. More girls than boys demonstrated literacy and small-motor skills. This gender difference was small, however. Hispanic preschoolers showed fewer signs of emerging literacy, exhibited more difficulties with physical activity or attention, and were in less good general health than white or black children. The study identified five family risk factors: (1) mother has less than a high school education; (2) family is below the poverty line; (3) mother speaks a language other than English as her primary language; (4) mother was unmarried at the time of the child's birth; and (5) only one parent is present in the home. These risk factors, especially low maternal education and minority language status, were found to be associated with fewer accomplishments and more difficulties in children. Attending Head Start, prekindergarten, or other center-based preschool programs have beneficial effects on emerging literacy and numeracy in four-year-olds from both high- and low-risk family backgrounds. However, preschool attendance does not appear to ameliorate behavioral, speech, or health difficulties of preschoolers. (BC)

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate risk factors that could promote HIV infection amongst adolescents and young adults living in tertiary educational institutional hostels in Namibia. Employing structured questionnaires and focus group discussions, we sought to answer questions pertaining to factors, beliefs systems, values, traditions and sexual relations that could promote HIV infection in the student hostels. The data on these issues were gathered from 306 male and 314 female students aged 18-35 years living in eight hostels. Amongst other results, the data revealed that sexual promiscuity in the hostels was treated as the norm in the majority of cases, unauthorized access to hostel rooms by non-hostel dwellers was rampant, sexual harassment of female students by men who were under the influence of alcohol was reported to be common and there was general lack of support for victims of sexual abuse in the hostels. In addition, there was a general sense of insecurity in the hostels where more than 50% of the participants were afraid of being sexually attacked, some female hostel residents engaged in sexual activities for monetary and material gain and there was a general practice of older men from the community having sexual relations with young female hostel dwellers. To mitigate these and other risks it is recommended that there be provision of more HIV/AIDS prevention services, enhanced security, non-toxic entertainment (e.g. participation in sport and social clubs) and the banning of the sale of alcohol in student residences and on tertiary institution campuses. These and other results are discussed in the article and ways of mitigating the risks are proposed.

AB  - The article presents information on a study which examined the relationship of Magic Johnson's disclosure of being HIV-positive to AIDS-related attitudes of predominantly Black students attending a public junior high school. In November 7, 1991, Magic Johnson reported that he had tested positive for human immunodeficiency virus. As an immensely popular and respected sports figure, it was widely expected that Magic Johnson's announcement would have a great impact, in particular, on Black youth. It was hoped that upon hearing that even Magic Johnson could get infected with the virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, many teenagers would re-examine and modify their sexual risk-taking behaviors. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate how Magic Johnson's announcement may have been related to the AIDS-related attitudes of a group of junior high school students. Three attitude domains measured in this study were AIDS knowledge, worries about vulnerability to HIV infection, and anxiety about interacting with a person with AIDS. It is expected that desire for knowledge about AIDS would be higher following the high level of media exposure generated by Magic John son's story.

AB  - This study examined the association between self-reported sports- or physical activity-related concussion and symptoms of depression and suicidal behaviors (suicidal ideation, having a suicide plan, and suicide attempts). This study used data from the 2017 and 2019 Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS), a biennial, school-based, nationally representative survey of U.S. students in grade levels 9 to 12 (N = 14,496). Multivariate logistical regression models assessed the association between self-reported sports-or physical activity-related concussions and suicidal behaviors among students, controlling for a range of demographic and psychosocial variables. Altogether, 13.6% of students reported a sports-or physical activity related concussion in the past 12 months. Among youth, sports-or physical activity related concussions were significantly associated with greater odds of symptoms of depression, suicidal ideation, making a suicide plan, and suicide attempts compared to other youth who did not experience sports- or physical activity-related concussion. Findings highlight increased risk for adverse mental health outcomes among students with sports-or physical activity related concussions. Providing resources for students to engage in physical activity and sports teams may help prevent the onset of depression and suicidal behaviors; however, resources must also be available to monitor any concussions related to these activities to provide support for student emotional well-being.

AB  - Intrinsic motivation is important for adolescents enrolled in residential treatment programs. According to Self-Determination Theory intrinsic motivation can be increased in environments that facilitate autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Residential treatment programs are frequently successful in facilitating competence and relatedness, but their rigid structure often makes them ill-equipped to facilitate autonomy. Constraints on autonomy within residential treatment settings are likely due to involuntary enrollment and reliance on extrinsic rewards to elicit desired behavioral change, both of which may inhibit intrinsic motivation. Understanding the constraints on intrinsic motivation is a necessary precursor to programming toward intrinsic motivation and long-term therapeutic success. Drawing on the premises of Self-Determination Theory, the purpose of this study was to better understand the dynamics of intrinsic motivation among adolescent males on outdoor trips within the context of a residential treatment program. Employing a qualitative case study, data collection consisted of interviews with 16 students and 6 staff members, as well as extensive observation and field notes. Data analysis was conducted using a constant comparison method. Research findings recognized five major thematically connected categories: (a) autonomy, (b) relatedness, (c) competence, (d) challenge, and (e) natural/outdoor environment, as well as three minor categories: (f) external consequences, (g) exercise, and (h) personal development/therapy. A discussion of the major and minor categories and corresponding subcategories is provided, as well as guidance for future research and recommendations for practitioners.

AB  - Context: With the advent of the National Collegiate Athletic Association's (NCAA's) mandating the presence and practice of concussion-management plans in collegiate athletic programs, institutions will consider potential approaches for concussion management, including both baseline and normative comparison approaches. Objective: To examine sport and team differences in baseline performance on a computer-based neurocognitive measure and 2 standard sideline measures of cognition and balance and to determine the potential effect of premorbid factors sex and height on baseline performance. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: University laboratory. Patients or Other Participants: A total of 437 NCAA Division II student-athletes (males = 273, females = 164; age = 19.61 +/- 1.64 years, height = 69.89 +/- 4.04 inches [177.52 +/- 10.26 cm]) were recruited during mandatory preseason testing conducted in a concussion-management program. Main Outcome Measure(s): The computerized Concussion Resolution Index (CRI), the Standardized Assessment of Concussion (Form A; SAC), and the Balance Error Scoring System (BESS). Results: Players on the men's basketball team tended to perform worse on the baseline measures, whereas soccer players tended to perform better. We found a difference in total BESS scores between these sports (P = .002). We saw a difference between sports on the hard-surface portion of the BESS (F-6,F-347 = 3.33, P = .003, eta(2)(p) = 0.05). No sport, team, or sex differences were found with SAC scores (P > .05). We noted differences between sports and teams in the CRI indices, with basketball, particularly the men's team, performing worse than soccer (P < .001) and softball/baseball (P = .03). When sex and height were considered as possible sources of variation in BESS and CRI team or sport differences, height was a covariate for the team (F-1,F-385 = 5.109, P = .02, eta(2)(p) = 0.013) and sport (F1,326 = 11.212, P = .001, eta(2)(p) = 0.033) analyses, but the interaction of sex and sport on CRI indices was not significant in any test (P > .05). Conclusions: Given that differences in neurocognitive functioning and performance among sports and teams exist, the comparison of posttraumatic and baseline assessment may lead to more accurate diagnoses of concussion and safer return-to- participation decision making than the use of normative comparisons.

AB  - Children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD) may experience stress in physical activity contexts due to emphasis on their poor motor skills. The purpose of this study was to explore the lived experiences of children at risk for DCD in physical education in order to develop a deeper understanding about what they experience as stress and how they cope with it. Using interpretative phenomenological analysis, six children in Grades 4-6 participated in two semistructured interviews. A motivational (and developmental) stress and coping theory informed interpretation of the three themes that described the children's experiences: (a) they hurt me-psychological and physical harm sustained from peers, (b) it's hard for me-difficulties encountered in activities, and (c) I have to-pressure to meet the teacher's demands. Although the children at risk for DCD were confronted with various stressors in physical education, they coped more adaptively when social support was provided.

AB  - ABSTRACT IN ENGLISH: Current advances towards better understanding of inequalities in health pinpoint the negative effects of cumulative disadvantages and disruptive life events on physical and mental health. The analyses presented in this article are based on the sub-sample of 50 to 74 year old respondents of the Swiss Household Panel, interviewed since 1999 in each of the first five waves and comprising 1,257 persons. The results indicate that current health status is strongly determined by current living conditions, negative life events, and levels of social support. With the exception of long standing health problems, disadvantages during youth and life-events during the life course are relatively weak direct determinants of the current health status. However, antecedent social factors influence the current health indirectly by making chronic health problems more likely and by decreasing the current household income and social support. // ABSTRACT IN GERMAN: Zur besseren Erklärung der Zusammenhängezwischen sozialer Ungleichheit und Gesundheit berücksichtigt die gegenwärtige Forschung vermehrt die Auswirkungen von Lebensereignissen und -bedingungen im gesamten Lebensverlauf. Die Auswertungen dieses Beitrags stützen sich auf die Daten der 50- bis 74-Jährigen (n=1'257) der ersten fünf Befragungswellen des Schweizer Haushalt-Panels (1999-2003). Der gegenwärtige Gesundheitszustand ist stark von aktuellen Lebensbedingungen, negativen Lebensereignissen und mangelnder sozialer Unterstützung geprägt. Mit Ausnahme von chronischen gesundheitlichen Problemen haben die während der Jugendzeit und im früheren Erwachsenenalter erlebten nachteiligen Lebensbedingungen und -ereignisse einen relativ schwachen direkten Einfluss auf den gegenwärtigen Gesundheitszustand. Diese sozialen Faktoren wirken aber über die Wahrscheinlichkeit chronischer gesundheitlicher Probleme, die Höhe des Einkommens und die soziale Unterstützung indirekt. // ABSTRACT IN FRENCH: Pour mieux comprendre les inégalités en matière de santé, la recherche actuelle se penche de plus en plus sur les effets des conditions et événements de vie qui prévalent tout au long de l'existence. Les analyses présentées dans cet article se basent sur les cinq premières vagues des données du Panel suisse de ménages, collectées annuellement depuis 1999, et concernent exclusivement le sous-échantillon des 1,257 personnes âgées de 50 à 75 ans. Les résultats montrent que l'état de santé actuel se trouve fortement déterminé par les conditions et événements de vie actuels, ainsi que le niveau de soutien social. À l'exception des problèmes chroniques de santé, les situations défavorables intervenant tout au long du parcours de vie ont une influence directe plutôt faible sur l'état de santé actuel. Toutefois, ces antécédents sociaux interviennent indirectement sur la probabilité de problèmes chroniques de santé et influencent négativement les niveaux de revenu et de soutien social.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Over 57 million people in the United States have prediabetes, and 70% will progress to diabetes mellitus (DM) type 2. In 2002, two large clinical trials demonstrated that lifestyle modification consisting of diet, exercise, and sustained weight loss can reduce the incidence of DM in pre-diabetic, at-risk patients by approximately 60%. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) went on to demonstrate a 34% reduction in DM incidence at ten years. However, recent National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES) data suggest that these practices have not been widely encouraged by physicians and that pre-diabetes often goes unrecognized. Frequently, serum glucose measurements become part of the health record because serum glucose is included in popular laboratory bundles (i.e. basic metabolic panel, basic chemistry panel, etc.) that providers order to diagnose or evaluate conditions other than abnormal glucose metabolism. However, patients and providers are often not aware of these data and may not use these data to initiate preventive counseling for pre-diabetic patients. Electronic health record (EHR) -generated clinician reminders can keep appropriate preventive care from slipping through the cracks during a busy primary care visit, and have been shown to increase rates of preventive care. We explored whether electronic health record (EHR) query based on glucose measurements can identify pre-diabetic patients eligible for lifestyle intervention, and we estimated rates of pre-diabetic lifestyle modification counseling. METHOD(S): Subjects included men and women >18 years of age who attended at least three office visits in a large, urban, academic primary care practice in Chicago. Electronic search identified patients with plasma glucose levels of 100 to 199 mg/dl between June 1st, 2007, and June 1st, 2009, excluding those with diabetes or diabetic medications/ supplies documented as coded, searchable data in problem, diagnosis, or medication lists. This glucose range was chosen based on the most widely accepted definition of pre-diabetes: the presence of impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and/or the presence of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). IFG is defined as fasting serum glucose levels of 100 to 125 mg/dl, and IGT is defined as serum glucose levels of 140 to 199 mg/dl two hours after an oral glucose load of 75 grams. From these 5,366 patients,100 randomly-selected subjects underwent classification into provisional categories based on all available EHR documentation on fasting state and concurrent fasting lipid panels: likely pre-diabetes, likely diabetes, abnormal glucose metabolism in the setting of acute illness, or possible normal glucose metabolism. In those likely to have pre-diabetes, investigators reviewed phone and office encounters 6 months before and after each glucose measurement to identify documented lifestyle modification counseling. We compared characteristics of subjects who did and did not receive lifestyle modification counseling using the two-tailed student's t-test for normally-distributed continuous variables, Wilcoxon Rank Sum test for non-normallydistributed continuous variables, and the Fisher exact test for categorical variables. RESULT(S): The initial electronic query identified 5,366 non-diabetic patients who had attended the clinic over two years with glucose measurements in the range of 100-199 mg/dl. Eighty-three percent had a glucose level of 100 to 125 mg/dl. Of the 100 randomly-selected patients (from the 5,366) for whom manual chart review was undertaken, 58% (95% CI 48 to 68%) of subjects met criteria for likely prediabetes. Fourteen percent were categorized as likely having diabetes, 21% had hyperglycemia in the setting of acute illness or corticosteroid use, and 7% had glucose measurements possibly reflecting normal postprandial glucose levels. Four of 14 categorized as likely to have diabetes had no documentation of the diagnosis or a diabetes-related prescription recorded in the free text portion of the EHR, implying that these individuals had undiagnosed diabetes. Counseling was documented in 30.5% (95% CI 21 to 44%) of subjects likely to have pre-diabetes. Twenty-six lifestyle counseling events were identified, comprising 24% of opportunities (95% CI 17 to 33%) in the 58 pre-diabetic individuals. We noted only one instance of documentation of a specific Diabetes Prevention Program recommendation, which appeared in a phone note and included the recommendation of weight loss of 7% of body mass. The difference in mean baseline BMI was clinically and statically significant when comparing those counseled to those not counseled (34.1 versus 29.9, p=0.037). Otherwise, there were no statistically- or clinically-significant differences between the two groups in terms of demographics (age, sex), co-morbidities (hypertension, dyslipidemia, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack), or clinical characteristics (glucose, creatinine, blood pressure, lipid levels). CONCLUSION(S): EHR query using a glucose measurement criterion can identify pre-diabetic individuals and those who require further evaluation of glucose metabolism, including subjects with undiagnosed diabetes. Our findings support the need to address glucose measurements of 100 to 199 mg/dl on a systemic or organizational level, potentially with physician reminders. Future research should investigate EHR-based, population-level interventions to facilitate pre-diabetes recognition and intervention, leading to improved quality of care.

AB  - Although dieting for weight-loss and weight maintenance is exceedingly popular in today's society, there exists minimal information regarding its influence on other areas of people's lives. The focus of the dieting literature has been on obese and eating disordered individuals. The present study presents a conceptual framework of dieting which attempts to expand its definition and specify its dimensions. Using a community sample of 614 young adults this study examines a continuum conceptualization of dieting behaviors by assessing specific dieting behaviors and their interrelationships. The relationships between young adult dieting behaviors and depression, substance abuse, health are investigated. In addition, several early and late adolescent predictors of young adult dieting behaviors are investigated, including personality, body weight, family relationships, and substance use. Latent-variables models are used to determine the correlations of both the latent factors and the measured variables. Structural equation models are used to determine adolescent predictors of the measured dieting variables. With the use of latent-variable models it was possible to study the construct, dieting behaviors and the specific measured variables, Healthy Dieting, Exercise, Deprivation Dieting and Eating Disordered Dieting. For both men and women, a higher frequency of healthy dieting behaviors directly predicted the likelihood of using deprivation or eating disordered behaviors to control weight. Excessive deprivation dieting strongly predicted eating disordered dieting. Both findings suggest a link between healthy and unhealthy methods of dieting. High numbers of women were found to use deprivation dieting. Young adult dieting was positively associated with depression for both men and women. However, the use of exercise as a dieting method was negatively associated with depression. For men who diet physical difficulties may be a significant problem.

AB  - Background: Recent data from a self-administered questionnaire show that approximately 75% of school children in Qatar do not meet the daily recommended levels of physical activity (PA). Since children spend half of their waking hours in school, it is important to understand when and how much PA children accumulate during the school day. This study aimed to objectively assess school-time PA among elementary school children in Qatar and to determine association of PA with age, gender, body mass index (BMI) status, or day of the week. Methods: A cross-sectional epidemiological study was conducted in four randomly selected elementary schools in Qatar. Two classes representing grade 1 children (age 5) and grade 4 children (age 9) were randomly selected within each school. A total of 183 elementary school children (86 boys and 97 girls) ages 6-12 years participated in this study. PA was assessed using a three-axial accelerometer (ActiGraph((R))wGT3X-BT). Participants wore accelerometers on their non-dominant wrist at school (7: 00 a. m. to 1: 00 p. m.) for five consecutive school days during the week. A cutoff points of 818 counts per 5 s was classified as moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Results: The average duration of MVPA in our study was 28.2 +/- 13.5 min per day. Only 39% of participated children reach the recommended school-based MVPA of 30 min or more per day. Students spent on average 58.1 +/- 8.4% of school time on sedentary activities. MVPA of boys and girls was similar in age 5 while girls age 9 were less active (23.7 +/- 1.5 min/day) than boys of the same age (42.7 +/- 1.8 min/day), ES = 0.269, P < 0.001. Neither overweight children nor children at risk for being overweight showed any differences in physical activity parameters when compared to children of normal weight. Our results showed, percentage of MVPA on the first (7.7 +/- 5.1%) and last (7.1 +/- 4.1%) day of the week was generally lower compared to other weekdays (P < 0.001). Conclusion: This was the first study to objectively assess PA during school hours among elementary school-children in Qatar. This study found that many of school children do not perform sufficient time being physically active at school. All students in two age categories (age 5 and age 9) spend the majority of school time engaged in sedentary activities. The low participation of girls age 9 in MVPA is a cause for concern and need to be addressed.

AB  - Background: Recent data from a self-administered questionnaire show that approximately 75% of school children in Qatar do not meet the daily recommended levels of physical activity (PA). Since children spend half of their waking hours in school, it is important to understand when and how much PA children accumulate during the school day. This study aimed to objectively assess school-time PA among elementary school children in Qatar and to determine association of PA with age, gender, body mass index (BMI) status, or day of the week. Method(s): A cross-sectional epidemiological study was conducted in four randomly selected elementary schools in Qatar.

AB  - Introduction Traumatic shoulder instability most frequently occurs in young people often during sports events. Currently, the arthroscopic Bankart repair is the therapy of choice in the absence of extensive glenoid bone loss and has proved to be a safe and effective procedure. Nevertheless, we see recurrence of instability-especially if new trauma happens-and further data are needed to guide the right decision-making for these often young patients. The purpose of this study was to determine the long-term outcome 10 years after arthroscopic Bankart operation in terms of satisfaction of the patient, functional result, complications, recurrent instability, and development of osteoarthritis, and to look after possible risk factors for recurrence of instability and statistical proof of these. Materials and methods Thirty-nine out of 49 patients underwent physical examination of both shoulders. We could perform a postoperative shoulder a-p X-ray in 28 patients. According to Samilson, [24] the extent of osteoarthritis was measured. The Constant score and the postoperative ROWE score were determined for both shoulders as well as the WOSI Score. In 25 cases, we calculated the ISIS Score. Results We could reach out to 89.6% of patients and 79.6% could be physically examined. The vast majority of 95.5% are either very satisfied or satisfied with the result at the time we ended the follow-up. The mean Constant score of 95.5 reflects this result. In contrast to this, we found at the same time in 15.3% ongoing clinical signs of instability of the concerning shoulder, even though 9.1% had to be re-operated for recurrent instability in between the follow-up timeline and we found in the X-rays (57.1% of all patients) in 35.7% at least moderate and in 10.7% severe signs of osteoarthritis. The Constant score but not the ROWE score differed significantly in patients with no or mild compared to those with moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis. Conclusions The arthroscopic Bankart stabilization procedure showed after 10 years to be a very safe operation and to be able to produce a satisfying and functional very good long-term result-reflected by the Constant score. We assume that the extent of osteoarthritis seems to be the determining factor of the very good functional result, even though ongoing instability was present in 15.3% of the patients.

AB  - ObjectiveRecent data report that the youth experience greater weight gain during summer than during school months. We tested the hypothesis that a difference in total energy expenditure (TEE) between school and summer months exists and may contribute to summer weight gain. Subjects and methodsA secondary analysis was performed on cross-sectional TEE data from school-age, sedentary African-American and Caucasian youth based in or near the District of Columbia who were at-risk for adult obesity because they had body mass index (BMI)85th percentile or had overweight parents. TEE was estimated from 18-O and deuterium measurements during 1-week intervals using urine samples collected after ingestion of doubly labelled water. Differences in summer- and school-time TEE were assessed using analysis of covariance. The data were adjusted for fat-free mass (FFM) as determined by deuterium dilution to adjust for the effect of body size on TEE. ResultsData were collected from 162 youth (average age 102 years, BMI 28 +/- 8kgm(-2) and BMIz-score 1.96+0.96). Of these, 96 youth had TEE measured during the school year (September-June); 66 different youths had TEE measured during summer months (June-August). After adjustment for FFM, average summertime TEE was 2450 +/- 270 kcald(-1) and average school-time TEE was 2510 +/- 350 kcald(-1) (P=0.26). ConclusionNo difference in TEE was detected between the school year and the summer months. These data suggest that seasonal differences in youth weight gain are not necessarily due to differences in energy expenditures.

AB  - Anorexia nervosa is a highly distinctive serious mental disorder. It can affect individuals of all ages, sexes, sexual orientations, races, and ethnic origins; however, adolescent girls and young adult women are particularly at risk. This disorder is characterised by an intense fear of weight gain and a disturbed body image, which motivate severe dietary restriction or other weight loss behaviours such as purging or excessive physical activity. Additionally, cognitive and emotional functioning are markedly disturbed in people with this disorder. Serious medical morbidity and psychiatric comorbidity are the norm. This lecture focuses on factors associated with anorexia nervosa that are of particular relevance to clinicians, such as recent developments in diagnosis, epidemiology, pathogenesis, treatment, and prognosis.

AB  - While sport for development programming has flourished, the complex social and economic environment in the postcolonial Eastern Caribbean is often overlooked by researchers. This case study examines sport for development with at risk' adolescent girls in St. Lucia (n=16). These young women, who have been removed from mainstream public schools due to behavioural issues, participated in focus group discussions regarding their experiences and perspectives on sport. Their sport participation included single-sex, organised programming at the Upton Gardens Girls Centre and mixed-sex, unsupervised football play. Results of the study indicate that these sporting activities contributed towards the capability development of the participants,with limitations toward challenging genderstereotypesand encouraging kinetically focused body image. While the female-only sport participation encouraged a positive sense of self-efficacy and fostered peer/mentor relationships, engagement in co-educational football supported girls' empowerment and the challenging ofgender stereotypes. However, outcome towards progressive perspectives on sport and body image gleaned mixed results. As a whole, these results point to larger concerns within the sport for development field and the need for more in-depth and comprehensive critical research to better understand how sport impacts development initiatives.

AB  - Parents of special needs children know how hard their children work to master new skills. It can be heartrending when hard-won progress evaporates. Summer can present a particular dilemma to those with learning challenges. The freedom, recreation, and fun is something everybody looks forward to, but this break from learning can result in the loss or critical academic skills--something that may have a lasting impact on their educational development. Quality summer programming helps children to maintain competency skills over the summer. Summer classes reinforce academic learning in subjects like reading and math and provide an opportunity to practice social and behavioral skills with peers. By keeping skills fresh over the summer, students are better prepared to transition back into school in September and take on the challenges of a new academic year. Summer programming for children with special needs has important quality-of-life benefits too. For special learners, summer break is often anything but a "vacation." The productive, predictable routine of school is replaced by a tremendous quantity of unstructured time. This can be disorienting, frustrating or lonely for a child with special needs. A summer program can foster friendships and provide opportunities to try new activities in a supportive environment. Socialization and recreation are important for special needs learners, but they may have difficulty taking part in mainstream sports or recreation activities. Issues such as health, motor planning, behavioral issues, over stimulating environments and difficulties inferring social cues and understanding abstract language can interfere with their participation. When looking for the right summer learning program for their child, the first thing parents want to look for is balance. The ideal summer program integrates both social and emotional development with engaging academics to build on a student's interests and strengths while maintaining what they have accomplished. The right blend of socialization and academics offers the special learner the ability to stay academically engaged while still experiencing a balanced and enjoyable summer "break."

AB  - Research shows that the sexual harassment of student teachers on teaching practice is a prevalent and seemingly insidious phenomenon. The Zimbabwean student teachers, regardless of their sex, are victims of sexual harassment but are generally reluctant to formally report the sexual harassment being perpetrated against them. The aim of the study was to explain the sexual harassment phenomenon as experienced and expressed by the victims who are the student teachers on teaching practice in Zimbabwe. The focus was on the phenomenon's prevalence and insidiousness. The study adopted a quantitative methodology. A sample of 127 student teachers, then fresh from a teaching practice phase of their teacher education course mainly in selected Zimbabwean rural schools, was asked to complete a questionnaire about their sexual harassment experiences during teaching practice. Chi-square tests were used to test hypotheses and in answering research questions on the prevalence and insidiousness of sexual harassment among the student teachers. Results showed that student teachers regardless of their sexes experienced sexual harassment of various forms from their superordinates but are generally reluctant to formally report the acts. The acts of harassment range from subtle or non-physical forms such as lustful stares that make the victim uncomfortable and to comply with the assertive acts that are the abuse of professional status. The study implores institutions to sensitise victims of their legal obligations in such cases. Reprinted by permission of the publisher Kamla-Raj Enterprises, Delhi, India

AB  - BACKGROUND: Stress is a natural automatic reaction of organisms to challenging or threatening stimuli. Prevalence rates reveal an increasing number of students both in elementary and secondary education suffering from anxiety and other stress-related disorders and illnesses [The Journal of Pediatrics. 2009 Mar;154(3):322-6]. Literature shows a plethora of stress management techniques being used with children and adults to achieve stress reduction and inner peace. This narrative review primarily aimed at summarizing evidence-based relaxation techniques currently used by minors, contrasting them with data from the past and directions for the future. *(Additional content can be found at the bottom page of this review). SUMMARY: Literature research revealed a plethora of stress management techniques, including breathing practices or exercises, meditation, guided imagery, clinical hypnosis, cognitive behavioral therapy, behavioral therapy, third wave therapies, interpersonal therapies, progressive muscle relaxation, autogenic training, biofeedback training, and mindfulness, that are deemed to be effective to treat stress and a variety of stress-related disorders such as anxiety disorders, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), headaches, abdominal pain, perioperative anxiety and postoperative pain, cancer, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. These evidence-based stress management techniques have been successfully employed in various settings such as schools, waiting rooms, dental offices, or inpatient settings. KEY MESSAGES: Stress management techniques used by children and adolescents are important to reduce anxiety, stress, and depressive symptoms, improve social skills, reduce stress-related physical pain, and achieve academic improvement across settings and diagnoses.Copyright © 2022 S.

AB  - The careful monitoring of the trigger factors of headache could be an important step in treatment, because their avoidance may lessen the frequency and severity of attacks. Furthermore, they may provide a clue to the aetiology of headache. The aim of the present study was to estimate the prevalence of tension-type headache (TTH) and to establish the frequency of precipitating factors in subjects with migraine and TTH in the adult population of Bakar, County of the Coast and Gorski Kotar, Croatia. Another important purpose of the study was to examine the relationship of the precipitating factors with migraine and TTH, and with migraine subtypes: migraine with aura (MA) and migraine without aura (MO). We performed a population-based survey using a ‘face-to-face door-to-door’ interview method. The surveyed population consisted of 5173 residents aged between 15 and 65 years. The 3794 participants (73.3%) were screened for headache history according to the International Headache Society (IHS) criteria. Headache screen-positive responders, 2475 (65.2%), were interviewed by trained medical students with a structured detailed interview focused on the precipitating factors. The following precipitating factors in lifetime migraineurs and tension-type headachers have been assessed: stress, sleep disturbances, eating habits, menstrual cycle, oral contraceptives, food items, afferent stimulation, changes in weather conditions and temperature, frequent travelling and physical activity. A total of 720 lifetime migraineurs and 1319 tension-type headachers have been identified. The most common precipitants for both migraine and TTH were stress and frequent travelling. Stress (odds ratio (OR) 1.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17, 1.69) was associated with migraine, whereas physical activity (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.59, 0.87) was related to TTH. Considering MA and MO, frequent travelling (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.59, 2.99), food items (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.35, 3.51) and changes in weather conditions and temperature (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.27, 2.41) exhibited a significant positive association with MA. The present study demonstrated that precipitant-dependent attacks are frequent among both migraineurs and tension-type headachers. Lifetime migraineurs experienced headache attacks preceded by triggering factors more frequently than tension-type headachers. MA was more frequently associated with precipitating factors than MO. We suggest that some triggering factors may contribute to the higher occurrence of precipitant-dependent headache attacks in susceptible individuals.

AB  - This study replicated and extended the design and outcome measures of several small studies. In these studies, juveniles at high risk for violence and delinquency showed decreased violence and positive changes in psychological risk factors after being required to take a school-linked course in traditional martial arts. In the present study, 60 boys in a large urban middle school were required to take a traditional martial arts course in their school. They were paired on problematic behavior profiles and assigned to a treatment group or to a wait-list control group. Thirty classes, three per week (45 minutes each), were taught by a master of Koga Ha Kosho Shorei Ryu Kempo and his assistant (neither was a public school teacher). Results are reported here for 14 variables from the following measures: four teacher rating scales from the Sutter-Eyberg Student Behavior Inventory, five self-report scales of the Piers-Harris Self-Concept Scale, four computerized measures of attentional self-control from the Intermediate Visual and Auditory Continuous Performance Test, and a count of permanent expulsions from school. The treatment students improved over baseline on 12 variables, while the controls improved on 5 by small amounts and deteriorated from baseline on 8, including teacher-rated violence. There were significant differences between the groups on self-reported happiness and schoolwork and on one measure of attention. After controls took the course, their scores resembled the postcourse scores of the treatment group. Importantly, the control group's increase in teacher-rated violence was reversed. Both groups were then pooled to compare baseline and postcourse teacher ratings. Their scores improved significantly in the areas of resistance to rules, impulsiveness, and inappropriate social behavior. There was also improvement in regard to violence, but the change in scores was not statistically significant. Follow-up on teachers' ratings showed that improvement remained, and in some cases increased, four months after completion of the course. Interestingly, all 6 permanent expulsions were among the control group students who had not yet taken, or had only begun taking, the martial arts course.

AB  - Background: Family history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is an independent risk factor for CVD. Therefore, efforts to prevent CVD among asymptomatic persons with a family history are warranted. Little is known about preventive recommendations clinicians offer their patients with a family history of CVD, and adherence to preventive recommendations by patients at risk for CVD has not been well described. Methods: We used the 2007 Oregon Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to evaluate among 2,566 adults without CVD associations between family history of CVD and (a) clinician recommendations; (b) perceived risk of developing CVD; (c) adoption of preventive and screening behaviors; and (d) risk factors of CVD. Results: Compared with adults with no family history of CVD, those with a family history reported that their clinician was more likely to ask about their family history information (OR = 2.6; 95% CI, 1.9-3.4), discuss the risk of developing CVD (OR = 2.0; 95% CI, 1.6-2.5), and make recommendations to prevent CVD (OR = 2.1; 95% CI, 1.7-2.7). Family history and clinician recommendations were associated with a higher likelihood of reported changes in diet or physical activity to prevent CVD (OR = 2.7; 95% CI, 2.3-3.2). Persons with a family history of CVD were more likely to report having high cholesterol, having high blood pressure, taking aspirin, and having had their cholesterol checked. Conclusion: The presence of a family history of CVD appears to prompt clinicians to recommend preventive changes and may motivate patients without CVD to adopt these recommendations.

AB  - Background: This study examines the nature of disparities in cardiovascular risk by exploring chronic stressors and other cardiovascular risk factors on youth of African descent who are integrating into an industrialized society. Methods: Qualitative data on cardiovascular risk and acclimation to the dominant society were collected from three groups of key informants: (1) community leaders; (2) youth; and (3) a community advisory group. Results: Youth of Ethiopian descent engaged in the same western diets, computerized social networking, and habits in smoking and alcohol use as did youth from the dominant society. However, informants of Ethiopian descent encountered and witnessed racism, institutional discrimination and evidence of devaluing Ethiopian culture, influencing youths' ability to integrate into the society. Conclusion: Immigrant youth of Ethiopian descent face an accumulation of conflicting social support, psychosocial factors, and stressors, including: living in low-income, high-crime areas; encountering pervasive discrimination; acclimating to a new and industrialized culture; and navigating within an often unhospitable society. Contributing to these factors are changes in health behaviors such as adding processed foods and sugary drinks to the diet, increasing heavy alcohol use and substituting screen use for physical activity. The accumulative impact of these factors contributes to the marginalization of youth of Ethiopian descent in the dominant society and perpetuates a cycle of increasing cardiovascular risk.

AB  - Increasingly evidence suggests that the self-reported health status (SRH) of 2nd generation immigrant youth (native-born youth with at least one parent who was born abroad) may be lower than non-immigrant youth. This cross-sectional study compared the SRH of 2nd generation immigrant to non-immigrant youth (n = 291), accounting for confounders including a clinical measure (i.e., body mass index), internal resources (i.e., diet, exercise, smoking), and external resources (i.e., socioeconomic status, family social support). Regressions showed SRH was associated with socioeconomic status (p < .05), family social support (p < .05) and exercise (p < .05) but not immigrant status. Yet, bivariate analyses, showed that among youth, 2nd generation immigrants had poorer diets (p < .01), were smokers (p < .0001), had lower socioeconomic status (p < .05) and less family social support (p < .05). Thus, although SRH did not differ by immigration status among youth, the differences in internal and external resources by immigrant status may lead to health differences in the future.

AB  - Objective: To compare the relative effectiveness of a modelling and a moulding instructional technique for teaching action sequences to participants with brain injury in rehabilitation settings. Design: Randomized crossover design. Setting: Regional Neurological Rehabilitation Unit. Subjects: Sixteen participants with an acquired brain injury undergoing early inpatient rehabilitation. Intervention: Participants were instructed to recall two different sequences of seven hand movements after a short (5 minutes) and longer delay (30 minutes). Participants were taught the sequences using moulding and modelling techniques. Main outcome measure: Participants’ recall of the sequence measured after the short and longer delay for each instructional technique. Results: Participants recalled the sequence after the longer delay (30 minutes) significantly more accurately (Z = 1.91, P = 0.028) when taught using the modelling instructional technique (mean 2.63, SD 1.55) compared to the moulding technique (mean 1.56, SD 1.63). There were no significant differences between the participants’ recall scores after a short delay. Participants who scored lower on a delayed memory subtest of a neuropsychological test benefitted more from the modelling technique. Conclusion: The use of a modelling instructional technique to teach brain-injured participants an action sequence during their rehabilitation may be more effective for their longer term performance than a moulding instructional technique.

AB  - Background: Limited research has been done on the compliance and acceptability of maintaining pedometer diaries for an extensive time frame in community-based interventions targeting minority populations. Methods: Community 'coaches' led participants in a 6-month community-based walking intervention that included wearing pedometers and maintaining pedometer diaries for the study duration. Descriptive statistics and ANOVA tests were used to evaluate compliance rates for maintaining diaries and daily step counts. After the intervention, focus groups were used to explore opinions regarding pedometers. Audiotapes were transcribed and evaluated using systematic content analysis. Results: The 8 coaches and 75 enrolled walking participants were primarily African American (98%) women (94%). Overall, the group (N = 83) submitted 85% of all possible pedometer diaries and recorded 73% of all possible daily step counts. Walking-group members were significantly (P < .01) more compliant if their coach was also compliant. Identified benefits of wearing pedometers and maintaining diaries outnumbered the barriers. Participants were enthusiastic about wearing the pedometers and indicated that the weekly diaries provided a source of motivation. Conclusions: This research suggests pedometer diaries are a viable intervention tool and research method for community-based physical activity interventions targeting African Americans and highlights the need for social support to promote pedometer diary compliance.

AB  - Introduction Few interventions have evaluated the influence of parent health literacy (HL) status on weight-related child outcomes. This study explores how parent HL affects the reach, attendance, and retention of and outcomes in a 3-month multicomponent family-based program to treat childhood obesity (iChoose). Methods This pre-post, quasiexperimental trial occurred in the Dan River Region, a federally designated medically underserved area. iChoose research protocol and intervention strategies were designed using an HL universal precautions approach. We used validated measures, standardized data collection techniques, and generalized linear mixed-effect parametric models to determine the moderation effect of parent HL on outcomes. Results No significant difference in HL scores were found between parents who enrolled their child in the study and those who did not. Of 94 enrolled parents, 34% were low HL, 49% had an annual household income of less than $25,000, and 39% had a high school education or less. Of 101 enrolled children, 60% were black, and the mean age was 9.8 (standard deviation, 1.3) years. Children of parents with both low and high HL attended and were retained at similar rates. Likewise, parent HL status did not significantly influence improvements in effectiveness outcomes (eg, child body mass index [BMI] z scores, parent BMI, diet and physical activity behaviors, quality of life), with the exception of child video game/computer screen time; low HL decreased and high HL increased screen time (coefficient = 0.52, standard error, 0.11, P <.001). Conclusion By incorporating design features that attended to the HL needs of parents, children of parents with low HL engaged in and benefited from a family-based childhood obesity treatment program similar to children of parents with high HL.

AB  - The depiction of alcohol in the media has been a public health concern for decades. Evidence for adverse effects of televised alcohol advertising, however, remains in dispute. Strickland's influential study (1983) contributed a great deal to this debate, though the data in that study were cross-sectional and the question of causation has remained open. The present study elaborated and extended Strickland's work by investigating the prospective relationships between televised alcohol advertising exposure, drinking behavior, and drinking problems among a large, school-based sample of ethnically diverse adolescents. In addition to the variables analyzed by Strickland, the current series of models assessed additional exposure variables and a host of control variables, including an associative memory component reliably found to predict drinking behavior in various populations. The primary goals of the current research were to (1) use prospective methods to clarify conflicting research findings regarding whether exposure to televised alcohol advertising impacts later drinking behavior and problems in adolescents, (2) determine the relative contributions of advertising exposure, peer influences, and implicit memory on drinking and drinking problems, (3) evaluate alternative influences that may account for the effects of alcohol advertising exposure on drinking behavior (e.g., norms), and (4) determine in a younger population whether implicit cognitive processes predict drinking behavior. Data were collected from a sample of 1,097 Southern California adolescent public school students who completed in-class surveys at each of three waves from the 7th through 9th grades. Advertising exposure was assessed several ways, including self-reported exposure to alcohol advertisements, to sports programming, and to various television programs. As a possible confounder of the relationship between advertising exposure and alcohol use, alcohol-consistent memory associations were measured using two word association tests: cue-behavior and outcome behavior association. Several additional covariates, including previous alcohol use and intentions, adult alcohol use, general television watching patterns, sports activity, gender, acculturation, and ethnicity, were also assessed. This work integrated relevant theory from the cognitive psychology, social psychology, advertising, and health behavior literatures to increase general understanding of the mechanisms by which exposure to alcohol advertising may exert effects.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mechanical injury in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) rarely transects the cord completely, even when the injury is classified as complete. These patients can show sub-clinical evidence of spared motor connections, which might be amenable to targeted rehabilitation. Neurophysiological evaluations can complement the clinical evaluation by providing objective data about conduction across the SCI site., CASE DESCRIPTION: A twenty-four year old patient with SCI was admitted to a rehabilitation centre 49 days post traumatic SCI. His injury was categorized as motor and sensory complete (AIS A) with a neurological level of C4. The strength of his triceps bilaterally was recorded 0/5 repeatedly by his therapists during the five-month period post-injury. As a result, no training was provided for these muscles during the rehabilitation program. Neurophysiological Assessment: Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded from his left triceps with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) which confirmed the existence of spared corticospinal connections to this muscle post-injury., INTERVENTION: He completed a series of active-assisted exercises with an EMG-triggered neuromuscular stimulation (NMS) device for his left triceps comprising 20-minutes elbow extension (15 trials), three times per day for 4 weeks., OUTCOME: The strength of his left triceps gradually improved to 2/5., DISCUSSION: Neurophysiological evaluation can be useful in identifying residual function below the level of injury, which can, in turn, be enhanced through appropriate rehabilitation strategies.

AB  - Background: Sleep deprivation, malnutrition and lack of physical activity are contemporary stress related factors present in student population. Recently, magnesium (Mg) supplement therapy has been reported to affect hormonal imbalance and hematology parameters variations observed in intense physical exercise. In this study, we aimed to examine whether magnesium supplement therapy influences hormonal and hematological status of male sedentary students. Method(s): Thirteen healthy male students of Belgrade University, age 22.7+/-0.5 years (mean+/-SD) participated in the study. Exclusion criteria were recreative physical activity more then two times per week. Blood samples were collected before and 4 weeks after supplementation with 2x250 mg of Magnesium 250 mg , Natural Wealth, NBTY Inc. Serum levels of FSH, LH, testosterone, ACTH, and cortisol were measured using Beckman Coulter immunoassays on Access 2 analyzer. Hematological parameters: total red blood cells (RBC), hemoglobin (HB), white blood cells (WBC) and WBC differential, were determined using Beckman Coulter LH750. Statistical significance between corresponding values prior and after Mg supplementation was calculated using the paired Student's t-test and P-value less then 0.05 was considered significant. Result(s): Despite the fact that there was no change in the serum level of ACTH, our trial showed statistically significant (P <0.05) decrease in serum cortisol levels after Mg supplementation. Analysis of pituitary-gonadal axis hormones did not show any significant change. A noteworthy increase in total RBC count (P <0.001) was found, and although the total WBC count was unchanged, statistically significant decrease in percentage of neutrophils (P <0.05), and a trend in lymphocytes percentage increase (P=0.064) were observed. Conclusion(s): The results presented here suggest that chronic oral magnesium supplementation in male sedentary students reduces serum level of stress hormone cortisol and may have a beneficial effect on some hematological parameters.

AB  - Background: Sleep deprivation, malnutrition and lack of physical activity are contemporary stress-related factors present in the student population. Stress activates the HPA and often suppresses the HPG axis, but also influences cytokine synthesis and consequently regulates immune response. Since magnesium deficiency facilitates negative pathophysiological consequences, a reasonable question imposes, wheth er Mg supplementation might correct the adrenal/go nadal hormone balance and immuno-endocrine function. Methods: Fifteen male students were given 2 x 250 mg Mg for four weeks. Serum levels of FSH, LH, testosterone (T), ACTH and cortisol (C) were measured before and after supplementation and the T/C ratio was calculated. Furthermore, IL-6, red blood cells (RBC), hemoglobin (Hb), white blood cells (WBC) and the WBC differential were measured. Results: Despite no change in the serum level of ACTH, a statistically significant (p < 0.05) decrease in the serum cortisol level appeared, accompanied with an IL-6 level reduction (p < 0.05) after Mg supplementation. Analysis of the pituitarygonadal axis hormones showed an increasing trend of the FSH level (p = 0.087), and a significant increase (p < 0.05) in the T/C ratio. An RBC count increase (p < 0.001) was found, along with a decrease in the percentage of neutrophils (p < 0.05), and a trend toward a lymphocyte percentage increase. Conclusions: The results suggest that chronic oral magnesium supplementation in male students improves the balance of pituitary-gonadal and pituitary-adrenal hormones and is involved in the regulation of the basal IL-6 level.

AB  - Background: "Athletic pubalgia," a term that has gained acceptance over "sports hernia," is more common in men than women; however, it represents a significant source of morbidity for patients of both sexes. Inconsistent terminology surrounding this entity poses a diagnostic challenge and makes studying the populations at risk difficult. Purpose(s): To review a case series of women with athletic pubalgia by analyzing their presentations, concomitant pathologies, and surgical outcomes. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Method(s): Between 2013 and 2016, 197 patients were seen and evaluated for the diagnosis of athletic pubalgia. Eighteen patients seen during this time were women. All patients received "pubalgia protocol" magnetic resonance imaging and subsequent surgical intervention for their pathologies. Outcomes among 17 women were assessed with a patient questionnaire >1 year after surgery. Result(s): Of the 17 women, 9 had rectus aponeurotic plate injury only, or pure athletic pubalgia; the remaining 8 had athletic pubalgia in combination with >=1 inguinal, obturator, and femoral hernias. Regarding female patients in both groups, 88.2% reported that the surgery was a success at follow-up. Conclusion(s): Surgical repair of athletic pubalgia among women is successful in dramatically reducing pain levels in this important subset of patients.Copyright © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Primary objective: To demonstrate that actigraphy is an appropriate means of measuring sleep in patients with TBI and to define parameters for its use in this population. Research design: Case series and review of the literature. Methods and procedures: Subjects participating in one of two externally funded studies addressing the role of acupuncture in treating insomnia in TBI underwent actigraphy for the purpose of quantifying sleep time. Cases selected for presentation illustrate challenges in use of this modality in this population. Main outcomes and results: Caution should be exercised in interpreting actigraphy data in patients with TBI and (1) motor impairment or (2) cognitive and behavioural impairments which include agitation and impulsivity. Conclusions: Guidelines for use of actigraphy in patients with TBI are proposed: (1) Patients should be at Rancho Los Amigos cognitive level of III or above; (2) Patients with paresis, significant spasticity or contractures of one or more limbs should have the device placed on the least affected limb; and (3) For patients with tetraparesis, the device may not be an appropriate instrument for measurement of sleep; if it is to be used, consideration should be given to placing it on the head, rather than limbs or torso.

AB  - The aim of this paper was to determine the frequency of occurrence of cardiovascular disease risk factors among the secondary school students in Ciechanow. The study comprised 150 students attending high school, mechanical technical secondary school and a vocational school complex in Ciechanow (province of Mazovia). All the examined students were 17-18 years of age. The study was in the form of an auditory questionnaire. It was conducted in February 2002. To evaluate the state of students' nourishment we used the so-called body mass index (BMI). For the needs of this paper, to examine the amounts of alcohol consumed, the following conversion factor was used: standard portion = 10g pure ethanol. The results were analyzed in accordance with the sex of the examined persons. Among the examined students no cases of obesity or diabetes were found. One third of the polled persons had inherited susceptibility to cardiovascular diseases. 27.3% of the polled secondary school students smoke cigarettes every day (usually 5-10 a day). This fact increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases. The problem of alcohol abuse concerned 6% students, but only every tenth of them declared being a teetotaler. Three fourths of the polled persons regarded the level of their physical activity as moderate. About one third of the examined students accomplish their physical activity exclusively within Physical Education classes. The form of exercise done on their own most frequently was slow and brisk walking. The students usually nourish regularly, eating breakfast, lunch and dinner every day. They eat fruit, cutting down on animal fats and salt. Most of the examined students are exposed to stressful situations, both in their home environment (56.6%) and at school (84.7%). Long-lasting and overlapping stress intensifies the risk of cardiovascular diseases. More than a half of the polled persons ascribe to themselves type A personality features, which makes them more susceptible to coronary heart disease, than type B personality.

AB  - The healthy lifestyle of people around the world has changed dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic. The personality risk factors for these processes from around the world remain understudied. This study aimed to examine the associations of the Big Five traits with a healthy lifestyle during the COVID-19 pandemic. In a cross-sectional study, data from 1215 Russian university students were analyzed. Participants completed the Big Five Inventory-10 and Short Multidimensional Inventory Lifestyle Evaluation. The results showed that personality traits predicted many dimensions of a healthy lifestyle during the COVID-19 pandemic. Diet and nutrition were positively predicted by extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness, and it was negatively predicted by neuroticism. Substance abuse was positively predicted by agreeableness and conscientiousness, and it was negatively predicted by extraversion. Physical activity was positively predicted by extraversion and conscientiousness, and it was negatively predicted by neuroticism. Stress management was positively predicted by extraversion and conscientiousness, and it was negatively predicted by neuroticism. Restorative sleep was positively predicted by extraversion and conscientiousness, and it was negatively predicted by neuroticism. Social support for healthy practices was positively predicted by extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Environmental exposures were positively predicted by extraversion, and neuroticism was positively and negatively predicted by conscientiousness. Our findings may be useful for further exploration of personality risk factors for healthy practices in challenging life circumstances.

AB  - Background and Aims: In our presentation we discuss a rare disorder, saphenous nerve syndrome, a possible cause of chronic lower limb pain and the role of the anesthesiologist in patient care. Method(s): Our patient, a 16-year-old girl, had a low energy, blunt left thigh trauma several months before her admission. We examined her because of allodynia, pain radiating to her inner thigh and flank, which developed weeks after the accident and significantly limited the patient in her daily activites. X-ray and ultrasound examinations did not show any abnormalities. We discussed the possibility of saphenous nerve entrapment but also could not rule out a psychogenic origin. Further diagnostics included ENG and MRI. However, it was a regional technique that provided the ultimate diagnosis: ultrasound guided blockade with 2% lidocaine ceased the patient's long-standing pain immediately. Due to a detectable morphological lesion (MRI showed scar tissue next to the nerve), we decided to perform surgery, we denervated the infrapatellar branch. Through a femoral nerve cannula we ensured that the patient remained pain free for 72 hours postoperatively. Result(s): After cannula removal, the patient's pain did not return any more. The young woman's quality of life greatly improved, and she returned to her former activities, including playing football. Conclusion(s): Saphenous nerve syndrome is a neuropathic disorder, a rare but often remediable cause of chronic thigh and knee pain. Our case is a good example of chronic pain syndromes needing multidisciplinary care. An anesthesiologist proficient in regional analgesic techniques can have a prominent role in both the diagnosis and the treatment.

AB  - Astrocyte-enriched marker, S100B, shows promise for gauging the severity of acute brain trauma, and understanding subconcussive effects will advance its utility in tracking real-time acute brain damage. The aim of the study was to investigate whether serum 5100B elevations were associated with frequency and magnitude of subconcussive head impacts in adolescents. This prospective cohort study of 17 high-school football players consisted of the following 12 time points: pre-season baseline, 5 in-season pre-post games, and post-season. A sensor-installed mouthguard recorded the number of head impacts, peak linear (PLA) and peak rotational (PRA) head accelerations from every practice and game. During the 5 games, players wore chest-strap heart-rate monitors to estimate players' excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC), accounting for physical exertion effects. At each time point, blood samples were obtained and assessed for S1008 and creatine kinase levels to account for astrocyte damage/activation and muscle damage, respectively. Using k-means clustering on the impact data, players were categorized into high- or low-impact group. Two players withdrew during the first month of the study. A total of 156 blood samples from 15 players were assessed for S100B and creatine kinase levels and included in the analysis. A median value of 596 head impacts from 15 players were recorded during all practices and games in a season. S100B levels were significantly elevated in all post-game measures compared with the respective pre-game values (median-increase, 0.022 mu g/L; interquartile-range, 0.011-0.043 mu g/L, p < 0.05 for all games). Greater acute S100B increases were significantly associated with greater impact frequency, sum of PLA and PRA, with negligible contributions from physical exertion and muscle damage effects. The high-impact group exhibited greater increases in serum S100B levels at post-games than the low-impact group (high vs. low, 0.043 +/- 0.035 mu g/L vs. 0.019 +/- 0.017 mu g/L, p = 0.002). The degree of acute S100B increases was correlated with subconcussive head impact exposure, suggesting that acute astrocyte damage may be induced in an impact-dependent manner. Acute changes in serum S100B levels may become a useful tool in monitoring real-time brain damage in sports.

AB  - Purpose Although the decline of physical activity in adolescent girls is well-documented, there are girls whose physical activity does not follow this pattern. This study examined the relationships between physical activity trajectories and personal, psychosocial, and environmental factors among adolescent girls. Methods Participants were from the University of Maryland field site of the Trial of Activity for Adolescent Girls. Of 730 girls measured in 8th grade, 589 were remeasured in 11th grade. Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was assessed by accelerometers; participants were categorized as active maintainers (n = 31), inactive maintainers (n = 410), adopters (n = 64), or relapsers (n = 56). Height and weight were measured, personal and psychosocial information was collected from surveys, and distance from home to school and parks was assessed from Geographical Information Systems. Multivariable logistic regression was used for data analysis. Results Variables at individual, social, and environmental levels predicted active maintainers and inactive maintainers, while only individual-level variables predicted adoption. None predicted relapse. Higher (favorable) scores for physical self-concept, perceived body fat, friend and family physical activity support, frequency of physical activity with friends, and shorter distance from home to a park predicted active maintainers. Overweight/obese status, earlier age at menses, and lower scores for physical self-concept, perceived body fat, friend physical activity support, and frequency of physical activity with friends, and farther distance from home to school predicted inactive maintainers. High physical self-concept and not being overweight/obese predicted adopters. Conclusions Multilevel factors appear to predict behavior maintenance rather than actual change. © 2014 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB  - Since the definition of health by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1948—“a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity”—a growing attention has been dedicated to the relationship between the urban environment and its impact on people’s behaviour and well-being. A vast quantity of research has already been conducted to investigate the effect of BE on physical health, focusing on the importance of physical activity for people’s well-being especially in relation to the prevention or the recovering from increasingly common diseases such as obesity [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], or cardiovascular diseases [3], among all populations (kids, teenagers, adults, and older adults).

AB  - AIMS: Identification of silent cardiovascular diseases by preparticipation evaluation (PPE) and disqualification from competitive sports have the potential to prevent sudden death but may induce adverse psychological consequences, particularly for exercise addicted athletes. We investigated the relationship between exercise addiction, attitude towards PPE and reaction to cardiovascular disease diagnosis. METHOD(S): We invited Italian competitive athletes to participate in an online questionnaire investigating exercise addiction, opinion about mandatory PPE and potential reaction to both sports disqualification and hypothetical diagnosis of different cardiovascular diseases. RESULT(S): The survey was completed by 1011 athletes (75% men, median age 30 years) encompassing a wide range of sports disciplines and competition levels. According to the 'Exercise Dependence Scale-21', 6% were classified as exercise addicted. The vast majority of both exercise addicted and nonexercise addicted athletes agreed that PPE should be mandatory (92 and 96%, P = 0.17) and that the eligibility decision should be left to the sports medicine physician (82 and 89%, P = 0.08). In case a cardiovascular disease is identified, a higher proportion of exercise addicted athletes would undergo 'open-heart' surgery if this would allow resuming high-intensity sport (54 versus 31%, P < 0.001) and would continue exercising in case of diagnosis of a disease at risk of sudden death (57 versus 32%, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION(S): Exercise addiction does not interfere with a general positive opinion about PPE, but is likely to impact on the adherence to medical prescription should a cardiovascular diagnosis be made. Exercise addiction should be taken into account when counselling athletes with newly diagnosed heart diseases.

AB  - Discussion of circumcision's negative impact upon a male's psychosexual development is limited, but Freud (1913) spoke to it. Regarding the trauma associated with the surgery, he wrote that a child's level of understanding of circumcision leads him to "equate it with castration" (p. 153, n1). Interestingly, a clinical-historian's review of Freud's other theoretical writings, letters, and dream accounts suggests that even Freud's own traumatic experience with the circumcision of his brother, Julius, provided the unconscious motivation for his conceptualization of the castration complex and its centrality to human development. Colman (1994) writes, "His [Freud's] writings are replete with emphasis on the importance of the penis and its destiny," and the argument is made that this significant circumcision event provides causal support to his "penis attention" (p. 603). Another psychoanalytic investigation into a 13-year-old boy's abnormal sadomasochistic sexual behavior attributed psychopathology to the overwhelming ego trauma of his circumcision (Kennedy, 1989). However, broad scope psychological research is lacking. CULTURAL DENIALThrough his linguistic studies, Mario Pei (1965) demonstrates language's cultural power in maintaining many ritualized activities over the centuries via its written, spoken, gestural, and symbolic forms. "Language," he writes, "is an all-pervasive conveyor, interpreter and shaper of humankind's social and scientific endeavors" (p. 29). When circumcision, then, is viewed by the culture as a "prophylactic surgical procedure performed by medical personnel as part of standard hospital practice," it creates a narrow framework in which to consider its implications upon the personal life of the boy and man. Boyd (1990) argues for the term "genital mutilation" when speaking about circumcision, as clinical words tend to trivialize and dismiss the depth of emotional and physical implications of foreskin removal. Such a term "is not only scientifically accurate, but also honors the feelings of those who feel they are victims of circumcision" (Boyd, 1990, p. 8). Directly speaking to men, Boyd further writes In 1984, invoking law and judicial case precedent, Brigman labeled "child mutilation through routine neonatal circumcision of males ... as barbarous as female circumcision," and called for it to be acknowledged as the "most widespread form of child abuse in (U.S.) society" (p. 337). In exploring the constitutionality of parental decision-making rights and the child's rights to privacy and protection, he argues that neither physicians nor parents should be safe from government authority to prohibit non-medically warranted circumcision, and suggests a class-action civil rights suit as an effective societal response to "child mutilation." Farrell's (1986) words similarly confront our denial of the trauma of male circumcision by referring to it graphically as when "their penises are taken to the blade of a knife and cut," and underscores "the subconscious lack of caring about men that is displayed" (p. 231).

AB  - Collision sports involve repetitive head acceleration events (HAEs), which may adversely affect the brain's maturation, especially in adolescent athletes whose activities increase vulnerability to concussions. We previously used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to detect abnormal changes in white matter (WM) microstructure (fractional anisotropy, FA; mean diffusivity, MD) over one competition season for high school football athletes (FBA); here we investigate changes of additional DTI metrics (axial diffusivity, AD; radial diffusivity, RD) and their association with HAEs. We hypothesize FBA exhibit WM microstructural deficits over time, and these deficits are expected to correlate with recently experienced HAEs. Sixty-four male high school football athletes (age: 16.0+/-1.0) participated in a longitudinal study over one competition season. All subjects had HAEs recorded during practices and games, and completed three MRI scanning sessions: first about one month before contact practices (Pre), and once in each of the first (In1) and second (In2) 6-week halves of the season. Diffusion-weighted imaging was conducted via spin-echo echo-planar imaging on a 3T GE Signa HDx using a 16-channel brain array. FA, MD, AD, and RD were evaluated using voxel-wise statistics and linear mixed effect analysis. Pearson's partial correlation analyses were performed with HAE records for regions with significant DTI changes across session. Regression models fit changes of regional DTI measures as a function of cumulative peak linear acceleration (PLA, unit: G), after individual application of a range of minimum PLA thresholds. Extending previous observations, voxel-wise statistics detected large clusters of WM tracts in the brain with significantly lower AD at In2, as compared to Pre, whereas RD was significantly higher at both In1 and In2. As the season progressed, we generally observed decreased AD and increased RD, both of which are common in axonal injury. DTI metrics in 14 of 29 WM regions correlated with cumulative PLA, and/or total HAEs, with the most predictive fits typically occurring for individual HAE thresholds of 50-70 G. These findings suggest FBA experienced WM microstructural deficits during one competition season, with deficits associated with at least the upper 25% of HAEs (those exceeding 50 G), making meaningful injury a common event warranting concern.

AB  - Human brains develop across the life span and largely vary in morphology. Adolescent collision-sport athletes undergo repetitive head impacts over years of practices and competitions, and therefore may exhibit a neuroanatomical trajectory different from healthy adolescents in general. However, an unbiased brain atlas targeting these individuals does not exist. Although standardized brain atlases facilitate spatial normalization and voxel-wise analysis at the group level, when the underlying neuroanatomy does not represent the study population, greater biases and errors can be introduced during spatial normalization, confounding subsequent voxel-wise analysis and statistical findings. In this work, targeting early-to-middle adolescent (EMA, ages 13-19) collision-sport athletes, we developed population-specific brain atlases that include templates (T1-weighted and diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging) and semantic labels (cortical and white matter parcellations). Compared to standardized adult or age-appropriate templates, our templates better characterized the neuroanatomy of the EMA collision-sport athletes, reduced biases introduced during spatial normalization, and exhibited higher sensitivity in diffusion tensor imaging analysis. In summary, these results suggest the population-specific brain atlases are more appropriate towards reproducible and meaningful statistical results, which better clarify mechanisms of traumatic brain injury and monitor brain health for EMA collision-sport athletes.

AB  - Human brains develop across the life span and largely vary in morphology. Adolescent collision-sport athletes undergo repetitive head impacts over years of practices and competitions, and therefore may exhibit a neuroanatomical trajectory different from healthy adolescents in general. However, an unbiased brain atlas targeting these individuals does not exist. Although standardized brain atlases facilitate spatial normalization and voxel-wise analysis at the group level, when the underlying neuroanatomy does not represent the study population, greater biases and errors can be introduced during spatial normalization, confounding subsequent voxel-wise analysis and statistical findings.

AB  - 1) Background: The common factors which potentially contribute to the development of eating disorders and exer-cise dependence during early adulthood are still relatively unclear. The present study aimed to examine the role of BMI, body image inflexibility, and generalized anxiety in these two behavioral problems in a sample of college stu-dents.2) Methods: In total, 878 habitual exercisers (58.1% male with BMI = 22.12 +/- 2.39; 41.9% female with BMI = 20.55 +/- 2.21) with age of 20.09 +/- 1.76 years participated in this study. The main outcomes of interest are exercise dependence symptoms, eating disorders symptoms, body image inflexibility, and symptoms of generalized anxiety (as measured by Exercise Dependence Scale-Revised, Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire-Short Form, Body Image Acceptance and Action Questionnaire, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, respectively). Pearson correlation, path analysis, and model fit information were tested.3) Results: After controlling for age, gender, and field of study, lower BMI was linked to more exercise dependence symptoms but this association was not statistically significant, while a greater BMI was significantly associated with a higher risk of developing eating disorders (I3 = -0.08, p < 0.001). Moreover, higher body image inflexibility significantly and positively contributed to severe exercise depen-dence (I3 = 0.26, p < 0.001) as well as abnormal eating attitudes and behaviors (I3 = 0.74, p < 0.001). Furthermore, gen-eralized anxiety is a significant contributor to exercise dependence symptoms (I3 = 0.14, p < 0.001) but not eating disorders symptoms.4) Conclusion: Based on our finding that body image inflexibility is a common risk factor for the development of exercise dependence and eating disorders, the prevention and treatment of these two disor-ders should involve the improvement of psychological flexibility. In addition, the individual with a higher BMI is more vulnerable to developing eating disorders, while those who have severer generalized anxiety symptoms should be given more attention when screening for exercise dependence.

AB  - Objective To examine how a mass-gathering event (the Federation Internationale de Football Association World Cup, 2010, South Africa) impacts trauma and mortality in the pediatric (<=18 years) population. Study design We investigated pediatric emergency visits at Cape Town's 3 largest public trauma centers and 3 private hospital groups, as well as deaths investigated by the 3 city mortuaries. We compared the 31 days of World Cup with equivalent periods from 2007-2009, and with the 2 weeks before and after the event. We also looked at the World Cup period in isolation and compared days with and without games in Cape Town. Results There was significantly decreased pediatric trauma volume during the World Cup, approximately 2/100a000 (37%) fewer injuries per day, compared with 2009 and to both pre- and post-World Cup control periods (P <.001). This decrease occurred within a majority of injury subtypes, but did not change mortality. There were temporal fluctuations in emergency visits corresponding with local match start time, with fewer all-cause emergency visits during the 5 hours surrounding this time (-16.4%, P =.01), followed by a subsequent spike (+26.2%, P =.02). There was an increase in trauma 12 hours following matches (+15.6%, P =.06). Conclusions In Cape Town, during the 2010 Federation Internationale de Football Association World Cup, there were fewer emergency department visits for traumatic injury. Furthermore, there were fewer all-cause pediatric emergency department visits during hometown matches. These results will assist in planning for future mass-gathering events.

AB  - ABSTRACT IN SPANISH: Este artículo presenta los resultados de una investigación centrada en la subjetividad de los jóvenes actores de la violencia en Caracas. En los testimonios de los varones entrevistados se hizo evidente que ellos se definen a sí mismos prioritariamente como hombres, para quienes el respeto constituye un valor fundamental e inextricablemente vinculado a su identidad masculina y a su modo de acción. El respeto deviene un clamor permanente que estos varones erigen en múltiples situaciones, en escenarios diferentes y frente a diversos interlocutores. A partir de esta constatación, este texto plantea entender la demanda de respeto como el modo como se gestionan distintas amenazas a la identidad. Propone vincular cada una de estas amenazas con una demanda particular de respeto bajo la cual los varones invierten estas amenazas y ejercen la acción violenta según distintos sentidos. Cada sentido de la acción violenta permite obtener un dividendo identitario o forma de reconocimiento. En este escenario ser sujeto deviene una búsqueda de respeto cotidiana frente a intensas amenazas a la subjetividad. // ABSTRACT IN ENGLISH: This article presents the results of a study centered on the subjectivity of young actors of violence in Caracas. From testimonies of the young men interviewed, it became evident that they define themselves primarily as men, for whom respect constitutes a fundamental value inextricably linked to their masculine identity and their way of acting. Respect becomes a permanent demand these young men make in multiple situations, different scenarios and facing diverse interlocutors. Based on this verification, the text suggests understanding the demand for respect as a way of managing different threats to their identity. It proposes linking each of these threats to a particular demand for respect through which these young men invert the threats and exercise violent action in different ways. Each violent action allows them to obtain an identity dividend or type of recognition. In this scenario, being a subject becomes a daily search for respect facing intense threats to subjectivity.

AB  - Using a naturalistic methodology, this study explored counselors' and administrators' perceptions of the implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of the Middle and High School Supplemental Counseling Program (MHSSCP) at a predominantly Latino high school. Determining how counselors and administrators define their roles in implementing, monitoring, and assessing MHSSCP should affect the program's effectiveness for at-risk students, for whom the program was designed to support. Three major areas of current literature were reviewed for this study: (a) history of public school counseling, (b) Assembly Bill 1802 and MHSSCP, and (c) leadership roles in MHSSCP. Based on participant interviews, five major themes emerged: (a) counselors and administrators implement the MHSSCP to support the district Initiative to increase student achievement for all students; (b) counselors and administrators evaluate the effectiveness of MHSSCP on three measurable student outcomes; (c) counselors and administrators identify inconsistent use of professional standards in current practice; (d) counselors and administrators exercise teamwork and leadership to create an integrated and directive grade-level service model; and (e) counselors and administrators identify the need to encourage involvement of parents of first-generation students. These themes are presented with supporting evidence from the focus group and individual interviews and are verified through artifacts, descriptive statistics, and field notes. The emergent themes suggest that, as counselors and administrators prepare students for college, they are faced with the challenge of changing a culture that is unfamiliar with how best to support college-bound students. Additionally, with greater emphasis placed on preparing students for college comes the challenge of continuing support for non-college-bound students, which can be addressed by offering courses in career and technical education. Finally, the effort to align counseling programs to state and national standards continues to be slow. The study provides an understanding of how counselors and administrators are caught between meeting established practices and embracing new roles and expectations.

AB  - Russian and Soviet sociology have always paid considerable attention to the study of youth. Interest in the problems of youth first emerged in Russian sociology at the turn of the twentieth century. It was manifested with special clarity, however, in the 1920s through the 1980s, when the research came to include problems of the daily life and material condition of college students; the position of adolescent blue-collar workers employed in production; the domestic life of young families; and the ideals of peasant children. For a long time, however, the study of problems of youth was not well developed in the social sciences, or it would develop in a controlled way as the activity of the Komsomol and other youth organizations of Soviet society (e.g., sports, cultural, and educational organizations). The study of young people became more active in the 1960s and 1970s: (1) in Moscow; (2) in Sverdlovsk; (3) in Leningrad; (4) in Novosibirsk; and (5) in Perm. But by the 1960s these studies had come to be developed as a special area of research. A very important landmark in the establishment of the sociology of youth was the creation of a Sociology Group under the Central Committee of the Komsomol, in December 1964. It is symbolically significant that this was due to the initiative of young scientists. The very fact that a sociology group was created in the structure of the central youth body in Moscow was of enormous significance, because it served as an important precedent for the institutionalization of the science of sociology in the country and for the establishment of a new sector within its structure, the sociology of youth. The group served as a center around which many fans of sociology rallied. This article discusses the current situation which requires a greater focus on the environment of Russian young people and its risks and how it influences behavior. (Contains 32 notes.)

AB  - OBJECTIVES:Accurate recognition of pediatric concussion in the emergency department (ED) is important to ensure appropriate management for safe recovery. The study objective was to determine whether the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Acute Concussion Evaluation (ACE) tools, modified for ED use, improved patient follow-up and post-injury behaviors.METHODS:The original ACE tools (ACE, ACE Care Plan) were modified for ED use via Delphi methodology with an expert panel and implemented in 2 urban pediatric EDs for patients aged 5 to 21 years evaluated within 24 hours of a head injury. Pre- (February 2009 to July 2009) and post- (December 2009 to June 2010) implementation, patient phone surveys were conducted 1, 2, and 4 weeks after ED discharge. Reported rates of patient follow-up and recovery measures were analyzed. ED clinician adherence was assessed.RESULTS:During the study, 164 patients were enrolled pre-implementation and 190 post-implementation. The mean patient age was 10.6 years (SD, 3.7); 65% were males, 49% were African American, and 46% were Caucasian. Post-implementation, 58% of patients received the modified ACE diagnostic tool and 84% received the modified ACE discharge instructions. Follow-up was improved at all time points (32% vs 61% at week 4; P < .001; odds ratio, 3.4; 95% confidence interval, 2.1-5.4). Post-implementation, parental recall of discharge instructions was significantly increased, patient's mean total post-concussion symptom score was significantly higher, and report of return to normal activity was significantly longer.CONCLUSIONS:The ACE tools, modified for ED use, were successfully implemented in the pediatric ED. Post-implementation, increased patient follow-up and improved recall of and adherence to ED discharge recommendations was demonstrated.

AB  - A screening of Bulimia, an eating disorder associated to Obesity and Anorexia Nervosa, has been carried out in the city of Buenos Aires. The data were obtained by means of the questionnaire of Pope & Hudson, administered to young women who attend diet and physical activity programs. Control groups were constituted by female university students and boutique employees. The results indicate that diet and physical fitness searchers are groups at risk of Bulimia. It is concluded that proper preventive measures can be taken by informing and training the personnel, professional or not, in charge of those institutions, and also by promoting the adequate information within the population.

AB  - Object. Up to 16% of children in the US between the ages of 3 and 17 years have either attention deficit-spectrum disorder or a learning disability (LD). Sports-related concussions among youth athletes represent a significant public health concern, and neurocognitive testing is a method to evaluate the severity of cognitive impairment and recovery after a sports-related concussion. The goal of this study was to assess baseline neurocognitive differences between athletes with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and/or LD versus those with neither disorder and to establish normative data for these special populations. Methods. Between August 2007 and March 2012,6636 young athletes underwent baseline neurocognitive testing performed using the Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT) battery. Of these participants, 90 had self-reported LD only, 262 had self-reported ADHD only, and 55 reported both. Those with ADHD and/or LD were matched with 407 participants with no history of ADHD or LD by age, sex, and number of prior concussions. The mean scores and SDs were calculated for each group to obtain normative values. A pairwise comparison between each diagnostic group was done to assess whether LD and/or ADHD diagnostic status predicted participants' baseline neurocognitive scores. Results. Participants with ADHD had significantly lower verbal memory, visual memory, and visual motor processing speed scores, along with significantly higher reaction time, impulse control, and symptom scores compared with those without LD or ADHD. Participants with LD had similar results, with significantly lower verbal memory, visual memory, and visual motor processing speed scores, higher reaction time and symptom score, but did not differ in their impulse control score compared with those without LD or ADHD. Participants with both LD and ADHD had a significantly lower visual motor speed score and a significantly higher reaction time and symptom score than those without LD or ADHD, but did not differ with regard to the other composite scores. Conclusions. Athletes with ADHD and/or LD have lower baseline ImPACT neurocognitive scores compared with athletes without ADHD and LD. Preliminary normative neurocognitive data for these special populations are provided.

AB  - Object. Sport-related concussions (SRCs) among youth athletes represent a significant public health concern. Prior research suggests that females fare worse symptomatically after an SRC. The authors aimed to assess sex differences in number, severity, and resolution of postconcussive symptoms using reliable change index (RCI) methodology applied to days to return to symptom baseline. Methods. Between 2009 and 2011, 740 youth athletes completed valid neurocognitive and symptom testing before and after an SRC using Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT). A total of 122 female and 122 male athletes were matched on number of prior concussions, age, and number of days to first postconcussion test. At baseline and postconcussion, the authors compared each of the individual 22 symptoms on ImPACT to calculate individual symptom severity and aggregate symptom severity, or the Total Symptom Score (TSS). When comparing individual symptoms, the significance level for the comparison of each symptom was set at 0.05/22 = 0.0023. When comparing aggregate symptom severity, or TSS, a single value was compared, requiring an alpha set to 0.05. The number of days to return to baseline TSS was compared using RCI methods set at the 80% confidence interval, equal to a raw score point value of 9.18 on the TSS. Results. At baseline, females reported a greater severity for the symptom, "sleeping less than usual," compared with males (0.88 +/- 1.49 vs 0.31 +/- 0.86, p < 0.001). However, no other individual symptom severity differences were noted before or after SRC. At baseline, females exhibited a statistically significant greater aggregate symptom severity than males (7.24 +/- 10.22 vs 4.10 +/- 6.52, p = 0.005). Greater aggregate symptom severity for females was also found postconcussion (21.38 +/- 19.02 vs 16.80 +/- 17.07, p = 0.049). Females took longer to return to baseline TSS (9.1 +/- 7.1 days vs 7.0 +/- 5.1 days, p = 0.013). Conclusions. The results of this retrospective study indicate that females endorse a greater severity of symptoms at baseline and postconcussion than males without significantly different symptom profiles. Furthermore, after suffering an SRC, females take longer to return to their baseline symptom level.

AB  - Background: The epidemiology of sports-related concussion (SRC) among student-athletes has been extensively researched. However, recent data at the collegiate level are limited. Purpose: To describe the epidemiology of SRC in 25 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) sports. Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods: SRC data from the NCAA Injury Surveillance Program during the 2009-2010 to 2013-2014 academic years were analyzed. Concussion injury rates, rate ratios (RRs), and injury proportion ratios were reported with 95% CIs. National estimates were also calculated to examine linear trends across time. Results: During the study period, 1670 SRCs were reported, representing a national estimate of 10,560 SRCs reported annually. Among the 25 sports, the overall concussion rate was 4.47 per 10,000 athlete-exposures (AEs) (95% CI, 4.25-4.68). Overall, more SRCs occurred in competitions (53.2%). The competition rate (12.81 per 10,000 AEs) was larger than the practice rate (2.57 per 10,000 AEs) (competition vs practice, RR = 4.99; 95% CI, 4.53-5.49). Of all SRCs, 9.0% were recurrent. Most SRCs occurred from player contact (68.0%). The largest concussion rates were in men's wrestling (10.92 per 10,000 AEs; 95% CI, 8.62-13.23), men's ice hockey (7.91 per 10,000 AEs; 95% CI, 6.87-8.95), women's ice hockey (7.50 per 10,000 AEs; 95% CI, 5.91-9.10), and men's football (6.71 per 10,000 AEs; 95% CI, 6.17-7.24). However, men's football had the largest annual estimate of reported SRCs (n = 3417), followed by women's soccer (n = 1113) and women's basketball (n = 998). Among all SRCs, a linear trend did not exist in national estimates across time (P = .17). However, increases were found within specific sports, such as men's football, women's ice hockey, and men's lacrosse. Conclusion: The estimated number of nationally reported SRCs has increased within specific sports. However, it is unknown whether these increases are attributable to increased reporting or frequency of concussions. Many sports report more SRCs in practice than in competition, although competition rates are higher. Men's wrestling and men's and women's ice hockey have the highest reported concussion rates. Men's football had the highest annual national estimate of reported SRCs, although the annual participation count was also the highest. Future research should continue to longitudinally examine SRC incidence while considering differences by sex, division, and level of competition.

AB  - OBJECTIVE Sport-related concussion (SRC) has emerged as a public health problem, especially among studentathletes. Whereas most concussions resolve by 2 weeks, a minority of patients experience postconcussion syndrome (PCS), in which symptoms persist for months. The objective of this study was to elucidate factors predictive of PCS among a sample of National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) student-athletes in the academic years 2009-2010 to 2014-2015. METHODS The SRC data originated from the NCAA Injury Surveillance Program (ISP) in the 2009-2010 to 2014-2015 academic seasons. The NCAA ISP is a prospective database made up of a convenience sample of schools across all divisions. All SRCs are reported by certified athletic trainers. The PCS group consisted of concussed student-athletes with concussion-related symptoms that lasted >= 4 weeks. The non-PCS group consisted of concussed student-athletes with symptom resolution in <= 2 weeks. Those with symptoms that resolved in the intermediate area of 2-4 weeks were excluded. Odds ratios (ORs) were estimated using logistic regression. RESULTS During the 2009-2010 to 2014-2015 seasons, 1507 NCAA student-athletes sustained an SRC, 112 (7.4%) of whom developed PCS (i.e., concussion-related symptoms that lasted >= 4 weeks). Men's ice hockey contributed the largest proportion of concussions to the PCS group (28.6%), whereas men's football contributed the largest proportion of concussions in the non-PCS group (38.6%). In multivariate analysis, recurrent concussion was associated with increased odds of PCS (OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.28-3.36). Concussion symptoms that were also associated with increased odds of PCS included retrograde amnesia (OR 2.75, 95% CI 1.34-5.64), difficulty concentrating (OR 2.35, 95% CI 1.23-4.50), sensitivity to light (OR 1.97, 95% CI 1.09-3.57), and insomnia (OR 2.19, 95% CI 1.30-3.68). Contact level, sex, and loss of consciousness were not associated with PCS. CONCLUSIONS Postconcussion syndrome represents one of the most impactful sequelae of SRC. In this study of exclusively collegiate student-athletes, the authors found that recurrent concussions and various concussion-related symptoms were associated with PCS. The identification of initial risk factors for the development of PCS may assist sports medicine clinicians in providing timely interventions and treatments to prevent morbidity and shorten recovery time after SRC.

AB  - OBJECTIVE Arachnoid cysts (ACs) are congenital lesions bordered by an arachnoid membrane. Researchers have postulated that individuals with an AC demonstrate a higher rate of structural brain injury after trauma. Given the potential neurological consequences of a structural brain injury requiring neurosurgical intervention, the authors sought to perform a systematic review of sport-related structural-brain injury associated with ACs with a corresponding quantitative analysis. METHODS Titles and abstracts were searched systematically across the following databases: PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. The review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Peer-reviewed case reports, case series, or observational studies that reported a structural brain injury due to a sport or recreational activity (hereafter referred to as sport-related) with an associated AC were included. Patients were excluded if they did not have an AC, suffered a concussion without structural brain injury, or sustained the injury during a non-sport-related activity (e.g., fall, motor vehicle collision). Descriptive statistical analysis and time to presentation data were summarized. Univariate logistic regression models to assess predictors of neurological deficit, open craniotomy, and cystoperitoneal shunt were completed. RESULTS After an initial search of 994 original articles, 52 studies were found that reported 65 cases of sport-related structural brain injury associated with an AC. The median age at presentation was 16 years (range 4-75 years). Headache was the most common presenting symptom (98%), followed by nausea and vomiting in 49%. Thirteen patients (21%) presented with a neurological deficit, most commonly hemiparesis. Open craniotomy was the most common form of treatment (49%). Bur holes and cyst fenestration were performed in 29 (45%) and 31 (48%) patients, respectively. Seven patients (11%) received a cystoperitoneal shunt. Four cases reported medical management only without any surgical intervention. No significant predictors were found for neurological deficit or open craniotomy. In the univariate model predicting the need for a cystoperitoneal shunt, the odds of receiving a shunt decreased as age increased (p = 0.004, OR 0.62 [95% CI 0.45-0.86]) and with male sex (p = 0.036, OR 0.15 [95% CI 0.03-0.88]). CONCLUSIONS This systematic review yielded 65 cases of sport-related structural brain injury associated with ACs. The majority of patients presented with chronic symptoms, and recovery was reported generally to be good. Although the review is subject to publication bias, the authors do not find at present that there is contraindication for patients with an AC to participate in sports, although parents and children should be counseled appropriately. Further studies are necessary to better evaluate AC characteristics that could pose a higher risk of adverse events after trauma.

AB  - OBJECTIVE. A significant proportion of patients experience long-term symptoms after sport-related concussion (SRC), and several factors have been associated with this protracted recovery. Limited data exist on the role of socioeconomic status (SES) on SRC outcomes. The objective in this study was to conduct a preliminary investigation to determine the effect of SES on outcomes after SRC in student-athletes treated at a regional sports concussion center. METHODS. A retrospective cohort study of 282 middle school, high school, and collegiate student-athletes was conducted. An attempt was made to contact all patients seen at a comprehensive SRC center between January 2012 and May 2015 for, in-depth interviews. Subsequent demographic data were collected. The SES was defined as follows: cost of living percentile, median income percentile, percentage of college graduates, percentage of homeowners, county type, and insurance status. Outcomes after SRC were defined as follows: days of symptom duration, days of missed school, and days of missed practice. Statistically controlled covariates included sex, race, age, body mass index, concussion history, neuropsychiatric history, and type of sport. RESULTS. A total of 282 student-athletes consented and were studied. The median age was 15.8 years (range 11.6-22.2 years) and 61.4% of student-athletes were male. A previous concussion was incurred by 34.0% of student-athletes. Football was the most common sport (32.3%), followed by soccer (16.3%), and basketball (15.6%). The median symptom duration was 21 days (range 1-365 days); the median missed school days was 2 (range 0-90 days); and median for days of missed practice was 10 (range 0-150 days). After multivariate Cox regression analysis, no relationship between any of the 6 SES variables and symptom duration or missed practice was seen. However, individuals with private insurance had more missed days of school than those with public insurance (hazard ratio 0.46, 95% CI 0.26-0.83, p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS. In a preliminary study of middle school, high school, and collegiate student-athletes,. SES had no impact on the outcomes of symptom duration and missed practice. However, for individuals with private insurance, the return to school was slower than for those with public insurance. This pilot study reveals the complex relationship between SES and SRC recovery, which demands further study with more accurate and validated assessments of SES.

AB  - Purpose of ReviewSport-related concussion (SRC) and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) have been thrust into the national spotlight, with youth athletes bearing the burden of this public health problem. The current review aims to provide a practical summary of pediatric SRC, including key terminology, return to play/school, and risk factors for post-concussion syndrome (PCS).Recent FindingsWhile the majority of youth athletes recover within 2 to 4weeks, approximately 10% of athletes experience a protracted recovery with symptoms lasting months, impacting social, scholastic, and sporting activities.SummaryIn the pediatric population, the strongest predictors of PCS are initial symptom burden and prior concussion, with mixed results behind the factors of gender, headaches, and learning disability. The role of psychiatric, family history, sports, and socioeconomic factors remain in their infancy.

AB  - Objectives: To assess the association between team sport participation and behavioral, psychological, and social health outcomes in young athletes. Method(s): A systematic review and meta-analysis were undertaken to identify studies published between 01/01/1950-05/01/2020 investigating the association between team sport participation and health outcomes in young athletes (<25 years). Included studies compared team sport participants to controls or themselves, assessed health outcomes, and had a sample size >50. Prospective and retrospective studies were included; non-primary literature was excluded. Health outcomes were categorized as: 1) behavioral, 2) psychological, or 3) social. Data were extracted to form 2 x 2 tables for each study to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Result(s): Of 371 queried articles, 34 studies from 10 countries across 4 continents were included, with 9 reporting homogenous outcomes for meta-analysis. Behavioral: Fifteen studies evaluated behavioral health outcomes of alcohol and/or drug use, fitness, and diet. Quantitatively, team sport participation was found to decrease rates of cigarette/tobacco use across 5 studies (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.69-0.76) and alcohol/drug use across 7 studies (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.69-0.77). Qualitatively, 12/15 (80%) of studies confirmed improved behavioral health outcomes with team sport participation. Psychological: Nineteen studies evaluated psychological health outcomes including anorexia, anxiety, depression, self-esteem, and suicidal ideation. Quantitatively, team sport participation was associated with decreased depression/anxiety rates across 5 studies (OR 0.59, 95%CI 0.54-0.64). Qualitatively, 14/19 (74%) of studies confirmed improved psychological health. Social: Ten studies evaluated social health outcomes including academic performance, commitment, psychosocial health, social behavior/identity, and delinquency/high-risk activity. Qualitatively, 7/10 (70%) of studies confirmed improved social health outcomes with team sport participation. Conclusion(s): Team sport participation was associated with decreased odds of smoking/tobacco use, alcohol/drug use, and depression/anxiety. Though few studies mentioned potential negative effects of team sport participation, the majority reported improved behavioral, psychological, and social health outcomes in youth athletes worldwide.Copyright © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Introduction: A large number of meta-analyses indicate that methylphenidate, amphetamines, and atomoxetine are effective drug and, combined with psychosocial intervention, should be considered as potential first treatments for children and adolescents with ADHD. Nevertheless, the safety of ADHD medications is not fully known: concerns have arisen about the lack of contemporary-standard information for medications originally licensed several decades ago, as well for signals of possible harm arising from more recently developed medications. Method(s): The guidelines group of the European Network for Hyperkinetic Disorders (EUNETHYDIS) reviewed the available literature on the ADHD medication licensed in Europe about cardiovascular, neurological (sleep, epilepsy and tics), growth and psychiatric (irritability, suicidal ideation, psychosis) side effects, and on the risk of abuse, misuse and drug diversion. Frequency, possible causal mechanisms, mediating factors and managing strategies were analyzed for specific adverse events. Result(s): Some of the effects examined appeared to be minimal in impact or difficult to distinguish from risk to untreated populations. Several areas require further study to allow a more precise understanding of the medication risks. This allowed the group to develop specific recommendation for screening before prescription and precaution during treatment. Before prescription heart rate and blood pressure (plotted on a percentile chart), history of exercise syncope, undue breathlessness and other cardiovascular symptoms as well as the family history of cardiac disease should be assessed: in the presence of specific risks a frank discussion of these aspects between the family, ADHD specialist and paediatric cardiologist should help to refine the acceptability for the individual patient. During treatment height, weight, blood pressure and heart rate should be monitored regularly and compared to age-matched norms. All patients should be carefully screened before treatment, and regularly monitored during treatment, for psychiatric disorders such as depression, suicidal thoughts, hostility, psychosis, mania and the risk for substance misuse and drug diversion. Common symptoms such as headache, insomnia, anorexia, nausea and any specific problems emerging in the individual patient should also be monitored. Medications (atomoxetine in particular) should be discontinued in patients with jaundice or laboratory evidence of liver injury and should not be restarted. Discussion/conclusion: With a caveat for the several areas of uncertainty, the impact of risk of ADHD treatment, and the balance of that risk against possible benefits of treatment is favourable in most cases: accurate screening before starting medications and monitoring during treatment is always strongly recommended.

AB  - Clavicle fracture is a common injury, and can be classified into middle third, medial third, and distal third fractures. Only 10-15% of clavicle fracture occur in the distal third segment. Neer classified the distal clavicle fracture into five types ; type II and V are unstable and requiring fixation . Various common methods of stabilizations are introduced such as K-wiring , tension band fixation , plate fixation, osteosynthesis with hook plate and coracoclavicular screw however all those operative methods have their own advantages and disadvantages. Material(s) and Method(s): We presented a case of 21 years old male with left shoulder pain after motor vehicle accident. Examination revealed tenderness on his left shoulder, and radiograph showed fracture of distal end left clavicle Neer type II, requiring fixation. He was counselled for lateral extension clavicle locking plate but unable to pay due to financial constraint. Result(s): The patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation using Kirschner wire with tension band fixation . The fracture site was visualized and the hematoma was curetted and washed. The fracture was reduced and fixed with two 1.4 mm trans-acromial Krischner wires and the reduction was checked with an image intensifier. Then the TBW is applied using stainless steel wire size 1.0 . The K-wires are bent beneath the skin. Sling immobilization is used for 2 weeks after the operation. Unrestricted tolerable shoulder motion is permitted. Stretched and exertional exercise is allowed after radiography shows osseous union and the implants are removed. Discussions : TBW is widely employed to treat limb fractures, such as patella and olecranon fracture but seldom used for distal clavicle nowadays. The advantages of TBW are higher antirotation and antibending force compared with that in K-wire fixation and lower profile compared with the bone plate, which reduces tendon irritation and prominent implant. The use of K-wires and TBW also required only the exposure of the fracture site. The soft tissue around the clavicle incurred little damage, leading to a lower infection rate. In addition, the use of K-wires and TBWs can provide a more rigid fixation than K-wires only. Rigid fixation with little complication contributes to good results . Conclusion(s): Surgical management is recommended for unstable distal clavicle fracture. TBW can be preferred because of the simplicity of the procedure, low cost, simple hardware, high union rate and easy availability of the implant.

AB  - Nurses caring for adolescent consumers with anorexia nervosa in the inpatient setting are challenged in a unique way, in that they are caring for people with whom they do not have a mutually held concept of well-being. Their efforts to ensure weight gain are frequently against the wishes of the consumer. This dissonance results in challenging interactions, where nursing care and authority may be undermined. This study investigated the dynamics of nurses' authority within this context. Interviews with nurses (n = 10) were conducted and analysed through thematic analysis. Nurses reported that consumers, compelled by the psychopathology of anorexia nervosa, often sought to challenge or undermine their authority. Some nurses experienced the opposition and conflict as demoralizing, whereas others were able to maintain confidence in the therapeutic merit of their care. Younger, inexperienced nurses in this study were particularly vulnerable to interactions that mitigated their authority, due to their tendency to engage in friend-like relationships. Nurses caring for adolescents with anorexia nervosa should be prepared to be confronted by interactions that overtly and surreptitiously undermine their capacity to exercise professional authority. It is important that nurses recognize the importance of maintaining their authority, and how it can be threatened in subtle and unexpected ways.

AB  - Obesity is a civilization disease and the proportion of people suffering from it continues to grow, especially in the developed countries. Number of obese people in Europe has increased threefold over the last 20 years. The paradox of obesity and poverty relationship is observed especially in the developed and developing countries. In developing countries, along with economic development and income growth, the number of people with overweight and obesity is increasing.This paradox has a relationship with both the easy availability and low cost of highly processed foods containing 'empty calories' and no nutritional value. To date, this paradox has been described in the United States and the United Kingdom, although many European countries are also experiencing high percentages of obese people. Among the reasons for the growing obesity in the population of poor people are: higher unemployment, lower education level, and irregular meals. Another cause of obesity is low physical activity, which among the poor is associated with a lack of money for sports equipment. Due to the large rate of deaths caused by diseases directly linked to obesity, the governments of many countries implement prevention programmes of overweight and obesity. These programmes are based primarily on educating the public about a healthy lifestyle based on healthy eating, daily physical activity and avoiding alcohol and cigarettes.

AB  - There is a considerable cultural pressure towards a slim body silhouette. Girls and young woman whose professional carrier depends on their low body weight and sharp looking posture are especially vulnerable to such trends. This problem is especially acute in girls attending to ballet schools, professional dancers and in some sportswoman who are expected to move with charm and appear unnaturally slim, usually being the result of special nutrition. The aim of this study was the evaluation of the nutritional habits of ballet school students and to compare the results with the current nutritional norms. 14 girls, ballet dancers, participated in this study. Before the study their body high (BH) and body mass (BM) were measured for the calculation of BMI (Body Mass Index). The girls were asked to make notes, during 10 days, on the amount and kind of food they consumed. The energy and amounts of selected nutrients were calculated by the computer program Food 3. The results show the deficiency in fats, fibre, minerals like K, Ca, Fe, Mg and some vitamins B1 and PP. Improper diet, deficient in several basics nutrients may results in incorrect physical development of attendees of ballet schools.

AB  - In the 1920s women appeared in French style attire on the streets. In the 1930s, women were prohibited to appear unveiled. In the 1950s, to appear unveiled became a choice and education was co-ed. In the 1960s and 1970s, some women worked with men, drove cars and sported mini-skirts. In the 1980s, some women danced in clubs, some worked in factories and the dowry was outlawed. In the 1990s, women were forced to take refuge in the veil from rival ethnic attacks. Thousands of women were abused and raped. For their 'protection', in the late 1990s, the Taliban outlawed the public appearance of women and prohibited them from participation in every aspect of public life. In 2003, female students again may appear unveiled on the university campus, but remain veiled out of campus for security concerns. Over all of these years, gender policies have swung like a pendulum, oscillating between the moderate and the extreme. Furthermore, all of the above were taking place in Kabul only-other conditions prevailed elsewhere in Afghanistan. Reprinted by permission of Carfax Publishing, Taylor & Francis Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: To explore the relationship between perceived satisfaction with life and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in a state-wide sample of 13-18-year-old adolescents (n = 4914) in South Carolina, USA. Methods: Questions were added to the self-report Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) asking about perceived life satisfaction in six domains (self, family, friends, living environment, school, and overall) and HRQOL (self-rated health; and the number of poor physical health days, poor mental days, and activity limitation days during the past 30 days). Results: Adjusted logistic regression analyses and multivariate models constructed separately revealed that self-rated health, poor physical days (past 30 days), poor mental health days (past 30 days), and activity limitation days (past 30 days) were significantly related (p < 0.05) to reduced life satisfaction, regardless of race or gender. Moreover, as the number of reported poor health days increased, the greater the odds of reporting life dissatisfaction. Conclusions: This is the first study to document the relationship between poor physical health and perceived life satisfaction. This adds to the mounting evidence that life satisfaction is related to a variety of adolescent health behaviors and that life satisfaction may add additional information in longitudinal databases that track adolescent health because it appears to be related to HRQOL.

AB  - Little research has examined the association between life satisfaction, self-rated health (SRH), and physical activity concurrently for middle school students. A convenience sample of 245 students in grades 7 and 8 was surveyed about physical activity, life satisfaction, and SRH using the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2005 Middle School Youth Risk Behavior Survey. ANOVA analyses revealed significantly reduced life satisfaction for females who reported not engaging in vigorous physical activity during the past 7 days [p < .01, effect size (ES) = .75]. Significantly reduced life satisfaction was detected for both males (p < .001, ES = .66) and females (p < .0001, ES = .80) who reported not playing on sports teams. Additionally, logistic regression analyses showed the odds of reporting fair/poor SRH increased 5.4 times for males (CI = 1.30–22.39, p < .05) and 30.9 times for females (CI = 3.74–255.43, p < .001) who reported not playing on sports teams. Preliminary findings suggest physical activity and sports participation is associated with improved life satisfaction and SRH for middle school students. In addition, although some gender differences were observed, consistent findings for sports participation suggest sports participation may carry multiple social, mental, and physical benefits for youth.

AB  - Objectives. We examined the health-related quality of life of residents in mountaintop mining counties of Appalachia using the 2006 national Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Methods. Dependent variables included self-rated health; the number of poor physical, poor mental, and activity limitation days (in the past 30 days); and the Healthy Days Index. Independent variables included metropolitan status, primary care physician supply, and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System behavioral and demographic variables. We compared dependent variables across 3 categories: mountaintop mining (yes or no), other coal mining (yes or no), and a referent nonmining group. We used SUDAAN MULTILOG and multiple linear regression models with post hoc least squares means to test mountaintop mining effects after adjusting for covariates. Results. Residents of mountaintop mining counties reported significantly more days of poor physical, mental, and activity limitation and poorer self-rated health (P<.01) compared with the other county groupings. Results were generally consistent in separate analyses by gender and age. Conclusions. Mountaintop mining areas are associated with the greatest reductions in health-related quality of life even when compared with counties with other forms of coal mining.

AB  - This dissertation is an ethnography that investigates how Chicago-based artists and organizations use hip-hop performance as a tool for grassroots education and communal dissent. By exploring these local artistic approaches, this research reveals the salience of hip-hop performance in cultivating social movements, embodied politics, and choreographic repertoires that respond to youth-of-color criminalization and police brutality. Chicago’s racial and economic segregation, history of police misconduct, and concentrated poverty continues to render the mobility of, namely, Black people precarious. Each chapter reads these forms of curtailed and regulated movement against hip-hop’s kinesthetic practices—whether animated through slam poets’ physicality, the sonic imaginaries of freestyling, or through rap’s activist ethos. In doing so, it asks: How does hip-hop’s liberating employment of the body—its insurgent kinesis—operate within and around regimes of power that seek to contain, curtail, and foreclose personal freedom? I explore this question in my ethnographic research in two specific sites: (1) Kuumba Lynx (KL), a hip-hop community arts organization in Chicago’s Uptown neighborhood where I’ve spent five years collaborating with instructors and students to better understand their artistic praxis, and (2) Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center (JTDC), a five-story detention center for incarcerated adolescents, where I have taught digital music production since 2014. My participant observation and interview data, combined with a detailed analysis of a local gangster rap subgenre called “drill music,” spotlight how my interlocutors use performance to carve out spaces of liberation from within constricting environments—that is, how they get free. Chapter one details how KL uses stylized movement, grassroots theater, and political education to interpret and critique the inequalities their students face. Through partnerships with local activist groups, students learn to safely comport themselves during police searches, often using artistic exercises to “rehearse” these interactions. Chapter two spotlights how JTDC residents,’ in lieu of material freedom, use rap music to traverse the center’s immobilizing setting and extend their voices beyond its walls. Finally, chapter three analyzes how drill rappers residing in the South Side’s restricting geography use social media to reach audiences outside of their neighborhoods. Their complex gang-oriented performances in music videos comprise movement vocabularies that communicate kinship, belonging, and mourning, while also propagating “Chiraq,” a moniker for Chicago that equates the city to a militarized zone of violence. Together, these chapters rethink hip-hop’s impact on Chicago’s youth of color as they embody, reimagine, and negotiate their freedom in the age of mass incarceration and amid shifting national conversations around race.

AB  - Unique musculoskeletal conditions can occur while the body is growing, and they need to be recognized and addressed appropriately. In addition, a with the increased emphasis in youth sports and female involvement with athletic activities, there comes a higher risk/frequency of orthopedic injuries (1). This chapter will focus on several of the more common musculoskeletal concerns of the young female athlete and how best to go about preventing and treating these orthopedic issues. After completing this chapter, you should have an understanding of the following: the important changes from prepubescence to postpubescence in females as far as anatomy and physiology of the musculoskeletal system is concerned; the pertinent differences and similarities between young females and males in terms of anatomy, physiology, and biomechanics of the musculoskeletal system; the occurrence of various common musculoskeletal injuries more unique to young female athletes, especially during the adolescent growth spurt; several measures for prevention of athletic injuries from occurring in preadolescent and adolescent females; and, different methods of orthopedic treatment for musculoskeletal injuries incurred by young female athletes--including specific recommendations for a regular conditioning program once healing is complete.

AB  - For the past several years, child advocates, parents, and educators have expressed concern over the sexualization of girls. Has the cultural sexual objectification of girls and women increased? Are younger and younger girls sold a 'sexed-up' version of femininity, and are adult women sold a girlish sexuality? The Sexualization of Girls and Girlhood: Causes, Consequences, and Resistance includes the best empirical research, theory, and practice stemming from the report of the American Psychological Association's Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls. Contributors discuss evidence for this phenomenon from media and marketing, to interpersonal interaction, to girls' own efforts to fashion themselves after sexualized role models around them. A variety of consequences of the sexualization of girls and girlhood—for girls themselves, for others, and for society at large—are presented. Individual chapters cover topics such as athletics as a solution and problem for the sexualization of girls, sexual harassment by peers, gendered violence, body image, adolescent girls' sexual development, and healthy sexuality for girls and young women. Importantly, positive alternatives and suggestions are included so that those who care for girls can address this troubling cultural trend and help counter the significant risk to girls' well-being that it represents. This volume is a valuable resource for child advocates, parents, and educators and useful for undergraduate and graduate courses that address gender across disciplines such as psychology, sociology, anthropology, education, communication, media studies, and women’s and sexuality studies.

AB  - The main aim of the article is to assess the role physical activity plays in a child's social development. According to Bandura's theory (1986; 1989), social development has a close connection with physical development, which is under the influence of physical activity. We focused on studying the child in late childhood as they enter the school system and when at the same time organised physical activities mean intensive social development. It was found that physical activity plays an important role in social development. Physical education at school and organised free time physical activities have an important influence on overall social development, especially in the formation of a child's gender role, physical and general self-confidence, independence from their parents and in the formation of a child's position within peer groups. The paper concludes that physical activity has a significant influence in the process of a child's socialization and, therefore, it must considered when setting up educational, school and sport programs for children.

AB  - The study aims to analyse the role of sports and physical activity in the leisure time of the youth. The first, theoretical part of the paper discusses the existing concepts of leisure time, while the second part presents the results of research of a sample of 82 secondary school pupils from the municipality of Koper. The data were collected through a survey questionnaire using the method of guided structured interviews. For calculations the SPSS statistical programme 14.0 for Windows was used. It was found that during the week young people have at least one hour (95.4%) and during the week-end at least two hours of leisure time a day (90.8%), most often spent in the company of friends and/or listening to music. Physical and sports activities occupy only the sixth place on the scale of the most popular free-time activities, and the most frequent among them are non-organised physical activities, especially walking on week-ends (69%, an average of 1.08 hours a day). The main reason for non-participation in organised forms of leisure-time sports activities is reported to be sports programmmes' poor adaptation to the needs of the youth and their being too demanding. Physical activity, more specifically participation in organised leisure-time physical activity, does not seem to feature among young people's most popular ways of spending their leisure time.

AB  - Childhood cancer survivors (CCS) are at risk of reduced bone health and premature osteoporosis. As physical activity with high impact loading (IL-PA) is known to promote bone health, we compared bone densitometry and microstructure between groups of CCS who performed different amounts of physical activities in their daily life. We used baseline data of a single-center PA trial including 161 CCS from the Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry, aged <16 at diagnosis, >= 16 at study and >= 5 years since diagnosis. Lower body bone health was assessed with peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Daily IL-PA (duration in activities >2 g acceleration and numbers of vertical impacts/hr >2 g) was captured using hip-worn accelerometers (1-3 weeks). For both IL-PA approaches, we formed low, middle and high activity groups based on tertiles. Bone health of the high and middle active groups was compared to the low active group. 63% of CCS had indication of at least one bone mineral density z-score <= -1 measured by pQCT or DXA. The high IL-PA group performing 2.8 min/day or 19.1 impact peaks/hr > 2 g (median) showed about 3-13% better microstructural and densitometric bone health as compared to the low IL-PA group with 0.38 min/day or 0.85 peaks/hr > 2 g. Just a few minutes and repetitions of high IL-PA as easily modifiable lifestyle factor may be sufficient to improve bone health in adult CCS. Future longitudinal research is needed to better understand pattern and dosage of minimal impact loading needed to strengthen bone in growing and adult CCS.

AB  - Background African-American (AA) and Hispanic/Latina (HL) females have higher obesity prevalence than do non-Hispanic Whites (NHW); this may be due to AA and HL consuming more energy-dense foods in response to stressors. Objectives This study examined racial/ethnic differences in dietary intake under controlled conditions (relaxation and stress) in a diverse sample of adolescent females. Methods Participants included 120 adolescent females (30% AA, 37% HL and 33% NHW) who participated in a laboratory food intake study. Using a randomized cross-over design, ad libitum food consumption was measured following control/relaxation and social-evaluative stress conditions. Food intake was indexed as consumed calories, added sugars and solid fats. Results The effect of laboratory conditions on food intake varied by race/ethnicity, such that AA consumed more energy following relaxation than following stress. For NHW and HL, food intake did not differ between conditions. Conclusions To the best of our knowledge, these findings are the first to directly observe racial/ethnic differences in food intake in response to acute stress, which may contribute to obesity-related health disparities.

AB  - Objective: Although the annual number of traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) reported in the US exceeds two million, data suggests that this is an underestimate. The goal of this study was to understand lifetime TBI incidence among a sample of college students. Additionally, this study examined whether a single yes/no question regarding TBI history was sufficient to gather accurate information about TBI incidence in college students. Design: Participants were asked a single TBI question and administered the BAT-LQ. Main Measures: The BAT-LQ is a screening tool designed to assess for probable lifetime TBIs. Results: Data from 121 participants were analyzed for this study. On the single-question, 24.8% of participants reported experiencing a TBI. However, upon further prompting, 76.8% of all participants reported experiencing a blow to the head accompanied by at least one diagnostic symptom of a TBI, suggesting a probable TBI based on best-practice diagnosis guidelines. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that increased education about TBI is warranted to ensure that individuals receive care for probable TBIs, as many individuals likely lack knowledge about what constitutes a TBI diagnosis. Additionally, the results suggest that a single question may not be sufficient to capture true lifetime TBI incidence.

AB  - Disordered eating patterns have become a significant public health issue on college campuses, especially within the female athlete population. Rates for eating disorders have been recorded as high as 20% in several collegiate samples (Alexander, 1998; Wilmore, 1991; Hesse-Biber, 1989). The current study examines the effects of athletic team stressors (competitive level, coaching style, and gymnastic-related stress) on general distress levels and disordered eating patterns. It was hypothesized that level of competition, sport-related stress, and coaching style would positively affect both distress and disordered eating patterns. Secondly, it was proposed that team cohesion would decrease the level of distress, while increasing the probability of disordered eating behavior. Finally, the effects of team cohesion were explored in order to determine whether cohesion buffered or amplified the effects of the stressors on disordered eating. The models evaluated in the current study were assessed using a triangulated research design, comprised of a survey, individual interviews, participant observation, and observations. The sample consisted of 120 female collegiate gymnasts, from eight different colleges and universities, collected during the 2001-2002 competitive season. Overall results indicate that team cohesion decreases the level of general distress the gymnasts reported, while an egoistic coaching style increases distress levels. In addition, cohesion amplifies the effects of competitive level on distress. Egoistic coaching, distress, and team cohesion each had main effects on disordered eating. The most remarkable finding is that egoistic coaching, paired with a highly cohesive team, increases the likelihood of disordered eating. This discovery reveals that cohesion does not buffer but instead amplifies the effects of team dynamics on disordered eating--challenging the traditional social support model.

AB  - Background: Participating in sports is a great way to gain physical, psychological, and social benefits. However, it also carries the risk of injury. Soccer is one of the most popular sports worldwide, and in recent years, there have been concerns about potential vulnerabilities to head injuries. Objectives: To investigate soccer-related head injuries (SRHIs), using data from the electronic Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program (eCHIRPP) surveillance system. Specifically, we aim to compare characteristics of SRHI cases to all head injury cases within the eCHIRPP database. Methods: Descriptive analyses of emergency department (ED) injury surveillance data (2011 to 2017) for individuals aged 5 to 29 years from all participating eCHIRPP sites. Computation of proportionate injury ratios (PIR) comparing SRHIs to all head injuries reported to eCHIRPP, and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: A total of 3,970 SRHIs were reported to eCHIRPP. Injuries were from contact with another player, the ball, ground, goal-post, and other causes. Of the injuries caused by contact with the ball, 9% were from purposely directing the ball with the head (heading). A higher proportion of concussions (PIR=1.32, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.27 to 1.37) and minor closed head injuries (PIR=1.20, 95% CI: 1.15 to 1.26) were observed in soccer players. Higher proportions of head injuries occurred in organized soccer and soccer played outdoors. However, admission to the ED for a SRHI was rare (PIR=0.40, 95% CI: 0.30 to 0.55). Conclusions: Overall, elevated proportions of brain injuries were observed among soccer players, however, these injuries were unlikely to result in a hospital admission. Moreover, purposely heading the ball contributed to few ED visits.

AB  - Religiousness is known to be specifically associated with substance abuse, but there is an evident lack of studies investigating the association between religiousness and doping behavior as a specific type of substance abuse in athletes. This study aimed to provide evidence for possible gender- and sport-specific associations between religiousness and doping behavior among team-sport athletes of both genders. The participants were 886 athletes (21.9 ± 3.8 years of age; 352 females) involved in four sports: volleyball (n = 154; 78 females), handball (n = 206; 68 females), soccer (n = 316; 110 females) and basketball (n = 230; 96 females) from Croatia and Slovenia (all traditionally Roman Catholics). The data were collected using a previously validated structured questionnaire that examined sociodemographic, sport- and doping-related factors. In addition, religiousness was captured by the Santa Clara Strength of Religious Faith questionnaire (SCSRF). Gender-stratified simple logistic regressions were applied to determine associations between covariates and doping behavior (criterion). There was no significant difference in potential doping behavior between males and females (OR 1.06, 95 % CI 0.76-1.46), while females reported higher religiousness (SCSRF: 23.11 ± 3.23 and 25.46 ± 7.2 for males and females, respectively; t test = 1.82, p < 0.05). Younger female athletes and those with higher SCSRF score are found to be less prone to doping behavior. When models were adjusted for personal opinion about doping presence in sport and age, the SCSRF remained a significant predictor of potential doping behavior (OR 0.95, 95 % CI 0.91-0.99). For males, the belief that doping was present in sport was strongly associated with a higher likelihood of doping. Our results suggest that highly religious females involved in three of the studies sports (i.e., volleyball, handball and basketball) show a weaker tendency toward doping. Meanwhile, there is no evidence that religiousness influences doping behavior among male team-sport athletes. Therefore, sport-specific and gender-specific approach in studying possible relationships that exist between religiousness and different types of misusing substances in sport is warranted.

AB  - AIM: To estimate the prevalence of some modified cardiovascular risk factors (RFs) among the students of two Moscow higher education institutions to further test the technology of individual medical prevention counseling., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A questionnaire survey was conducted among 1912 first-year students (boys and girls, mean age 17.7 years) from 2 Moscow higher education institutions to reveal physical activity levels, smoking status, alcohol abuse, and food addictions., RESULTS: Almost one third of the students (mainly girls) lead a sedentary lifestyle. The mean age at onset of smoking is 14.8 years. At the moment, the smoking students are 22% (28% of boys and 18% of girls). 12.2% of the respondents have moderate and high nicotine dependence. Most smokers demonstrate low motivation to give up smoking. The mean age for alcohol consumption is 15.8 years. 60% of the students use alcohol. There are no great differences in the drinking of alcoholic beverages between the girls and boys. 18% of the study sample students eat irregularly. Nearly 50% of the students add salt to cooked foods. 17% of the students eat too much sugar; more than 50% take sugar- and fat-laden foods. 54% of the students use vegetables and fruits insufficiently., CONCLUSION: Among all the modified cardiovascular RFs, alcohol use and irrational nutrition are most common among the students. Smoking and low physical activity are also relevant problems although these indicators among the students of Moscow are lower than among those in other regions of the Russian Federation. The found patterns call for the increased attention of the administrations of higher education institutions.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Attributes of the built environment can influence active transportation, including use of public transportation. However, the relationship between perceptions of the built environment and use of public transportation deserves further attention. The objectives of this study were 1) to assess the relationship between personal characteristics and public transportation use with meeting national recommendations for moderate physical activity through walking for transportation and 2) to examine associations between personal and perceived environmental factors and frequency of public transportation use., METHODS: In 2012, we administered a mail-based survey to 772 adults in St Louis, Missouri, to assess perceptions of the built environment, physical activity, and transportation behaviors. The abbreviated International Physical Activity Questionnaire was used to assess walking for transportation and use of public transportation. The Neighborhood Environment Walkability Scale was used to examine perceptions of the built environment. Associations were assessed by using multinomial logistic regression., RESULTS: People who used public transportation at least once in the previous week were more likely to meet moderate physical activity recommendations by walking for transportation. Age and employment were significantly associated with public transportation use. Perceptions of high traffic speed and high crime were negatively associated with public transportation use., CONCLUSION: Our results were consistent with previous research suggesting that public transportation use is related to walking for transportation. More importantly, our study suggests that perceptions of traffic speed and crime are related to frequency of public transportation use. Future interventions to encourage public transportation use should consider policy and planning decisions that reduce traffic speed and improve safety.

AB  - Background: The VISA-P questionnaire evaluates severity of symptoms, knee function and ability to play sports in athletes with patellar tendinopathy. This English-language self-administered brief patient outcome score was developed in Australia to monitor rehabilitation and to evaluate outcome of clinical studies. Aim of this study was to translate the questionnaire into Dutch and to study the reliability and validity of the Dutch version of the VISA-P. Methods: The questionnaire was translated into Dutch according to internationally recommended guidelines. Test-retest reliability was determined in 99 students with a time interval of 2.5 weeks. To determine discriminative validity of the Dutch VISA-P, 18 healthy students, 15 competitive volleyball players (at-risk population), 14 patients with patellar tendinopathy, 6 patients who had surgery for patellar tendinopathy, 17 patients with knee injuries other than patellar tendinopathy, and 9 patients with symptoms unrelated to their knees completed the Dutch VISA-P. Results: The Dutch VISA-P questionnaire showed satisfactory test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.74). The mean (+/- SD) VISA-P scores were 95 (+/- 9) for the healthy students, 89 (+/- 11) for the volleyball players, 58 (+/- 19) for patients with patellar tendinopathy, and 56 (+/- 21) for athletes who had surgery for patellar tendinopathy. Patients with other knee injuries or symptoms unrelated to the knee scored 62 (+/- 24) and 77 (+/- 24). Conclusion: The translated Dutch version of the VISA-P questionnaire is equivalent to its original version, has satisfactory test-retest reliability and is a valid score to evaluate symptoms, knee function and ability to play sports of Dutch athletes with patellar tendinopathy.

AB  - Discusses the physical, psychological, educational, and social dimensions of healthy recreation for adolescents. It is argued that too often concern about the health of adolescents is only expressed when the evidence of illness is plainly obvious—historically, for example, the spread of contagious disease that could have been prevented by immunization, or more recently the incidence of sports injuries, the occurrence of drug and solvent abuse, or the consequences of alcoholic excesses. Examining contemporary leisure activities and detecting any latent (or emerging) hazards to health is proposed as an alternative, so that preventive action might be undertaken. Recreational activity and leisure time is not only a luxury to be enjoyed by some, but is an inevitable part of modern life in the developed world. Thus, recreation should be looked on as a part of occupational health, which needs further research, legislative protection, and appropriate instruction and guidance.

AB  - Youth with physical disabilities have lower psychosocial health and attention compared to their typically developing peers. Recent research has shown positive associations between sports participation and these outcomes. The purpose of the current study was to explore whether a school-based sports program affects psychosocial health and attention in youth with physical disabilities. METHOD(S): Seventy children and adolescents (mean age (SD) 13.8 (2.9) years, aged 8-19 years, 54% boys) with physical disabilities were included in this quasi-experimental study from schools for special education. The sports group (n= 31) followed a school-based sports program (45 min/week) for six months. The control group followed the regular curriculum. Psychosocial health was assessed with self-perception (Self-Perception Profile for Children) and quality of life (DISABKIDS Chronic Generic Measure, DCGM-37). Attention was measured with experimental tasks on search efficiency, sustained attention, and distractibility. RESULT(S): Linear regression analyses revealed no differences between the sports and control group for self-perception, quality of life, and attention. CONCLUSION(S): A school-based sports program seems to have no effect on psychosocial health and attention in youth with physical disabilities. Research into the important factors influencing these variables is needed before further resources can be given to improve sports participation for increasing psychosocial health and attention.Copyright © 2020 - IOS Press and the authors.

AB  - This study assessed the effect of a 12-week behavioural intervention delivered in and by English Premier League football/soccer clubs, and its influence on lifestyle behaviours, in men typically regarded as hard-to-reach. One hundred and thirty men aged 18 years or older engaging in the programme self-reported data on optimal lifestyle behaviours (OLBs) (physical activity, diet, smoking and alcohol consumption) at pre- and post-intervention. Logistic regression models were used to predict the likelihood of OLBs post-intervention. Healthy behaviours were uncommon at baseline, yet at 12 weeks, 19% (n = 24) of men displayed positive change in one behaviour and 67% (n = 87) had changed >=2. A combination of improving diet (odds ratio [OR] = 2.76; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.65-4.63) and being employed (OR = 4.90, CI = 1.46-16.5) significantly increased the likelihood of reporting >=150 min of physical activity per week. Increased physical activity significantly increased the likelihood of self-reporting a healthy diet (OR = 2.32, CI = 1.36-3.95). This study shows that a 12-week behavioural intervention can reach and engage a proportion of at risk men. Further, among such men, the intervention helped to stabilize and improve several of the most important lifestyle behaviours that impact mortality and morbidity.

AB  - Context: The rising incidence of physical activity- and sports- related injuries has prompted the present-day investigation of resistance training as a potential means of injury prevention and physical literacy development among youth. Evidence Acquisition: Relevant studies on the topics of athlete development, physical literacy, resistance training, and injury prevention in children and adolescents were reviewed (PubMed and Sports Discus, 1982-2016). Recommendations from consensus guidelines and position statements applicable to resistance training and injury prevention in youth, in addition to young athlete development, were reviewed. Additionally, hand searches, expert requests, article reference lists, and gray literature were utilized and reviewed for pertinent content. Study Design: Clinical review. Level of Evidence: Level 4. Results: Youth throughout the physical activity spectrum are at risk for physical activity- and sports-related injury. Of highest priority are early specializers, physically inactive youth, and young girls, owing to increased injury rates. Resistance training among these at-risk populations has been shown to reduce injury risk by up to 68% and improve sports performance and health measures, in addition to accelerating the development of physical literacy. Recent recommendations, position statements, and national initiatives advocate for the incorporation of resistance training with qualified instruction among these groups. Conclusion: Resistance training in addition to free play and other structured physical activity training can serve as a protective means against injury and a positive catalyst for the development of physical literacy to offset the impact of diminishing physical activity and early sport specialization in today's youth.

Recent recommendations, position statements, and national initiatives advocate for the incorporation of resistance training with qualified instruction among these groups., CONCLUSION: Resistance training in addition to free play and other structured physical activity training can serve as a protective means against injury and a positive catalyst for the development of physical literacy to offset the impact of diminishing physical activity and early sport specialization in today's youth.

AB  - Research handles the subject from two major indicators: degree of exposure and practices involved in drugs culture. Research also adopts three theories including subsidiary culture and family disintegration. A study sample of students was selected from 10 secondary schools in Riyadh City, 6 of which located in residential areas with high rates of drug cases, and the other 4 located in residential areas with low drugs cases rates, and then a study was applied on a random sample of 1478 students from the selected schools. Findings showed that a special- nature sub -culture about drugs has prevailed among the study sample. Such culture is based on a number of contradicted misconceptions about drugs such as their positive effect on consciousness and enhancement of creativity and so forth. Findings have also shown that dependency on drugs among study sample is much more psychological and social than being physical. Study recommendations include the following: activation of situational prevention programs and the importance of launching awareness program on risks of drugs use.

AB  - Introduction Aggression is a kind of disorder in social relationships among individuals and groups which is considered as one of the most important problems in contemporary society. This problem has different social consequences, the most significant of which is declining of different dimensions of security in society. Street aggression might result in assault and physical violence as well as verbal abuse and insult. Such quarrels may happen given the social, cultural and economic situations in every society and its rate is more or less due to different factors. Increasing poverty, unemployment and inflation are considered as effective and important factors in growing crimes and aggression. Meier believes that "aggression is disciplinarily obvious and directly visible, which might occur at least between two individuals" (Meier, 1989: 24). The problem appears necessary to investigate with regard to murder, organ deficit, prison, financial deficiency and irrecoverable mental crisis for those who are involved in an act of aggression and their families and creating consequences such as increasing social hurts, negative effects on social security and ruining the cultural reputation of a place. Having created disorder in social relationships, this phenomenon makes an atmosphere full of enmity, spite and grudge among individuals, paving the way for skirmish and strong tensions . This research attempts to study and measure factors that influence the rate of aggression among 15-60 year-old citizens of Yazd. Materials and Methods The research has been carried out using a survey method. The statistical population included a total of 15-60-year-old male citizens in Yazd, and the sample size was determined to include 324 subjects using Krejcie and Morgan's Table. The instrument for data collection was a questionnaire which was made based on aggression characteristics (of course, some items were used by Mirfardi et al, 2011). Using explanatory factor analysis, namely, attitude to aggression, tendency to revenge and tendency to aggression, the concept of aggression was divided into 3 dimensions. Diner et al.'s scale of life satisfaction comprised of 5 items, access to welfare facilities comprised of 7 items, and aggression objective experience comprised of 3 items constitute other sections of the instrument. The reliability coefficient for aggression scale was 0.89, 0.85 for life satisfaction and 0.87 for access to welfare to facilities. Discussion of Results and Conclusions Based on the descriptive findings, from among the total number of 324 respondents, 147 were single (45.4%) and 177 were married (54.6%). The age mean was 29.77. Among the respondents, 34.9 percent had diploma (associate degree) or lower and 65.1 percent had a higher degree. The individuals' mean of aggression on the scale of 12-92 was equal to 42.66, the mean of aggression objective experience on the scale of 0-3 was 1.65, mean of life satisfaction on the scale of 5-25 was equal to 16.31, and mean of access to welfare facilities on the scale of 7-35 was equal to 22.64. Most of the variables have a statistically significant correlation with each other. Age variable has a significant and negative relationship with other variables except life satisfaction and income. Tendency to aggression (r = -0.228) and tendency to revenge (r= -0.226) variables have a significant, negative relationship with age, indicating that young people have a more tendency to get involved in acts of aggression and revenge than the elderly. Income variable has a positive and significant relationship with life satisfaction (r= 0.158) and access to welfare facilities (r= 0.189) variables, that is, as income increases, their access to facilities will rise and hence, their life satisfaction will increase. But income does not have a significant relationship with other variables. The phenomena of aggression in a society produces challenges and problems that create an atmosphere full of enmity, spite and grudge among individuals, by fostering disorder in social relationships, paving the way for skirmish, dispute and strong tensions, and decreasing the feeling of security among citizens. This phenomenon poses a great problem in our country which has a multiracial context. On the other hand, aggression and violence are unfortunately still those issues in some Iranians' culture which are an index of power or even protecting social, cultural and family prestige. Given the relationship between education and rate of aggression, it is recommended that serious attempt to be made to educate families and diminish the rate of illiteracy. As individuals gain more experience in acts of aggression, they adopt a higher tendency toward it. Hence, it is suggested that the occurrence of aggression will be controlled and minimized by relevant organizations. Given the higher tendency of adolescents and youth to this phenomenon, it is necessary for cultural organizations in the province of Yazd to establish such urban facilities as cinemas, amusement-scientific parks, libraries, academic centers, whereby increasing youth's interests to participate in acts and activities of sport and amusement.

AB  - To explore the evidence supporting campus environmental design for physical activity promotion in cold climates, empirical studies based on Theory of Evidence-based Design and Social-ecological Model were conducted in 9 campuses located in the northeast of China. Accordingly, the impacts of different domains of campus environment on students’ winter physical activity have been defined by questionnaire surveys. Cross-sectional comparisons between physical activity level in winter and other seasons, and subjective evaluation in 9 campuses have been studied by descriptive statistical analysis; correlations between campus environment elements and students’ winter physical activity have been defined by multiple linear regression. The results revealed: both the frequency and amount of physical activity conducted in winter are lower than those in other seasons; the quality of campus environmental elements evaluated in winter is less desirable than in other seasons, specifically the ratings of climate-protection, walkable accessibility, traffic safety and winter activity safety are relatively lower than other elements; in winter, some elements (destination variety, public-transit choice variety, street network connectivity, environmental quality of walking routines, walking-assisted facility presence and crime safety ) are positively correlated with the transportation-related physical activity, while some (ice and snow threatens and air pollution) are negatively related with it; there is no obvious correlation between campus environment and recreation-related physical activity. Based on the statistical findings, design indications of campus design and the relative importance of campus environmental elements for physical activity promotion can be inferred reasonably, to be more specific, elements such as campus destinations, walking routines, crime safety, walking-assisted facilities and campus public transit are proved to be more important.

AB  - Peer relationship is essential for the healthy growth of adolescents. Positive peer relationships serve as fundamental support for adolescents to successfully pass through puberty, while negative peer relationships such as rejection and bullying may increase the risk of depression and hinder cognitive development. The formation of adolescent peer relationships and the role of family socioeconomic status in this process are important for understanding educational inequality and intergenerational mobility. This paper examines the impact of family socioeconomic status on adolescent peer acceptance from the perspective of social stratification and explores its mediating mechanism, and discuss whether the mediation mechanism is differentiated among groups of different social classes. The data used in this paper is from China Education Panel Study (CEPS) for the school year of 2013-2014. This study finds: (1) socioeconomic status has positive effects on adolescent peer acceptance, students whose parents have college education and above enjoy significant higher peer acceptance than those whose parents have high-school or below educational level; and (2)positive traits at individual-level, such as higher academic performance, self-efficacy, and sports hobbies, have a significant positive impact on peer acceptance, while art hobbies do not. Among them, only cognitive ability (academic performance) has slight mediating effect that transfers part of socioeconomic effect to adolescent peer acceptance. These findings show that in the context of Chinese middle schools, parental involvement in children's peer network is relatively low, possibly indicating that the inequality of family socioeconomic status is not passed on to classmate relationships. However, it may also mean that we have not yet found the real mechanism between family socioeconomic status and adolescent peer relationships, and further exploration is needed.

AB  - Modern developmental psychology has abandoned the idea that development is a natural process advancing according to a given sequence of steps. Nowadays, it has adopted a new understanding of development & studies the peculiarities of being young under conditions of social change. Health policies also offer interpretations of the risks young people take. However, these interpretations are less explicit than those used in the developmental psychology of adolescence, which studies & theorizes on the phenomenon of adolescent risk behaviors. For this reason, such an interpretation within the health sector is based on principles & aims that differ from those pursued by developmental psychologists. Preventing addiction is an area for health-policy measures. In line with the health-policy mandate to reach certain target groups, it is, however, characterized by a special theoretical & practical orientation. The decisive shift towards modern concepts of preventing addiction has resulted from the interplay between the new perspectives of action-based developmental psychology & youth research, on the one hand, & the reorientation efforts that have taken place in the preventive sector since the mid-1980s on the other. The paper focuses on comparing adolescents who are members of sport clubs with those who are not members, with relation to their risk of becoming addicted. The author presents the results of a study that analyzed 1,296 adolescents & 66 trainers in the area of Baden, Germany. Based on four hypotheses, she proves that sport-club members are less prone to smoking & are generally better protected against the risk of becoming addicted. Regarding alcohol consumption, a preliminary analysis did not yield any significant differences between the two groups. However, the data are very heterogeneous for the different types of sports. The club atmosphere & the trainers' influence have a decisive impact on whether or how young people use drugs. 10 References. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - The frequency of involvement in sports often has been concurrently and longitudinally associated with higher self-esteem. The interpretation of this association consistently has been framed as involvement in sports leading to higher levels of self-esteem over time (i.e., socialization effect), although no studies have tested whether higher levels of self-esteem lead to increased involvement in sports over time (i.e., selection effect). Another important aspect of involvement in sports that may be related to self-esteem is the degree to which youth enjoy sports. However, this aspect has received much less attention. To address these gaps in the literature, we first examined the bidirectional effects between self-esteem and the frequency of involvement in sports with 1,492 adolescents (50.8 % female; 92.4 % Canadian-born) over 4 years. Higher levels of self-esteem predicted greater involvement in sports over time, but greater involvement in sports did not predict higher levels of self-esteem over time, offering support only for selection effects. We then tested the bidirectional effects between the enjoyment of sports and self-esteem and found evidence of both socialization and selection effects. Specifically, greater enjoyment of sports predicted higher self-esteem over time, and higher self-esteem predicted greater enjoyment of sports over time. These novel findings suggest that adolescents with higher self-esteem play sports more frequently and enjoy sports more than adolescents with lower self-esteem. In addition, the degree to which adolescents enjoy sports may be more important for increasing self-esteem than the frequency with which adolescents play sports. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Objective: Child abuse can have devastating mental health consequences. Fortunately, not all individuals exposed to child abuse will suffer from poor mental health. Understanding what factors are related to good mental health following child abuse can provide evidence to inform prevention of impairment. Our objectives were to 1) describe the prevalence of good, moderate, and poor mental health among respondents with and without a child abuse history; 2) examine the relationships between child abuse and good, moderate, and poor mental health outcomes; 3) examine the relationships between individual- and relationship-level factors and better mental health outcomes; and 4) determine if individual- and relationship-level factors moderate the relationship between child abuse and mental health. Method: Data were from the nationally representative 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey: Mental Health (n = 23,395; household response rate = 79.8%; 18 years and older). Good, moderate, and poor mental health was assessed using current functioning and well-being, past-year mental disorders, and past-year suicidal ideation. Results: Only 56.3% of respondents with a child abuse history report good mental health compared to 72.4% of those without a child abuse history. Individual- and relationship-level factors associated with better mental health included higher education and income, physical activity, good coping skills to handle problems and daily demands, and supportive relationships that foster attachment, guidance, reliable alliance, social integration, and reassurance of worth. Conclusions: This study identifies several individual- and relationship-level factors that could be targeted for intervention strategies aimed at improving mental health outcomes following child abuse.

AB  - Research conducted primarily with adults has supported claims that adults derive positive psychological benefits from training in the martial arts. These results are encouraging and could foreshadow the potential benefits of martial arts training in terms of prevention efforts and intervention for at-risk youth. This project represents an effort to further investigate the potential effects of martial arts training for boys ages 8 to 13. The participants included 122 boys in one of three groups (karate, sports or a comparison group). The participants in the karate and sports (basketball and baseball) groups completed ratings when they first enrolled in their activity and again after they participated for two months. The comparison group, which consisted of participants who were not in karate, basketball or baseball at the time of the study, completed pre-test and post-test measures over a two month period. Measurements of self-esteem, aggression and social competency were gathered at both rating periods. Results indicated that their were no significant effects over the two month time period on any of the dependent variables for any of the three groups. There were however, differences between these naturally occurring groups at the pretest rating period. The karate group had significantly higher aggression ratings than the sports and comparison groups. In addition, the sports and comparison groups demonstrated higher self-esteem and social competency scores than the karate group. These findings suggest that children with certain characteristics such as higher aggressive tendencies choose karate rather than other sports or activities.

AB  - Maximizing youth experiences in community sport programs is critical, particularly for vulnerable and/or marginalized youth who may have limited access and opportunity to these experiences. Using second-order latent growth modeling, this study explores the impact of a community sport program, the LiFE Sports Camp, on the development of social and sport skills among vulnerable youth. The importance of a sense of belonging as a key mechanism that contributes to youth outcomes also is examined. The findings of this research point to the value of community sport that is strategically designed to promote both sport and social outcomes in youth, as well as highlights the role of belonging in these contexts. Implications for sports management leaders and practitioners are discussed.

AB  - After school and community-based programming is used widely throughout the world to aid children and adolescents who are at risk for being abused, exploited and/or victimized. Although there are mixed findings about the effectiveness of such interventions, some evidence indicates programs that target adolescents anti-social attitudes and behavior can impact future incidents of criminal misconduct and delinquency. The Voices4Peru sponsored program, Club Deportivo Dan, was developed for the purposes of curbing anti-social and high-risk behaviors among the youth of Ventanilla, Perth. The present analysis shows findings gathered from self-report surveys administered to former participants of the club and to respondents who chose not to participate in the organization. The long-term effectiveness of the club was measured from responses to questions about financial stability, perceived social support, incidents of anti-social behavior, concern about physical and psychological wellbeing and reported sexual behavior.

AB  - Objective: Participation in sports has been shown to be protective against depression and suicidal ideation, but little is known about what factors mediate these. relationships. No previous studies examined potential mediators between sports participation and suicidal ideation and only one study explored possible mediators between sports participation and depression. Increased sports participation could protect against depression and suicidal ideation by increasing endogenous endorphin levels, boosting self-esteem, improving body image, increasing social support, and affecting substance abuse. Method: Multivariate hierarchical logistic regression analyses of Add Health data to explore whether increased participation in sports (none, 1-2, 3-4, or 5 or more times per week) is associated with depression and suicidal ideation and whether exercise, self-esteem, body weight, social support, and substance abuse mediate these relationships. Results: As sports participation increases, the odds of suffering from depression decreases by 25% (OR: 0.75; 95% Cl: 0.70-0.82) and the odds of having suicidal ideation decreases by 12% (OR: 0.88; 95% Cl: 0.83-0.93) after controlling for sex, age, race/ethnicity, public assistance, and physical limitations. Substance abuse, body weight, and exercise did not mediate these associations. Consistent with self-esteem and social support acting as mediators of these relationships, the inclusion of these variables in the multivariate models attenuated the associations for depression (OR: 0.83; 95% Cl: 0.75-0.91) and suicidal ideation (OR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.88-0.99). Conclusion: Adolescents should be offered ample opportunity and encouragement to participate in sports, which can protect against depression and suicidal ideation by boosting self-esteem and increasing social support.

AB  - Background Previous research has linked adolescents' participation in organised leisure-time activities (OLTAs) to better health and well-being. It remains unclear whether these associations can be observed consistently across social and socioeconomic strata and countries. Methods The present study used nine nationally representative samples of adolescents aged 11, 13 and 15 years (total n=55 429) from the 2017/2018 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children survey from Europe and Canada. Regression models with mixed effects to account for nested nature of data were applied to estimate: (1) the associations of social and socioeconomic factors with OLTA participation; (2) strengths of the associations between breadth and pattern of OLTA participation with health and well-being indicators, after adjustment for the social and socioeconomic factors. Results Rates of OLTA participation varied by age, sex and country of adolescents. Participants from lower socioeconomic classes and non-nuclear families were less likely to participate in OLTAs across each of the nine countries. Moreover, breadth of OLTA participation was associated with higher well-being independent of socioeconomic status or family structure. All of the participation patterns were associated with higher life satisfaction, but sports (either alone or in combination with a non-sport OLTA) were also associated with fewer psychological complaints and excellent self-rated health. Conclusion Adolescents' engagement in OLTAs was associated with adolescents' subjective well-being regardless of country, age, sex and variance in social and socioeconomic factors. Policies aimed at increasing adolescents' subjective well-being and OLTA participation should focus on adolescents from low socioeconomic classes and non-nuclear families.Copyright ©

AB  - Focusing upon the recent policy context within the UK, this paper offers a review of the evidence related to the outcomes of the participation of children and young people in curricular physical education and sport. Particular attention is paid to potential contributions that such activities can make towards social inclusion and the development of social capital. The review suggests that there are some areas for which there is a considerable amount of evidence in favour of a positive relationship with participation in these activities (such as physical and mental health), and others for which further research remains necessary (such as cognitive and academic development, crime reduction, truancy and disaffection). In general, however, it is evident that much more empirical research is necessary if the benefits of sporting participation for young people and society are to become much more than a theoretical aspiration.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of sport participation on locus of control and academic performance among eighth-grade students. In the analysis, particular attention was placed on the differential effects of sport participation of racial and linguistic minority groups who often times lag behind. Participants were eighth graders from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort (2006). Data were analyzed by employing path analysis with partial least square estimation and group analyses. Results showed the positive effects of sport participation on locus of control and reading and math performance among white and Hispanic groups while the effect was not significant for black and non-English-speaking students.

AB  - The current study examined the association between playing high school football and involvement in violent behaviors in sibling pairs drawn from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). The analysis revealed that youth who played high school football self-reported more violence than those youth who did not play football. Quantitative genetic analyses revealed that 85% of the variance in football participation was the result of genetic factors and 62% of the variance in violent behavior was due to genetic factors. Additional analyses indicated that 54% of the covariance between football participation and violence was due to genetics and 46% was the result of nonshared environmental influences. However, even after controlling for genetic influences, participation in football appeared to increase violent behavior.

AB  - Extra-curricular physical activity (ECPA) may have an important role to play in the health and well-being of adolescents, but the actual benefits are relatively unknown. This study examined ECPA participation amongst adolescent males (age 12-15 years) from disadvantaged backgrounds, and evaluated its impact on overall physical activity (PA) accumulation and psychological well-being. At three time points over a single academic year, participants from four schools (n = 174) wore a pedometer for seven days and completed a questionnaire assessing habitual PA, frequency of ECPA participation, barriers to ECPA participation and seven psychosocial subscales. An average year-long score was calculated for each participant, for each variable. Across seasons, 84% of participants reported regular ( twice a week) or occasional (once a week) participation in ECPA. Those reporting regular participation in ECPA were significantly (p < .01) more active (steps/day) and scored higher (p < .01) on each psychosocial subscale. Results of multinomial regression analysis showed that perceived physical competence (p < .001) had a significant main effect on ECPA participation. Our study results indicate that students from disadvantaged backgrounds whom participate in ECPA at least once a week are significantly more physically active and have a higher level of psychological well-being than those who never participate.

AB  - Purpose -- The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of young people's participation in organised sport on their educational outcomes. Design/methodology/approach -- Systematic review of the literature. A comprehensive search was used to identify all research evidence about engagement, impact and value in culture and sport. A combination of manual and automated screening was used to select studies for inclusion in this review based on pre-specified criteria. Included studies had to use a "high"-quality experimental research design, focus on children and young people and have quantitative educational outcome measures. Results from the individual studies were transformed into a standardised effect size and meta-analysis was used to combine the results from individual studies where appropriate. Findings -- Young people's participation in sport may lead to improved educational outcomes. Young people's participation in organised sports activities, when compared to non-participation, improves their numeracy skills. Young people's participation in organised sport linked with extra-curricular activities, when compared to non-participation, improves a range of learning outcomes for underachieving pupils. These findings are based on six "high"-quality studies conducted in the UK and North America. Study populations included young people within the range of four to 16 years old. Originality/value -- This paper builds on the existing evidence base in two main ways. First, it focuses specifically on the impacts associated with organised sport whereas previous reviews have had a broader focus. Second, it uses meta-analytic methods to synthesise study findings. This paper provides pooled effect sizes for overall educational impacts and translates these into potential changes in test/grade scores. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Adolescent participation in extracurricular activities is associated with numerous positive outcomes, yet the mechanisms underlying this relationship are largely unknown. This study had two goals: to investigate the association between participation in extracurricular activities and indicators of positive and negative development for Australian adolescents; and to determine if these associations were mediated by the characteristics of adolescents' friends. Extracurricular participation was positively associated with higher academic track enrolment, university aspirations, and school belonging, and negatively associated with skipping school; participation in team sports was related to greater alcohol use. In addition, friend characteristics were found to mediate the association between activity participation and developmental indicators. (Contains 5 tables and 3 footnotes.)

AB  - While research shows that low levels of social acceptance and elevated body dissatisfaction increase risks for depressive symptoms among both girls and boys, little is known about protective factors that can mediate these risks. We test the hypothesis that positive team sports involvement mediates the effects of these risks on depression in a cross-sectional study involving a diverse group of 449 Canadian students (49.7% girls) recruited from grades 8 to 10. Findings showed that positive team sports involvement partially mediated risks for depressive symptoms for both boys and girls. Implications for community- and school-based sports programs are discussed.

AB  - Background Engaging in sport has been suggested to be mitigate against psychological distress. Using a prospective-longitudinal design, we examine whether sport participation is associated with reduced psychological difficulties in adolescents and whether associations differ by sport and personal characteristics. Methods 17550 adolescents from grade 7 to 10 (mean age=14.4 years old) self-reported on sport participation, depressive symptoms, social anxiety symptoms and loneliness in Spring 2007 and 1year later. Analyses tested the association between sport participation and subsequent psychological difficulties using linear regression, while adjusting for pre-existing psychological and sociodemographic characteristics. Analyses also verified whether associations differed by sport frequency (weekly/more than weekly) and type (team/individual) using Wald tests of parameter constraints, as well as sex, age and pre-existing psychological difficulties using interaction terms. Results After adjusting for potential confounders, sport participation predicted lower social anxiety symptoms (beta=-0.02 (-0.04, -0.01)) and loneliness (beta=-0.04 (-0.05, -0.02)), but not depressive symptoms. Moderation analyses showed that sport participation predicted greater reductions in depressive symptoms, social anxiety symptoms and loneliness in adolescents with higher baseline scores on each outcome. Associations did not differ by sport frequency and type, sex and age. Post hoc analyses revealed bidirectional associations between sport participation and social anxiety symptoms and loneliness. Conclusions Sport participation predicts small reductions in adolescent psychological distress. Reductions seem most important in youth experiencing greater pre-existing psychological difficulty. Our findings suggest that sport participation represents a protective factor that supports psychological resilience in at-risk youth.

AB  - Introduction: Recent developments in health behavior among adolescents may have been accompanied by changes in risk factors for alcohol use. Focusing on postmillennial cohorts of adolescents, we revisit the question of whether sports participation is a risk factor for alcohol use. Method: This study analyses data from four waves (2017−2020) of the MyLife longitudinal study. Participants were 3425 (45% boys) Norwegian adolescents attending middle school in 2017 (age range: 12−15 years). Annual questionnaire assessments included questions about frequency of sports practice, frequency of alcohol use/heavy episodic drinking, parental cohabitation, unstructured leisure time, sensation‐seeking, and behavioral problems. We employed growth curve models (N = 2682) and fixed effects models (N = 3131). Results: Overall, we did not find systematic differences in initial alcohol use or development over time according to sports practice frequency at the first assessment. However, adolescents with the highest initial sports frequency had slightly lower initial alcohol use and a steeper increase (initial use: b = −0.06, p = .351; linear slope: b = −0.12, p = .218; quadratic curvature: b = 0.09, p = .004). There was no, or only a weak negative, association between change in sports practice and change in alcohol use after adjusting for potential time‐varying confounders, b = −0.03, p = .065. Conclusion: Contrary to most previous research, we found little evidence for an association between sports participation and alcohol use among Norwegian adolescents born after 2000. Sports activities might not require particular attention in the prevention of alcohol use. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people experience significantly poorer mental, social and emotional health disparities compared to their non-Indigenous counterparts as a result of sustained disadvantage and intergenerational trauma. The relationship between physical activity and sport participation and positive mental and psychosocial health in young people is well established, yet little is known about this relationship in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people. This review aims to address this gap by systematically identifying and assessing existing evidence of the impact of sport and physical activity programs on mental health and social and emotional wellbeing outcomes within young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The review also aims to highlight limitations of current practice within the research area. Method(s): A systematic search of literature was undertaken on three peer-reviewed databases (PsycINFO, MEDLINE and SPORTSDiscus) and grey literature until July 2020. Studies were included if they described a sport and physical activity program for young (10-24 years) Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and reported mental health or social and emotional wellbeing outcomes. Result(s): Seventeen studies were selected for this review. Within these studies, the most commonly reported outcomes were related to psychosocial development (N = 12) and a sense of connectedness (N = 12). Mental illness related outcomes (N = 1) were rarely reported, as were substance use (N = 2) and social and emotional literacy (N = 1). Other promising outcomes included increased connection to culture, self-esteem and confidence. Nonetheless, due to indirectness, suboptimal study design, and risk of bias, the precise impact on these outcomes cannot be determined. Discussion(s): A relevant evidence base is emerging on the impact sport and physical activity programs have on the mental, social and emotional wellbeing of young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. However, further research that utilises robust, culturally appropriate methodologies and tools (e.g., participatory action research, body mapping and yarns) needs to be undertaken before the effects of sport and physical activity programs can reliably be discerned.

AB  - Despite abundant literature the respective roles of psychosomatic status, personality, health perception, family environment, and sport activity in tobacco, alcohol and illicit drug use have not been well known. To assess their roles, an epidemiological cross-sectional study was conducted in 3294 middle and high school adolescents, 2396 (73%) of whom agreed to participate. The standardized questionnaire was filled out by the teenagers under the supervision of the teachers. Strong associations were found between tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drug use. The prevalence of alcohol use and illicit drug use were respectively 7 and 10 times higher in smokers than in non-smokers. On the whole, the potential risk factors for tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drug use were age, psychosomatic status and psychotropic drug consumption, boring family atmosphere, not living with both father and mother, and health perception. Mother being a housewife was a protective factor. No marked role was noted for the head of family's socio-occupational category. Personality would be indicators of self-control ability. Indeed, some self-reported personalities (serious, attentive, calm, organized) had protection roles whereas some others (easily irritable, aggressive, worried, clumsy, careless, solitary, etc.) were risk factors (risk-taking or deviant behaviors). Some sports activities were found to be negatively related, but some others related positively with drug use, possibly due to repetitive meetings between the adolescents at risk. Preventive measures may be targeted at these risk factors.

AB  - The aims of this working paper were to investigate whether taking part in out of school activities during primary school is linked with end of primary school attainment and social, emotional and behavioural outcomes, for all children and specifically for children from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. The analysis is based on the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) survey data linked to administrative data holding the cohort children's Key Stage 1 (KS1) and Key Stage 2 (KS2) attainment scores. In addition to looking at KS2 attainment (total point score, English and maths) we also investigated social, emotional and behavioural outcomes using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) total difficulties and prosocial skills scores. The results presented in this paper are based on logistic and multiple linear regression analysis. Results showed that sports clubs and "other" (unspecified) club participation was positively associated with attainment outcomes at age 11, when controlling for prior attainment. Participating in organised sports or physical activity was also positively linked to social, emotional and behavioural outcomes. Among disadvantaged children, after school club emerged as the only organised activity linked to child outcomes; participation was linked to both higher KS2 attainment and prosocial skills. The implications of these findings for further research, policy and practice are discussed. Appended to the report are: (1) KS2 Attainment regression tables; and (2) SDQ outcomes regression tables. A bibliography is included.

AB  - This paper explores whether high-school sports are functional and accessible activities to keep students from school disciplinary behaviors. For this purpose, we included students racial and linguistic status, socioeconomic status, sex, and prior academic performance with the school's proportion of free-lunch recipients and minorities, to understand how sport participation affects students of diverse groups. Additionally, the study implemented a multilevel mediation modeling to the Education Longitudinal Study (ELS) data and assessed student dropouts with sequential mediators of sport participation, school misbehavior, and suspension. The findings of the study largely revealed that White students participated in sports more than Black, Hispanic, and Asian. Likewise, students who speak English as the primary language and male students participated in sports more than their counterparts. White sport participants displayed fewer incidents of suspension than White non-sport participants. Black, Hispanic, and White sport participants had lower dropout incidents than their non-sport-participating counterparts.

AB  - In this paper, I review an issue that is an urgent challenge in the development field-the effectiveness of after-school programs for preventing school-age youth violence in vulnerable settings in Latin American and the Caribbean. These programs have proliferated in the region and include sports, recreation, music, tutoring, and other focused activities. Given their popularity and because they target known risk factors for violence (such as drop-out from school, poor academic performance, lack of motivation, too much idle time, low quality and quantity of adult supervision, and social isolation), it is critical to examine empirically whether they can be effective prevention strategies. Unfortunately, most rigorous trials of after-school interventions to prevent youth violence have been conducted in developed countries, with far fewer in Latin America. In this review, a broad range of databases was searched systematically. Only six studies in five Latin American and Caribbean countries were identified. Reported results indicate at least some benefits for youth behavior, although not across all youth. Additional concerns regarding how these programs are implemented and whether specific components can be tied to violence prevention are noted. The need for more rigorous evaluation of these programs is noted.

AB  - This article presents the results of a scoping review of the sport literature (2000-2014) on psychological and social outcomes relevant to youth alcohol and illicit drug use. Prior reviews report that sport is related to increased alcohol use and reduced illicit drug use among youth, yet provide little guidance regarding the mechanisms that can explain this relationship. We reviewed the literature on sport participation and psychological and social outcomes to identify factors that could help explain this link. Psychological and social factors were selected as they play a paramount role in understanding youth alcohol and drug use. Fifty-nine articles were identified and included in the review. The literature generally supported connections between sport and positive psychological and social outcomes, including self-esteem, self-regulation, general life skills, and pro-social behaviour. Yet limitations in the methods and measures limit the ability to draw conclusions from the literature. In addition, the diversity of youth and sport was generally ignored in the literature. This article suggests a number of directions for future research that might improve our understanding of how sport impacts psychological and social outcomes along with alcohol and illicit drug use.

AB  - This study examines a cross-sectional structural equation model of participation in youth activities, neighborhood adult support, individual decision making skills, and delinquent behavior in urban middle school youths (n = 2611). Results indicate extracurricular activity participation had both direct and indirect associations with delinquent behavior. Breadth, but not intensity, of activity participation had a positive association with neighborhood adult support and higher levels of adult support were associated with higher levels of youth decision making skills. Higher levels of decision making skills were, in turn, associated with lower levels of delinquent behavior. A direct positive association between intensity of activity participation and delinquent behavior was noted, after accounting for other effects in the model. The specificity model revealed that this association was mostly due to participation in neighborhood clubs (as opposed to sports, school clubs, church, helping/volunteer, or music, art, or drama). Implications and limitations of the study are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - We tested the hypothesis that school 'athletes' and 'non-athletes' differ in intentions to consume alcohol and get drunk, attitudes toward alcohol, and perceptions of subjective norms. We also investigated, using the theory of reasoned action, whether athletic involvement is a factor in predicting alcohol-related intentions. Data were obtained from students in a stratified sample of schools in a major Welsh city. Male athletes were significantly more likely than male non-athletes to intend to get drunk and to believe friends would approve of their alcohol consumption. For males, sporting involvement was a significant predictor of likelihood of getting drunk. In contrast, female athletes showed significantly more negative attitudes than did female non-athletes toward drinking alcohol. Differences in intentions were nonsignificant.

AB  - Previous research into the relationship between sports and illegal behavior has left it unclear whether sports participation acts as a preventative measure or a risk factor for illegal behavior. The present study examines the relationship between sports involvement and illegal behavior, in both the long and the short-term, in a national sample, using propensity score matching and negative binomial regression to examine the short and long-term impacts of youth sports participation and adult illegal behavior. The results suggest that in general, sports participation has very little if any direct impact on illegal behavior, but participation specifically in contact sports, either alone or in combination with participation in noncontact sports, is associated with reduced frequency of some illegal behaviors. Implications for policy and future research are considered. (C) 2012 Western Social Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

While previous research produced inconsistent results, the present study revealed that participation in school-based sports was associated with a reduction in cigarette and marijuana use, thus, serving as a protective factor for Black and White students. However, the protective role of sports involvement for alcohol use was present only among Black females. Participation in sports was associated with an increase in alcohol use (serving as a risk factor) among White males and females and Black males (after controlling for conventional predictors of alcohol use in adolescence). Implications for expanding the role of sports as a potential school resource in drug use prevention planning are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to examine the association between extra-curricular activities and risky sexual and illicit drug use behaviours among youth (12–22 years old) in South Africa. The study uses nationally representative data. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression models are used. Results show that a high percentage of youth engage in at least one type of risky sexual behaviour (33.84%) and have used at least one type of illicit substance (7.79%). Sports (about 60%) and youth groups (about 15%) are the most popular forms extra-curricular activities. Further, the odds of risky sexual behaviour are higher for youth who participate in sports (OR = 1.29, p-value < .05) and youth groups (OR = 1.58, p-value < .05). While youth who engage in other, undefined extra-curricular activities (OR = 2.11, p-value < .05) and sports (OR = 1.03, p-value < .05) have higher odds of illicit drug use. There is need to monitor and evaluate local extra-curricular activities to prevent risky behaviours among youth. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: This study examined the association between participation in school-based and/or community-based activity and major depressive episodes (MDE) in adolescents using nationally representative data. Methods: This study utilized cross-sectional data from the National Survey of Drug Use and Health from 2015 to 2019. Nine screening questions determined the presence of past-year MDE in adolescents ages 12-17 (n = 67,033). Participants indicated past-year participation in school-based (eg, team sports, cheerleading, choir, band, student government, or clubs) and/or community-based activities (eg, volunteer activities, sports, clubs, or groups). Sociodemographic variables included sex, race/ethnicity, family income, and age. Descriptive statistics, univariable and multivariable regression analyses were conducted. The multivariable model included interaction terms between age and sex, and age and race/ethnicity. Results: Overall, 14% of the sample met the criteria for having MDE. The odds of MDE increased with age. Joint effects of age and sex, and age and race/ethnicity significantly influenced the association between MDE and school- or community-based activities. Participation in 1+ community-based activities was protective for MDE across all races/ethnicities. Conclusions: Findings help illuminate the direct association of school- and community-based activity participation on MDE risk in adolescents, improving our understanding of MDE across various sociodemographic subgroups in an adolescent population. Schools should aim to facilitate equitable programming and endorse adolescent participation in multiple activities throughout the year. Schools should examine the resources available and consider partnerships that would bolster resources, access, and social capital throughout the community.

AB  - Drawing on data gathered from high-school seniors in the 2008 Monitoring the Future Study of American Youth (N = 2,063), this research examined the explanatory effects of competitive sports participation on alcohol consumption and marijuana use using race and noncompetitive exercise frequency as controls. Among males, competitive sports included baseball, basketball, football, soccer, track and field, and weightlifting, and among females, sports included softball, basketball, soccer, swimming and diving, track and field, and volleyball. White males reported greater alcohol consumption than Black and Hispanic respondents, with competitors in baseball, football and weightlifting consuming alcohol more frequently. The use of marijuana did not depend on race, but baseball players and weightlifters reported significantly more use. Among females, race differences did not emerge in ordinal regression models testing effects on alcohol consumption, but participants in every sport reported drinking alcohol more frequently. White female athletes also appeared to smoke marijuana more frequently. Overall, results suggested comparably strong effects for female sport environments while male behaviors varied by race, noncompetitive exercise frequency, and sports competition. Limitations of the study and recommendations for future research are offered. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] À partir de données recueillies auprès des étudiants seniors des écoles secondaires participant à l'étude « 2008 Monitoring the Future Study of American Youth » (N= 2,063), la présente étude examine les effets de la compétition sportive scolaire sur la consommation d'alcool et l'utilisation de la marijuana en utilisant la race et la fréquence de l'activité physique non-compétitive comme variables contrôle. Chez les hommes, les sports incluaient le base-ball, le ballon-panier, le football, le soccer, l'athlétisme et l'haltérophilie et, chez les femmes, la balle-molle, le ballonpanier, la natation, le plongeon, l'athlétisme et le volley-ball. Les hommes blancs ont rapporté une plus grande consommation d'alcool que les répondants noirs ou hispaniques, les compétiteurs en base-ball, football et haltérophilie rapportant consommer de l'alcool plus souvent que les autres étudiants. L'utilisation de la marijuana ne dépendait pas de la race mais les joueurs de base-ball et les haltérophiles ont rapporté significativement plus d'utilisation. Chez les femmes, la consommation d'alcool n'a pas varié selon la race mais les compétitrices de tous les sports ont rapporté consommer plus d'alcool que les autres étudiantes. Les athlètes féminines blanches ont également rapporté fumer de la marijuana plus souvent. En somme, les résultats suggèrent un effet important de l'environnement sportif pour les femmes tandis que chez les hommes, le comportement varie selon la race, la fréquence de l'activité physique non-compétitive, et la compétition sportive. Les limites de l'étude sont présentées ainsi que des recommandations pour des études ultérieures.

AB  - Concerned about potentially increased risk of neurodegenerative disease, several health professionals and policy makers have proposed limiting or banning youth participation in American-style tackle football. Given the large affected population (over 1 million boys play high school football annually), careful estimation of the long-term health effects of playing football is necessary for developing effective public health policy. Unfortunately, existing attempts to estimate these effects tend not to generalize to current participants because they either studied a much older cohort or, more seriously, failed to account for potential confounding. We leverage data from a nationally representative cohort of American men who were in grades 7–12 in the 1994–95 school year to estimate the effect of playing football in adolescent on depression in early adulthood. We control for several potential confounders related to subjects’ health, behavior, educational experience, family background, and family health history through matching and regression adjustment. We found no evidence of even a small harmful effect of football participation on scores on a version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CES-D) nor did we find evidence of adverse associations with several secondary outcomes including anxiety disorder diagnosis or alcohol dependence in early adulthood. For men who were in grades 7–12 in the 1994–95 school year, participating or intending to participate in school football does not appear to be a major risk factor for early adulthood depression.

AB  - Risk-taking is statistically normative during adolescence, yet is associated with adverse outcomes including substance use. The present study draws the distinction between protective factors (effective for those identified as high risk takers) and promotive factors (effective for all) against substance use, focusing on parental monitoring, school bonding, and sports participation. A total of 36,514 8th and 10th grade participants in the national Monitoring the Future study were included. Although parental monitoring was associated with lower alcohol and marijuana use among all adolescents (i.e., promotive effect), these effects were strongest among the highest risk takers (i.e., protective effect) and females. School bonding was associated with lower levels of both alcohol and marijuana use among all groups of adolescents, but these promotive effects were weak. Sports participation was associated with higher levels of alcohol use among all males and among 8th grade females who did not identify as high risk takers. Despite being a risk factor for alcohol use, sports participation did demonstrate a promotive effect against marijuana use among 10th grade females only, and especially so for high risk-taking females (i.e., protective effect). Overall, these findings suggest that of the three mechanisms studied, parental monitoring emerged as the most promising entry point for substance use prevention and intervention across groups, particularly for females and high risk-taking adolescents.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine possible relationships between participation in extracurricular activities and student achievement, participation in extracurricular activities and attendance, and participation in extracurricular activities and behavior. The setting for this study was a high school in western Nebraska. Data for 275 of the school district's 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 high school graduates were obtained from the high school activities office and the school district's student management system. Ten research hypotheses were tested using appropriate statistical analyses. Relationships were found for five research hypotheses: (1) Students who participated in extracurricular activities had higher grade point averages than students who did not participate. (2) Students who participated in extracurricular activities had a higher rate of school attendance than students who did not participate. (3) Students who participated in only sport activities received more disciplinary referrals than students who participated in only non-sport activities. (4) Students whose families have a higher level of socio-economic status were more likely to participate in extracurricular activities. (5) White students were more likely to participate in extracurricular activities than Hispanic and other racial ethnic backgrounds. No relationships were found for five research hypotheses: (1) Between grade point averages of students who participated in only sports activities and grade point averages of students who participated in only non-sport activities. (2) Between attendance of students who participated in only sports activities and attendance of students who participated in only non-sport activities. (3) Between participation in extracurricular activities and disciplinary referrals. (4) Between grade point averages of students who participated in only sports activities, grade point averages of students who participated in only non-sport activities, and grade point averages of students who participated in both sport and non-sport activities. Between attendance of students who participated in only sport activities, attendance of students who participated in only non-sport activities, and attendance of students who participated in both sport and non-sport activities.

AB  - Objectives Sports programs are widely implemented as measures of crime prevention. In contrast to their popularity, there is little systematic knowledge about their effectiveness. This systematic review and meta-analysis have been carried out to fill this gap. In a systematic review, we gathered data on evaluated prevention programs specifically designed to prevent crime and delinquency. We then conducted a meta-analytic integration with studies using at least roughly equivalent control groups for the program evaluation. Method To retrieve relevant literature, we conducted a comprehensive international literature search until June 2021 drawing on scientific databases. We also applied snow-balling searches and contacted practitioners in the field. Studies were eligible if they evaluated sports programs designed to prevent delinquency on primary, secondary, and/or tertiary level. We focused on crime-related outcomes and potentially underlying psycho-social factors. We made no restrictions regarding characteristics of the participants or other aspects such as duration of the program. Results 24 studies were eligible for our systematic review, from which only thirteen were included into our meta-analytic integration. We found a moderate effect of participation in sports programs on crime-related outcomes (d = 0.36, p < .001). Participants showed a significant decrease in outcomes such as aggressiveness or anti-social behavior. We also analyzed psychological outcomes such as self-esteem or mental well-being, which also significantly improved when participating in sports programs (d = 0.87, p < ..05). Conclusions Sports programs seem to be an effective measure of crime prevention. However, future research needs more sound evaluation designs and moderator analyses to better understand the functioning and improve the implementation of sports programs.

AB  - This study examined the relationship between children's sports participation and emotional well-being including self-reported emotional and behavioral problems and multidimensional aspects of self-concept. Data were collected from 203 young adolescents using a multitrait-multimethod assessment methodology. Information was obtained using a sports questionnaire concerning participation in and perceptions of sporting activities. Emotional well-being was assessed by the Youth Self-Report (Achenbach, 1991) and the Self-Perception Profile for Children (Harter, 1985). The study found that increased levels of sports participation had a positive relationship with aspects of emotional and behavioral well-being, particularly self-concepts. Results also showed that children with increased perceptions of sport-related competencies reported significantly fewer emotional and behavioral problems than did children who were, by external standards (e.g., teacher rating, number of sporting achievements), actually competent at sport. The study also found particular areas of sports participation to be positively associated with self-concept. Evidence suggests a similar beneficial association with some aspects of behavior problems. Practical implications of the findings are discussed along with recommendations for future research. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Background: The prevalence of problem behaviours among British adolescents has increased in the past decades. Following Erikson's psychosocial developmental theory and Bronfenbrenner's developmental ecological model, it was hypothesized that youth problem behaviour is shaped in part by social environment. The aim of this project was to explore potential protective factors within the social environment of British youth's for the presentation of disruptive behavioural problems. Method: This study used secondary data from the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England, a cohort study of secondary school students. These data were analysed with generalized estimation equations to take the correlation between the longitudinal observations into account. Three models were built. The first model determined the effect of family, school, and extracurricular setting on presentation of disruptive behavioural problems. The second model expanded the first model by assuming extracurricular activities as protective factors that moderated the interaction between family and school factors with disruptive behavioural problems. The third model described the effect of prior disruptive behaviour on current disruptive behaviour. Results: Associations were found between school factors, family factors, involvement in extracurricular activities and presence of disruptive behavioural problems. Results from the second generalized estimating equation ( GEE) logistic regression models indicated that extracurricular activities buffered the impact of school and family factors on the presence of disruptive behavioural problems. For instance, participation in sports activities decreased the effect of bullying on psychological distress. Results from the third model indicated that prior acts of disruptive behaviour reinforced current disruptive behaviour. Conclusion: This study supports Erikson's psychosocial developmental theory and Bronfenbrenner's developmental ecological model; social environment did influence the presence of disruptive behavioural problems for British adolescents. The potential of extracurricular activities to intervention strategies addressing disruptive behavioural problems of adolescents is discussed.

AB  - Objective: To identify early predictors of suicidal ideation in young adults, and to determine when specific time-varying determinants become important in predicting later suicidal ideation Methods: Data were available for 877 participants in the Nicotine Dependence in Teens study, an ongoing prospective cohort of students aged 12 to 13 years at cohort inception in 1999. Time-invariant covariates included age, sex, mother's education, language, and self-esteem. Time-varying covariates included depression symptoms, family stress, other stress, alcohol use, cigarette use, and team sports. Independent predictors of past-year suicidal ideation at age 20 years were identified in 5 multivariate logistic regression analyses, one for each of grades 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 Results: Eight per cent of participants (mean age 20.4 years [SD 0.7], 46% male) reported suicidal ideation in the past year. In grade 7, none of the potential predictor variables were statistically significantly associated with suicidal ideation In grade 8, participation in sports teams in and (or) outside of school protected against suicidal ideation (OR 0.6; 95% CI 0.4 to 0.8; P = 0 002). Depression symptoms in grades 9, 10, and 11 were independent predictors of suicidal ideation (OR 2.2; 95% CI 1.5 to 3.2, OR 1.6; 95% CI 1.0 to 2 5, and OR 1 9; 95% CI 1.1 to 3.4, respectively) No other variables were statistically significant in the multivariate models. Conclusion: Depression symptoms as early as in grade 9 predict suicidal ideation in early adulthood It is possible that early detection and treatment of depression symptoms are warranted as part of suicide prevention programs.

AB  - This study examined the relationship between physical activity, physical education class, and sports participation on the substance use practices of adolescents. Data was derived from the 2009 Youth Risk Behavior Survey study of adolescent behaviors. The results of this study indicated that recreational physical activity, attending PE class, and participating in sports were independent protective factors for many cigarette use behaviors but not for smokeless tobacco use. Additionally, recreational physical activity and sports participation appears to be a protective factor for marijuana use among females but not males. On the other hand, recreational physical activity and sports participation appears to be a risk factor for alcohol use behaviors among males.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are associated with long-term poor mental health. Less is known about factors that improve long-term mental health among those with ACEs. OBJECTIVE To evaluate, among those exposed to ACEs, whether team sports participation during adolescence is associated with better mental health in adulthood and whether the association between team sports participation and mental health varies by sex. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This study used data from 9668 individuals who participated in waves 1 (1994-1995) and 4 (2008) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. Individuals were included if they had complete data on exposure to ACEs (physical and sexual abuse, emotional neglect, parental alcohol misuse, parental incarceration, and living with a single parent) and a valid sample weight. Statistical analysis was performed from November 6, 2017, to January 4, 2019. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The association between team sports participation in grades 7 to 12 (wave 1) and diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety and current depressive symptoms (determined by Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale-10 scores) at ages 24 to 32 years (wave 4) among individuals exposed to ACEs. Multivariable logistic regression models were weighted based on propensity scores for factors associated with team sports participation and controlled for individual, family, and school characteristics. Interaction terms tested whether associations between team sports participation and mental health varied by sex. RESULTS Of 9668 individuals included in the study (4470 male [50.0%]; mean [SD] age, 15.2 [1.75] years), 4888 (49.3%) reported 1 or more ACE and 2084 (21.3%) reported 2 or more ACEs. Among those with ACEs, team sports participation during adolescence was significantly associated with lower odds of receiving a diagnosis of depression (unadjusted rate, 16.8% vs 22.0%; propensity score-weighted [PSW] adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.76; 95% CI, 0.59-0.97) or anxiety (11.8% vs 16.8%; PSW aOR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.56-0.89) and having current depressive symptoms (21.9% vs 27.5%; PSW aOR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.71-1.01). There were no significant differences in associations between team sports participation and mental health by sex. Stratified analyses showed significant associations for all outcomes among males (depression: PSWaOR, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.46-0.99]; anxiety: PSW aOR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.45-0.96]; depressive symptoms: PSWaOR, 0.75 [95% CI 0.56-0.99]) but only 1 outcome among females (anxiety: PSW aOR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.54-0.98). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among individuals affected by ACEs, team sports participation in adolescence was associated with better adult mental health. Team sports may be an important and scalable resilience builder.

AB  - This reprinted article originally appeared in Journal of Adolescent Research, 1999(Jan), Vol 14(1), 10-43. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]1998-03284-001[/rid].) Examined the potential benefits and risks associated with participation in five types of activities: prosocial (church and volunteer activities), team sports, school involvement, performing arts, and academic clubs. A sample of 1,259 Ss was followed from 1983 when the Ss were in the 6th grade to 1997. First, the authors explored the link between involvement in these activities and our indicators of positive and negative development. Involvement in prosocial activities was linked to positive educational trajectories and low rates of involvement in risky behaviors. In contrast, participation in team sports was linked to positive educational trajectories and to high rates of involvement in one risky behavior: drinking alcohol. Then, the authors explored two possible mediators of these associations: peer associations and activity-based identity formation. The evidence supported the hypothesis that group differences in peer associations and activity-based identities help explain activity group differences.

AB  - The widely held notion that sports participation reduces subsequent risk of substance use is evaluated with longitudinal data of a representative sample of youth when they were in their preteen and young adult years. Unlike previous inquiries into the deterrence hypothesis, the present study controls for other major factors previously found to be predictive of alcohol and drug use. Results of analyses revealed that contrary to the deterrence hypothesis, playing high school sports does not appear to be a protective factor that lowers one's involvement in young adult alcohol or drug use - with one exception. Subgroup analyses revealed that among blacks, the greater the extent of high school sports participation the less the risk of substance use. In direct contradiction to the deterrence hypothesis, playing high school sports was found to be positively associated with alcohol use for whites, even in the context of other major predictors of alcohol use. Further analyses revealed that the positive association between sports participation and alcohol use appeared to exist only for white males. The implications of these results are discussed.

AB  - Identifying groups of young people that might be especially susceptible to marijuana use would aid in the design and implementation of drug policy programs. This article examines whether those who participated in high school athletics have a different pattern of marijuana use than comparable non-athletes. The results indicate that male athletes have a higher incidence of marijuana use than non-athletes. The same is not true for female athletes, who actually engage in less marijuana use than their non-athlete counterparts. However, female athletes are more likely than non-athletes to wait until their post-high school years to try the drug for the first time. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The study purpose was to examine the relationship between sports participation and recent alcohol and past-year alcohol use among students. A secondary data analysis of the PRIDE survey (N= 37,616) was performed. A series of chi-square analyses and odds ratios were conducted. Results indicated sports participation reduced the odds for past-year alcohol use among male students, but not recent use. Female students who participated in school sports often/a lot were at reduced risk for reporting both recent use and past-year use. Overall, sports participation had a protective effect on alcohol use. Recommendations for future research are included.

AB  - This article examines links between different measures of after-school time activity participation (5 specific activities and breadth) on youth's developmental outcomes (anxiety/depression, delinquency, and substance use) over 6 years and whether these links are moderated by neighborhood-level variables. The sample (N=1,315) of 9- and 12-year-old youth was drawn from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN), a multilevel, longitudinal study of youth from 80 Chicago neighborhoods. Findings revealed that different types of activities and patterns of participation over time were associated with outcomes for youth and that, to some extent, these outcomes varied with neighborhood characteristics. In brief, sports participation was associated with fewer anxious/depressed symptoms, higher average delinquency scores, and increased substance use-both average scores and growth over time. Participation in the arts and student government were negatively associated with average substance use and attenuated increases in usage over time. Participation in community-based clubs was positively associated with youth's anxiety/depression in violent neighborhoods only, whereas church groups were protective against substance use in nonviolent neighborhoods. The direction of the influence of breadth of participation was nonlinear for delinquency such that delinquency scores were highest among youth who engaged in an average number of activities.

AB  - Despite the relevance of cognitive and non-cognitive skills for professional success, their formation is not yet fully understood. This study fills part of this gap by analyzing the role of sports club participation, one of the most popular extra-curricular activities, on children's skill development. Our results indicate positive effects: school performance improves by 0.20 standard deviations and overall non-cognitive skills by 0.09 standard deviations. The results are robust when using alternative datasets as well as alternative estimation and identification strategies. The effects can be partially explained by increased physical activities replacing passive leisure activities.

AB  - This study examines whether unstructured and structured activities interact in their association with delinquency and cannabis use. We hypothesize that unstructured activities are more strongly associated with delinquency and cannabis use for those who are less engaged in structured activities. Data are drawn from three nationally representative self-report studies conducted between 2005 and 2011 in Sweden, and include 19,644 adolescents. The results support the hypothesis that unstructured activities interact with structured activities in the association with delinquency and cannabis use. The association between unstructured activities and these outcomes is stronger for those with lower levels of structured activities. Sporting activities constitute the structured activity that most clearly interacts with unstructured activities in the association with delinquency and cannabis use.

AB  - This project studied high-risk activities in adolescent male athletes (ages 13-19) compared with a control group of adolescent male and female nonathletes. All athletes surveyed participated in one or more interscholastic sports. The prevalence of drug use by athletes compared to nonathletes was determined. Of the 19 drugs observed in this study, all were shown to have a lower prevalence of use among athletes in their senior year of high school, compared to the comparison group. Among the more commonly abused substances by the athlete population, beer, wine and whiskey, cigarettes, and marijuana were shown to have a lower use rate, by 25.5, 39.9, 57.5, and 57.7%, respectively. The prevalence of drug use by adolescent male athletes compared to adolescent nonathletes was also studied. Of the 19 individual drugs surveyed, all demonstrated a lower prevalence of use among athletes in their senior year of high school compared to the national data. The second high-risk activity measured was sexual activity. Of the athletes, 45.5% stated that they had never had sexual intercourse, compared to 50.0% of the nonathletes. Of the sexually active athletes, 81.9% had their first intercourse at between 13 and 15 years of age, whereas only 67.8% of the nonathlete control group had done so. This difference diminished significantly at age 16 and above. The results of this study suggest that participation in athletics by male athletes may lead to a significant decrease in drug and alcohol use and abuse but, also, may increase early sexual contact. These trends were seen throughout all 4 years of high school in the athletes studied.

AB  - A premise of contemporary crime prevention programs such as youth athletic leagues and midnight basketball projects is that athletic participation reduces crime. Athletic participation may reduce crime either by way of the socializing effects of participation or by way of the tendency of athletics to channel the time and energy of young adults from crime to more benign and even healthy activities and thus divert potential delinquents from engaging in criminal activity. In this paper, I examine the relationship between athletic participation and the delinquency of young adults by using panel data of over 20,000 high school students from the National Educational Longitudinal Study (NELS). The NELS data permits separate estimates of factors that predict participation in various high school sports programs from estimates of the effect of that participation on delinquency. Specifically, I use an instrumental variable approach to disentangle the self-selection effect from the subsequent effect of athletic participation on delinquency. Moreover, I focus on the effects of particular sports--football, basketball, baseball, swimming, diving, etc. I also transform the standardized regression coefficients into elasticities in order to make comparisons within and across regressions easier. Finally, I address the central policy implications of the findings.

AB  - This paper investigates the relationship between adolescent sport participation and alcohol use, focusing on differences in sport contexts. We also include the wider social context, the role of peers and parents as key variables in our analysis. Our sample consists of a nationally representative sample of 10,992 Icelandic adolescents. The findings indicate that adolescents that participate in formally organized sport clubs are less likely to use alcohol than those that do not. The results obtained for participation in informal sport are in the reverse direction, indicating that adolescents that do only informal sport are more likely to use alcohol than those that do not. Moreover, it was found that the well-known relationship between adolescent alcohol use and having alcohol-using friends was contingent on formal sport participation. We also find that the influence of low parental monitoring and time spent with parents and broken family structure on alcohol use becomes significantly weaker with greater involvement in formal sport. In other words, sport participation in formal sport is more relevant for those groups of adolescents that are at most risk for using alcohol, since it buffers the effects of known risk factors on alcohol use. Participation in informal sport does not, however, show such buffering effects. The findings further highlight the need to consider the wider social context as well as differences in sport organization and sport contexts while studying the potential effects of sports on adolescent alcohol use.

AB  - BackgroundThere is a lack of research investigating organised activity participation and associated alcohol use in vulnerable groups. AimsThe purpose of this research was to test and compare associations between participation in organised activities and indicators of hazardous drinking between young offenders and young non-offenders. MethodsTwo groups of 13-18year-old males were recruited in Cardiff, UK: 93 young offenders and 53 non-offenders from secondary schools matched on estimated IQ, sex and socioeconomic status. Indicators of hazardous drinking were measured using the Fast Alcohol Screening Test (FAST). Organised activity participation and externalising behaviour was measured by the Youth Self Report. The Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence was also administered. ResultsYoung offenders participated in fewer organised activities and had higher FAST scores than non-offenders. Young offenders and non-offenders significantly differed on mean FAST scores if they participated in no organised activities but not if they participated in at least one team sport. Externalising behaviour problems were unrelated to participation in organised activities. ConclusionsAlthough young offenders were less likely to have participated in organised activities, for them, participation in a team sport was associated with less hazardous drinking. Vulnerable youths who might benefit most from sporting activities actually access them the least. Future research should identify the different barriers to participation that they face.

AB  - This study examined whether participation in school team sports, exclusively or in combination with other extracurricular activities, is associated with higher levels of psychosocial functioning and healthy behavior than participation in other extracurricular activities alone or nonparticipation. The study sample includes 50,168 ninth grade public school students who completed an anonymous, voluntary statewide survey in 2001. Students were classified into four groups based on their participation in sports and other activities (such as clubs, volunteer work, band, choir, or music lessons): neither, both, other activities only, and sports only. Odds ratios for the group involved in both types of activities were significantly higher than those for all the other groups for all healthy behaviors and measures of connectedness, and significantly lower for all but one of the unhealthy behaviors. Students involved in sports, alone or in combination with other activities, had significantly higher odds than the other two groups for exercise, milk consumption, and healthy self-image, and significantly lower odds for emotional distress, suicidal behavior, family substance abuse, and physical and sexual abuse victimization. Students involved in other activities, alone or in combination with sports, had significantly higher odds than the other two groups for doing homework and significantly lower odds for alcohol consumption, marijuana use, and vandalism. The finding that abuse victims appeared to avoid sports but not other group activities raises concern and merits further research. Considering the potential benefits of participation in sports and other activities, more research is needed to identify and overcome barriers or deterrents, particularly for youth from low-income families.

AB  - Despite its long-standing popular appeal, the idea that athletic activity is a deterrent to crime and delinquency suffers from a distinct lack of empirical support. This article tests the hypothesis that the relationship between high school sports participation and deviance varies by both type of deviant behavior and level of athletic involvement. The analysis is based upon longitudinal data focusing on the effects of involvement in high school sports, the country's largest institutional setting for youth sports participation, in early adulthood. We find that the relationship between athletic involvement and deviance varies significantly depending upon the deviant behaviors examined. Specifically, we find that shoplifting decreases with sports participation, while drunken driving increases. Moreover, these effects extend further into the life course (age 30) than has been demonstrated in any previous study and hold across all our measures of sports participation. Several potential explanatory mechanisms are evaluated. The implications of these enduring, bifurcated effects are discussed.

AB  - This thesis is a compilation of three papers that study how various factors influence educational outcomes. The first paper, "The Benefits of Athletic Participation: Heterogeneous Effects on Academic and Labor Market Outcomes", focuses on sports participation in schools. It shows that athletic participants have higher GPAs, increased high school graduation rates, greater schooling attainment beyond high school, and higher wages compared to non-participants. In addition the gains from participation are concentrated in underachieving populations participating in team sports. This paper argues that improved outcomes arise from institutional performance incentives and the development of human capital. The second paper, "The Influence of Height on Academic Outcomes", explores the relationship between height and educational achievement. Taller students earn higher grades, are more likely to graduate from high school, and attain more years of schooling. However, this height effect varies across school size: height has a stronger correlation with outcomes for students from bigger schools. These results imply that intelligence alone does not drive the association between height and outcomes. Differential access to activities such as school sports plays a role in driving these results. Finally, the third paper, "The Effect of Menarche on Education: Explaining Black-White Differences", looks at the relationship between developmental timing in girls and their educational outcomes. A girl's developmental timing, marked by age at menarche, is strongly correlated with educational attainment. However, the direction of this correlation varies by race. Among the white population, delayed menarche is associated with improved educational outcomes while among the black population, it is associated with worse outcomes. Different responses to pregnancy driven by variance in marriage market quality across race can explain part of this relationship. Absent pregnancy, differing marriage patterns across race may also contribute to the trends between menarche and achievement. Evidence suggests that endogenous factors such as health, which influence both development and outcomes, cannot explain the varying relationship between age at menarche and education across race.

AB  - Although several studies have investigated the relationship between interscholastic athletic participation & delinquency, little attention has been given to younger populations. Anonymous self-report questionnaire data are utilized to examine the relationship between youth sport participation & deviant behavior in 381 sixth-grade students. Overall, a negative association was found between youth sport participation & delinquency. Although some similarities were found in the profiles of youth sport participants & deviants, important distinctions were found regarding the variables of delinquent associates, peer status, & personal values. 7 Tables, 15 References.

AB  - Introduction: Based on Bronfenbrenner's bioecological theory and Bornstein's specificity principle, the purpose of this study was to examine adolescents' time in out‐of‐school settings as a precursor of three types of problematic substance use in adulthood (i.e., binge drinking, regular marijuana use, and use of illicit drugs). Method: Adolescents (N = 978) reported the time they spent in four common out‐of‐school settings at ages 15 and 18: unsupervised time with peers, organized sports, other organized activities, and paid employment. At age 26, participants reported binge drinking, marijuana use, and illicit drug use. Results and Conclusions: Adolescents' time in out‐of‐school settings during high school predicted age 26 substance use over and above family and adolescent factors, including adolescents' substance use during high school. Adolescents' unsupervised time with peers increased the odds and frequency of binge drinking and regular marijuana use at age 26. Time in high school organized sports increased the odds of binge drinking at age 26, but not marijuana or illicit drug use. Time spent in other organized activities, such as community service and the arts, lowered the odds of illicit drug use whereas paid employment in high school was not related to age 26 substance use. Aligned with Bornstein's specificity principle, time spent in specific out‐of‐school settings during adolescence were differentially related to substance use problems in early adulthood, with some activities serving as a risk factor and other activities serving as a protective factor for young adults.

AB  - Social development and stress process theories suggest that participation in one's community can function as a Protective factor for menial health, especially for youth from socioeconomically disadvantaged areas. However, the effects of community involvement on adolescent menial health could vary across racial/ethnic groups and levels of neighborhood disadvantage. The objectives of this paper are to: (1) examine the effects of various types of community involvement on adolescent mental health, and (2) assess the extent to which race/ethnicity and neighborhood disadvantage moderate the effects of community involvement on adolescent mental health. Using data from two waves (1994195 and 1996) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health ("Add Health," N= 7,863), multilevel (hierarchical) linear models were estimated that tested for interaction effects of race/ethnicity and neighborhood disadvantage. The types of community participation that impacted adolescent mental health varied across racial/ethnic groups. Neighborhood interaction and religious participation were salient for both White and Hispanic teens, but the impact of religious participation for Whites was moderated by neighborhood disadvantage. Non-sport extracurricular activities and employment were the salient factors for Black teens, both of which were moderated by neighborhood disadvantage. The findings from this study have implications for community-level and clinical interventions to prevent and/or treat mental health problems among adolescents. Social integration interventions should take into account adolescents' cultural backgrounds and socioeconomic contexts in order to be effective. (c) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Participation in extracurricular activities is purported to protect the broad spectrum of youth from a host of behavioral risks. Yet, empirical research on the extent to which this assumption holds for involvement in violence by immigrant youth is limited. Thus, using data for 13,236 (51.8% female) adolescents from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, this study explores how the relationship between extracurricular activities and youth violence varies by type of extracurricular activity profile (sports alone, non-sports alone, and a combination of sports and non-sports) and by generations of immigration (first, second, and third-plus). The sample is composed of 9.3% (n = 1,233) first-generation youth, 15.7% (n = 2,080) second generation, and 74.9% (n = 9,923) third-plus generation. The results reveal that adolescents from the third-plus generation (i.e., non-immigrant youth) who participate in non-sports alone or sports plus non-sports have lower odds of involvement in violence than adolescents from the same generation who do not participate in extracurricular activities. However, for first-and second-generation adolescents, participation in extracurricular activities is associated with higher rather than lower odds of violence compared to their non-participating counterparts. These findings challenge the viewpoint that participation in mainstream extracurricular activities as afforded by US schools is equally beneficial for all youth. They also call for additional research that explores why immigrant youth are less likely than non-immigrant youth to gain violence-reducing benefits when they participate in extracurricular activities.

AB  - Purpose. The purpose of the review was to describe current knowledge regarding relationships between physical activity (PA) and depressive symptoms among adolescents. Conclusions. Inverse relationships were found between PA, particularly sports participation, and depressive symptoms. Limitations of the current research are discussed, including measurement issues. A major gap exists regarding research with youth at high risk for depressive symptoms and low levels of PA, including older, low-income, minority females. Future research should focus on high-risk populations such as youth attending alternative high schools. Practice Implications. Nurses should consider promoting PA among middle and older adolescents as a way to prevent depressive symptoms and consider integrating PA into care plans for those experiencing depressive symptoms.

AB  - In this study, it is aimed to analyze the correlation between depression levels and the attitudes towards addictive substances of the students participating and not participating in sports who live in Hendek district of Sakarya province and to determine if sports have an effect on depression and attitudes towards addictive substances. Also by using Vocational and Technical High schools and Anatolian High schools, it became possible to see the effect of school type. Furthermore, the effect of sociodemographic variables such as sex, grades, marital status of parents, and branch of sports, duration and frequency of participation in sports, income level, and number of siblings was researched. The study group consists of 326 students and "Demographic Information Form" developed by the researcher, "Beck Depression Inventory" and "Attitude towards Addictive Substances Scale" were used as data collection tools. The obtained data was statistically analyzed by using SPSS 25.00 program. While no difference was observed in depression symptoms for the individuals participating and not participating in sports in the general frame, it is determined that the individuals participating in sports has a higher interest in addictive substances when compared to their peers who do not participate in sports. Moreover, this negative attitude towards addictive substances is higher in male students and in the students who study at Vocational and Technical High schools.

AB  - This report presents findings from a two-year quasi-experimental evaluation of the "AfterZone"--a citywide system-building effort in Providence, Rhode Island, that aims to provide high-quality, accessible out-of-school-time services to middle school youth. The AfterZone model is unique in that it is built on a network of "neighborhood campuses" anchored by one or two middle schools; this structure provides youth the opportunity to participate in sports, arts and skills-enhancing programs in both community- and school-based settings. The report summarizes the patterns of youth participation in the AfterZone during the two-year period (in terms of amount, breadth and engagement); examines the benefits youth experience from participating after one and two school years; and presents implications for funders, policymakers and program leaders interested in implementing their own citywide out-of-school-time system. Appended are: (1) Measures; (2) Attrition; (3) Analyses; (4) Effect Sizes; (5) Accounting for Baseline Group Differences; (6) Subgroup Analyses; (7) Two-Year AfterZone Participants; (8) Participation Analyses; and (9) Correlations Among Dimensions of Participation.

AB  - After considering suicide from four theoretical perspectives - sociology, psychology, social-psychology and theology - a database of 33,135 young individuals (aged 13-15) in England and Wales was interrogated to discover whether churchgoing provides protection against suicidal ideation. Following the Durkheimian notion that suicide is associated with social isolation and making use of the Eysenckian three-dimensional model of personality, analysis indicated a statistically significant protection offered by churchgoing. Further analysis concentrated on vulnerable pupils. In this instance, vulnerable pupils are those who have been bereaved by the loss of at least one parent. After taking personality variations into account, church attendance is shown to offer significant protection against suicide, while the protective effects of team sports are insignificant. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - This project seeks to identify what factors can account for patterns of delinquency, with special attention given to the role of organized sports. We used The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), a school-based sample of adolescents collected for the purpose of measuring the impact of social environment on adolescent health and social behaviors. The framework for this study rests on the social bond theory of delinquent behavior and social psychology of sports research. We hypothesize that organized sports participation, as a measure of involvement, mitigates youthful delinquent outcomes, as do attachment to parents and friends. Our findings indicate that social bond theory is not sufficient to explain the relationship between sports and delinquency, and social psychological approaches provide some context for understanding outcomes and conceptualizing sport as a complex domain for both exerting and experiencing social control. Although some involvement with sports does not produce an increase in delinquency, being a highly involved athlete is generally associated with higher levels of delinquency.

AB  - Background Lower socioeconomic status is associated with poorer wellbeing among children. Identifying how children participate in after-school activities and how after-school activities are associated with wellbeing may inform interventions to improve wellbeing among children from low socioeconomic backgrounds. This study explored whether children's after-school activities varied by socioeconomic status and examined the associations between after-school activities and wellbeing in low socioeconomic status children. Methods This study analysed cross-sectional data from 61,759 school students in years 4 to 9 who completed the 2018 South Australian Wellbeing and Engagement Collection. Students reported the number of days per week they participated in 12 activities (after-school care, homework, music lessons or practice, youth organisations, sports, television, videogames, social media, reading, chores, arts and crafts, and socialising with friends) during the after-school period (3-6 pm) and their wellbeing (happiness, sadness, worry, engagement, perseverance, optimism, emotion regulation, and life satisfaction). Socioeconomic status was measured by parents' highest education level obtained from school enrolment data. Linear multilevel models were used to examine whether frequency of after-school activities varied by socioeconomic status. Multilevel ordered logit models were used to analyse the association between after-school activities and wellbeing amongst participants in the low socioeconomic status category. Results After-school activities differed according to socioeconomic status; high socioeconomic status children did more frequent sport, homework, and reading and low socioeconomic status children did more frequent screen-based activities (TV, videogames and social media). Among children from low socioeconomic status backgrounds, higher wellbeing was associated most consistently with more frequent sports participation, homework, reading and spending time with friends and less frequent videogames, social media and after-school care. Conclusions Children's wellbeing is positively associated with socioeconomic status. Amongst children from disadvantaged backgrounds, participating in sport, spending time with friends and getting less screen time may be protective for wellbeing. The results suggest that programming targeted at increasing sports participation and reducing screen time amongst children from low socioeconomic status backgrounds may support their wellbeing.

AB  - Many intervention programs, including physical activity programs, have been developed to deal with youth involvement in delinquency. The current study explored whether youth participation in sport and physical activity programs reduces their involvement in delinquent behaviors. It examined the interaction effects of the features of the sports program with participation in the sports program. The sample consisted of 126 Israeli adolescents aged 13-18 (M = 15.68, SD = 1.32) who completed questionnaires about involvement in delinquency at the beginning of their sports program and again 6 months later. We found significant reductions in adolescents' involvement in all the delinquent acts explored: crimes against a person; crimes against property, and public disorder crimes. However, no interaction effects were found between program features (sport type; program intensity; training and supervision in the program; and interaction with community services) and participation in the sports program. The findings highlight the importance of including sports programs in the interventions provided for at-risk youth and call for further investigation of the factors that may increase the benefits provided by participation in physical activity programs.

AB  - Examined associations between the extent of participation in endurance sport, and self-report data on self-image, physical and psychological health and overall lifestyle in a large representative sample of German high-school students. 988 German adolescents (47.2% males and 52.8% females, aged 14-18 yrs) were administered a series of questionnaires aimed at assessing anxiety-depression, trait addiction, smoking and drinking behavior, physical ill-health reports, and self-perception of self-image, parental acceptance and educational attainment. Regular practice of endurance exercise was related to a more favorable self-image. There was a strong association between participation in sports and the type of personality that tends to be resistant to drug and alcohol addiction. Physical exercise was further significantly related to scores for physical and psychological well-being. Adolescents who engaged regularly in physical activity were characterized by lower anxiety-depression scores, and displayed much less social behavioral inhibition than their less active counterparts. It is likely that discussion of recreational or exercise involvement may provide a useful point of entry for facilitating dialogue among adolescents about concerns relating to body image and self-esteem.

AB  - Background: The purpose of this study was to show how participation in leisure-time physical activity changes between ages 13 to 23, and to what extent engaging in specific types of sports tracks into young adulthood. Methods: The sample comprised 630 subjects who responded to questionnaires at age 13, with seven follow-ups over a 10-year period in the Norwegian Longitudinal Health Behaviour Study. The associations between adolescent participation in global and specific types of leisure-time physical activity were examined by analyses of variance, regression analysis and growth curve analysis. Results: The findings suggest that the transition from adolescence to adulthood is, on average, a period of decline in physical activity, but with the decline levelling off into adulthood. The decline was significantly greater among males than females. There were substantial individual differences in the amount of change, in particular among males. Conclusion: The observed variation in change might suggest a need for a more targeted approach, with a focus on subgroups of individuals. The group of inactive youth may be considered as a high risk group, and the findings suggest that adolescent males who are inactive early seem likely to continue to be inactive later.

AB  - This article examines the extent to which participation in high school interscholastic sports contributes to male violence. Deriving competing hypotheses from social control, social learning, and masculinity theories, I use data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health to test if (1) type of sport and (2) peer athletic participation, contribute to the risks of male serious fighting. Contrary to social control expectations, analyses suggest that athletic involvement fails to inhibit male violence. Moreover there is a strong relationship between contact sports and violence. Football players and wrestlers, as opposed to baseball, basketball, tennis, and other athletes, are significantly more likely than nonathletic males to be involved in a serious fight. Additionally, the direct effect of football is explained by the football participation of individuals' peers. Males whose friends play football are more likely to fight than other males, supporting perspectives that emphasize peer contexts as important mediators. Overall, findings are consistent with the expectations of social learning and masculinity arguments. The theoretical and policy implications of these results are discussed.

AB  - Background: Understanding time trends in risk factors for substance use may contextualize and explain differing time trends in substance use. Methods: We examined data (N = 536,291; grades 8/10/12) from Monitoring the Future, years 1991-2019. Using Latent Profile Analyses, we identified six time use patterns: one for those working at a paid job and the other five defined by levels of socialization (low/high) and engagement in structured activities like sports (engaged/disengaged), with the high social/engaged group split further by levels of unsupervised social activities. We tested associations between time use profiles and past two-week binge drinking as well as past-month alcohol use, cigarette use, cannabis use, other substance use, and vaping. We examined trends and group differences overall and by decade (or for vaping outcomes, year). Results: Prevalence of most substance use outcomes decreased over time among all groups. Cannabis use increased, with the largest increase in the group engaged in paid employment. Vaping substantially increased, with the highest nicotine vaping increase in the high social/engaged group with less supervision and the highest cannabis vaping increase in the highly social but otherwise disengaged group. Substance use was lowest in the low social groups, highest in the high social and employed groups. Conclusions: While alcohol, cigarette, and other substance use have declined for all groups, use remained elevated given high levels of social time, especially with low engagement in structured activities or low supervision, or paid employment. Cannabis use and vaping are increasing across groups, suggesting the need for enhanced public health measures.

AB  - Participation in organized activities has been largely regarded as beneficial for academic and socioemotional development for adolescents, but the impacts of various types of organized activities for adolescents at risk for maltreatment have been rarely tested. In this study, we investigated the differential impacts of five types of maltreatment exposure (physical maltreatment, sexual maltreatment, neglect, other type, and multiple types) on the associations between four types of organized activities (mentored groups, art and music clubs, sport clubs, and academic clubs) and academic and socioemotional development (school engagement, delinquency, depressive symptoms, and trauma symptoms) of adolescents who were investigated by Child Protective Services (CPS) for maltreatment exposure. Data came from a national, longitudinal sample of 790 adolescents in contact with CPS in the U.S. After controlling for demographic characteristics of participants and prior levels of each outcome, multiple linear regression models were fitted to the data with interactions between the organized activities and the maltreatment types. The main findings of this study included: 1) adolescents who participated in mentored groups, sport clubs, and academic clubs reported higher levels of school engagement; 2) adolescents who participated in academic clubs reported fewer depressive symptoms; 3) adolescents who participated in art and music clubs reported more trauma symptoms compared to non-participants; and 4) the effects of participation in mentored groups on delinquency and trauma symptoms differed by maltreatment type. These results indicate both possible benefits and risks of organized activity participation for adolescents with certain maltreatment exposures.

AB  - Objectives This study investigated the correlation between sports club activities and well-being and physical health parameters in 10-12 years old boys. Design Cross sectional. Setting Danish schools. Participants 2293 boys took part in the study. Primary and secondary outcome measures Questionnaires on participation in sports clubs and well-being and testing of physical health profile through measurement of body composition, resting heart rate (RHR), blood pressure and postural balance, jump and Yo-Yo IR1C performance. Data were analysed by participation in sport and according to the five most frequently reported sports. Results Boys enrolled in sports clubs had higher physical well-being (51.7+/-9.7 vs 45.9+/-8.7) and psychological well-being (53.3+/-9.6 vs 51.4+/-10.0), experienced more peers and social support (50.9+/-9.9 vs 48.0+/-11.6), and had a more positive perception of the school environment (48.6+/-7.5 vs 45.9+/-8.1) than boys not involved in sports clubs. In addition, they showed better Yo-Yo IR1C (+46%), long jump (9%) and balance test performance (+20%). The boys active in sports clubs had higher relative muscle mass (+6%) and lower fat percentage (-3%), body mass index (-6%) and RHR (-5%) compared with boys not involved in sports clubs (p<0.05). Boys enrolled in football clubs had higher aerobic fitness compared with boys not active in clubs (+11%), handball players (+5%), swimmers (+8%) and badminton players (+7%). Moreover, the boys enrolled in football clubs had lower fat percentage (-17%) and higher relative muscle mass (+4%) than swimmers. Conclusion Boys participating in club-based sports showed markedly higher levels of well-being and better physical health profiles than boys not involved in sports club activities. Footballers had superior aerobic fitness and body composition compared with those active in other sports. Results suggest that sports club activities seem to be beneficial for young boys' well-being, fitness and physical health profile, with the greatest benefits achieved by boys involved in football.

AB  - School-based discipline can negatively shape the educational outcomes of students, particularly for racial and ethnic minorities. Because racial and ethnic minority youth are at risk for educational failure and marginalized within schools, academic and sport extracurricular activities are often presented as a means to ameliorate educational risk factors. Little is known, however, about the relationship between involvement in these activities and school-based discipline, particularly for racial and ethnic minority youth. This study uses data from the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 and incorporates multilevel modeling techniques to examine whether the relationship between academic and sport extracurricular activities, misbehavior, and school-based discipline varies by race and ethnicity. This study suggests that while academic and sport extracurricular activities reduce the likelihood of school-based discipline for White students, the relationships for racial and ethnic minority are complex. The implications of the racial and ethnic disparity in school-based discipline in the United States are discussed.

AB  - Although adolescents experience an array of out-of-school time (OST) settings, research has primarily focused on these settings in isolation. This study examined time in four OST settings (unsupervised time with peers, paid employment, sports, and nonsports organized activities) in relation to adolescent functioning at age 15 and the end of high school. Individual fixed effects analyses provided a more rigorous control of selection into OST activities by controlling for time-invariant observable and unobservable characteristics. More unsupervised time with peers predicted increases in risky and externalizing behaviors, whereas increases in paid employment predicted gains in work orientation and self-identity. Time in organized sports was associated with increased positive self-identity, highlighting the value of expanding consideration of multiple OST contexts and selection effects.

AB  - It is believed that sports, as a social institution, are one of the most critical extracurricular activities for adolescent as they teach the rules and disciplines. However, the effects of sports participation on adolescent development are still controversial at the level of theoretical and empirical perspectives in sociology and psychology. For this reason, this study focused on the causal relationships among sports activity, social and environmental factors, and juvenile aggression based on empirical research to examine the effects of sports on adolescents. For this purpose, this research used the Korean Children & Youth Panel Survey (KCYPS) which surveyed 2378 adolescents by multi-stage stratified cluster sampling from 98 schools across South Korea. The data was analyzed by reliability analysis, correlation analysis, exploratory factor analysis, multiple regression, and path analysis with SPSS ver. 23.0 program for Windows. The results were as follows: Firstly, sports activity had a statistically significant effect on the sustainable social environmental factors, and teacher and friend relationships. Secondly, it was found that sustainable social environment had a statistically significant effect on juvenile aggression toward others and oneself. Lastly, sports activity also showed an indirect effect on juvenile aggression toward others and oneself. This means that sports activity affects juvenile aggression through a sustainable social environment. In detail, more sports activity could positively improve one's relationships with teachers and friends and then reduce aggression toward both others and oneself.

AB  - In order to study whether participation in sports has a protective impact on suicidal behaviour in students, the data from 11 Youth Risk Behavior Surveys were combined providing a sample size of 152,858 students. The results indicated that sports participation was a protective factor against suicidal behaviour for European-American boys and girls. However, for African-American, Hispanic-American and Asian-American girls, participation in sports might be a risk factor for suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. For boys from minority ethnic groups, participation in sports was not associated with suicidal behaviour.

AB  - This systematic review aims to provide an overview of the current knowledge regarding life skills development (LSD) and life skills transfer (LST) in sports programs serving adults in a socially vulnerable position. It identifies factors influencing LSD and LST in these sports programs, as well as possible differences in this regard between the various subgroups of social vulnerability. Potentially relevant studies were identified by searches of five databases, complemented by backward and forward snowballing. The 26 articles included reported the development of cognitive, emotional and/or social skills amongst socially vulnerable adults through participation in a sports program. In 20 studies, transfer was reported for at least one of the life skills developed. Potential factors that may influence the process of LSD and LST were related to the individual, the staff, the program design, the inherent demands of sport, a safe environment and social cohesion. Some differences in LSD and LST were found between subgroups of social vulnerable adults. However, because some subgroups were hardly represented, a comparison was difficult to make. This review showed that sports programs have the potential to help socially vulnerable adults develop and transfer life skills. Recommendations for future research are given.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to understand the usage patterns and correlates of illicit drug use among schoolchildren in Colombo district, Sri Lanka. Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out among grade 10 and 12 students using a self-administered questionnaire. Results: From the 6000 students selected, 5353(89.22%) responded. Betel chewing with tobacco was seen in 28.48% males and 10.44% females. Substances such as Barbul, Madana Modaka, and cough syrups that are not established as illicit drugs were used as psychoactive substances. Ingredients of some of these compounds are not fully understood or regulated. Prevalence of cannabis use was 3.85% in males and 0.24% in females. Studying nonscience subjects for Advanced Level, doing sports, low academic performance, and peer smoking significantly increased the odds of using one or more substances (P < .05). Conclusions: Many types of illicit substances were used by schoolchildren. More strategies to prevent further aggravation of these behaviors are needed. Constituents of some compounds are not understood and need further evaluation. Recognized high-risk groups can be targets for preventive and cessation programs.

AB  - This study examined the relationship between student use of substances and extent of participation in school and/or community sponsored sport or nonsport activity. The study also examined student substance use and extent of participation in sport or nonsport activity together with extent of employment. Data were provided by 24,699 public school youths who attended grades 6 through 12 and completed the 2001-2002 Duval Secondary Substance Use and Violence Survey: Knowledge, Attitudes, and Behaviors. Frequency tables, crosstabulation, chi-square tests, and loglinear analysis were used to analyze the data. The study found: (a) a higher percentage of respondents who participated in 11 or more hours of sport/athletic activity or nonsport activity reported using substances almost every day than did respondents who participated in 1-5 hours of activity; (b) a higher percentage of students reported using alcohol almost every day when involved in greater than 20 hours of work per week and 11 or more hours of sport/athletic or nonsport participation than did those with lesser involvement in activity in conjunction with work at any level. Extracurricular programs and student employment may function as protective factors in discouraging adolescent substance use. Extracurricular programs and student employment may also place the student at greater risk for substance abuse when such involvement exceeds 20 hours per week in work and more than 11 hours per week of extracurricular activity. While extracurricular programs and student employment should be designed and offered to encourage widespread student participation, extent of participation should be monitored to assure healthy participation.

AB  - Sport participation for youth with immigrant background is often argued to play an important role for migrant youth integration into their new host society. Although few well sampled longitudinal studies has been conducted. The aim of this study was to study the impact that sport participation has on two integration-related outcomes (problem behaviours and native friends) by using the Swedish version of the longitudinal CILS4EU study. The multi-group latent growth curve models showed that although youth active or starting in sport independent of immigrant background did less problem behaviours and had more native friends than their peers with the same immigrant background that was not engaged in sport. However, the trajectories were very similar and often very close to zero, which makes it difficult to claim that sport participation has any significant impact on integration in the Swedish society.

AB  - Objectives: To identify and describe existing evidence of the impact of sport and physical activity programs on social outcomes among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Design: Systematic scoping review. Methods: Nine scientific databases (MEDLINE, Scopus, SPORTSDiscus, PsycINFO, Informit, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), The Cochrane Library, The Campbell Library, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses) and grey literature were systematically searched for programs or activities that target Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and use physical activity and sport participation to improve one or more of six social and community outcomes of: (i) education; (ii) employment; (iii) culture: (iv) social and emotional wellbeing; (v) life skills: (vi) crime reduction. Results: Of the 1160 studies identified, 20 met the inclusion criteria and were published between 2003 and 2018. Most studies reported positive findings across multiple, broad outcomes of education (N =11), employment (N =1), culture (N =9), social and emotional wellbeing (N =12), life skills (N =5) and crime reduction (N = 5). Some evidence was found for increased school attendance and improved self-esteem resulting from physical activity and sport participation as well as enhanced aspects of culture, such as cultural connections, connectedness, values and identity. Conclusions: There is some evidence of benefit across the six social outcomes from physical activity and sport programs. This promotes their continuation and development, although critical appraisal of their methods is needed to better quantify benefits, as well as the generation of new evidence across indicators where gaps currently exist, particularly for employment and crime reduction outcomes.

Well-being, physical fitness, and health profile of 2,203 Danish girls aged 10-12 in relation to leisure-time sports club activity-with special emphasis on the five most popular sports. J Strength Cond Res 36(8): 2283-2290, 2022-This study investigated the relationship between leisure-time sports club activities and well-being as well as physical health parameters in 10-12-year-old Danish girls. Two thousand two hundred three girls took part in the study, which included questionnaires on participation in leisure-time sports clubs, well-being, Yo-Yo intermittent recovery level 1 children's test, long jump, balance tests, body composition, blood pressure (BP), and resting heart rate (RHR). Data were analyzed according to whether the girls participated in leisure-time sport and according to the 5 most frequently reported sports. Girls enrolled in leisure-time sports had higher physical well-being (49.3 +/- 8.6 vs. 45.2 +/- 8.3), psychological well-being (50.4 +/- 9.0 vs. 49.4 +/- 9.8), experienced more peer and social support (50.2 +/- 10.0 vs. 48.9 +/- 10.7), and perceived a more positive school environment (52.5 +/- 8.0 vs. 50.5 +/- 9.3), as well as showing higher Yo-Yo (+39%), long jump (+10%), and balance performance (+15%) than girls not involved in sport clubs. The girls active in sports clubs had higher relative muscle mass (+5%), lower fat percentage (-11%), body mass index (-5%), RHR (-3.4 b.min -1 ), and diastolic BP (-1.4 mm Hg) compared with girls not involved in sport ( p < 0.05). Girls who played soccer showed higher aerobic fitness compared with inactive girls (+67%), dancers (+39%), swimmers (+38%), and gymnasts (+16%). Gymnasts had a lower fat percentage than inactive girls (-19%), team handballers (-10%), swimmers (-12%), and soccer players (-4%). Girls participating in club-based leisure-time sports showed higher well-being and better fitness and health profiles than girls not involved in any sports club activities. Girls involved in soccer had better aerobic fitness and gymnasts a lower fat percentage.Copyright © 2020 National Strength and Conditioning Association.

AB  - The purpose of this cross sectional study was to predict feelings of belonging and social responsibility based on the motivational climate perceptions and contingent self-worth of children participating in urban after-school physical activity programs. Three-hundred and four elementary school students from a major Midwestern city participated. Based on multiple regression analyses we predicted 39 % of the variance in feelings of belonging largely due to perceptions of leadership emotional support and task climate and 31 % of the variance in feelings of social responsibility largely due to perceptions of a caring climate. Our findings support the importance of after school physical activity programs, which appear to provide nurturing environments that may contribute to feelings of belonging and social responsibility.

AB  - From the standpoint of the school settings, sport participation constitutes a key strategy concerning the manifestation of positive behaviors that result from the development of personal and social responsibility. Based on the TPSR model, the goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of an intervention geared toward teaching life skills through sport to youngsters who had been committed. The participants were evaluated before and after the intervention. After the initial evaluation, they were randomly assigned to the experimental and control groups. The experimental group took part in the community football program, while the control group attended physical education classes not based on the TPSR model. The experimental model consisted of 3 weekly sessions over the course of 6 weeks, which totaled 18 sessions. This investigation supplied empirical evidence concerning the potential of community sport programs in the teaching and development of life skills deemed necessary for an adequate reintegration of such at-risk youngsters. The model was shown to be valid both in stimulating changes of attitudes and in promoting the adherence to socially positive behaviors. The effectiveness of the model, as well as its unique approach, make its application attractive to both the youngsters and the professionals. This program facilitates the training of youngsters to act, in the sense of promoting both their autonomy and the acquisition of a system of ethics and moral values within a culture of responsibility for how decisions affect the individual and the community. Finally, this intervention generated empirical support in favor of the argument that sport constitutes a unique opportunity within the educational process to establish values, beliefs, attitudes, and practical habits pertaining relationships and cooperation that generate social responsibility in individuals.

AB  - Background: Sports participation, though offering numerous developmental benefits for youths, has been associated with adolescent alcohol use. Differences also exist between men/boys and women/girls in both sports participation and patterns of alcohol-related behaviors, but there are few longitudinal investigations of this relationship. Purpose: This study investigated the relationship between school-based sports participation and alcohol-related behaviors using data from a multiwave national study of adolescent men/boys and women/girls. Methods: Nationally representative data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, collected between 1994 and 2001, were analyzed in 2009 (n=8271). Latent growth modeling, accommodating the complex sampling design, was applied to examine whether participation in school-based sports was associated with initial levels and change in problem alcohol use over three waves of data collection. Results: After taking into account time-invariant covariates including demographics and other predictors of alcohol use, greater involvement in sports during adolescence was associated with faster average acceleration in problem alcohol use over time among youths who took part in only sports. The findings suggest, however, that the relationship between sports participation and problem alcohol use depends on participation in sports in combination with other activities, but it does not differ between men/boys and women/girls. Conclusions: Sports may represent an important and efficient context for selective interventions to prevent problem alcohol use and negative consequences of alcohol use among adolescents.

AB  - Adolescence is characterized as a period of change and adaptation typically marked by a decline in physical activity participation accompanied by an increase in substance use. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships among the type (team and individual activity) and intensity (high, medium, and low intensity) of physical activity and substance use (tobacco, marijuana, alcohol use, and binge drinking) in a sample of 738 adolescents. Results indicated differing relationships among study variables depending on the type and intensity of physical activity and the type of substance used. For instance, a positive relationship was found for physical activity intensity and alcohol use, but negative relationships were found for physical activity and tobacco and marijuana use. Collectively, the results reveal that the relationships between physical activity type and intensity and substance use are more complex than previously believed.

AB  - We examined social participation in organized clubs and groups from childhood to adolescence in a sample of young people from Dunedin, New Zealand. Groups were broadly categorized as "sports" and "cultural/youth" groups. While the results indicated high levels of participation in childhood with a decline over the ensuing adolescent years, path analyses suggested strong continuities in participation over time. Both family "active-recreational" orientation (ARO) and "intellectual-cultural" orientation (ICO) predicted participation, and mediated the effects of disadvantage on participation. Participation was significantly related to adolescent attachment to parents, friends and school/workplace, as well as self-perceived strengths, after controlling for early family disadvantage and social support.. peer attachment and literacy. The effect of participation in adolescence is to widen the "social convoy" to which young people are exposed as well as strengthening relationships within that convoy.

AB  - This article examines patterns of adjustment among urban middle-school children as a function of involvement in organized team sports. Four hundred twenty-three seventh-grade students (216 boys and 207 girls) reported on their involvement in sport, self-esteem, delinquent activity, and drug use during the year preceding the survey. Physical Education teachers rated social competence, shyness/withdrawal, and disinhibition/aggression. Compared with noninvolved children, sport-involved youth reported higher self-esteem and were rated by teachers as more socially competent and less shy and withdrawn. Sport-involved youth, including those in contact sports, were not rated as more aggressive than noninvolved children. And though sport-involved youth reported a slightly broader range of delinquent activities than noninvolved youth, sport-involved boys were actually less likely than noninvolved boys to have experimented with marijuana.

AB  - In this cross-sectional study, physical activity, sport participation and associations with well-being, anxiety and depressive symptoms were examined in a large representative sample of European adolescents. A school-based survey was completed by 11,110 adolescents from ten European countries who took part in the SEYLE (Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe) study. The questionnaire included items assessing physical activity, sport participation and validated instruments assessing well-being (WHO-5), depressive symptoms (BDI-II) and anxiety (SAS). Multi-level mixed effects linear regression was used to examine associations between physical activity/sport participation and mental health measures. A minority of the sample (17.9 % of boys and 10.7 % of girls; p < 0.0005) reported sufficient activity based on WHO guidelines (60 min + daily). The mean number of days of at least 60 min of moderate-to-vigorous activity in the past 2 weeks was 7.5 +/- 4.4 among boys and 5.9 days +/- 4.3 among girls. Frequency of activity was positively correlated with well-being and negatively correlated with both anxiety and depressive symptoms, up to a threshold of moderate frequency of activity. In a multi-level mixed effects model more frequent physical activity and participation in sport were both found to independently contribute to greater well-being and lower levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms in both sexes. Increasing activity levels and sports participation among the least active young people should be a target of community and school-based interventions to promote well-being. There does not appear to be an additional benefit to mental health associated with meeting the WHO-recommended levels of activity.

AB  - This study aimed to find possible links between an adolescent's extracurricular activities, leisure activities and substance use (cigarettes, alcohol and drugs). The data was collected in the spring of 2013, within a large project called CAST (Behaviors and Attitudes with regards to Health, among Youngsters from Cluj-Napoca). This study was conducted by the Social Work Department in collaboration with the Psychology Department of "Babes Bolyai" University from Cluj-Napoca. There were 1,105 adolescents involved in the study and the results show that leisure activities are not always "bad" for the adolescent; it really depends on the activity, the adolescent's peer group and what they like to do when hanging out. For instance, the results show that practicing sports can be protective against smoking and drug use, but not against alcohol use. On the other hand, extracurricular activities do not always work as protective factors for teenagers when it comes to substance use. Being part of a student's club proved to be a risk factor for smoking, drinking and drug use.

AB  - The impact of athletic participation on the academic, social, & social-psychological development of high-school girls is examined. A panel design & multistage sampling were used to assess the effect of athletic participation on perceived popularity, sex-role attitudes, psychological well-being, sociability, delinquency, academic achievement, educational aspiration, & extracurricular involvement. Data were obtained from transcript records & survey questionnaires administered during the Ss' sophomore (1980) & senior (1982) years (N = 5,669). Multiple regression analysis reveals that athletic participation was strongly related to extracurricular involvement, modestly related to perceived popularity, but only slightly related to delinquency & educational aspiration. Athletic participation was not related to psychological well-being or sex-role attitudes. 4 Tables, 1 Appendix, 46 References. HA

Analysis indicates that athletic participation enhanced popularity & involvement in extracurricular activities, but was unrelated to grades, standardized test scores, or educational expectations in the senior year. Depending on school geographic location -- urban, suburban, or rural -- athletic participation was significantly related to lower dropout rates for some minority youth. Athletic participation is discussed as a social resource & academic resource, & only one of many institutional forces impacting the lives of US minority youth. 2 Tables, 1 Appendix, 16 References.

AB  - This study examines patterns of organized activity and their concurrent association with academic achievement, problem behavior, and perceived adult support in a sample of urban, early adolescent, middle school students (mean age = 13.01; N = 2,495). Cluster analyses yielded six activity profiles: an uninvolved group (n = 775, 31.1%), a multiply involved group (n = 247, 9.9%), a sports group (n = 469, 18.8%), a church group (n = 486, 19.5%), a school and community clubs group ( n = 278, 11.1%), and a community clubs and sports group (n = 240, 9.6%). These profiles are differentially associated with academic achievement, problem behavior, and adult support. While some form of organized activity is generally associated with more positive outcomes, the school and community and community and sports profiles also report the highest levels of delinquency, drug use, and school suspensions. Results support the utility of using person-centered approaches to studying youth-organized activities.

AB  - Objectives: To examine whether a diverse range of both structured and unstructured routine activities is associated with offending, and whether activities have crime-specific effects. Method: Data on 15-year-olds from the fourth wave of the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime were analyzed (minimum n = 3,064). Principal components analyses identified core routine activities. Random intercepts logistic regression models examined their associations with assault, fare evasion, shoplifting, vandalism, and drug use. Results: Core routine activities identified were hanging around with friends locally, hanging around away from home, nightlife, cultural and consumer activities, and involvement in youth clubs and sports. All had associations with offending, though effects varied by offense. For example, involvement in youth clubs and sports was positively associated with assault and fare evasion; involvement in nightlife was positively associated with assault and drug use; and hanging out with friends locally was positively associated with assault, shoplifting, and vandalism. Conclusions: It is theorized that the varied targets and facilitators present in different activity settings help account for study results. Findings are limited by the cross-sectional character of data analyzed and may be influenced by selection effects. They would benefit from further testing with longitudinal data.

AB  - Purpose: To describe adolescent binge drinking trajectories across grades 8-11 and examine their associations with pubertal timing, socioeconomic status (SES), and structured activity and sport involvement. Methods: Longitudinal data were analyzed from the Youth Activity Participation Study (YAPS), an annual survey of youth in 39 schools across Western Australia (N - 1,342). Results: Latent class growth analysis revealed four binge drinking trajectory groups: Accelerating (early onset, increased frequency), Steep Increase (delayed onset, rapid escalation), Slow Growth (delayed onset, gradual increase) and Stable Low (abstinence). Accelerating was characterized by early pubertal timing, low SES, and more sport involvement in grade 8, relative to Stable Low. The groups did not significantly differ in their grade 8 activity participation. However, for early maturers, greater grade 8 activity participation was associated with a decreased probability of belonging to Steep Increase relative to Stable Low. Conclusions: Early pubertal timing and sports participation increased the odds of belonging to a problematic binge drinking trajectory. For youth at-risk due to early pubertal timing, structured activities appear to be protective against a problematic developmental course of binge drinking.

AB  - The current study sought to explore the long-term outcomes associated with participation in extracurricular activities for at-risk adolescents. Participation was divided into four categories; sports, non-sports, multiple (sports and non-sports), and no activity. Psychological, educational/economic, and deviant behavior outcomes were measured, and the major conclusion that emerged from was that participation in high school extracurricular activities (especially multiple activities, including both sports and non-sports activities) was associated with a number of positive long-term effects in a variety of domains. With a few notable exceptions that deserve further inquiry, participation in high school extracurricular activities appeared to be beneficial for at-risk youth and should be encouraged by parents, in the way of modeling, verbal praise and encouragement, financial resources, time, etc., and by communities, in the way of funding, opportunities for low-cost activities, and through the promotion of an active/involved lifestyle starting in childhood.

AB  - Adolescents spend only a fraction of their waking hours in school and what they do with the rest of their time varies dramatically. Despite this, research on out-of-school time has largely focused on structured programming. The authors analyzed data from the Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002) to examine the out-of-school time activity portfolios of 6,338 high school sophomores, accounting for time spent in school clubs and sports as well as 17 other activities. The analytical sample was balanced with respect to sex and racially and ethnically diverse: 49% female, 67% White, 10% Latino, 10% African American, and 6% Asian and Pacific Islander. Approximately 76% of the sample attended public schools, 30% were in the highest socioeconomic quartile, and 20% were in the lowest socioeconomic quartile. The authors identified five distinct out-of-school time activity portfolios based on a cluster analysis. The demographic profiles of students by portfolio type differed significantly with respect to sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, school type and location. Students by portfolio type also differed significantly in terms of measures of academic success, school behavior, victimization and perceptions of school climate, controlling for covariates. These findings underscore the importance of more complex considerations of adolescents' out-of-school time.

AB  - Objective: This scoping review investigates the literature to understand what is known about the relationship between sport participation and aggressive and violent behaviors in youth. Method: We reviewed the literature to summarize evidence and identify gaps in published research. The study was guided by the Joanna Briggs Institute framework for conducting systematic scoping reviews. Results: Findings suggest that there is an association between youth populations and sport contexts and that other mechanisms and factors (e.g., social environment, social agents, performance/winning) influence the onset of and/or adherence to aggression and violent behavior. Younger male youth of color who live in urban communities and participate in competitive, team-based contact sports may be at higher risk for aggressive and violent behavior. Conclusions: By understanding the relationship between sport and violence, social workers and other service professionals who use sport as an intervention and/or work with youth within sport systems can more intentionally design and facilitate these settings to enhance the healthy development of all youth, particularly those most at risk for the onset and/or adherence of behavioral health problems.

AB  - Background: The many negative consequences and high rates of use associated with youth binge drinking make further study into its causes and correlates vital. Sport participation is a relevant factor in predicting drinking behaviors among youth in need of further research. Objectives: The current study tests the influence of specific types of sport participation on the binge drinking behaviors of African American youth through binary logistic regression. Study of this particular sample is vital as race and sport participation have been shown to be critical variables associated with variations in drinking behaviors. Results: Results indicated that various types of sport participation were uniquely associated with drinking behaviors. Conclusion/Importance: Results are framed through social learning, social bond, and the power sport hypothesis in accordance with previous research.

AB  - Background: The fields of public health and allied health, including athletic training, are rarely informed by the other. Yet, the allied health profession of athletic training (AT) is well positioned to support public health efforts in reducing health disparities in underserved and vulnerable youth populations. This project aims to assess the feasibility of inclusion of ATs in existing public health interventions that target youth from the aforementioned populations, as well as examine the impact of trauma and the social determinants of health on various aspects of sport and youth athletes.Objectives: Aim 1: To determine the distribution of schools served by School Based Health Centers (SBHCs) and ATs and the geographical characteristics of these schools; Aim 2: To establish the prevalence of adverse childhood experiences in adolescent athletes and their impact on negative behavior in athletes; Aim 3: To assess the impact on community socioeconomic status on interscholastic sport offerings in the St. Louis region.Methods: Aim 1 This analysis used a national survey of SBHCs and ATs, along with school district data to investigate the distribution of these services to high schools in the US and specifically the St. Louis region as well as identify common demographics. Aim 2 This analysis used pooled cross-sectional data from the National Survey of Children's Health. Regression models and latent class analysis were used to examine the relationships between ACEs, sports and youth aggressive behavior (Bullying). Aim 3 Interscholastic sport data for each school and school district in the St. Louis region was obtained and, with census data, spatial relationships between community characteristics and interscholastic sport opportunities by school districts were explored. Spatial regressions were conducted to assess the association between community characteristics and sport diversity (SDI).Results: Aim 1 SBHCs in the St. Louis region were concentrated in predominantly Black/African American and low-income areas, which is in line with the population that SBHCs were created be a health resource for. Aim 2a&bThis analysis provides evidence linking a potential gradient in ACEs and youth sports participation. ACE exposure in adolescents is associated with reduced odds of sport participation. Aim 2c LCA revealed 6 unique classes of ACEs, most of which were significantly associated with increased odds of all levels of the bullying spectrum. The joint effect of the interaction between sports and the latent ACE classes was significant, indicating that sport does moderate the relationship between ACE risk classes and bullying. Aim 3 The SDI demonstrated that there are unequal opportunities for sport participation within St. Louis region school districts. School districts with predominantly Non-Hispanic Black students had lower diversity of sports compared to school districts with predominantly Non-Hispanic White students.Implications for public health: The results presented across these three aims support the overall theme and hypothesis of this work: there is a salient intersection of sports medicine and public health. This exists not only through the obvious clinical junctions but also via the examination and understanding of the impact of policy, through the role of neighborhood context i.e. location, on the inequitable distribution of resources. Resources, inclusive of healthcare and equitable access to opportunities, have the potential to improve youth lives across the continuum. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Extracurricular activities are important in many young people's lives and have been associated with positive academic, psychological, and social outcomes. However, most previous research has been limited to school-based activities in the North American context. This study expands existing literature by analyzing longitudinal data from more than 1,300 young Maori and European New Zealanders, using propensity score matching techniques to control for selection effects. Results suggest that youth participating in community-based activities experienced greater social support than nonparticipants. For Maori youth, participating in nonsports activities was associated with later benefits, while for New Zealand European youth, benefits were associated with sports activities. Participants of different ages reported different types of benefits. These findings highlight points of similarity and difference between New Zealand and North American youth and provide a better understanding of the positive impacts of community-based activities for young people. © 2012 American Psychological Association.

AB  - Introduction: Youth with refugee backgrounds experience social and socioeconomic difficulties that arise following resettlement. Research has found that sport participation generally provides youth with a protective milieu that is especially beneficial for the most disadvantaged youth. Accordingly, the current study examines whether sport participation is related to positive psychosocial outcomes for resettled adolescent refugees, and if these effects are greater for those living in socioeconomically disadvantaged communities. Method: Data were from a large, nationally representative cohort of refugees recently resettled in Australia (Building New Life in Australia study, BNLA). Self-reported social and emotional wellbeing was collected from 415 youth who entered the country as refugees (M-age = 14.04, SD = 1.99) at three years post settlement were used. Results: A moderated regression analysis indicated that refugee youth living in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods who participated in sports reported significantly better outcomes compared to those refugee youth in economically similar neighborhoods who did not participate in sport. In contrast, refugee youth residing in more socioeconomically advantaged communities had better developmental outcomes, regardless of sport participation. Conclusions: Sport participation is a protective factor for youth with refugee backgrounds. Community socioeconomic disadvantage moderates this relationship, whereby stronger effects were observed for adolescents in more disadvantaged communities. Protecting the most disadvantaged in our society is a human rights imperative, and the current study indicates that sport participation could contribute to these efforts among resettled refugee populations.

AB  - Introduction Extracurricular activity participation is associated with positive academic, health, and behavioral outcomes for adolescents, but these findings may reflect unobserved confounding rather than participation effects. Method Data were drawn from 3885 adolescents aged 12-15 in a nationally representative cohort of Australian adolescents. Effects of participation in three kinds of extracurricular activity (team sport, individual sport, and arts) on an array of outcomes were modeled using fixed-effects regression to account for potential unobserved confounding. Results Strong bivariate relationships between all forms of activity participation and positive adolescent outcomes were found. These associations were much smaller in the fixed-effects analysis, but beneficial effects of sports for mental health and arts for peer group characteristics remained statistically significant. Minimal effects of extracurricular activity participation for academic achievement were found. Conclusion Extracurricular activity participation has beneficial effects on adolescents' mental health and exposure to peers' delinquent behavior.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sport and physical activity is generally believed to be beneficial to young people's psychosocial health, but the scientific evidence seems equivocal. This article gives a narrative review of recent developments in the literature on psychosocial health effects of physical activity and sport among children and adolescents. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Based on a narrative review of a selection of metaanalytical and key studies, results in four areas of psychosocial functioning are presented. RESULT(S): Findings support an association between involvement in physical activity and sport and well-being. Physical activity is associated with lower levels of mental health problems, and seems to promote self-esteem. Physical activity as a treatment of mental health problems for this age group is underexplored and no firm conclusions can be made. The evidence with respect to effects on cognitive and academic functioning is weak. Further, the evidence that juvenile delinquency and antisocial development could be counteracted is equivocal. INTERPRETATION: There is a paucity of studies that can confirm any causal effects. Future research would benefit particularly from studying the role of sports and physical activity mode as well as the psychological and social context in which it may produce beneficial psychosocial outcomes.

AB  - Background Health risk behaviour is rife among school learners in the Western Cape province. This paper assesses risk and protective factors related to health risk behaviours among high school learners. Method: Longitudinal data were sourced from 2950, 2675 and 2230 at Time 0, Time 1 and Time 2 among grade 8 learners aged 13-18 years between 2012 and 2013. Health risk behaviours were assessed on alcohol consumption, smoking cannabis in the past six months, and ever having sexual intercourse. The sociodemographic variables examined were age, sex, residence, socioeconomic status (SES), family structure and population group. Contextual variables studied were the feeling of learners about the intervention program, participation in religious activities, paid casual work and school sports. Descriptive statistics, bivariate associations and binary logistic analyses predicting health risk behaviours were carried out using generalized linear mixed models after restructuring the data collected at different time points.Result Health risk behaviours increased consistently for alcohol consumption (25.7-42.7%), smoking cannabis (10.4-22.1%) and (22.3-36.0%) engaging in sexual intercourse. Increasing age emerged as a risk factor for all the health risk behaviours: alcohol consumption [OR:1.3 (1.2-1.4), p < 0.001]; smoking cannabis [OR:1.3 (1.2-1.4), p < 0.001] and had sex [OR:1.5 (1.4-1.7), p < 0.001]. Participation in paid casual work also predicted health risk behaviour: alcohol use [OR:1.5 (1.2-1.8), p < 0.001]; smoking cannabis [OR:1.3 (1.0-1.7), p < 0.05] and sex [OR:1.4 (1.1-1.7),p < 0.01]. High SES and feelings about the EPEP programme enhanced alcohol consumption and smoking cannabis. Smoking cannabis was augmented by residing in an urban area. Participation in school sports was associated with increased alcohol consumption and engaging in sexual intercourse. Participation in religious activities was protected against alcohol consumption [OR:0.7 (0.53-0.83), p < 0.001]; and sex [OR: 0.5 (0.4-0.7), p < 0.001]. Being a female and belonging to a coloured population group diminished engaging in sexual intercourse, and the family structure of both parents attenuated involvement in smoking cannabis.Conclusion The findings of the study on risks and protective factors on health risk behaviours mirror those of school-based programmes in developing countries. Learners who participated in paid work and school sports are at risk of adverse health outcomes. Furthermore, participation in religious practices and family structure roles in attenuating health risk behaviours should be integrated and considered in the school-based intervention programme.

This research examined whether students' engagement in particular school activities increased or decreased the likelihood of being bullied while at school. Data for this research were drawn from the Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002) and utilized the base year's nationally represented stratified sample (N = 7,990). Associations were examined between various activities of 10th grade public school students-including classroom-related activities, club, interscholastic sports, intramural sports, and misbehavior-and their likelihood of being bullied while at school.

AB  - Social bond theory suggests that strong bonds to school influence better outcomes on measures of educational progress and success. However, we know little about the relationship between social bonding to school and dropout for racial/ethnic minorities, or how this relationship varies across school settings. We examine how five types of social bonding (attachment, academic and sports involvement, commitment, and belief) influence the likelihood of dropout for racial/ethnic minorities in urban, suburban, and rural schools using national survey data. Results suggest that strong social bonds to school have the potential to mitigate some of the observed racial/ethnic gaps in dropout risk; however, the opportunity to form such bonds, as well as the strength of their protective effects, vary by student race/ethnicity, type of social bond, and school location.

AB  - A number of risk factors have emerged as important correlates of adolescent substance use. In addition, research continues to focus on which factors act as mediators protecting adolescents from negative outcomes. One of these protective factors is religiosity, and the focus of this paper is to examine its role in the life of adolescents in postsocialist Hungary, where active religious participation was highly discouraged until a decade ago. The sample of adolescents (N = 1240) consists of middle and high school students living in Szeged, Hungary. The calculated odds ratios for the relationship between religiosity, and other protective factors, and substance use revealed that smoking, drinking, and marijuana use among boys and marijuana use only among girls were related to religiosity. Group membership, for example, participation in school clubs, sports clubs, or religious groups, seems to be more important for boys compared with girls. A more careful examination of the protective role of religion in postsocialist Hungary could be extremely important in a country where both adult and adolescent smoking and alcohol use is among the highest in Europe.

AB  - Sports involvement for youth, generally, promotes academic progress and success; however, little is known about the relationship between interscholastic school sports and punishment. This study utilizes a nationally representative stratified sample of 11,320 tenth grade public school students and incorporates logistic modeling techniques to examine whether interscholastic sport participation moderates the relationship between race, ethnicity and school punishment. Findings indicate that participation in interscholastic sports does play a role in school punishment. Most notably, interscholastic sports participation is a protective factor for Black/African American and White American students while it is a risk factor for Latino American and Asian American students. The implications of the school punishment patterns for racial and ethnic minority student athletes in the United States school system are discussed more generally [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Justice Policy Journal is the property of Center on Juvenile & Criminal Justice and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

AB  - On the basis of a socialization theoretical model this contribution looks at two comparisons. One, the comparison between adolescents who are actively engaged in sports and those who are not and, secondly, the comparison between individual and team sports. These comparisons are based on various health relevant and delinquent types of behavior as well as stress-theoretically important resources. Data is based on 602 adolescents between fifteen and eighteen years of age who participated in a standardized survey. The data evaluation was done using mean comparisons, multiple regression analyses, and a structure-comparison model. The findings show that sport participation has a suppressive potential towards alcohol and drug consumption and theft as well as a promoting change in respect to nutritional and dental hygiene behavior. The picture with regard to social support as a resource is rather ambivalent. The comparison between the types of sport leads to a more positive result in favor of those who participate in individual sports. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between sports participation and self-reported violent, delinquent, and aggressive behaviors in rural high school populations. Three-hundred and thirty-eight athletes and non-athletes from four rural high schools completed the YRBSS and the Conflict Behavior Scale (CBS). The results indicated that: (a) males demonstrated similar violent and delinquent behaviors to other urban and suburban populations, (b) male non-athletes reported significantly more assaults, trouble at school, drinking while driving, trouble with the police, and marijuana use than male athletes, and (c) female athletes reported significantly less and male athletes reported significantly more aggressive behaviors than their non-athlete counterparts on the CBS. These data illustrate that violent, delinquent, and aggressive behaviors do exist in rural populations, but that sports participation does not necessarily influence higher rates of these behaviors.

AB  - This article examines the impact of physical-sports activities on the psychological wellbeing of Spanish and Colombian young people. Scientific literature highlights that young people devote leisure time to sports for the purpose of enjoyment, and to maintain good health and body image. In addition, it provides the opportunity to socialize, and come into contact and connect with people who have shared interests. It is also an ideal resource for learning and developing social skills to ensure inclusion and the appropriate strategies for emotional management. Similarly, it favors the learning of values that promote the assumption of responsibilities, decision-making capacity, tolerance to frustration, and the development of resilience. This study considers the inherent benefits of physical-sports activities in order to analyze the impact on young people's assessment of their own psychological wellbeing. To this effect, a quantitative ex post facto study was designed, and Ryff's Model of Psychological Wellbeing was used with 1,148 young people from Spain and Colombia aged 16-21. The young people were asked whether or not they performed any type of physical-sports activity in their leisure time and the type of activity performed. The results show that young people who perform such activities have higher overall levels of psychological wellbeing. In turn, they emphasize that the perform of physical-sports activities has a positive impact on three of the dimensions of psychological wellbeing: self-acceptance, positive relations with others, and purpose in life. In addition, significant differences in young people's psychological wellbeing were found depending on whether they perform individual, team or other physical-sports activities. These results provide a basis for the proposal and design of interventions with young people based on sports and leisure activities as socio-educational strategies.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the prospective association between leisure-time physical activity practice at 11 years of age and incidence of school failure from 11 to 15 years of age. Method(s): The sample comprised >4,300 adolescents followed up from birth to 15 years of age participating in a birth cohort study in Pelotas, Brazil. The incidence of school failure from age 11 to 15 years was calculated by first excluding from the analyses all subjects who experienced a school failure before 11 years of age, and then categorizing as "positive" all those who reported repeating a grade at school from 11 to 15 years of age. Leisure-time physical activity was measured using a validated questionnaire. Result(s): The incidence of school failure was 47.9% among boys and 38.2% among girls. Adolescents in the top quartile of leisure-time physical activity practice at 11 years of age had a higher likelihood of school failure (OR: 1.36; 95% CI: 1.06, 1.75) compared with the least active adolescents. In adjusted analyses stratified by sex, boys in the top quartile of leisure-time physical activity practice at 11 years of age were also more likely to have failed at school from age 11 to 15 years (OR: 1.60; 95% CI: 1.09, 2.33). Conclusion(s): Adolescents allocating >1,000 min/wk to leisure-time physical activity were more likely to experience a school failure from 11 to 15 years of age. Although this finding does not advocate against physical activity promotion, it indicates that excess time allocated to physical activity may jeopardize school performance among adolescents. © 2012 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

AB  - The effects of athletics on the concern for physical health & community norms of 4,941 seniors from 30 high schools in 6 northeastern states were investigated. Correlational analysis of responses to a 227-item questionnaire measured phases of social, athletic, drug, & school activities. Five hypotheses were tested: (1) the greater the number of sports participated in, (A) the lower the rate of illegal substance use, (B) the lower the rate of alcohol use, (C) the lower the rate of cigarette use, & (D) the fewer the number of problems resulting from substance use; (2) participation in out-of-school sports is associated with a greater diminishment of illegal substance, alcohol, & cigarette use than is participation in U or intramural sports. Only hypothesis (2) regarding diminished use of cigarettes was upheld, but the correlations were small, accounting for less than 3% of the variance. Participation in all types of sports thus affects use of mood-altering drugs very little. 4 Tables, 21 References. HA.

AB  - This document describes a longitudinal study of the role of sports in the lives of minority youth during the 1980s. Data were analyzed from the High School and Beyond study and all findings were proven to be statistically significant after multiple regression analyses. The term "athletes" refers to those individuals who reported participating on varsity athletic teams both in their sophomore year (1980) and in their senior year (1982); "nonathletes" refers to individuals who either participated only in the sophomore year or not at all. The following findings are discussed: (1) minority athletes are more active in the affairs of their schools and communities than nonathletes; (2) Black and Hispanic athletes scored higher on standardized tests than nonathletes; (3) athletic participation was significantly related to lower dropout rates for Black males and Hispanic females in rural schools and for Whites in suburban school, but demonstrated no "holding power" in urban schools; (4) the upward mobility of minority athletes after high school is limited compared to that of Whites, with the exception of Hispanic female athletes; (5) females benefit from sports much the same as males; and (6) high school athletes stay involved with sports as young adults. Recommendations for educational policy are included. The appendices provide statistical data on 14 graphs, a discussion of the research methodology, and a list of the members of the policy advisory board. (FMW)

AB  - Over 15% of adolescents in the US have used opioids or stimulants in the past year without a prescription. Research suggests that sports participation is a predictor of adolescent illicit opioid and stimulant use; however, these studies are atheoretical. This study fills this gap by using a national sample to use social learning theory and self-control theory, to examine adolescent use of nonmedical opioids and stimulants. The study also examines the relationship between sports participation and drug use. Findings indicate social learning and low self-control predicts adolescent use of stimulants and opioids; however, sports participation was not significant. The manuscript concludes by discussing the finding's implications.

AB  - The relationship between athletics and delinquency is investigated with emphasis on whether the relationship changes when differentiating between types of delinquent behavior. The overall findings indicate a negative relationship between athletic participation and juvenile delinquency. Data supports the deterrent hypothesis and indicates that athletes on the whole tend to be less delinquent than non-athletes. This study suggests that the association between athletics and delinquency is a function of the degree of athletic participation, the type of offense committed, and the social class background of the subjects tested. Data obtained in this research are appended in tabular form. (JD)

AB  - Although several studies have reported a negative association between interscholastic athletic participation and delinquent behavior, research has failed to take account of the social psychological processes underlying the relationship. Consequently, the purpose of this study was to analyze the dynamic processes underlying the relationship between participation in interscholastic athletics and delinquent behavior. The study evaluated the relative contribution of 12 sociopsychological variables in the etiology of delinquent behavior among male and female athletes and nonathletes. Of the total sample of 1,693 high school students, 788 (442 males and 346 females) were classified as athletes. Overall, the results indicated that a similar pattern persists in the etiology of delinquent behavior among male and female athletes and nonathletes. Several differences were also found in the etiology of delinquent behavior among male athletes and nonathletes, female athletes and nonathletes, and male and female athletes.

AB  - Objective: To determine whether being both vigorously active and a team sports participant or being vigorously physically active but not a team member is associated with substance use and sexual risk behaviors. Design: Cross-sectional, using data from the 1999 national Youth Risk Behavior Survey. Participants: A nationally representative sample of 15 349 US high school students. Main Outcome Measures: Sexual risk behaviors and substance use among those who were both physically active and team sports participants, physically active but not on a sports team, physically nonactive but on a sports team, and physically nonactive and not on a sports team by sex and race/ethnicity. Results: Nationwide, 41.9% of the students were both physically active and participants on a sports team, 22.1% were physically active but not sports team members, 12.6% were physically nonactive sports team members, and 22.3% were physically nonactive and not sports team members. More female (mean [SD], 29.3% [2.2%]) than male students (15.3% [1.9%]) were nonactive, and more male students were both physically active and participants in team sports (48.9% [3.4%]) than were female students (34.8% [3.2%]). Black students were more likely to be physically nonactive in both the team and nonteam categories than were students overall. Relative to nonactive nonteam female students, physically active female students on sports teams were less likely to be substance users or engage in sexual risk behaviors than were active nonteam and nonactive team female students. Other associations were specific to racial/ethnic subgroups. Conclusion: Overall, being both physically active and a team sports participant was associated with a lower prevalence of several health risk behaviors.

AB  - This paper investigates the relationship between physical activity and depressed mood, under conditions of family conflict. We analyze data from a representative sample of 7232 Icelandic adolescents. Analysis of variance was carried out to test for main and interaction effects. The study shows that while family conflict increases the likelihood of depressed mood, among adolescents, physical activity decreases the likelihood of depressed mood. Furthermore, physical activity plays a more important role among those adolescents living in aversive circumstances, than other adolescents, as family conflict and physical activity interact in the effect on depressed mood for adolescents living in such circumstances. The findings highlight the role of physical activity in decreasing mental distress among adolescents, especially those living in aversive circumstances at home.

AB  - Youth violence is a serious problem in high schools throughout the United States. This study examined whether participation in high school sports serves as a protective factor against youth violence. As identified by the U.S. Surgeon General and many current research studies, school bonding is a significant protective factor for youth violence. School bonding is the building of connections between the student and the school institution, school staff and peers at school. This study used the basis of the social development model to inspect students' bonds to school through participation in high school sports programs. This quantitative study gathered data concerning high school students' sports participation, feelings of school bonding and violent behavior using the 2009 Youth Risk Behavior Survey administered by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The independent variable was participation in high school sports while the dependent variables were self-reported school bonding and incidents of violent behaviors. T tests were used to measure the mean differences in reported levels of school bonding and incidents of violent behaviors for male and female athletes, and multiple regression analyzed the relationship between sports participation and school bonding. The results supported the social development model by indicating a relationship between school bonding and lower incidents of violent behavior; however, participation in high school sports had no relationship with lower violent behavior or school bonding. This research was designed to contribute to the current body of knowledge related to school bonding through interscholastic sports opportunities in an effort to assist schools in reducing violent behaviors in high schools.

AB  - This paper explores the relationship between sport participation and adolescents alcohol and substance use in the context of other peer activities. Focusing on sport participation we analyze data from a nationally representative sample of Icelandic adolescents, exploring the variation in the use of alcohol and illegal drugs between three different types of adolescents subcultures taking both the family and the school context into consideration. The findings show that alcohol and substance use varies significantly between peer groups, based on what kind of leisure patterns they engage in. More importantly, the findings show that adolescent engaging in sports are less likely to use alcohol and drugs even if they come in contact with alcohol and drug using peers. The findings suggest that it is important to understand adolescents' sport in the context of other peer leisure activities that define the modern adolescent society.

AB  - Objective: To examine the relationship between alcohol and tobacco use and sports in a national sample of secondary students. Methods: This cross-sectional study enrolled a representative sample of secondary students from public and private schools from all 27 Brazilian state capitals. Students were assessed in 2010 by a self-report questionnaire including questions on drug use and sport activity in the last month (n = 13,872). Results: Subjects who played sports exhibited a higher frequency of alcohol use and heavy episodic drinking than their peers who did not play sports. Practices that were associated with higher odds of heavy episodic drinking in the last month included gym, weight training (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.0, 95% confidence interval [95%CI] 1.6-2.4), and soccer (aOR: 1.3, 95%CI 1.1-1.5). Fighting, martial arts, or capoeira were associated with smoking (aOR: 1.9, 95%CI 1.2-3.2). Conclusion: These results suggest a relationship between some sports preferences and a higher risk of alcohol or tobacco use among Brazilian secondary students. This relationship should be considered in preventive programs. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Despite the wide implementation of sport-based crime prevention programs, there is a lack of empirical knowledge on the effectiveness of these interventions. This study evaluated a Dutch sport-based program in N = 368 youth at risk for juvenile delinquency. Intervention effects were tested in a quasi-experimental study, comparing the intervention group with a comparison group using multiple sources of information. The study was conducted under conditions that resemble real-life implementation, thereby enhancing the relevance of this contribution to practitioners. The primary outcome was juvenile delinquency, measured by official police data. The secondary outcomes were risk and protective factors for delinquency, assessed with self- and teacher reports. A significant effect was found on one delinquency measure. The intervention group consisted of fewer youth with police registrations as a suspect than the comparison group (d = -0.34). We did not find an intervention effect on the number of registrations as a suspect in each group. In addition, no significant intervention effects were found on the secondary outcomes. Implications for theory and practice concerning the use of sport-based crime prevention programs are discussed.

AB  - To identify factors potentially protective against involvement with additional illicit drugs among adolescent users of marijuana, a cross-sectional, secondary analysis of a national data set of Swiss adolescents (N = 9,268, ages 15-20 in 1992/93) was performed. Potentially protective factors were examined in bivariate relationships & analyzed in a multiple regression model. Communicating well with a parent was significantly associated with not having progressed to use of illicit drugs. Other significant protective correlates for boys were academic achievement, type of education (school vs apprenticeship), confiding in a family member, & regular participation in a sports club. A cross-sectional analysis identified the quality of relationships within the family & factors related to school associated with lack of progression of illicit substance use. However, longitudinal studies are needed to confirm these associations & aid in the design of interventions targeting the enhancement of protective factors among young people already at risk for serious substance use. 6 Tables, 41 References.

AB  - Background: Research has shown that sports participation is positively related to youth developmental outcomes, but it is still unknown if sports participation relates to these outcomes among socially vulnerable youth. Hence, this research aimed to examine the relationship between sports participation and youth developmental outcomes (i.e., problem behaviour, pro-social behaviour, school performance, subjective health, well-being, self-regulation skills, and sense of coherence) for socially vulnerable youth. In addition, the stability of the relationship between sports participation and the youth developmental outcomes were investigated with a six-month interval. Methods: Two identical questionnaires were administered with a six-month interval by youth professionals from four youth organisations, measuring the youth developmental outcomes and sports participation rates of socially vulnerable youth. In total, 283 socially vulnerable youths (average 14.68 years old) participated at baseline and 187 youths after six months. Results: The results showed that sports participation was positively related to pro-social behaviour, subjective health, well-being, and sense of coherence at both measurements. We found no evidence for the relationship between sports participation and problem behaviour and the self-regulatory skills. In addition, sports participation was only positively related to school performance at the first, but not at the second, measurement. Conclusions: The results of this study show that there are positive relationships between sports participation and several youth developmental outcomes. Based on the current data no conclusions can be drawn about the causal relationship between sports participation and youth developmental outcomes. Given the focus of policymakers and health professionals on sport as a means to achieve wider social and educational outcomes for young people, including in the Netherlands, further research is needed to shed light on the relationship between sports participation and youth developmental outcomes for socially vulnerable youth, with a special focus on this group's heterogeneity.

AB  - Objectives: This cross-sectional study examined the effect of school-level structural social capital on smoking and drinking among Japanese youth. Methods: Self-administered anonymous questionnaires were distributed to 3248 students at 29 high schools across Okinawa, Japan in 2008. Structural social capital was measured by students’ participation in organized activities: student council, extracurricular activities, volunteer activities, community sports clubs, and youth associations. Contextual-level social capital was measured by aggregated school-level individual responses. Results: At the individual level, extracurricular activity participation was negatively associated with smoking and drinking, whereas participation in youth associations was positively associated with smoking and drinking. School-level extracurricular activity participation was negatively associated with smoking among boys, whereas school-level participation in youth associations was positively associated with smoking among boys and girls and drinking among boys. Conclusions: This study suggests that structural social capital measured by participation in organized activities, especially extracurricular activities, might be an important way for youths to attain good health. This study also supports the idea that particular type of activities, such as youth associations, can lead to the so-called 'dark side of social capital'.

AB  - Background: Suicide ranks as the third leading cause of death for adolescents. Recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicate that the adolescent suicide rate increased 18% between 2003 and 2004. Sport may represent a promising protective factor against adolescent suicide. This study examined the relative risk of hopelessness and suicidality associated with physical activity and sport participation. Methods: Data from the CDC's 2005 Youth Risk Behavior Survey were analyzed. Logistic regression modeling was used to compare the odds of hopelessness and suicidality in students who engaged in various levels of physical activity to inactive students. Similar analyses were performed comparing risks of athletes to nonathletes, and the risks of highly involved athletes to nonathletes. Results: Findings showed that frequent, vigorous activity reduced the risk of hopelessness and suicidality among male adolescents. However, low levels of activity actually increased the risk of feeling hopeless among young females. Yet, for both males and females, sport participation protected against hopelessness and suicidality. Conclusion: These findings indicate that involvement in sport confers unique psychosocial benefits that protect adolescents against suicidality. Findings suggest that mechanisms other than physical activity contribute to the protective association between sport and reduced suicidality. Social support and integration may account for some of the differences found in suicidality between athletes and nonathletes. (Contains 5 tables.)

AB  - Background: Most research regarding sport participation and suicide risk found protective relationships. However, all studies in this area were based on cross-sectional designs. Objective: To fill a gap in research by exploring associations between sport involvement and suicide ideation and attempts (suicidality) based on a 5-year longitudinal, population-based study. Study group: Participants (n=739) completed surveys in middle school and high school. Methods: Logistic regression analysis compared suicidality during high school across four groups: youth who participated in sport in both middle and high school, youth who participated only in middle school or only in high school, and youth who did not participate in sport during adolescence. Results: Compared to non-participants, youth involved in sport in both middle and high school had lower odds of suicidal ideation during high school. Youth who discontinued sport after middle school had higher odds of attempting suicide during high school than non-participants. Conclusions: Remaining involved in sport throughout adolescence can offer mental health benefits. Future research should identify mechanisms that account for protective relationships between involvement in sport throughout adolescence and suicidality, and identify factors that explain deleterious relationships for youth who discontinue sport early in adolescence.

AB  - The extant research has revealed inconsistent findings concerning the efficacy of the sport-as-deterrent assertion, and has simultaneously overlooked the impact of sport on the lives of minority adolescent girls. The purpose of this study was to explore the impact of sport on associations with delinquent peers and individual delinquent behaviors among African American (Black), Hispanic, and European American (White) adolescent girls. Level of sport participation, peer delinquency, and individual delinquency, conceptualized as vandalism (e.g., indirect), verbal threats (i.e., verbal), physical altercations (e.g., physical), and alcohol use were assessed via anonymous self-report. Although sports participants reported lower levels of individual delinquency, they also reported more peer delinquency. Path analysis results suggest that sport was negatively related to the indirect, threat-related, and physical subtypes of individual delinquency for all racial/ethnic groups. However, sports participation was significantly related to alcohol use only for European Americans. Overall results suggest that the deterrent properties of sport may differ between racial/ethnic group and type of delinquent behavior. Furthermore, study evidence suggests that some athletes may associate with delinquent peers, yet do not engage in a similar set of behaviors.

AB  - The purpose of this study that focused on African American high school girls was threefold. First, the relationship of sports participation and victimization was explored. Second, the impact of sports participation on self-esteem was assessed. Third, the role of self-esteem and its disaggregated components (social acceptance, competence, and self-confidence) as mediators of the relationship between sports participation and victimization was examined. In accordance with the sport protection hypothesis, it was hypothesized that sports participation would be related to enhanced self-esteem and reduce victimization. Results suggest that sports participation appears to have some relationship to lower rates of victimization. There was also support for our assertion that sports participation was related to enhanced self-esteem. Finally, overall self-esteem and, specifically, the individual component competence mediated the relationship between sports participation and victimization. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - This project examines the relationship between sports participation, gang associations, and delinquency among a diverse sample of rural high school girls. It was hypothesized that girls who participated in sports would have less gang involvement and lower rates of individual delinquency. Each of these hypotheses were partially supported by the findings. A number of variations in outcomes and strength of relationships were impacted by race/ethnicity. Results suggest that sports participation was negatively related to gang involvement for all participants, but the weakest relationship was found among White youth. The impact of sport on individual delinquency was not consistent. Findings are discussed in the context of various theoretical constructs (differential association, social control) which underlie the notion of sport-as-deterrent.

AB  - Objective. To assess the likelihood of smoking among adolescents with different patterns of team sport participation, grades 9-11. Methods. Adolescents (N = 1,098) participating in a longitudinal study of the biobehavioral predictors of smoking adoption completed items assessing various health-related behaviors, including team sport participation and smoking practices. General growth mixture modeling (GGMM) was used to analyze the data. Results. Four patterns of team sport participation were found. Adolescents with decreasing or erratic participation were nearly three times more likely than adolescents with high participation to be current smokers in eleventh grade. Nonwhites were at particular risk for decreasing and erratic patterns of participation, and later smoking. Females were at high risk for low team participation. Conclusion. Results suggest that multiple patterns of team sport participation can be identified with GGMM and that these patterns may be useful in characterizing individuals at particular risk for future smoking.

AB  - This study examined the associations between levels of frequency and enjoyment in various extracurricular activities and mental health status during adolescence. More specifically, the associations were examined within the domains of social withdrawal, somatic complaints, anxiety, depression, social problems, thought problems, attention problems, aggressive behavior, and delinquent behaviors as measured by the Child Behavioral Checklist (CBCL). The study was a secondary analysis of data that were originally collected by The National Institute of Child Health and Development (NTCHD): Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development. The sample included 973 adolescents and their parents who were assessed when the child was in Grade 6, and again, at the 9 th grade. The first aim of this study was to identify family experiences during middle childhood that may be contributing factors to extracurricular participation later in adolescence. Furthermore, this study aimed to analyze specific differences between various extracurricular activities and the correlation they may have with mental health status. Results of correlational and regression analyses indicated that children who participated in family activities showed higher levels of extracurricular participation. Secondly, significant associations were found between adolescent participation in a variety of activities (versus participation in only one activity) and lower levels of reported behavioral symptoms. In addition, enjoyment of extracurricular activities, compared with frequency of participation in the activities, was associated with lower problem behaviors across multiple mental health domains. However, frequency of participation did demonstrate some significant relationships with adolescent mental health outcomes. For example, higher frequency of sport activities was associated with lower levels of somatic complaints for both male and female adolescents. Lastly, in the analysis examining type of extracurricular activities, sport and volunteering activities were associated with less symptoms of problem behaviors, while music/dance activities were not associated with adolescent mental health outcomes. In addition to these findings, this study also examined the differential relationships of extracurricular activities on male versus female adolescents. Results indicated that both male and female adolescents demonstrated lower symptoms in various mental domains when they participated in sport activities, while participation in volunteer work was only associated with lowering symptoms for female adolescents. Ultimately, this study reinforced the idea that extracurricular activities may play vital roles in various mental health outcomes during adolescence. While data from this study can certainly be helpful in changing the way we view or implement extracurricular activities in school, the information can be extended beyond the confines of the educational grounds. Extracurricular activities are important elements seen in facilities such as Residential Treatment Centers and Juvenile Delinquent Centers.

AB  - Examined the age distribution of alcohol and intoxication debut and factors associated with this among a representative sample of Norwegian teenagers. A sample of 3,368 teenagers aged 12-18 yrs was recruited from 34 schools to complete an 87-item questionnaire under examination conditions; 5.2% reported drinking alcohol for the first time when 10 yrs or younger, 25.2% when they were 13 yrs or younger and 60.1% when 16 yrs or younger, with 39.9% having never drunk alcohol; 1.3% were first intoxicated by 10 yrs or younger, 12.8% when 13 yrs or younger and 37.5% when 16 yrs or younger. Ss with early alcohol or intoxication debut (<14 yrs) tended to come from single-parent families, from cities, experienced less family support and a more highly organized family life, reported more frequent peer and parental drinking, and did not participate in sports. They also showed a substantially elevated total yearly current alcohol consumption, compared to the group with alcohol debut at 14 yrs or later. Poor family support but high family organization, living in single-parent families and in cities, and more frequent parental and peer drinking are associated with early alcohol debut, whereas participation in organized sport activities may delay drinking.

AB  - The current world wide phenomena of youth suicide which became a major issue for countries in the early nineties, is still growing exponentially. The Sports Challenge program was initiated in 1992 in Western Australia to identify 'at risk' children and adolescents who display: a low sense of basic trust, a sense of shame and doubt, a sense of inferiority and a sense of identity confusion with common characteristics of low self esteem. The subsequent program is based on a strong statistical paradigm encompassing current and historical information with reliable and objective evaluation measures. To this end, since 1992, Sports Challenge has been recognised as a 'World Best Practice' in redressing the issue of 'at risk' children and adolescents. The program now operates in over 150 schools and communities throughout Australia and 24 schools and Detention Centres in Singapore. This paper will allow a window into the development of the program and the successful transfer of the project into Singapore. The Singapore study which began in 1996 has revealed the success of the Sports Challenge program cross culturally with improvement in self esteem and self concept of 'at risk' groups in the range of 18% to 44%.

AB  - Past research has demonstrated an association between financial hardships and risk-taking behaviors (defined as delinquent or transgressive acts). However, this effect may differ based upon the provision of protective spaces, like those offered in extracurricular activities. In the current study, we examined the longitudinal effect of financial hardships on risk-taking in a sample of Australian adolescents (N = 3,852). We found experiences of financial hardship at the age of 12/13 predicted higher risk-taking 2 years later. Further, a longitudinal indirect effect was observed, where financial hardships were associated with higher risk-taking 4 years later via increased exposure to risk-taking peers. Non-sporting activity participation (e.g., debating, dance) was found to offset the risks associated with experiencing financial hardships. Participation in sports was not significantly related to any of our outcomes. Our data highlights how the provision of non-sporting activities may improve behavioral outcomes, especially among more financially disadvantaged adolescents.

AB  - While the concept of social capital has rekindled interest in fundamental issues of social inquiry, concerns have been raised regarding its definition and application in increasingly diverse topics. We address these concerns by revisiting Coleman's and Bourdieu's original ideas of the role of family and school in adolescent outcomes. Multi-level modelling reveals that controlling for individual background, parental relations and adolescent activities, school levels of intergenerational closure and cultural activities are predictive of higher maths grades, while school levels of intergenerational closure, supervised activities and sports participation are predictive of less alcohol use. The results support the general thrust of social capital theory and suggest further theoretical elaborations.

AB  - Estimated cumulative incidence of the start of smokeless tobacco use in a nationally representative cohort of young persons and identified sociodemographic, environmental, behavioral, and personal predictors of experimentation with or regular use of snuff or chewing tobacco. Data were derived from the 1989 Teenage Attitudes and Practices Survey and its 1993 follow-up. The study included 7,830 Ss aged 11–19 yrs. During the 4 yrs, 12.7% of Ss first tried smokeless tobacco, and 4% became self-classified regular users. Cumulative incidence was highest for male non-Hispanic Whites. Predictors of regular use included age, geographic region, use of smokeless tobacco by a person in the home, perceived use by peers, cigarette smoking, participation in organized sports or physical activity, self-described risk-seeking behavior, steady girlfriend, and perceived friends' approval or indifference.

By means of a specially designed questionnaire, a representative sample of 4,686 Slovene high school students of both sexes (14–19 yr olds), were assessed as to their general characteristics, suicidal ideation and behavior, family circumstances, self-appraisal of the problems and ways of solving them, engagement in sport, and exposure to suicide in their close circle. Numerous important differences were established between suicidal and nonsuicidal adolescents. The data gathered will help further research into suicidal behavior in adolescents.

AB  - The overarching goals of this project were to 1) extend the existing evidence on the longitudinal relation between physical activity and cigarette smoking, and 2) test an intervention model that uses physical activity promotion as a strategy to reduce smoking risk among adolescents. To achieve the first goal, nationally representative data from Add Health were analyzed using autoregressive cross-lagged models to assess the bi-directional, longitudinal relations between overall physical activity, sports participation and cigarette smoking from adolescence (12-19 years old) to early adulthood (25-32 years old). I found that adolescent smokers engaged in significantly less physical activity and were less likely to play sports one year later compared to non-smokers. Adolescent smokers were also significantly less likely to play sports in young adulthood compared to non-smokers. Total physical activity was not a significant predictor of future cigarette use at any time point. However, adolescents who participated in sports were significantly more likely to smoke one year later compared to non-sports participants. To achieve the second goal, a structured afterschool program was pilot tested and evaluated in two Uruguayan secondary schools using a quasi-experimental, pre-post design with a waitlist control group. The primary behavioral objectives of the program were to increase physical activity engagement and reduce smoking risk. The results of the effectiveness study were inconclusive, with no significant intervention effects observed. The study's small sample size (n=77) limited its ability to detect significant between-group differences. The process evaluation revealed that the program was feasible to implement in the target schools and demonstrated high fidelity of implementation and satisfaction among participants. Average student attendance was relatively low (61%), indicating that incentives should be considered to maintain participation over time. Recommendations for improving the content and delivery of the program were generated from these data. Interventions that successfully prevent cigarette use among adolescents may also have the potential to prevent future declines in physical activity. Afterschool programs hold great potential for improving adolescent health outcomes in the context of Uruguayan public schools. Their ability to impact physical activity levels and smoking behavior in this setting should be evaluated on a larger scale. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The empirical research examining the impact of sports participation on alcohol and other drug use has produced mixed results. Part of this problem may be the result of how different types of sports participation create different experiences that shape certain types of behaviors that either facilitate or deter substance use. We examined the association between different types of competitive sports participation and substance use among a nationally representative sample of adolescents. Two recent cross-sections from the Monitoring the Future were merged to capture a large subsection of adolescents who participate in either high-contact sports (football, wrestling, hockey, and lacrosse), semicontact sports (baseball, basketball, field hockey, and soccer), and noncontact sports (cross-country, gymnastics, swimming, tennis, track, and volleyball). Multivariate analyses revealed that adolescents who participated in high-contact sports had higher odds of using substances during the past 30 days and initiating substance use at early ages. Further, adolescents who participated in noncontact sports had lower odds to indicate smoking cigarettes and marijuana during the past 30 days. Parents, educators, and policy makers need to consider that some sporting contexts may be a catalyst to engage in risky behaviors like substance use. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Background: Despite numerous studies examining the association between competitive sports participation and substance use behaviors among adolescents and young adults, the use of standardized measures to assess potential substance use disorders has been largely neglected. The objective of this study was to examine if past involvement in interscholastic sports (competitive school-sponsored sports) was associated with potential substance use disorders in young adulthood. Methods: Data for this study were taken from the Student Life Survey (SLS). A total of 3442 young adults participated in the SLS during the spring semester in 2013, with 74% of males and 71% of females indicating participation in interscholastic sport during high school. Results: Respondents who participated in interscholastic sports during high school had higher odds of positive screens for potential alcohol use disorders when compared with their peers who did not participate in interscholastic sports. No association was detected between interscholastic sports participation and potential drug abuse disorders. Moreover, previous involvement in certain types of sports was found to be associated with positive screens for potential alcohol use disorders (i.e., crew and football) and positive screens for potential drug abuse disorders (i.e., lacrosse) among the sample of young adults. Conclusions: School and community sport organizations should be aware of the potential link between sports participation and potential substance use disorders, and may consider brief substance use screeners during yearly physicals to monitor potential substance use problems among athletes.

Methods: Secondary analysis of the nationally representative 2013 Youth Risk Behavior Survey (n = 13,583). Results: Boys who participated on sport teams had the greatest odds of engaging in extreme binge drinking. Discussion and Conclusions: Despite the modest associations found among athletes, boys who participated on multiple sport teams had the greatest odds of engaging in extreme binge drinking. Scientific Significance: Greater prevention efforts should target multi-sport athletes because they are at greater risk for negative consequences of heavy drinking.

AB  - The objective of this study is to examine how participation in different types of competitive sports (based on level of contact) during high school is associated with substance use 1 to 4 years after the 12th grade. The analysis uses nationally representative samples of 12th graders from the Monitoring the Future Study, who were followed 1 to 4 years after the 12th grade. The longitudinal sample consisted of 970 12th graders from six recent cohorts (2006-2011). The analyses, which controlled for 12th grade substance use, school difficulties, time with friends, and socio-demographic characteristics, found that respondents who participated in at least one competitive sport during the 12th grade had greater odds of binge drinking during the past two weeks (AOR = 2.04; 95% CI = 1.43, 2.90) 1 to 4 years after the 12th grade, when compared to their peers who did not participate in sports during their 12th grade year. Moreover, respondents who participated in high-contact sports (i.e. football, ice hockey, lacrosse, and wrestling) had greater odds of binge drinking (AOR = 1.80; 95% CI = 1.18, 2.72), and engaging in marijuana use during the past 30 days (AOR = 1.81; 95% CI = 1.12, 2.93) 1 to 4 years after the 12th grade when compared to their peers who did not participate in these types of sports during their 12th grade year. Accordingly, the findings indicate important distinctions in sport participation experiences on long-term substance use risk that can help inform potential interventions among young athletes.

AB  - Little is known about how adolescents' peer relations might alter whether sport participation is associated with alcohol use. Consistent with social learning theory, we found that sport participation was protective against alcohol use if these peers had low alcohol use, but athletes were likely to use alcohol if their sport friends and teammates had high alcohol use. Interestingly, those with no or low sport participation seemed to emulate the alcohol use of their non-sport friends, whereas adolescents in a high number of sports had elevated alcohol use regardless of their non-sport friends' alcohol use.

AB  - School-based extracurricular activity participation has been linked to positive behavioral and academic outcomes; however, little is known about the participation and outcomes of participation of Hispanic students, a group that is historically at high risk for school failure. As such, extracurricular activity participation characteristics and outcomes of a diverse group of middle school students were examined in this two journal article dissertation. First, participation differences between students based on student racial group membership and student sex were examined. Logistic regression was used to examine participation status differences (yes or no). Analysis of variance was used to examine participation intensity between student groups. Additionally, the effects of participation on outcomes related to adolescent peer groups, belongingness, and school membership were examined. Multiple regression models were utilized for this analysis, and consideration was given to interaction effects that would indicate whether groups of students (i.e. sex and race) benefited differentially from participation. Results indicated that, during the 7th grade, Hispanic students were significantly less likely to participate in sports-related extracurricular activities as compared to their Caucasian peers. However, no group differences in sex or race were found for participation intensity. Furthermore, participation in sports-related extracurricular activities was related to higher feelings of school membership for Hispanic and Black, but not White, students. In addition, participation in sports was related to Black students identifying a higher percentage of their friends as displaying prosocial behavior. Overall, the results suggested that while Hispanic students may have benefited more so than their White peers from participation, they participated at lower levels as a group. This highlights a currently under-tapped potential for intervention. Copies of dissertations may be obtained by addressing your request to ProQuest, 789 E. Eisenhower Parkway, P.O.

AB  - The authors investigated whether participation in school-based extracurricular activities would predict social and behavioral outcomes (school membership, peer prosocial orientation, and prosocial behavior) associated with school social capital in a group of Hispanic middle school students from the United States of America. Results of hierarchical linear regressions based on longitudinal data indicated that participation in sports-related activities was associated with increased feelings of school membership and peer prosocial orientation. Results are especially significant as Hispanic youth are at an increased risk for school failure and are less likely to have access to social capital in the home and community settings.

AB  - Adolescent alcohol and other drug (AOD) use is a serious problem in the United States which often results in grave consequences to individuals and society. Research into adolescent AOD use has traditionally focused on identifying risk factors that may aid in identifying youth in need of intervention and/or treatment for AOD problems. The resiliency perspective has developed as an alternative to the risk-factor orientation to research and intervention in adolescent AOD use. Researchers using the resiliency approach aim to provide insight into why many adolescents, despite exposure to multiple risk-factors, do not use substances. Examples of social resiliency factors proposed to be protective of adolescent AOD include volunteering, sports, religious, arts, and civic activities. Advantages of the resiliency approach have included simultaneous consideration of both risk and protective factors, examination of how multiple systems interact to affect young people, and efficacy in proactively preventing AOD use in adolescent versus addressing problems after they have been initiated. The purpose of this study was to identify social resiliency factors that may predict abstinence from the use of AOD in students attending Lucas County, Ohio, schools in grades 10 through 12 utilizing data from the 2006 Lucas County (Ohio) Alcohol and Drug Addiction Services (ADAS) Board Youth Alcohol & Other Drug Use Survey. The specific resiliency factors examined were participation in sports or athletic activities, arts or civic activities, religious activities, volunteering or community activities, and alcohol or drug prevention clubs. The drugs of abuse examined include tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana. A Chi square analysis was employed to examine if each resiliency activity (independent variables) was predictive of abstinence from the use of tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana use (dependent variables). Results supported previous research indicating that sports and athletic activities may be somewhat protective against use of cigarettes, but not for alcohol, especially in males. Significant results were found for females for arts and civic activities, religious activities, and volunteering and community activities. However, results for males for each of these resiliency factors were negative, with the exception of religious activity and marijuana. Significance for participation in drug and alcohol prevention clubs was not found for any group or substance. Differences in independent variable measurement issues may be factors in the lack of consistency in results. Non-participation in several of the resiliency activities was found to be associated with substance use, especially in females. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study tested the potential of a novel intervention addressing alcohol prevention within the context of a sport program. Study participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups, with one group receiving the sport consultation (Sport), a second the sport consultation plus an alcohol consultation (Sport Plus), and a third a sport consultation, alcohol consultation, and mailed parent print materials (Sport Plus Parent). Researchers recruited 465 eighth graders from three schools in the northeast Florida region to participate in the study. The Youth Alcohol and Health Survey(1) was used to collect data on alcohol and drug consumption, alcohol use risk and protective factors, and exercise habits at baseline and three-month post-intervention. Significant time effects (p's < .05) were found on three of six alcohol measures, both exercise measures, and four risk/protective factors, with all but one risk factor showing improvements over time. Time by assignment by current drinking status (yes/no) interaction effects (p's < .05) were found on alcohol initiation, length of alcohol use, quantity, heavy use, moderate physical activity, and four risk/protective factors, with preintervention drinking adolescents exposed to the Sport intervention showing the greatest improvements on all but two measures. Findings suggest that a brief sport-based screen and consultation tailored to adolescents' health habits, with and without parent materials, may potentially reduce alcohol use while increasing exercise frequency.

AB  - The primary research problem that prompted this study was to identify if involvement in interscholastic sports could be an option to alleviate financial burdens of delinquency and provoke a level of rehabilitation for youth. To provide context on this aforementioned financial burden, between 2018 and 2019, 5.56% or 696,620 youth in the United States aged 10–17 were arrested, (Puzzanchera, 2021). The cost of these arrests can be up to $407.58 per day per youth, and taxpayer dollars supplement this price tag. The purpose of this quantitative study was to examine the extent to which a relationship exists between juvenile involvement in interscholastic sports and juvenile delinquency while also looking at the number of sports seasons played. The theoretical foundation of this research was Hirschi's social control theory. The key research question was, to what extent does involvement in interscholastic sports and seasons played have an influence on involvement in delinquency? In this quantitative study, respondents between ages 18 and 22 were asked to respond to questions retrospectively, thinking about their high school experience. The sample population met inclusion criteria of age and participation in high school interscholastic sports. The data responses were collected through an online survey and were analyzed using SPSS software to conduct a binary logistic regression analysis. Results showed no statistically significant relationship between playing high school sports, the number of seasons played, and juvenile delinquent behavior. The findings of this study have potential implications for positive social change by educating families and various other stakeholders about delinquent behavior and the possibility of needing more interventions than sports participation to reduce its occurrence.

AB  - To study whether participation in organized sports during adolescence predicts increased smoking of tobacco, alcohol intoxication and cannabis use from late adolescence to adulthood when controlling for potential confounders. Moreover, to study whether such increased drug use varies according to type of sport (team versus individual), main skills needed (endurance, strength or technical) and level of competition. Survey of national sample of Norwegian high school students (aged 13-19 years) in 1992 (T1) followed-up in 1994 (T2), 1999 (T3) and 2006 (T4) ( n = 3251). Outcome measures included smoking of tobacco and 12-month prevalences of alcohol intoxication and cannabis use, respectively. Confounders included pubertal timing, friends' drug use, perceived social acceptance, grades and parental socio-economic status. Latent growth curve analyses showed that initial level of participation in organized sports predicted growth in alcohol intoxication. Those involved initially in team sports had greater growth in alcohol intoxication, but lower growth in tobacco use and cannabis use, during the adolescent and early adult years compared to those involved in technical or strength sports. Practising endurance sports, as opposed to technical or strength sports, predicted reduced growth in alcohol intoxication and tobacco use. Sports participation in adolescence, and participation in team sports in particular, may increase the growth in alcohol intoxication during late adolescent and early adult years, whereas participation in team sports and endurance sports may reduce later increase in tobacco and cannabis use.

AB  - Despite the numerous advantages associated with organized leisure-time activities, it has been argued that the participation fee may create a social selection situation where only young people from affluent families have access to the activities [40]. [...]the competition, discipline and hard work involved in several of these organized activities during early adolescence may undermine young people’s motivation and thus active participation [41]. [...]organized youth sport is seen as an arena, which promotes social integration and offers physical benefits from one’s participation, yet the inherent logic of competition in sports potentially creates losers and dissatisfaction and the notion that organized sport is a developmental asset for all could be a great myth [41,43]. According to Säfvenbom and colleagues [34], such “contexts may produce thriving young people, not in spite of, but because of involvement in contexts with no strict rules, no formal leaders and no a priori competence or performance goals” (p. 16). Furthermore, the fun factor and imaginative play, common in many self-organized PA are more likely to promote creativity, identity and self-actualization [47].

AB  - Introduction: The objective of this study was to examine the association between participation in school sports and substance use behaviors in both male and female high school students. Methods: The current study used cross-sectional data from 60,601 students from Year 6 (2017–2018) of the COMPASS study. Students reported their school physical activity participation (none, intramurals only, varsity only, both) and past 30-day substance use (binge drinking, cannabis use, cigarette use, e-cigarette use). Hierarchical logistic regression models predicted the odds of substance use, by sex. Results: 55% of students did not participate in any school sports and 32% reported substance use. Intramurals were negatively associated with cannabis use and cigarette use among all students and e-cigarette use among females. Varsity sports were associated with lower odds of cigarette use among all students and cannabis use among males. In contrast, participating in varsity sports was associated with increased odds of binge drinking and e-cigarette use among all students. Participating in both intramurals and varsity sports was associated with increased odds of binge drinking and e-cigarette use but with decreased odds of cannabis use and cigarette use. Conclusions: Intramurals were found to be protective against cannabis use and cigarette use among all students and e-cigarette use among females. Although varsity sports were protective against cannabis and cigarette use, they were found to be a risk factor for binge drinking and e-cigarette use. Substance use prevention efforts should be a focus among school varsity sports teams, especially for binge drinking and e-cigarette use. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: Previous research has found that physical activity has considerable potential to promote child development and, thus, should be of interest to social workers. An important gap in the literature regards the potential of school sports to increase academic outcomes. The goal of this cross-sectional analysis was to examine a partially mediated hypothesis linking school sports participation with academic achievement via positive body-weight image and global self-esteem. Method: Data are from a convenience sample of 3,186 students in the 6th to 9th grades from 14 schools in one North Carolina county. All measures were taken from the School Success Profile survey. Latent variable structural equation modeling was used with appropriate estimation methods for the nonnormal, ordinal, and clustered data. Results: The measurement model and structural models exhibited acceptable fit. Results indicate that school sports participation was significantly associated with academic achievement, positive body-image perceptions, and self-esteem. Overall, participation in school sports demonstrated a significant standardized effect (.225) on academic achievement. Comparison with an alternative model comprising only nonsports extracurricular-activity participation found that the school sports model was both distinct and preferred. Conclusions: Findings suggest that school sports may promote several outcomes of interest to social workers, and that social work research should further investigate the mechanisms underlying these relationships.

AB  - This study explores the relationship between social capital and adolescent violent behaviors for a national sample of secondary school students (N = 4,834). Cross-sectional data from The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health were used to evaluate multivariate models examining the family, school and neighborhood correlates of violent behaviors. Results demonstrate the importance of social capital factors across domains as significant resources moderating violence outcomes, especially parent-child relationships and school affiliation. Although we hypothesized that greater sports and club participation would decrease tendencies toward violence, results indicate otherwise.

AB  - This study aimed to explore associations of sport participation with anxiety and depressive symptoms among Chinese minority adolescents. A cross-sectional study was conducted among Chinese adolescents in Tibet. A convenience sample method was used to select participants. Finally, 1452 students completed the survey and 1421 (52.10% girls, Grades 4-9, 13.46 +/- 1.41 years old) adolescents met the inclusion criteria of analysis. Sociodemographic variables, sport participation, depression and anxiety were evaluated by self-reported questionnaires. Among 1421 participants, 80% of adolescents lived in rural area and more than four fifths of participants had siblings. The parent's education level of participants was mostly middle school and below. The prevalence of participating in sport more than 3 times per week was only 7%. More than one-third of adolescents reported they never engaged in sport and 36.5% of adolescents took part in sport 1-3 times per month. In comparison with participants who never engaging in sport participation, those who engaging in one to three time/month (OR = 0.71%, 95% CI: 0.54-0.93) and more than 3 times/week (OR = 0.50%, 95% CI: 0.32-0.79) were less likely to report severe depression symptoms. Compared with participants who never had sport participation, only those counterparts who engaged in sport more than 3 times/week had lower odds for severe anxiety (OR = 0.46%, 95% CI: 0.29-0.73). These results indicated that engaging in sport participation was negatively associated with depression and anxiety. There is an urgent need to improve the level of sport participation for Chinese minority adolescents, and to explore the mechanism of exercise under hypoxia on mental health.

Results of administration to 2,651 low socioeconomic status middle & senior high school Mexican American adolescents in TX indicate that a higher level of involvement in delinquency was significantly associated with increased participation in unsupervised socialization with friends & less frequent participation in organized leisure & sport activities & in activities at home. Different associations of leisure activities & delinquent acts were also observed between male & female participants. 2 Tables, 31 References. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - The purpose of the present study was to examine the relationships of interscholastic sports participation with locus of control, self-concept, cognitive test scores, and school dropout in adolescents via a secondary analysis of National Educational Longitudinal Study 1988 (NELS:88). Subjects were 1,883 students who completed all measurements in 8th grade (1988), at Follow-up 1 (10th, 1990), and Follow-up 2 (12th, 1992). Scales utilized to measure locus of control, self-concept, and cognitive ability were developed by the National Center for Educational Statistics. Dropout was assessed through school records and contact with participants. At baseline and Follow-up 1, students self-reporting sport participation displayed higher self-concept and locus of control; however, these differences were no longer observed at Follow-up 2. Drop-out rate for boys at Follow-up 2 was significantly lower for students reporting interscholastic sport participation at baseline or at Follow-up 1. Similarly, drop-out rate for girls at Follow-up 2 was significantly lower for students reporting interscholastic sport participation at baseline or at Follow-up 1. These findings support the presumed positive role of sport participation for adolescents in American schools.

AB  - Objectives: The cause–effect relationship between educational and sport factors, and alcohol drinking in adolescents is rarely prospectively investigated. This study aimed to establish the possible influence of sport, scholastic and socio-demographic factors on harmful alcohol drinking (HD) and the initiation of HD in adolescents from Bosnia–Herzegovina. Methods: Study included 881 adolescents (49% females) and consisted of (1) baseline tests (16 years of age) and (2) follow-up testing (18 years of age). The independent variables were scholastic and sport-related factors. Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test was used, with the following dependent variables: (1) HD at baseline, (2) HD at follow-up, and (3) HD initiation. Logistic regressions were applied to define the relationships. Results: Higher likelihood of HD was evidenced in children who performed poorly in school. Sport factors were positively correlated with HD at study baseline. Higher odds for HD initiation were found for adolescents who reported a lower GPA, a lower behavioral grade, more frequent school absences, and more unexcused school absences. Conclusions: The results showed scholastic failure as the predictor of HD initiation. The potential influence of sport factors on HD initiation should be studied at an earlier age.

AB  - Background: Aggressive behaviour is a substantial behavioural problem in children and adolescents. This review systematically summarises the current evidence on the relationship between physical activity participation and aggressive behaviour and quantifies the effects of physical activity interventions on aggression in children and adolescents.Methods: Studies were identified through a search of five electronic databases (PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus, MED-LINE, CINAHL and Web of Science) with combinations of three groups of keywords. Two independent reviewers screened and extracted data from the individual studies. The reporting quality and publication bias were assessed. The relationship between physical activity participation and aggressive behaviour was systematically summarized. Data (effect sizes) were pooled to investigate the effects of physical activity interventions on aggressive behaviour. A moderator meta-analysis was performed to identify potential moderators of the effects of physical activity interventions on aggressive behaviour. Results: Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria. The relationship between physical activity participation and aggressive behaviour was mixed. A significant reduction in aggressive behaviour was observed after physical activity interventions (k = 8, SMD =-0.53, 95% CI [-0.27,-0.79], p < 0.001). The moderator meta-analysis showed that physical activity interventions involving team-based physical activity had greater effects than those involving individual-based physical activity (beta = 0.42, SE = 0.18, p = 0.02). In addition, interventions involving physical activity alone were more effective in reducing aggressive behaviour than those that combined physical activity with other activities such as a philosophy course (beta =-0.63, SE = 0.11, p < 0.001).Conclusion: The current meta-analysis presents evidence for the effect of physical activity interventions on aggressive behaviour in children and adolescents. Physical activity-only interventions involving team-based physical activity might be used for preventing or reducing aggressive behaviour in children and adolescents. Possible mechanisms, methodological strengths and weaknesses, implications, and suggestions for future studies were discussed.

Children, and parents reported on children's social, emotional and behavioural characteristics at three-assessment points over 12 months. Results were examined universally (for all children) and for children who scored above the clinical cut-off for anxiety at pre-test. Results revealed that children in the FRIENDS intervention group reported fewer anxiety symptoms regardless of their risk status at posttest."

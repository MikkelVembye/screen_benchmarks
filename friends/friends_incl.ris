AB  - INTERVENTION: The intervention was 10 weekly 1‐hour session of cognitive behavioural treatment for anxiety problems. The manualised treatment programme (FRIENDS) was used which included the following strategies: participants learning awareness of anxiety symptoms; learning to relax, learning to challenge unhelpful thoughts, using graded exposure to overcome avoidance and learning problem solving. CONDITION: Anxiety disorders and major depression in children and adolescents PRIMARY OUTCOME: Anxiety disorders and major depression diagnoses were assessed using structured diagnostic interviews. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were assessed by self‐report questionnaire. SECONDARY OUTCOME: Health care use for a mental health problem and stressful life events over the follow‐up. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Students in grade 7 of high school were identified by self or teacher report as experiencing anxiety symptoms.

AB  - INTERVENTION: The FRIENDS programs (Fun FRIENDS, FRIENDS for Life, My Youth FRIENDS, Adult Resilience; Barrett, 2012) will be utilised. The parent resilience format will provide the Adult Resilience (a one‐day *8 hour program) to parents of children completing the FF, FFL or MYF programs. Allocation to the groups of Fun FRIENDS, FRIENDS for Life or My Youth FRIENDS is determined by age, groups are 4‐7 y/o, 8‐11 y/o and 12‐15 y/o respectively. Classrooms will be randomized to determine the timing of parental intervention (either during the child intervention or 6‐months following intervention). The FRIENDS programs are robustly supported anxiety treatment programs with over 50 published articles supporting their use in children and adolescents. Strategies are based on a cognitive behavioural framework and delivered in a group clinical setting. The frequency of sessions is weekly over 20 weeks for the standard format. These will be a 50‐minute session conducted by a classroom teacher accredited in the programs (having received a minimum of one‐day training). The FRIENDS programs (including all 3 children and the adult program) incorporate physiological, cognitive, and behavioral strategies to assist children and adolescents in coping with stress and worry. The behavioral component includes exposure, relaxation training, assertiveness training, coping and problem solving plans, and conflict resolution. The cognitive component teaches children and adolescents to recognize their feelings and thoughts and the link between them. It also teaches them to identify faulty cognitions and incompatible self‐statements, and to elaborate alternative interpretations of difficult situations. Through the program, protective factors such as self‐esteem, self‐concept, coping skills, hope, and social support are enhanced. The treatment integrity of the child component of the program (FF, FFL, MYF) will be monitored via self‐report forms using a Treatment Integrity checklist. The treatment integrity of the adult component of the program (AR) will be monitored by independent reviewers checking the treatment integrity checklist in vivo. Overall there will be two modes/arms of intervention: Arm 1: FRIENDS program only (see active comparison below; these will receive the conjunctive adult component at 6‐month followup) Arm 2: Standard FRIENDS program and conjunctive adult resilience component (over 20 weeks) CONDITION: Anxiety disorders Internalising disorders PRIMARY OUTCOME: Anxiety levels on the Preschool Anxiety Scale and Spence Children’s Anxiety Scale Resilience using the Deveruex Student Strengths Assessment and Devereux Early Childhood Assessment SECONDARY OUTCOME: Behaviour problems on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire Bullying prevalence on the Olweus Bully/Victim Questionnaire School climate levels on the School Climate Survey INCLUSION CRITERIA: All children and their families in the grade years undertaking the FRIENDS program at the school will be invited to complete the research. There will be no inclusion criteria regarding levels of symptomology or a determined diagnosis.

AB  - Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent form of psychopathology in children. Anxiety disorders often begin early in life, involve great suffering, and predict psychiatric problems. Unfortunately, only a few children with anxiety disorders will receive effective treatment. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of FRIENDS for Life, an Australian school-based prevention programme, with children from Sweden. Participants were 50 children, and the impact of the programme was measured at three time points on the outcomes of anxiety, depression, and general mental health. Results showed a decrease in depressive symptoms and difficulties, and an increase in strengths, for those children receiving the programme. For those children at risk for anxiety receiving the programme, the results also showed a decrease in anxiety symptoms. Overall, the study suggests that FRIENDS for Life could be a promising intervention for Swedish children. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Our study aimed at evaluating FRIENDS for Life, an intervention to prevent anxiety and depression in Swedish school children. A total of 695 children between the ages of 8 and 11 were recruited from 17 schools in Stockholm, Sweden, and cluster-randomized to either the intervention or control group. Teachers in the intervention group received a full day of training and administered FRIENDS for Life in their classrooms. We assessed the children's anxiety and depressive symptoms, general mental health, and academic performance at pre- and post-intervention as well as at the 12-month follow-up. A multi-informant approach was used with data collected from children, parents, and teachers. Assessment was done with the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale, Children's Depression Inventory, and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Children's baseline symptoms, gender, and age as well as their teacher's use of supervision were examined as moderators of effect. Our study found no short- or long-term effects of the intervention for any outcome with regard to the entire sample. We found an enhanced effect of the intervention regarding children with elevated depressive symptoms at baseline. We found a decrease in anxiety symptoms among children whose teachers attended a larger number of supervision sessions, compared to children whose teachers attended fewer supervised sessions or the control group. Mediation analyses showed that this effect was driven by change in the last phase of the intervention, suggesting that supervision might play an important role in enhancing teachers' ability to administer the intervention effectively.

AB  - This study is the first to examine the effectiveness of the "Fun FRIENDS" programme, a school-based, universal preventive intervention for early childhood anxiety and promotion of resilience delivered by classroom teachers. Participants (N = 488) included children aged 4-7 years attending 1 of 14 Catholic Education schools in Brisbane, Australia. The schools were randomly allocated to one of three groups, the intervention, active comparison and waitlist control group. Parents completed standardized measures of anxiety and behavioural inhibition (BI), resilience, social and emotional functioning and behaviour difficulties in addition to parental stress and anxiety, at pre- and post- and 12-month follow-up. Teachers also completed a parallel measure of social and emotional strength at the three time points. Comparable results were obtained for the intervention and comparison groups; however, the intervention group (IG) achieved greater reductions in BI, child behavioural difficulties and improvements in social and emotional competence. In addition, significant improvements in parenting distress and parent-child interactions were found for the IG, with gains maintained at 12-month follow-up. Teacher reports revealed more significant improvement in social and emotional competence for the IG. Clinical implications of the findings are discussed, along with limitations and directions for future research.

AB  - Young immigrants frequently experience anxiety as a consequence of the stress associated with migration. Despite being at high risk for the development of psychopathology, culturally sensitive assessment and intervention procedures for use with ethnic minority groups residing in Australia have yet to be developed and validated. The aims of the current study were to (a) investigate the level of anxiety in a sample of former‐Yugoslavian teenage refugees; (b) appraise the efficacy of the FRIENDS program, a validated Anglo‐Australian anxiety‐prevention program, for use with this high‐risk group; and (c) obtain information from both the program participants and facilitators regarding how the intervention could be modified to better meet the needs of this growing refugee population in Australia. Twenty female former‐Yugoslavian youths completed standardised measures of internalising symptoms. Participants were allocated to either an intervention (n = 9) or a waiting list (n = 11) condition. In spite of the small sample size, post‐assessment indicated that participants in the intervention condition reported significantly less internalising symptoms than participants in the waiting list condition. Social validity data indicated that, overall, participants were highly satisfied with the intervention. Suggestions for assessment and treatment program modifications are discussed.

AB  - This study aimed to (a) appraise the efficacy of a well validated Anglo‐Australian anxiety‐prevention and stress‐resiliency program (FRIENDS) for use with culturally diverse migrant groups residing in Australia, (b) examine the social validity of FRIENDS, and (c) obtain information from both participants and facilitators regarding how the program can best be modified for specific use with non‐English‐speaking background (NESB) clients. To test the efficacy of the intervention, pre‐ and post‐intervention evaluation of internalising symptoms and coping ability were compared with waiting‐list control groups (matched according to ethnic group, gender, and school level). One hundred and six primary and ninety‐eight high school students differentiated by cultural origin (former‐Yugoslavian, Chinese, and mixed‐ethnic) and school level (primary and high school), completed standardised measures of internalising symptoms and were allocated to either an intervention (n = 121) or a waiting‐list (n = 83) condition. Both groups were readministered the assessment package for comparison following a 10‐week treatment or waiting period. Consistent with a recent pilot study, pre/post‐assessment indicated that participants in the intervention condition exhibited lower anxiety and a more positive future outlook than waiting‐list participants. Participating students reported to be highly satisfied with the intervention. Despite the overall success of FRIENDS, the program may be enhanced by culturally sensitive supplements so that the program is more applicable for use with NESB participants. Suggestions for treatment program modifications of FRIENDS are discussed.

AB  - The primary objectives of this study were: (i) to evaluate the capacity of a wellvalidated anxiety prevention and emotional resiliency program (FRIENDS) to reduce psychological distress in young culturally diverse migrants of non-English speaking background (NESB), and (ii) to determine whether any change in psychological symptoms and emotional resilience would be maintained over time. Three hundred and twenty-four students differentiated by cultural origin (formerYugoslavian, Chinese, and mixed-ethnic) and educational level (elementary and high school), were recruited from different Australian states and allocated to either an intervention or wait-list condition. All students completed standardized measures of self-esteem, internalizing symptoms, and future outlook both before and after a 10-week FRIENDS intervention or wait period. One hundred and thirty-nine participants from Queensland were also assessed six months following completion of the FRIENDS program to determine its long-term effects. Consistent with previous trials involving culturally diverse populations, NESB participants who underwent FRIENDS training exhibited significantly greater selfesteem, fewer internalizing symptoms, and a less pessimistic future outlook than wait-list participants at both post- and six months follow-up assessment intervals. This study provides empirical evidence for the utility of the FRIENDS program as a resource for therapists and schools working with young culturally diverse migrant populations.

AB  - Anxiety disorders are among the most common mental health problems affecting children and adolescents. Current estimates indicate that 1 in 5 children or 4 to 6 students within a classroom of 30 children are at risk for developing an anxiety disorder (Boyd, Kostanski, Gullone, Ollendick, & Shek, 2000). Of these children, many will not receive clinical intervention. The school environment is the optimal setting to address this issue and to minimise the risk and prevent the development of anxiety disorders. This article examines the importance of early intervention and prevention within the school setting through an examination of the risk and protective factors of anxiety and the comparability of three approaches to prevention in schools--selective, indicated, and universal approaches. All three prevention approaches are discussed along with the advantages and disadvantages of each. The applicability of the universal approach to prevention is discussed in relation to the FRIENDS for Life (FRIENDS) program (Barrett, 2004, 2005) and its implementation within schools. The FRIENDS program is an evidence-based, cognitive-behavioural anxiety program for children and youth. It is the only evidence-based program endorsed by the World Health Organization as an effective program for the prevention and treatment of anxiety and depression in children and youth.

AB  - This study evaluated the long-term effectiveness of the FRIENDS Program in reducing anxiety and depression in a sample of children from Grade 6 and Grade 9 in comparison to a control condition. Longitudinal data for Lock and Barrett's (2003) universal prevention trial is presented, along with data from 12-month follow-up to 24- and 36-month follow-up. Results of this study indicate that intervention reductions in anxiety reported in Lock and Barrett were maintained for students in Grade 6, with the intervention group reporting significantly lower ratings of anxiety at long-term follow-up. A significant Time x Intervention Group x Gender Effect on Anxiety was found, with girls in the intervention group reporting significantly lower anxiety at 12-month and 24-month follow-up but not at 36-month follow-up in comparison to the control condition. Results demonstrated a prevention effect with significantly fewer high-risk students at 36-month follow-up in the intervention condition than in the control condition. Results are discussed within the context of prevention research.

AB  - Background: Preschool-aged children exhibit a relatively high prevalence rate of anxiety disorders, and the course of these disorders is often chronic. However, surprisingly few studies have focused on the treatment of anxiety in this age group. In response to this limitation, the purpose of the current study was to examine the effectiveness of an open trial of the Fun FRIENDS (FF) program, a downward extension of the FRIENDS programs for preschool-aged children (5–7 years), in a community clinic setting. Method: The sample included 31 children diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. Treatment consisted of 10 weekly sessions administered in a group format. Parents also received two information sessions. Child anxiety, behavioural inhibition, and resiliency were assessed at preintervention, immediate postintervention, and at 12-month follow-up. Results: Significant decreases in child anxiety and shyness and improvements on measures of resiliency were observed following the completion of treatment. Conclusions: The results of this study provide support for the effectiveness of the Fun FRIENDS program as a treatment for anxiety in young children. Further, this study adds to the relatively small body of research focused on the use of CBT to treat anxiety disorders in this population.

AB  - This research investigated the effectiveness of a cognitive-behavioural intervention program (FRIENDS) in Hong Kong for reducing anxiety symptoms in children. The goal of FRIENDS is to increase resilience in children for coping with everyday problems and stresses. Its effectiveness has been established in a variety of research settings, but only limited research has been completed for the Hong Kong program. Participants were ethnic Chinese (n=8) or Western expatriate children (n=25) who received either a 12-week FRIENDS intervention called Fun FRIENDS (for children ages 4-6) or FRIENDS for Life (for children ages 7-9), or children with anxiety problems who participated in a no-treatment control condition (ethnic Chinese n=2 and nonChinese=10). Before and following the intervention or the no treatment waiting period, participants were interviewed to establish diagnosis based on the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule - IV (ADIS-IV). Participants and their parents also completed standardized measures of anxiety symptoms (Spence's Anxiety Scales), and a measure of socio-emotional and behavioural difficulties (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire). Mixed measure ANOVA analyses revealed that the FRIENDS program yielded significant reductions in total anxiety levels and overall stress for both age groups relative to the control sample, with larger effect sizes among Fun FRIENDS (Ages 4-6) participants relative to the FRIENDS for Life (Ages 7-9) group. Based on the ADIS-IV, the percentage of children meeting criteria for probable Social Phobia diminished from 86.8% at pretest to 47.8% at posttest for the younger Fun FRIENDS group and from 64% at pre-test to 38% at post-test for the older FRIENDS for Life group. For Generalised Anxiety Disorder, 30.4% of the younger participants met criteria at pretest and 13.04% participants met criteria at posttest, and 48% of the older participants met diagnostic criteria at pretest compared with 38% at posttest. This study provides support for the efficacy of the FRIENDS programs for reducing anxiety symptoms and associated socio-emotional problems among children in Hong Kong. The findings also provide support for the value of early intervention during preschool and early primary school. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Introduction Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) is an effective psychological intervention for children and young people with anxiety disorders (James et al, 2013). This has led to interest in whether CBT programmes can be widely provided in schools to prevent or ameliorate anxiety symptoms in children. Objective Results from school based anxiety prevention trials are encouraging (Neil & Christensen 2009; Fisak, Richard, Mann 2011). Before the widespread use of school based preventive programmes can be advocated methodologically robust evaluations are required to demonstrate that they are effective when transported to everyday settings. Aim To undertake a pragmatic randomised controlled trial (RCT) of a universal school based CBT programme (Friends for Life) for children aged 9-10 years of age . Methods Three arm RCT comparing Friends for Life delivered by trained health or school leaders with usual school provision (Stallard et al,2012). Primary outcome the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS) at 12 month follow-up. Results A total of 1362 children from 40 schools participated with 1257 (92%) being re-assessed at follow-up. There was a difference in adjusted mean child report RCADS scores for health-led versus school-led FRIENDS (−3.94, 95%CI −6.41 to −1.47) and health-led FRIENDS versus usual school provision (2.66, 95%CI −5.22 to −0.09). Health-led CBT resulted in greater reductions in symptoms of anxiety than the other two arms (Stallard et al 2014), Conclusion Our pragmatic trial demonstrates that universally delivered anxiety prevention programmes can be effective when transported into schools. However, effectiveness varies depending upon who delivers them.

AB  - The FRIENDS for Life (FFL) programme, a school-based anxiety prevention programme, targets anxiety reduction and resiliency development in elementary school-aged children (Barrett, Sonderegger & Xenos, 2003). In the context of equivocal effectiveness findings regarding FFL in Canadian schools, the present study assessed pre–post changes in anxiety, self-esteem, and prosocial behaviour in a school system in Northeastern Canada. To yield further insight to the potential sources of equivocal FFL effectiveness findings, we also evaluated FFL treatment integrity (TI) and social validity (SV). Few studies have assessed FFL TI at the level of identifying which programme sessions, or within-session content, have or have not been adhered to (Higgins & O'Sullivan S, 2015). Similarly, few studies have provided detailed programme SV data or perceived programme benefits by children and parents. TI and SV can provide programme data beyond anxiety reduction, which is key in prevention programming research, as pre–post changes are challenging to detect in 'healthy' samples (Durlak & Wells, 1997). Treatment outcome, TI, and SV data were collected from classrooms across 10 elementary schools administering FFL. The sample included 210 child and 108 parent participants; post-testing occurred 1 week following FFL programme completion. Findings indicated significant decreases from pre- to post-test in child-reported anxiety and self-esteem but no changes in prosocial behaviours. Findings suggest that low TI ratings may have impacted anxiety, self-esteem, and prosocial behaviour results, and that child-reported SV may be more related to programme outcomes than parent-reported SV. Implications for FFL programme developers and future FFL evaluation studies are discussed.

AB  - <bold>Background: </bold>Schools present a context with great potential for the implementation of psychosocial evidence-based practices. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based practice that has been found to be very effective in treating anxiety in various community settings, including schools. Friends for Life (FRIENDS) is an efficacious group CBT protocol for anxiety. Unfortunately, evidence-based practices for anxiety are seldom employed in under-resourced urban schools, because many treatment protocols are not a good fit for the urban school context or the population, existing behavioral health staff do not receive adequate training or support to allow them to implement the treatment with fidelity, or school districts do not have the resources to contract with external consultants. In our prior work, we adapted FRIENDS to create a more culturally sensitive, focused, and feasible CBT protocol for anxiety disorders (CBT for Anxiety Treatment in Schools (CATS)).<bold>Methods/design: </bold>The aim of this 5-year study is to evaluate both the effectiveness of CATS for urban public schools compared to the original FRIENDS as well as compare the implementation strategies (train-the-trainer vs. train-the-trainer + ongoing consultation) by conducting a three-arm, parallel group, type 2 hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial in 18 K-8 urban public schools. We will also assess the cost-effectiveness and the mediators and moderators of fidelity. Ninety therapists, 18 agency supervisors, and 360 children will participate. The interactive systems framework for dissemination and implementation guides the training and support procedures for therapists and supervisors.<bold>Discussion: </bold>This study has the potential to demonstrate that agency therapists and supervisors who have had little to no prior exposure to evidence-based practices (EBPs) can implement an anxiety disorder EBP with fidelity. Comparisons of the implementation strategies would provide large urban mental health systems with data to make decisions about the adoption of EBPs.<bold>Trial Registration: </bold>ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02651402.

AB  - The present study evaluated the effectiveness of a universal school-based cognitive behavior prevention program (the FRIENDS program) for childhood anxiety. Participants were 638 children, ages 9 to 12 years, from 14 schools in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. All the children completed standardized measures of anxiety and depression, social and adaptive functioning, coping strategies, social skills, and perfectionism before and after the 10-week FRIENDS program and at two follow-up assessments (6 and 12 months) or wait period. Children who participated in the FRIENDS program exhibited significantly fewer anxiety and depressive symptoms, and lower perfectionism scores than children in the control group at 12-month follow-up. Younger children (9-10-year-olds) displayed treatment gains immediately after the intervention, whereas older children (11-12-year-olds) showed anxiety reduction only at 6- and 12-month follow-up. Perfectionism and avoidant coping acted as mediators of pre- to postintervention changes in anxiety scores. This study provides empirical evidence for the utility of the FRIENDS program in reducing anxiety and depressive symptoms among German children. (Contains 2 tables and 1 figure.)

AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess an open trial of the Fun FRIENDS program, as an early intervention for referred young children with internalizing symptoms, combined with the simultaneous administration of an adult resilience building program with parents. More specifically, 178 children, ranging in age from 5 to 7, and their parents participated in concurrent intervention programs, as children participated in the Fun FRIENDS program parents participated in the Strong Not Tough: Adult Resilience Program. Based on assessment from pre to post-intervention, significant improvements were found in both child and parent functioning, including reductions in internalizing symptoms and increases in levels of resilience. Also, for mothers, reduction in parent-related stress from pre to post-intervention predicted levels of child anxiety at post-intervention. Overall, the results of this study provide support for the positive impact of Fun FRIENDS enhanced with an adult resilience building program for parents.

AB  - Background: The 'FRIENDS for life' program (FRIENDS) is a 10‐session cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) program used for prevention and treatment of youth anxiety. There is discussion about whether FRIENDS is best applied as prevention or as treatment. Methods: We compared FRIENDS delivered in schools as targeted prevention to a previous specialist mental health clinic trial. The targeted prevention sample (N = 82; Mage = 11.6 years, SD = 2.1; 75.0% girls) was identified and recruited by school nurses in collaboration with a community psychologist. The clinical sample (N = 88, Mage = 11.7 years, SD = 2.1; 54.5% girls) was recruited for a randomized controlled trial from community child‐ and adolescent psychiatric outpatient clinics and was diagnosed with anxiety disorders. Results: Both samples showed significantly reduced anxiety symptoms from baseline to postintervention, with medium mean effect sizes across raters (youths and parents) and timepoints (post; 12‐months follow‐up). Baseline youth‐reported anxiety symptom levels were similar between the samples, whereas parent‐reported youth anxiety was higher in the clinical sample. Conclusions: The study suggests that self‐reported anxiety levels may not differ between youth recruited in schools and in clinic settings. The results indicate promising results of the FRIENDS program when delivered in schools by less specialized health personnel from the school health services, as well as when delivered in clinics by trained mental health professionals.

AB  - FRIENDS for life is a school-based, cognitive-behavioural therapy programme, designed to promote emotional resilience in order to prevent (or stabilise) the development of negative feelings of anxiety and depression. The programme consists of a series of 10 weekly sessions covering topics such as recognising symptoms of anxiety, emotional self-management and supporting peer relationships. Each session is enhanced by a series of additional activities that can be used to practice the newly learned skills as well as homework activities. The Salus Group (Salus), a training provider offering a range of programmes in schools, within the community and at home, delivered the intervention. Salus delivers FRIENDS in the UK and is not affiliated with the original FRIENDS developers. The project was a cluster-randomised control trial. 122 Year 5 classes in 79 participating primary schools were randomised to either receive FRIENDS or to act as a business as usual control group. The evaluation tested the impact of FRIENDS on the attainment of pupils, measured by combined Key Stage 2 English and Maths scores, and also on health measures of self-rated worry, anxiety and depression, and teacherrated difficulties. The process evaluation involved interviews with various stakeholders, class observations and focus groups with pupils. The trial took place in schools between March 2016 and July 2017. The programme was co-funded by the Department for Education as part of an EEF funding round on Character Education

AB  - Anxiety is the most pervasive childhood mental health disorder today. This study examined the parent component of a school-based universal prevention and early intervention program. Participating parents ( N = 122) completed four measures on anxiety, the Anxiety Sensitivity Index, the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression, the Penn State Worry Questionnaire, and the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders, before and after the parent program. The effectiveness of the program was investigated by analysing mean scores of the parent self-reported anxiety symptoms and parent reports of child anxiety symptoms. The main analyses conducted were 2 × 2 between-within ANOVAs for each measure. The hypothesis that parents who participated in the program ( n = 20) would report reduced anxiety symptoms for themselves and for their children when compared to parents who did not attend ( n = 120) was not confirmed. The parent's satisfaction level with the program was also studied, with high acceptability ratings providing strong social validity for this program. Implications of the findings, strengths, limitations and suggestions for further research are discussed.

AB  - Anxiety and depression are common problems experienced by children and adolescents that, without an effective intervention, can lead to a series of negative consequences. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness the Spanish version of the FRIENDS for Life program (Barrett, 2008a, 2008b), a social and emotional skills program that uses cognitive-behavioural techniques for the prevention and early intervention of anxiety and depression. The program was implemented at the selective level of prevention with girls living at an orphanage in Mexico. Participants received the program for 10 consecutive weeks, and pretest and post-test measures were administered. Measures evaluated participants’ anxiety and depressive symptoms and risk status, proactive coping skills, levels of self-concept, self-esteem, and optimism. Social validity was also assessed. Results showed positive changes particularly in optimism and self-concept. Particular items and subscales of the measures also reported statistically significant changes, such as a decrease in worry, physiological symptoms of anxiety, and negative mood, and an increase in self-esteem at home and with peers. Participants evaluated the program as enjoyable and useful. Implications of the findings and further research are discussed.

AB  - A growing number of school-aged children experience or are at risk for a myriad of psychological and behavioral problems such as anxiety and depression that interfere with their interpersonal relationships, school performance, and potential to become productive citizens –hence the importance of school prevention. This study assessed the effectiveness of the Spanish version of the FRIENDS for Life program [AMISTAD para siempre], a social and emotional program that uses cognitive-behavioral techniques to prevent anxiety and depression. Eight schools from a northern city in Mexico were randomly selected and assigned to either an intervention or standard curriculum instruction. Fifteen teachers implemented the intervention, and 16 served as control. Participants were 1,030 fourth and fifth grade students (ages 8-13). The impact of the program was evaluated immediately after the intervention and after 6 months. The program showed a positive effect by reducing symptoms and risk for depression and increasing the proactive coping skills of the overall sample. Suggestions for further research and implications for practice are offered. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Un número elevado de niños de edad escolar experimentan o corren el riesgo de experimentar una serie de problemas psicológicos y de comportamiento tales como la ansiedad y la depresión, las cuales interfieren en sus relaciones interpersonales, el desempeño académico y el potencial para convertirse en personas productivas. El presente estudio evalúa la eficacia de la versión en español del programa FRIENDS for Life [AMISTAD para siempre], que enseña habilidades sociales y emocionales utilizando técnicas cognitivas-conductuales para prevenir ansiedad y depresión. Ocho escuelas de una ciudad al norte de México fueron aleatoriamente seleccionadas y asignadas a un grupo de intervención o al grupo de currículo estándar. Quince educadoras implementaron el programa y 16 maestras siguieron con el currículo estándar. Los participantes fueron 1.030 niños, de 8 a 13 años de edad, de cuarto y quinto grado de primaria. El impacto del programa se evaluó inmediatamente después de la intervención, y a los seis meses. Los resultados muestran que el programa tuvo efectos positivos al reducir los síntomas y el riesgo de depresión e incrementar las estrategias de afrontamiento proactivas de aquellos que lo recibieron. Se ofrecen sugerencias sobre futuras investigaciones así como sobre sus implicaciones para la práctica.

AB  - This study is the first social validity evaluation of the Spanish version of the "FRIENDS for Life" program with Mexican children. "FRIENDS for Life" is a cognitive-behavioral intervention aimed at increasing social and emotional competence and decreasing anxiety and depressive symptoms in children. The program is designed to empower children and families by teaching relaxation techniques, coping and interpersonal skills, and positive thinking. Participants were 498 students, ages 9 to 11. Upon completion of the program, students, parents, and teachers were surveyed regarding their perceptions on the utility and enjoyability, and their global satisfaction. Results indicate that students, parents, and teachers evaluate the program as helpful and enjoyable. Gender differences were found, girls reported the program as more useful and enjoyable than boys. The skill that students and parents found more useful was changing negative thoughts into positive, and positive correlations were also found between level of satisfaction and outcome measures.

AB  - Introduction: Anxiety symptoms in young children can have negative consequences such as the deterioration of family and interpersonal functioning, and may lead to the development of an anxiety disorder; therefore, the importance of prevention. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Fun FRIENDS program in the reduction of children's anxiety symptoms and the promotion of emotional and behavioral competences as a protective factor in a sample of Mexican children. Methodology: The participants included 49 children from the first grade at elementary school along with their teachers. The program was implemented by teachers as twelve consecutive one-week sessions conducted in the classroom. The outcome was measured with a pretest-posttest quasi-experimental design. Measures included the Preschool Anxiety Scale (PAS) for parents, Behavioral and Emotional Rating Scale (BERS-2) for parents and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), for parents and teachers. Results: Findings showed a decrease in the subscale of separation anxiety of the PAS, an increase in the interpersonal, intrapersonal and affective strengths subscales of the BERS-2, and an increase in prosocial behavior as measured by the SDQ. Conclusions: Results indicate promise for the effectiveness of the Fun FRIENDS program as an early intervention program based on the promotion of resilience for Mexican children.

AB  - Background: Research on school maladjustment has increasingly focused on social skills, such as the ability to control emotions, collaborate with others, and achieve goals. Social and emotional learning (SEL) is one approach to nurturing social skills. However, few preventive interventions to promote SEL have been conducted among young children, particularly in Asian countries, including Japan. Therefore, this study examined the effectiveness of an SEL program—Fun FRIENDS—among children in Japan. Methods: In mid-2022, the Fun FRIENDS program was administered to 115 children aged 4–5 years, who were enrolled in two kindergartens. The program was administered to the entire class as part of their kindergarten activities. The control group included 93 children in three kindergartens. This study included 94 participants (81.7%) in the intervention group and 66 (71.0%) in the control group, whose parents agreed with the assessment of their skills. Fun FRIENDS is a support program based on a cognitive–behavioral approach. The program aims to teach children how to cope with anxiety and stress and develop resilience and confidence to face difficulties. The program includes 10 sessions, each lasting approximately 1 h and conducted once per week. To examine the program's effectiveness, teachers evaluated these children's social skills before and after program implementation using the Social Skill Scale. Results: Results showed significant post-intervention improvements in self-control and cooperation scores among children in the intervention group, compared with pre-intervention. Further, post-intervention self-control and cooperation scores were significantly higher among children in the intervention group than the control group. Conclusions: SEL implemented on a class-wide basis could be effective in early childhood. An early approach targeting preschool-aged children is necessary to prevent school maladjustment. A universal approach implemented on a whole-class basis could contribute to improving children's social skills.

AB  - Background: Despite the existence of evidence-based interventions for promoting mental health in children, the number of children at risk remains high. One of the reasons is that such interventions are not reaching specific groups at risk such as low socioeconomic status and ethnic minority groups. This study evaluated an adaptation of a school-based psychosocial program for nonreferred students aged 11 to 12 years attending a multicultural school from a low socioeconomic status area. Methods: The FRIENDS Program was adapted for a multicultural population. A quasi-experimental design was used, involving a pre/post-test, to evaluate the impact of the intervention on participants' outcomes on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Participants were divided into 2 categories ("at risk"/"not at risk") based on their scores in the SDQ at pre-test. Post-test data were collected to evaluate the overall effectiveness and acceptability of the program. Results: Analyses showed significant improvement for the group initially identified as "at risk," with 30% of the students being no longer at risk after the intervention. Most students rated the intervention as being highly acceptable and useful. Conclusions: Adaptations to existing evidence-based programs for implementation with specific minority groups at risk represents a promising approach to promote emotional health in children.

AB  - The literature indicates increasing evidence showing the benefits of classroom-based, universal preventive interventions for mental health and the link between social and emotional learning and academic performance. The FRIENDS program has been extensively tested and has showed promising results not only for preventing childhood anxiety, but also for improving students' self-concept, social skills and coping skills. However, when it comes to communities in disadvantage, the results are mixed, with some studies reporting the need to include enhancements to the context in which the program is implemented to better support communities at risk. A combined intervention aiming to promote students' social-emotional skills was piloted in a school located in a low socio-economic status area. Teachers received training to teach social and emotional skills for students and a resilience program for themselves. Students' social-emotional outcomes were assessed at pre, post, 3 and 6 months following the intervention. Results showed that the intervention helped students to decrease their anxiety, and the intervention was well accepted by participants.

AB  - INTERVENTION: We will be approaching approximately 80 schools to participate in the research. The trial will be cluster‐randomised, utilising matched‐pair randomisation at the class level (utilising Key Stage 1 and baseline anxiety/depression scores for minimisation). Within each school, we will randomly allocate half of the year 5 classes to an intervention group and half of the year 5 classes to a comparison group. (This will mean that for most schools, one year 5 class will participate in FRIENDS, and one will continue as normal. Some smaller schools where there is only one year 5 class, will either receive the FRIENDS curriculum or a cash incentive instead). The FRIENDS programme consists of 10 weekly sessions, which aim to promote various protective factors, such as recognising physiological symptoms (e.g. session 2), emotional self‐management (e.g. session 4), and supporting peer relationships (e.g. session 8). Indeed, the name of the programme is designed to help pupils recall and utilise the various skills taught in the sessions (Feelings; Remember to Relax; Inner helpful thoughts; Explore solutions and coping plans; Now reward yourself; Do it every day; Stay strong inside). Each session is designed to last 60‐75 minutes, but can also be conducted over two 30‐35 minute periods instead. Additionally, there are two booster sessions that can be held approximately 1 to 3 months after completing the program, and two information sessions for parents of approximately 2 hours length each. There have been significant revisions in the most recent editions of the FRIENDS programs (Barrett, Cooper, Guajardo, 2014), which now includes increased focus on addressing externalising symptoms. Throughout various updates in content, the theoretical model underpinning FRIENDS can be consistently described as Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT). The programme therefore teaches children skills in the cognitive (identify and challenge anxiety increasing cognitions), emotional (identify an CONDITION: Worry, anxiety, depression ; Mental and Behavioural Disorders PRIMARY OUTCOME: 1.

AB  - Introduction: Many universal school-based preventative intervention trials for anxiety have been conducted in Western countries. This pilot study examined the efficacy and acceptability of a school-based, universal preventative program for anxiety among children aged 8–9 years in Japan. The program was based on cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and was informed by similar universal programs (i.e., the Fun FRIENDS program; Barrett, 2007a, 2007b). Methods: Seventy-four children from a single school were allocated to an intervention or control group. The intervention comprised 10 CBT sessions, and assessments were conducted before and after the program. The primary outcome measure was the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS) as children's self-report. Secondary outcome measures were the Depression Self-Rating Scale for Children (DSRS-C), Children's Hope Scale (Hope), Spence Children's Anxiety Scale-Parent Version (SCAS-P), and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire-Parent Version (SDQ-P). Results: The SCAS as the primary outcome showed no significant differences between the two groups. In addition, DSRS-C, Hope and SDQ-P also showed no significant differences. SCAS-P in the intervention group showed significant decrease compared to those in the control group. Conclusion: The results of this trial study suggest that a school-based universal preventative program for anxiety may have no significant effects on 8–9-year-old children.

AB  - Aggression and externalisation problems at school hold negative consequences for both the perpetrators and the victims. This paper argues that the relationship between anxiety and aggression may make it possible to use certain anxiety prevention programmes to help prevent aggression. This hypothesis was tested on a sample of early adolescents using a quasi-experimental design with a control group. Four classes of early adolescents (N = 73) were randomly assigned to the control or intervention group. The intervention group was exposed at school to an anxiety prevention programme based on social and emotional learning called My FRIENDS. Aggression and externalisation problems were measured before the intervention, immediately after and at a six-month follow-up. The results show: (a) in the control group, aggression (dimensions: "aggression towards authority," "physical aggression") increased over the study period, whereas in the intervention group, it remained at the baseline level after the intervention and at the six-month follow-up; (b) externalisation problems (dimension: "hyperactivity") were reduced in the intervention group relative to the baseline after the intervention and at the six-month follow-up. The results support use of the My FRIENDS programme as a possible prevention programme for aggression and externalisation problems as well as anxiety. Study limitations and future research directions are considered.

AB  - FRIENDS for Life is an anxiety prevention programme that integrates cognitive behavioural approach with social and emotional learning. The current study examines the effects of the FRIENDS for Life programme in a school environment, with outcomes focusing on anxiety and aggression. The theoretical basis for the joint prevention and intervention of anxiety and aggression is based on their frequent simultaneous occurrence. Four classes of 4th-grade students (N = 85) were randomly assigned two to intervention and two to a no-treatment control group in a randomized control study. We measured the total anxiety and components of anxiety and the total of aggression and components of aggression with AN-UD and AG-UD aggression scale at pre-, post-, half-year, one-year and one-year-and a half follow-up. The results were inconclusive with regard to the effectiveness of the programme. However, there is some indication of possible effects on the reduction of anxiety and aggression in the boys' sub-sample. This was also the sub-sample that showed higher levels of anxiety and aggression at baseline, suggesting possible difference in the effectiveness of the programme. Proposals are made to replicate the study in a larger format.

AB  - Objectives. We investigated whether intervention effects of FRIENDS for Life, a school-based prevention program for children with anxiety or depression symptoms, were maintained over a period of 12 months after the intervention in a naturalistic setting. Methods. We used a quasi-experimental design, with 339 children in the intervention group and 157 in the control group (aged 8-13 years) in schools in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. We collected self-, teacher, and peer reports of anxiety and depression scores before and after intervention, and 6 and 12 months after intervention, from 2010 to 2012. Results. Intervention-group children reported a continuing and significant decrease in anxiety and depression scores compared with the control group. Twelve months after the intervention, participants' anxiety and depression levels were comparable to those of the general population. Girls reported a stronger decrease in anxiety scores than did boys. Teacher reports suggested no effects. Although classmates reported increased internalizing problems in intervention-group children immediately after intervention, these effects disappeared over time. Conclusions. FRIENDS for Life, an indicated prevention program, yielded long-lasting and continuing reduction in anxiety and depression problems when implemented in daily school practice.

AB  - Background: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for pediatric anxiety is efficacious for reducing anxiety symptoms and improving functioning, but many children are unable to access CBT for anxiety in community settings. Schools are an important setting in which children access mental health care, including therapy for anxiety. In this setting, therapy is usually delivered by Masters-level therapists., Objectives: Friends for Life (FRIENDS), a 12-session, manualized, group CBT program for anxiety has demonstrated effectiveness when implemented in schools. However, prior research has also found challenges regarding feasibility and cultural fit when delivering FRIENDS in the urban school context. To address these challenges, we adapted FRIENDS for implementation in the school setting so that it might be more feasible and culturally appropriate for low-income, urban schools in the United States, while maintaining the core components of treatment. The current study uses a mixed-method approach to compare the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and perceived appropriateness of FRIENDS and CATS when delivered by Masters-level therapists with train-the-trainer support., Materials and methods: First, we compared change scores for student outcomes (i.e., child-report MASC-2 total score, parent-report MASC-2 total score, teacher-report Engagement and Disaffection subscale scores) from pre- to post- treatment between students receiving FRIENDS and students receiving CATS to assess whether the two conditions resulted in equivalent outcomes. Second, we compared the cost and cost-effectiveness between the groups. Finally, we used an applied thematic analysis to compare appropriateness of the interventions as perceived by therapists and supervisors., Results: The mean change score for the child-reported MASC-2 was 1.9 (SE = 1.72) points in the FRIENDS condition and 2.9 (SE = 1.73) points in the CATS condition; results indicated that the conditions were similar in their treatment effects, and symptom reductions were small in both groups. The modified protocol, CATS, was shown to cost significantly less to implement compared to FRIENDS and showed greater cost-effectiveness. Finally, compared to therapists and supervisors in the CATS condition, therapists and supervisors in the FRIENDS condition more strongly described aspects of the intervention that were not appropriate for their context and in need of more extensive adaptations., Conclusion: Relatively brief, group CBT for anxiety, with adaptations to improve cultural fit, is a promising approach to treat youth anxiety symptom when delivered by school-based therapists with train-the-trainer implementation support.

AB  - Background: Anxiety disorders are among the most common psychiatric disorders in childhood and can develop as early as the preschool years. Therefore, providing young children who display early signs of anxiety with skills to prevent the development of later psychopathology is invaluable. The current study evaluates the effectiveness of Fun FRIENDS, an anxiety prevention and resilience program for young children. Method: Fifty-seven kindergartners across three classrooms participated in a 15-week anxiety prevention program and teachers completed a behavioral screening measure and anxiety questionnaire at pre, post, 3 month, and 10-month follow-up assessment points. Results: Anxiety positively correlated with emotional symptoms, peer difficulties, and total difficulties at pre-intervention. Anxiety symptoms decreased from pre-intervention to follow-up. Additionally, prosocial behaviors improved and moderated the relationship between pre-and post-intervention anxiety symptoms. Conclusions: These findings yield promising implications regarding the effectiveness of prevention and intervention programs on increasing social emotional skills and reducing anxiety symptoms in young children.

AB  - This study used an "indicated prevention" approach to attempt to replicate very positive international evaluations of the FRIENDS for Life programme. Using standardised self-report measures of anxiety, low mood and self esteem with groups of children from four schools, the study found significant improvements in all of these measures following the 10-week programme, which were sustained four months later. Positive findings were also obtained from an examination of the programme's impact on children's social skills. Implications for improving emotional well-being and educational outcomes for children in Scottish schools are discussed. (Contains 8 tables.)

AB  - This paper describes the development and preliminary findings of a program designed to prevent the development of anxiety and depressive symptoms in children aged 10 to 13 years. Using a universal prevention approach, a total of 594 children were randomly assigned on a class‐by‐class basis to either a 10‐session family group CBT program (FRIENDS) routinely implemented as part of the school curriculum, or to a comparison group. Pre‐post intervention changes were examined universally, and for children who scored above the clinical cut‐off for anxiety at pretest. Results revealed that children in the FRIENDS intervention group reported fewer anxiety symptoms, regardless of their risk status, than the comparison group at posttest. In terms of reported levels of depression, only the high anxiety group who completed the FRIENDS intervention evidenced improvements at posttest. Overall, these preliminary results appear to support the benefits of a school‐based universal cognitive‐behavioural intervention program. Implications of this study are discussed, and long‐term follow‐up measures are currently underway.

AB  - In 2001 we evaluated a universal prevention trial of anxiety during childhood, and also examined the effects of the program on levels of depression. Participants were 594 children aged 10‐13 years from seven schools in Brisbane, Australia, who were randomly assigned to an intervention or control group on a school‐by‐school basis. The intervention was based on the group CBT program FRIENDS (Barrett, Lowry‐Webster & Holmes, 1999a, 1999b, 1999c). Results were examined universally (for all children) and for children who scored above the clinical cut‐off for anxiety at pre‐test. At 12‐month follow‐up, intervention gains were maintained, as measured by self‐reports and diagnostic interviews. Eighty‐five per cent of children in the intervention group who were scoring above the clinical cut‐off for anxiety and depression were diagnosis free in the intervention condition, compared to only 31.2% of children in the control group. Implications of these findings are examined, alongside limitations and directions for future research.

AB  - Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for childhood anxiety is effective in schools; however, researchers have reported mixed results and expressed concerns regarding sociocultural differences in treating childhood anxiety. This study examined the efficacy of the FRIENDS program, which is a CBT program used at a universal school level. Students (N = 154; 11- to 12-years-old) participated in either a program or waitlist condition and completed the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale at prior and subsequent to implementation of the program and during follow up. Results revealed a significant interaction between group and gender in the social phobia subscale and a significant main effect of gender in six subscales. The feasibility and limitations of universal CBT in a Japanese school setting are discussed.

AB  - Abstract: The present research examined the effectiveness of a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) based intervention program, FRIENDS, for children from grades 4 to 6, using random assignment at the school-level and an attention-control design in two longitudinal studies. The first study targeted children with anxiety symptoms (N =191, mean age=10.1) as screened with self, parent, and teacher-reports; the second study took a universal approach with full classrooms of children participating (N =253, mean age=9.8). The results showed no intervention effect in both studies, with children’s anxiety symptoms decreasing over time regardless of whether they were in the story-reading (attention control) or FRIENDS condition. The findings also indicated that girls reported a higher level of anxiety than boys and children in higher grades reported lower anxiety relative to younger children in both studies. In addition, similar patterns were found using a subgroup of children with high-anxiety symptoms from both studies.

AB  - Anxiety disorders are prevalent in the school-aged population and are present across cultural groups. Scant research exists on culturally relevant prevention and intervention programs for mental health problems in the Aboriginal populations. An established cognitive behavioral program, FRIENDS for Life, was enriched to include content that was culturally relevant to Aboriginal students. Students (N = 533), including 192 students of Aboriginal background, participated in the cluster randomized control study. Data were collected three times over 1 year. A series of multilevel models were conducted to examine the effect of the culturally enriched FRIENDS program on anxiety. These analyses revealed that the FRIENDS program did not effectively reduce anxiety for the total sample or for Aboriginal children specifically. However, all students, regardless of intervention condition, Aboriginal status, or gender, reported a consistent decrease in feelings of anxiety over the 6-month study period.

AB  - In light of the occurrence of anxiety disorders among children and adolescents, it has become increasingly important to investigate the effectiveness of anxiety prevention and intervention programs in schools. In response, this study examined one such program: the FRIENDS prevention program (Barrett, 2004). The primary goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of the FRIENDS universal anxiety prevention program within a sample of tenth grade female students. Pre and post anxiety levels were assessed using paired sample t-tests. Significant improvements were realized in overall Adolescent Stress Questionnaire results, specifically in the domains of Resolving Conflict and Performance/Expectations subscales. This was supplemented with similar reduction in anxiety, as indicated by the physical symptoms subscale of the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children-Second Edition. The FRIENDS program should be considered as a proactive means for ameliorating the elevated levels of anxiety and sources of stress that affect high school students in the very environment where many of these stressors are derived from the academic environment.

AB  - Objective: Anxiety disorders and depression during childhood and adolescence are among highly prevalent serious mental health problems, which lead to reduced performance in children and can also negatively affect children's emotional and social long-term development. This study, which was conducted in Mashhad in 2015, aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of the Friends for Life cognitive-behavioral program in reducing the symptoms of anxiety and depression in children. Method: In this controlled clinical trial, 248 male students aged 10 were screened for mild to moderate symptoms of anxiety and depression using the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety (RCMA) and the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI). Of the participants, 40 students met the inclusion criteria. The demographic questionnaire, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), and the Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scale (DASS) were filled out by parents. The children in the experimental group received the Friends for Life cognitivebehavioral training program for eight 1-hour weekly sessions. RCMA, CDI, SDQ, and DASS were filled out again by both groups at the end of the sessions and 3 months later. To evaluate comparability between the 2 groups, Mann- Whitney test was used for qualitative variables and paired t test and repeated measure for quantitative variables with normal distribution. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS-16. All statistical references were made at p=0.05. Results: Children's depression and manifest anxiety scores were not significantly different in the 2 groups before the intervention; however, their changes immediately after intervention and at the 3- month follow-up were significant (p<0.001). Moreover, hyperactivity (p = 0.039), peer problems (p = 0.011), and parental depression (p = 0.015) scores significantly changed in both groups over time. Conclusion: Implementation of Friends for Life program is effective in prevention and treatment of the symptoms of anxiety and depression in children.

AB  - The prevalence of anxiety symptoms among South African children is reported to be significantly higher than in other parts of the world. The need for an effective anxiety prevention and early intervention program for use with South African children is urgently needed. The aim of the present study was therefore to determine whether the Australian FRIENDS program could effectively reduce the anxiety symptoms, as measured by the Spence Children's Anxiety scale (SCAS), among a sample of South African children from low socioeconomic background. The program evaluation employed a quasi-experimental, nonequivalent control group design that followed participants ( N = 46) over a course of 10 months. Within group effects and between group effects revealed that the FRIENDS program had little statistically significant postintervention effect on the anxiety symptoms of this sample, but had significant effects in the longer term, at 4 months and 6 months follow-up. The implications of these results for the South African context are discussed.

AB  - In Lebanon, approximately one in four adolescents suffers from a psychiatric disorder. Alarmingly, 94% of adolescents with a mental disorder have not sought any treatment. This study assessed the effectiveness of an evidence-based school-based universal mental health intervention (the FRIENDS program) in reducing depression and anxiety symptoms in middle school students in Lebanon. A total of 280 6th graders aged 11-13 years were recruited from 10 schools in Beirut. Schools were matched on size and tuition and randomly assigned to intervention or control groups. The FRIENDS program was translated into Arabic, adapted, and then implemented by trained mental health professionals during 10 classroom sessions over 3 months. We assessed sociodemographic and relevant psychological symptoms by self-report, using the Scale for Childhood Anxiety and Related Disorders (SCARED), Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ), and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), at baseline. We re-administered these scales at 3 months post-intervention. There was a significant time × group interaction for the SDQ emotional score (p = 0.011) and total MFQ score (p = 0.039) indicating significant improvement in depressive and emotional symptoms in the intervention group. Subgroup analysis by gender showed a significant time × group interaction for the total SCARED score (p = 0.025) in females but not in males (p = 0.137), consistent with a reduction of anxiety symptoms in this stratum of the intervention group as compared with the control group. The FRIENDS program was effective in reducing general emotional and depressive symptoms among middle school students in this Lebanese study population. This intervention provides an opportunity for promoting mental health in Lebanese schools and reducing the treatment gap in mental health care.

AB  - Mental illness is a major health problem in children and young people, and there is evidence that mental illness is increasing among young people in the population. More than 80 % of the cost to society of mental illness in children in Sweden is the cost of treatment and care. Only a small portion thus consists of preventive interventions. The report "Programs to prevent mental illness in children ‐ a systematic literature review" (2010) from the Swedish National Council on Technology Assessment (SBU), concluded that no prevention program has evidence of efficacy under Swedish conditions. A target for future prevention work is according to the authors SBU‐report that programs that are used have scientific support and evaluated in Sweden. Based on the review the report's authors recommend that five programs should be prioritized for further evaluation. One of these five programs is FRIENDS for life, a prevention program to prevent anxiety. Anxiety and depression are the most common psychiatric problems in children and adolescents. Untreated anxiety disorders often have a chronic course or may occur again and depression in adolescents often continue into adulthood anxiety and depression in children and adolescents predicts a variety of psychiatric diagnoses later in life, leading to difficulties with school and friends, and lead to increased risk of suicidal acts, alcohol and drug abuse. In comparison with the treatment of mental disorders, there is relatively limited knowledge about prevention. There are at least two very important reasons to investigate further preventive interventions for anxiety and depression. (1) Only about 20% of children and adolescents with anxiety or depression use health services. (2) Some children stop treatment and almost 40% do still fulfill criteria for the disorder after treatment. FRIENDS for life is one of the most evaluated prevention programs internationally. The program has shown promising results in research. In Sweden there are no high‐quality evaluation of prevention programs targeting anxiety and depression. Based on the high incidence of anxiety and depression and its serious consequences it is of utmost importance to investigate whether prevention programs work in a Swedish context. The overall aim of the present study is to evaluate FRIENDS for Life in Sweden. The following research questions guide the study: 1. Do FRIEND for life affect children's estimates of anxiety and depression symptoms and parents' estimates of children's anxiety symptoms, on the scales Spence Children's Anxiety Scale? Is the possible impact still visible after 12 months? 2. Do FRIEND for life affect the presence of anxiety diagnoses and subclinical anxiety at 12 months according to ADIS‐C/P interview? Additional research questions are: 3. Is there any congruence between parents' and children's estimates of the child's anxiety symptoms? 4. Do FRIEND for life affect parents' and teachers' estimates of children's general mental health? 5. Do gender, symptom level, fidelity to the manual, decreased negative thoughts, behavioral inhibition affect the effect of FRIEND for life? International studies have shown promising results of FRIEND for life. Previous studies have, however, been of varying quality. Strengths of this study are that parents, teachers and children are respondents, and it is investigated whether various background characteristics and implementation factors influence the effect. Given the high prevalence of anxiety and depression in young ages, and the fact that only a few children with anxiety and depression use health services, the knowledge that this study generates are very important.

AB  - The objective of this pilot project was to evaluate the effectiveness of the FRIENDS program in reducing anxiety and symptoms of depression for children in Regina public schools. The project comprised 461 children in Grades 1, 4, 5, and 6 who participated in the 10-week FRIENDS program between September 2013 and May 2014. Effectiveness of the program was measured using the Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale, which was administered at the beginning and end of the program. The percentage of children with subclinical or clinical levels of anxiety and depression significantly decreased from 21.8% to 13.4%. This study validated the effectiveness of the FRIENDS program in children in Regina schools. Ce projet pilote avait pour but d'évaluer l'efficacité du programme FRIENDS à réduire les symptômes d'anxiété et de dépression chez les enfants des écoles publiques de Regina. 461 enfants de 1e, 4e 5e et 6e années ont participé au programme FRIENDS de 10 semaines entre septembre 2013 et mai 2014. Pour mesurer l'efficacité du programme, on s'est servi de l'Échelle révisée de mesure de l'anxiété et de la dépression chez l'enfant qui a été administrée au début et à la fin du programme. Le pourcentage des enfants manifestant des degrés infracliniques ou cliniques d'anxiété et de dépression a considérablement diminué passant de 21,8% à 13,4%. Cette étude confirme l'efficacité du programme FRIENDS chez les enfants des écoles de Regina.

AB  - The FRIENDS for Life program is a cognitive-behavioral group program that targets anxiety in children. The main purpose of this study was to analyze the effectiveness of the Portuguese version of the FRIENDS for Life Program, which was implemented in schools to reduce anxiety problems in a group of highly anxious children. The study used a quasi-experimental research design with two groups of children, an intervention (n = 17) and a wait-list control group (n = 21), aged 8 to 12 years old. The impact of the program in reducing anxiety symptoms as assessed by children and mothers was analyzed through the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders-Revised (SCARED-R). The results show a statistically significant post intervention effect on anxiety symptoms evaluated by the child, but not by the mother. The implications of these results for the prevention of anxiety disorders in Portuguese schools are discussed.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effects of the FunFRIENDS protocol on anxiety symptoms, internalizing problems and prosocial behavior in 4‐ to 5‐year old children. Participated of this study 43 children with an allocation ratio of 1:1 between groups (Intervention Group [IG], N = 21; Control Group [CG], N = 22) from a public school in the city of Sao Paulo participated in the study. Behaviors were evaluated by using standardized questionnaires (PAS, CBCL, SDQ, SCBE) assessing the behavioral profile of the children at three different periods; baseline (T0), one month (T1) and three months (T2) after the intervention. It was observed a reduction in the intensity of anxiety symptoms in the IG after the intervention but with no significant effect. Overall, there were no significant differences between the IG and the CG in most behaviors on all periods evaluated. On both Intention‐to‐Treat analyses also it was not detected significant effects of the intervention. This is the first Brazilian study evaluating the effects of FunFRIENDS program and the implications of these findings are discussed and its significance for future research.

AB  - Background Anxiety constitutes the most common form of psychopathology in childhood and adolescence. Methods This randomised controlled study evaluated the 'FRIENDS for Life' school-based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy programme on overall anxiety, anxiety subtypes and school adjustment. Sixty-two students aged 12-13 completed measures of anxiety and school adjustment before, immediately after and 4 months after completing the programme. Parents and teachers also rated the students on overall anxiety levels and school adjustment respectively. Results The intervention group's 'overall anxiety' and specifically 'separation anxiety' reduced significantly during the programme and continued to decrease at the 4-month follow-up. Conclusions A significant negative correlation was found between anxiety and school adjustment. The professional implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - The FRIENDS for Life programme is a cognitive behavioural based programme designed to reduce childhood anxiety and promote emotional resilience. Teachers are in a unique position to monitor children who are at risk and to intervene early with preventive social and emotional learning programmes. This study was designed to replicate very positive international evaluations of the FRIENDS for Life programme for anxiety reduction and extend the evidence base by investigating effects on strengths based qualities such as self- concept, coping and school connectedness. Further, for the first time in an Irish context primary school teachers were the lead facilitators of the programme, with 709 children aged 9 to 13 years in a representative sample of 27 primary schools from across Ireland. Schools were allocated to an intervention group or a wait-listed control group. Teachers were trained and supported to deliver the programme by educational psychologists. Quantitative and qualitative data including measures of anxiety, self-concept, coping, school connectedness and social validity indicated that the FRIENDS for Life programme was very positively received by children, parents and teachers. The programme was implemented successfully by teachers and resulted in positive outcomes for students including improved emotional wellbeing, greater coping skills and an enhanced sense of connectedness with school.

AB  - Anxiety‐related problems are common in childhood and adolescence and, if left untreated, may hold short‐term and long‐term negative consequences for psychosocial functioning and other domains. In addition to having negative individual‐level consequences, anxiety‐related problems may have a negative impact at the school level. Because almost all children and adolescents attend school, school plays a significant role in development as a socialisation agent and provides an ideal venue for the delivery of prevention and intervention programs. Here, we present the first evidence regarding the effectiveness of the My FRIENDS emotional resilience program as a method of reducing anxiety among students in Slovenia and the feasibility of implementing the program at the national level. Grade 8 students (N = 78) were assigned either the intervention condition, the My FRIENDS program, or a no‐treatment control condition. We measured general anxiety and its components using the AN‐UD (Lestvica anksioznosti za učence in dijake) anxiety scale and internalising difficulties using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire at preintervention, postintervention, and 6‐month follow‐up assessments. Students in the intervention condition reported lower amounts of general anxiety and its cognitive component of worrying, and fewer internalising difficulties at the postintervention and follow‐up assessments.

AB  - Introduction: Research has shown that the number of children and adolescents experiencing emotional difficulties such as anxiety is escalating, especially for those groups at risk. Living in an orphanage has been considered a risk factor for delays in an individuals' social, emotional and behavioral development. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Spanish version of the friends program, a cbt-based resilience program, with 57 girls from low socioeconomic status (ses) background that were living in an orphanage. Method: Participants received the program for ten consecutive weeks, and pre- and post-test measures were collected. Measures evaluated participants' anxiety symptoms, level of self-concept, hope, coping skills, and psychosocial difficulties. Social validity was also assessed. Results: Results showed positive changes, including a decrease in anxiety symptoms and psychosocial difficulties, as well as an increase in their proactive coping skills. Several subscales and items of the self-concept and hope outcome measures also reported statistically significant improvements. Conclusions: Participants and parents/ caregivers reported that the program was both enjoyable and useful. Implications of the findings and directions for further research are discussed. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Introducción: Las investigaciones han demostrado que el número de niños y adolescentes que experimentan dificultades emocionales como la ansiedad va en aumento, sobre todo para los grupos en situación de riesgo.

AB  - The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of FRIENDS, a well-validated emotional resiliency program, to reduce internalizing problems among primary school children aged 8-10. 47 children who reached at least the cutoff point for internalizing score, as measured using a standardized test on child behaviour, were allocated to either the intervention or the wait-list control condition. All children completed measures on internalizing symptoms and self-esteem both before and after an 8-week FRIENDS intervention or wait period. Results showed that children from the FRIENDS program showed significantly higher self-esteem and fewer internalizing symptoms when compared to those in the waitlist group. Modifications done on adapting FRIENDS to culturally and contextually appropriate content for Hong Kong children with internalizing problems were discussed. Limitations of this study were also addressed.

AB  - Background: Evaluations of school-based anxiety prevention programmes have reported improvements in psychological functioning although little is known about their effect upon educational outcomes. Methods: One thousand three hundred and sixty-two children from 40 primary schools in England took part in the randomised controlled trial, Preventing Anxiety in Children through Education in Schools. The trial investigated the effectiveness of a universal school-based cognitive behaviour therapy prevention programme, FRIENDS, delivered by health care staff or school staff compared with usual personal, social, health and education (PSHE) lessons. Self-report psychological outcomes and educational attainment on national standardised attainment tests in reading, writing and maths were collected 12 months postintervention. Analysis was performed at individual level using multivariable mixed effect models controlling for gender, type of intervention and school effect. Registered trial: ISRCTN: 23563048. Results: At 12 months, anxiety reduced in the health-led FRIENDS group compared to school-led FRIENDS and PSHE. There were no between-group differences in academic performance regardless of gender, deprivation, ethnicity and additional educational needs. Conclusions: School-based mental health interventions should assess psychological and educational outcomes. Further research should directly compare the effects of interventions led by health and school staff.

AB  - Emotional disorders in children are common and although effective interventions are available comparatively few receive specialist help. School nurses were trained to deliver an evidence-based emotional health cognitive behaviour therapy programme, FRIENDS, to 106 non-referred children aged 9–10 attending three schools. Levels of anxiety and self-esteem were stable in the 6-month period before FRIENDS. Three months after completing FRIENDS, anxiety had significantly decreased and self-esteem increased. Children with the most severe emotional problems benefited from the programme. The value of delivering standardised evidence based programmes in schools by school nurses is discussed and the need for further research highlighted.

AB  - Background: Emotional problems such as anxiety and low mood in children are common, impair everyday functioning and increase the risk of severe mental health disorders in adulthood. Relatively few children with emotional health problems are identified and referred for treatment indicating the need to investigate preventive approaches. Methods/Design: The study is designed to be a pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of an efficacious school-based cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) prevention program (FRIENDS) on symptoms of anxiety and low mood in children 9 to 10 years of age. The unit of allocation is schools which are assigned to one of three conditions: school-led FRIENDS, health-led FRIENDS or treatment as usual. Assessments will be undertaken at baseline, 6 months and 12 months. The primary outcome measure is change on the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale. Secondary outcome measures assess changes in self-esteem, worries, bullying and life satisfaction. An economic evaluation will be undertaken. Discussion: As of September 2011, 41 schools have been recruited and randomized. Final 12-month assessments are scheduled to be completed by May 2013.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anxiety in children is common, impairs everyday functioning, and increases the risk of severe mental health disorders in adulthood. We investigated the effect of a classroom-based cognitive behaviour therapy prevention programme (FRIENDS) on anxiety symptoms in children., METHODS: Preventing Anxiety in Children though Education in Schools (PACES) is a three-group parallel cluster randomised controlled trial. Interventions were given between September, 2011, and July, 2012, with schools as the unit of allocation and individual participants as the unit of analysis. We enrolled state-funded junior schools in southwest England. We sent information to all eligible schools (state-funded junior schools in southwest England) inviting them to enrol in the study. School year groups were assigned by computer-generated randomisation (1:1:1) to receive either school-led FRIENDS (led by teacher or school staff member), health-led FRIENDS (led by two trained health facilitators), or usual school provision. Children were not masked to treatment allocation. The allocated programme was given to all students (aged 9-10 years) in the school year (ie, universal delivery) as part of the school curriculum as nine, 60 min weekly sessions. Outcomes were collected by self-completed questionnaire administered by researchers masked to allocation. Primary outcome was symptoms of anxiety and low mood at 12 months assessed by the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS 30). Analyses were intention to treat and accounted for the clustered nature of the design. The study is registered, number ISRCTN23563048., FINDINGS: 45 schools were enrolled: 14 (n=497 children) were randomly assigned to school-led FRIENDS, 14 (n=509) to health-led FRIENDS, and 12 (n=442) to usual school provision. 1257 (92%) children completed 12 month assessments (449 in health-led FRIENDS, 436 in school-led FRIENDS, and 372 in usual school provision). We recorded a difference at 12 months in adjusted mean child-reported RCADS scores for health-led versus school-led FRIENDS (19.49 [SD 14.81] vs 22.86 [15.24]; adjusted difference -3.91, 95% CI -6.48 to -1.35; p=0.0004) and health-led FRIENDS versus usual school provision (19.49 [14.81] vs 22.48 [15.74]; -2.66, -5.22 to -0.09; p=0.043). We noted no differences in parent or teacher ratings. Training teachers to deliver mental health programmes was not as effective as delivery by health professionals., INTERPRETATION: Universally delivered anxiety prevention programmes can be effective when used in schools. However, programme effectiveness varies depending on who delivers them., FUNDING: National Institute for Health Research Public Health Research Programme. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Anxiety in children is common and incapacitating and increases the risk of mental health disorders in adulthood. Although effective interventions are available, few children are identified and referred for specialist treatment. Alternative approaches in which prevention programmes are delivered in school appear promising. However, comparatively little is known about the best intervention leader (health care-led vs. school-led), long-term effects or the primary preventive value of such programmes. Methods/Design: Preventing Anxiety in Children through Education in Schools, or PACES, is a pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of a cognitive-behavioural therapy prevention programme (FRIENDS) on symptoms of anxiety and low mood in 9- to 10-year-old children. Forty-one schools were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: school-led FRIENDS, health care-led FRIENDS or treatment as usual. Assessments were undertaken at baseline, 6 months and 12 months, with the primary outcome measure being the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale score at 12 months. Secondary outcome measures are changes in self-esteem, worries, bullying and life satisfaction. Discussion: This protocol summarises the procedure for the 24-month follow-up of this cohort. The study will determine the medium-term effectiveness of an anxiety prevention programme delivered in schools.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anxiety in children is common, impairs everyday functioning and increases the risk of severe mental health disorders in adulthood, yet few children with anxiety are identified and referred for treatment., OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a universal school-based preventative programme (FRIENDS) in reducing symptoms of anxiety and low mood., DESIGN: Cluster randomised controlled trial. Schools (n = 41) were randomly assigned after recruitment on a 1 : 1 : 1 basis to health-led FRIENDS, school-led FRIENDS and usual school provision., SETTING: Primary schools in three local education authorities in the south-west of England., PARTICIPANTS: Children (n = 1362) aged 9-10 years attending school and participating in personal, social and health education (PSHE)., INTERVENTIONS: The FRIENDS programme is a cognitive-behavioural therapy programme that develops skills to counter the cognitive, emotional and behavioural aspects of anxiety. The FRIENDS programme was led by either a trained member of the school or a health leader external to the school and was delivered over 9 consecutive weeks. The comparison group received usual school PSHE lessons. Interventions were delivered in the academic year September 2011-July 2012., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical effectiveness assessed by child report of symptoms of anxiety (Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale, RCADS); cost-effectiveness based on RCADS and quality-adjusted life-years (Child Health Utility 9 Dimensions, CHU-9D) between baseline and 6 months; process evaluation, evaluation of reach and attrition and qualitative feedback from children, school staff and parents., RESULTS: At 12 months there was a difference in the adjusted mean RCADS scores for health-led FRIENDS compared with school-led FRIENDS [-3.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) -6.48 to -1.35] and for health-led FRIENDS compared with usual school provision (-2.66, 95% CI -5.22 to -0.09). At 24 months we were able to assess only 43.6% of our cohort. There were few differences in baseline characteristics between completers and non-completers. Child-reported anxiety in all three groups had reduced by 24 months and there were no longer any group effects. There were no between-group effects for any parent- or child-completed secondary outcomes at 12 or 24 months. The cost of the FRIENDS programme was 52-56 per child. We found no evidence that the FRIENDS programme was cost-effective over a 6-month period; however, our subgroup for the economic analysis differed significantly from our main trial cohort., CONCLUSIONS: Although greater reductions in anxiety were noted at 12 months when the FRIENDS programme was delivered by health leaders, these additional benefits were not maintained at 24 months. Children's anxiety levels improved irrespective of the intervention that they received. Our economic evaluation and 24-month assessment had significant shortcomings. However, the universal delivery of specific anxiety prevention programmes will result in additional costs that may be beyond the finances available to most schools. Future work should identify the active ingredients and potential moderators of universal anxiety programmes to determine whether programme length can be reduced, short-term effectiveness maintained and cost-effectiveness improved. At present, our results find limited evidence to support the universal provision of specific anxiety prevention programmes in UK primary schools., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN23563048., FUNDING: The National Institute for Health Research Public Health Research programme.

AB  - This study is the first to examine the efficacy of the FRIENDS for Life program, a school-based, universal prevention program for childhood anxiety, when delivered exclusively to school-children from socioeconomically disadvantaged communities. Participants (N = 963) were children from Grades 5, 6 and 7 attending one of three public primary schools in Brisbane, Australia. Participants from all three schools completed a teacher-led intervention, delivered during regular classroom time within one school term. Participants completed measures assessing anxiety and depressive symptomatology, self-esteem, coping skills and psychosocial difficulties at pre, post and 12-month follow-up. Self-report data revealed significant decreases in both anxiety and depressive symptomatology at post-intervention which were maintained at followup. Significant reductions in peer problems and conduct problems, along with significant improvements in self-esteem and the use of coping strategies, were also noted over time. Clinical implications of the findings are discussed, along with limitations and directions for future research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study evaluated the efficacy of a school-based anxiety prevention program among urban children exposed to community violence. Students who attended Title 1 public elementary schools were screened. Ninety-eight 3rd-5th-grade students (ages 8-12; 48% female; 92% African American) were randomized into preventive intervention versus waitlist comparison groups. Students attended 13 biweekly one-hour group sessions of a modified version of FRIENDS, a cognitive-behavioral anxiety intervention program. Results indicated that both intervention and control groups manifested significant reductions in anxiety symptomatology and total exposure to community violence, along with improved standardized reading achievement scores. Additional gains observed only in the intervention group were increased standardized mathematics achievement scores, decreased life stressors, and reduced victimization by community violence. The intervention was equally efficacious for both genders and for children exposed to higher, compared to lower, levels of community violence. Implications for comprehensive, culturally and contextually relevant prevention programs and research are discussed.

AB  - The current study examined the effects of Rethink Autism's web-based video modeling program on the behavior of paraeducators as it relates to discrete trial teaching and on student performance of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder in a special education school environment. In addition, a cost analysis was conducted to assess the cost of training paraeducators under the supervision of a special education teacher compared to training special education teachers under the same condition to fulfill similar teaching functions. For the main component of the study, a multiple baseline design across subjects was employed; there were 4 primary participants (paraeducators) who were each matched with a separate student with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (secondary subjects). Every paraeducator began the three-phase intervention with the viewing of their student's unique specific skill Rethink Autism lesson video. This was completed prior to implementing each teaching session. (Each phase of the study included four teaching sessions.) In response to the expectations of the special education setting where the study was being held, more intensive interventions were added in phases 2 and 3 dependent on the paraeducator's performance related to discrete trial teaching (DTT) accuracy (90% over two sessions). These "retraining" interventions included the addition of Rethink Autism's general DTT training video and corrective verbal feedback. Results indicated that the Rethink Autism intervention was effective in increasing the DTT skill level of paraeducators as well as in increasing student performance. Effect sizes were large for all primary participants (DTT skills) and percentage gain was notable for all students' performance. Participants' treatment acceptability ratings indicated that the Rethink Autism web-based intervention was acceptable. Also, results of the cost analysis showed benefits of training paraeducators over special education teachers. Implications for practice, study limitations, and possible directions for future research are discussed. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

AB  - This paper examines the impact of two approaches to teacher professional development in arts integration--a summer institute model and a model combining the summer institute with instructional coaching. In an experimental design, the intervention trained third and fourth grade teachers to integrate visual arts and theater into reading curriculum. Findings suggest the coaching plus institute intervention had a greater impact on teacher confidence, use and frequency of arts integration than the institute-only intervention or on the comparison group. Coached teachers reported greater confidence integrating the arts, produced higher-quality work samples, taught more reading concepts with arts integration, implemented more arts standards, and used arts integration more frequently than did the institute-only teachers or the control group teachers. Coached teachers reported in greater numbers about the positive impact the professional development had on their teaching practice, including feeling more creative, inspired and finding greater enjoyment in teaching. Coached teachers were more likely than institute-only teachers to correctly use state VAPA standards and to perceive student progress towards those standards. Institute-only teachers demonstrated greater confidence in and used arts integration more frequently than did the comparison group. However, they did not reach the same levels as the coached teachers and were more likely to report time constraints and other roadblocks to successful implementation. Teachers in both treatment groups reported high student engagement and better expression of learning by students when using arts integration instructional strategies. This project was funded through the U.S. Department of Education Arts in Education Model Development and Dissemination program.

AB  - In this paper I examine the Nordic model, i.e. a child-centred and holistic approach, in order to discuss Early Childhood Education (ECE) as a key policy instrument for fighting social inequality. Since 1999 it has been an important goal for the Danish government to ensure equal opportunities for all by starting with early intervention. This is especially relevant in Denmark, where greater than 95% of all children attend day-care. International research shows that early interventions can make a positive difference, and as shown in US Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) studies, the effects are lasting. On the other hand, international research does not address the two different main approaches to the ECE systems (holistic/academic) nor to the questions of how pedagogic initiatives and framework conditions work as prerequisites for success (best practice). An analysis of research into the situation in the Nordic countries shows growing awareness of how to identify target groups for ECE-intervention as well as an increased focus on pre-school school teachers' education and the need for new assessment and evaluation methods for determining best practice. Since it would appear that the ECE system fails to provide equal social and intellectual opportunities to all children, further development in this area is required. Based on an analysis of the Nordic situation, some preliminary results of a recent Danish intervention involving some 60 centres and 2700 pre-school children are presented and discussed.

AB  - Objective: Most children with autism rely on schools as their primary source of intervention, yet research has suggested that teachers rarely use evidence-based practices. To address the need for improved educational outcomes, a previously tested consultation intervention called the Collaborative Model for Promoting Competence and Success (COMPASS; Ruble, Dalrymple, & McGrew, 2010; Ruble, Dalrymple, & McGrew, 2012) was evaluated in a 2nd randomized controlled trial, with the addition of a web-based group. Method: Forty-nine teacher-child dyads were randomized into 1 of 3 groups: (1) a placebo control (PBO) group, (2) COMPASS followed by face-to-face (FF) coaching sessions, and (3) COMPASS followed by web-based (WEB) coaching sessions. Three individualized goals (social, communication, and independence skills) were selected for intervention for each child. The primary outcome of independent ratings of child goal attainment and several process measures (e.g., consultant and teacher fidelity) were evaluated. Results: Using an intent-to-treat approach, findings replicated earlier results with a very large effect size (d = 1.41) for the FF group and a large effect size (d = 1.12) for the WEB group relative to the PBO group. There were no differences in overall change across goal domains between the FF and WEB groups, suggesting the efficacy of videoconferencing technology. Conclusions: COMPASS is effective and results in improved educational outcomes for young children with autism. Videoconferencing technology, as a scalable tool, has promise for facilitating access to autism specialists and bridging the research-to-practice gap. (Contains 4 tables and 1 figure.)

AB  - This study examined the direct and indirect effects between training in the Responsive Classroom(TM) (RC) approach, teachers' uptake of RC practices, and teacher-student interaction quality, using a structural equation modeling framework. A total of 24 schools were randomly assigned to experimental or control conditions. Third- and fourth-grade teachers in treatment schools (n = 132) received training in the RC approach, whereas teachers in control schools (n = 107) continued 'business as usual.' Observers rated teachers' fidelity of implementation (FOI) of RC practices 5 times throughout the year using the Classroom Practices Observation Measure. In addition, teachers completed self-report measures of FOI, the Classroom Practices Teacher Survey and Classroom Practices Frequency Survey, at the end of the school year. Teacher-student interactions were rated during classroom observations using the Classroom Assessment Scoring System. Controlling for teachers' grade level and teacher-student interaction quality at pretest, RC training was expected to predict posttest teacher-student interaction quality directly and indirectly through FOI. Results supported only a significant indirect effect, Beta = 0.85, p = .002. Specifically, RC teachers had higher levels of FOI of RC practices, Beta = 1.62, p < .001, R2 = .69. In turn, FOI related to greater improvement in teacher-student interaction quality, Beta = 0.52, p = .001, R2 = .32. Discussion highlights factors contributing to variability in FOI and school administrators roles in supporting FOI.

AB  - Objective: To investigate elementary school teachers' baseline knowledge about ADHD and learning disorders (LD) and the impact of a strategy to increase awareness of these disorders. Method: A total of 37 teachers were selected from four elementary schools in the catchment area of the University Hospital, in Porto Alegre, Brazil. To evaluate teachers' knowledge, two self-report questionnaires about ADHD and LD were applied before and after an awareness program on these disorders. Results: The intervention significantly increased teachers' knowledge of both disorders, even after adjustment for confounding factors (p <.001). In the repeated measures ANCOVA, only teachers' previous knowledge of ADHD/LD (p <.001) was significant in predicting score change in knowledge before and after the intervention. Conclusion: Results suggest the efficacy of a brief psychoeducational intervention program for increasing teacher awareness and knowledge about ADHD and LD. Future studies are warranted to confirm the efficacy and evaluate the long-term impact of this intervention.

AB  - Background: Adult-child relational interactions constitute an essential component of out-of-school-time programs, and training staff to effectively interact with children is key to improving program quality. Efficient staff training, that meets the limited time availability of out-of-school time staff, is particularly needed. Objective: This pilot study introduces Simple Interactions (SI), an innovative, strengths-based, and interaction-based professional development approach. Rather than attempting to teach generic competencies or targeting weakness areas for improvement, SI is designed to help program staff build from their strengths. Methods: In two cohorts over the course of 10 months, ten afterschool programs (N = 70 staff) participated in a pilot of SI. Program staff watched short video clips of themselves working with children and used the intuitive, 1-page SI Tool to guide discussion of adult-child interactions; specifically, connection (affective intune-ness), reciprocity (balanced roles of engagement), participation (involving all children), and progression (incremental challenge). Results: Results suggest that participants valued the professional development process, the strengths-based approach, and the use of self-video despite initial apprehension, and reported perceived improvements in their professional learning communities. Pre-post videos of Cohort 2 staff (n = 20), coded blind to time point (pre or post), indicate significant and substantive improvements in staff-child connection, reciprocity, and participation. Conclusion: These results support the use of this simple, practical, and potentially effective model of supporting quality improvement for and by local staff.

AB  - Across the globe, social workers serve schools in a variety of capacities, providing services such as skills training; individual, group, and family counseling; crisis intervention; home visits; parent support and education; and advocacy for students, families, and school systems. To date, no synthesis of the literature exists examining tier 1 and tier 2 cross-national school-based social work interventions. Therefore, the purpose of this systematic review was twofold: (1) to identify tier 1 and tier 2 school-based interventions that involve social workers and (2) to examine the extent to which the interventions are efficacious with school-based youths. A computerized search with inclusion and exclusion criteria was conducted using several databases. Eighteen studies were included for the final sample in this review. Effect sizes were calculated for all outcomes to determine magnitude of treatment effect. Results indicated that most of the studies were conducted in the United States (n = 14) and half (n = 9) of the included interventions were tier 1. Many positive effect sizes were found. Interventions aimed to treat a variety of outcomes such as sexual health, aggression, self-esteem, school attendance, identity, and depression. More research is needed to determine the effectiveness of school-based social work worldwide. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The process of reporting suspected child maltreatment to authorities is often difficult for both mental health professionals and family members who are intimately involved. This article reports the development of a training programme to assist professionals in effectively reporting suspected child maltreatment. A study was conducted to develop a training curriculum to assist professionals in reporting suspected child maltreatment. The study aimed to further develop an existing workshop on child maltreatment reporting. The participants were 55 professional and student mental health practitioners who were randomly assigned to the child abuse reporting workshop or a comparison workshop designed to enhance ethnic cultural sensitivity. The participants were administered various outcome measure pre- and post- workshops. The results indicated that participants in the reporting suspected child maltreatment workshop demonstrated significant improvement in knowledge of child maltreatment reporting laws, accuracy in recognising child maltreatment, and clinical expertise in reporting. The improvement noted in the child maltreatment reporting workshop participants provides initial support for the utility and promise of the training programme.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the Targeted Reading Intervention (TRI), a professional development and early reading intervention program delivered via webcam technology, could support the early reading progress of English learners (ELs). Participants for the current study were drawn from a larger three‐year randomized controlled trial and included 108 ELs from 47 classrooms randomly assigned to treatment and control conditions. Teachers in treatment classrooms used the TRI in one‐on‐one sessions in the regular classroom for approximately 15 minutes per day. Weekly, and later biweekly, webcam coaching sessions between a TRI coach and each classroom teacher allowed the coach to interact with both the teacher and students in real time and allowed classroom teachers to receive real‐time feedback from the coach. Two‐level hierarchical linear models suggested that ELs struggling with learning to read in intervention classrooms significantly outperformed their peers in control classrooms on word‐level measures of early reading, with effect sizes of .43 and .45, but not on text‐level measures. Results also suggested that ELs struggling with learning to read were gaining at the same rate as their nonstruggling peers but were unable to catch up within the study year.

AB  - This report discusses the outcomes of a study that tested the effectiveness and compared two different approaches of conjoint behavioral consultation using a manual versus a videotape series as the main components of training parents and teachers to treat children's behavioral difficulties. Children (n=68) exhibiting externalizing or internalizing behavioral problems who attended Head Start Programs were targeted for this intervention. During the first 2 years of the project, a manual-based program was conducted. The last 3 years of the project involved delivery of the parent/teacher training program through a series of videotapes and accompanying manuals. Children were randomly assigned to either an experimental or no-treatment control group. Results indicated that both of the treatment groups demonstrated improved behaviors within more cases when compared to the control group, and that the manual treatment group reported the greatest number of behavioral improvements. Direct behavioral observations did not indicate clinically relevant improvements in behavior; however, parent and teacher goal attainment reports characterized students as meeting their behavioral goals overall. Both parents and teachers also reported high rates of treatment acceptability and satisfaction with both the manual and videotape treatment programs. Appendices include the assessment instruments.

AB  - The potential of formative assessment, evident in several research reviews, has raised the interest in many countries to invest in reform initiatives to develop its use. However, implementation of formative assessment is not straightforward and there is a lack of knowledge about how to design appropriate professional development. The intervention study presented in this thesis aimed to see if a random selection of teachers, participating in a professional development program with many contact hours and substantial support of an expert, implemented formative assessment in a way that increased their students’ learning in mathematics. It also aimed to examine the reasons for the teachers’ changes in their classroom practice. The twenty-two year 4 teachers attended a professional development program in formative assessment in mathematics. A mixed methods approach used classroom observations, teacher interviews, questionnaire surveys and student mathematics tests to investigate the effects on teacher classroom practice and student achievement. It was found that the teachers trained in formative assessment built on their previous formative classroom practice and added new formative assessment activities into their mathematics classroom practice to a level that had significant impact on student achievement in mathematics (p = .036, d = .66). The teachers developed their formative assessment practice in three dimensions: key processes in teaching and learning, agents in the classroom, and the length of the formative assessment cycle. The reasons for teachers ́ implementation of new formative assessment activities were well explained by the expectancy-value theory of achievement motivation. Important aspects of the professional development program were: (1) A formative and process-oriented character; (2) Activities directly useable in classrooms; (3) Experience of using formative assessment activities; (4) Connection between theory and practice; (5) Time; and (6) Knowledgeable support. The thesis shows that it was possible to provide sufficient support to a random selection of teachers for them to develop their formative assessment practice in a way that improved student achievement. However, this thesis also indicates that it can be expected that teachers would need substantial time and support to achieve such developments in their classroom practice.

AB  - A random sample of 22 Year 4 teachers in mathematics from a middle-sized Swedish municipality participated in a teacher professional development programme in formative assessment. The content of the programme was formative assessment conceptualised as a unity of different, integrated strategies. The study examines the effects on student achievement of the changes in the teachers' formative classroom practice that followed the professional development input. Results show that, after controlling for pretest scores, the classes in the intervention group significantly outperformed the classes in the control group in a posttest administered one school year after the end of the programme (p = 0.036, d = 0.66).

AB  - A random sample of 22 Year 4 teachers in mathematics from a middle-sized Swedish municipality participated in a teacher professional development programme in formative assessment. The content of the programme was formative assessment conceptualised as a unity of different, integrated strategies. The study examines the effects on student achievement of the changes in the teachers’ formative classroom practice that followed the professional development input. Results show that, after controlling for pretest scores, the classes in the intervention group significantly outperformed the classes in the control group in a posttest administered one school year after the end of the programme (p = 0.036, d = 0.66). The study contributes to the understanding of under-studied areas of the impact of professional development in formative assessment, and the impact of teacher practice based on formative assessment conceptualised as a unity of different formative assessment strategies.

AB  - Heterogeneity in treatment effects of MyTeachingPartner (MTP), a professional development coaching intervention focused on improving teacher–student interactions, was examined for 1407 4-year-old preschoolers who were enrolled in classrooms that served children between the ages of 3 and 5. On average, there were no consistent impacts of MTP coaching on children’s school performance, but there was evidence of moderation in treatment effects as a function of classroom age diversity, defined as the proportion of children who were not 4 years of age. MTP coaching improved children’s expressive vocabulary, literacy skills, and inhibitory control in classrooms that served primarily 4-year-olds and were less age diverse. These effects were in large part due to MTP causing improvements in teachers’ instructional support that in turn was more predictive of children’s skills in less age-diverse classrooms. Results also indicated that the nature of age diversity did not matter; a greater number of 3- or 5-year-old classmates equally reduced the benefits of the MTP intervention for 4-year-olds. The sole exception occurred for receptive vocabulary, in which case, MTP was most effective in classrooms with a larger number of older (but not younger) children. Taken together, these results suggest that under the right circumstances, the benefits of professional development that improve early childhood educators’ teaching practices can also translate into benefits for students.

AB  - Professional development (PD) is a critical pathway for promoting the use of evidence-based intervention practices in early childhood (EC) settings. Coaching has been proposed as a type of PD that is especially promising for job-embedded learning. A lack of consensus exists regarding evidence-based EC coaching strategies and what types of support coaches need to implement these strategies. In this literature review, we analyzed the EC coaching literature in terms of coaching strategies shown to improve EC practitioners’ use of effective intervention practices, coaching model components and strategies, the rigor and quality of the research, and the preparation provided to coaches in the identified articles. We conclude with recommendations for enhancing the effectiveness of coaching and improving the preparation of coaches who serve in EC settings.

AB  - This paper compares the effectiveness of two interventions aimed to improve teaching quality and student achievement in Indonesia. The first intervention was the use of education standards, while the second one was the combination of education standards with a teacher improvement program. The study involved 50 schools, 52 teachers, and 1660 students. Teaching quality was measured through classroom observations and student achievement was assessed with a performance test. The multilevel analysis showed student achievement improved only in the second intervention group, whereas the analyses of difference and effect size showed teaching quality in the same group improved only in the first half of the intervention program.

AB  - Using a randomized controlled trial, we tested a new teacher professional development program for increasing the language and literacy skills of young Latino English learners with 45 teachers and 105 students in 12 elementary schools. School-based teams randomly assigned to the intervention received professional development focused on cultural wealth, high-impact instructional strategies, and a framework for collaboration. We observed each teacher three times during the school year and assessed students individually at the beginning and end of the school year using the Woodcock Muñoz Language Survey (WMLS). Using an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis, we found effects for the intervention on teachers' implementation of high-impact instructional strategies and students' language and literacy skills.

AB  - There is a growing evidence base showing the efficacy of school-based interventions to prevent conduct problems but few evaluations have addressed teachers' perceptions of these programmes. Teachers' views on the acceptability, feasibility and usefulness of an intervention will influence implementation fidelity and programme sustainability and can help further our understanding of how the intervention works and how it may be improved. A pilot study of the Incredible Years Teacher Training Programme supplemented by a curriculum unit on social and emotional skills was conducted in inner-city pre-schools in Kingston, Jamaica. Three pre-schools comprising 15 classrooms participated in the intervention which involved seven monthly teacher workshops and 14 weekly child lessons in each class. At the end of the intervention in-depth individual interviews were conducted with each intervention teacher. Teachers reported benefits to their own teaching skills and professional development, to their relationships with children and to the behaviour, social-emotional competence and school readiness skills of the children in their class. Teachers also reported benefits to teacher-parent relationships and to children's behaviour at home. A hypothesis representing the teachers' perceptions of how the intervention achieved these benefits was developed. The hypothesis suggests that intervention effects were due to teachers' gains in skills and knowledge in three main areas: (1) a deeper understanding of young children's needs and abilities; (2) increased use of positive and proactive strategies; and (3) explicitly teaching social and emotional skills. These changes then led to the variety of benefits reported for teachers, children and parents. Teachers reported few difficulties in implementing the majority of strategies and strongly recommended wider dissemination of the intervention. The intervention was valued by Jamaican pre-school teachers and teachers felt they were able to successfully integrate the strategies learned into their regular practice.

AB  - Presents the evaluation design and case study outcomes for 28 children (aged 3–5 yrs) from the 1st 3 yrs of the Ohio Early Childhood Intervention (ECI) project. The ECI project was designed to help build the capacity of professionals for intervention design. Capacity building refers to preparing educational systems for change and, specific to this report, providing valid conceptual and procedural guidelines for early intervention. The foundations of the ECI project are ecobehavioral analysis, ecological consultation, and naturalistic intervention design. The acronym PASSKey (Planned Activity, Strategic Sampling, Keystone behavior) describes 3 major aspects of the assessment-intervention guidelines. Validity evidence for the guidelines is based on single case quasi-experimental (accountability and case study) designs documented by comprehensive early childhood case portfolios. In addition, estimates were obtained of the consultants' time spent in problem solving. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The goal of the present study was to determine whether a web-based medium is an effective tool for supporting knowledge, attitude, and behavior change in teachers of elementary school children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Nineteen teachers from Nova Scotia, Canada completed a 7-week intervention that consisted of presentations, web links, and discussion board activities related to different aspects of ADHD. Teachers' knowledge positively changed from pre- to post-intervention (p = .03), as did teachers' attitudes related to perceived control in their classrooms (p = .001) and competence in teaching (p < .0001). The study demonstrated that a web-based medium is a useful tool for knowledge creation and translation and has potential as a means of providing professional development to teachers about ADHD.

AB  - Background/Context: Billions of dollars are spent annually on professional development (PD) for educators, yet few randomized controlled trials (RCT) have demonstrated the ultimate impact PD has on student learning. Further, while policymakers and others speak to the role schools should play in developing students' civic awareness, RCTs of PD designed to foster civic learning are rare. This randomized controlled trial contributes to the knowledge base on the effectiveness of PD designed to integrate civic learning, ethical reflection, and historical thinking skills into high school humanities courses. Focus of Study: The study examined the impact of a PD intervention in two areas: (a) teacher self-efficacy, burnout, and professional engagement and satisfaction; and (b) the academic, civic, social, and ethical competencies of 9th and 1 Oth grade students in the teachers' classes. Population/Participants/Subjects: The study involved 113 teachers and 1,371 9th and 10th grade students in 60 high schools from eight metropolitan regions in the United States. Intervention/Program/Praclice: The intervention, Facing History and Ourselves, provides PD through a five-day seminar, curricular materials, and follow-up coaching and workshops to help teachers develop their capacities to implement an interdisciplinary historical case study unit using student-centered pedagogy. Research Design: The study used a school-level, randomized, experimental design to investigate impacts of the intervention for teachers and their 9th and 10th grade students. Findings/Results: Intervention teachers showed significantly greater self-efficacy in all eight assessed domains, more positive perceptions of professional support, satisfaction and growth, and greater personal accomplishment. Intervention students demonstrated stronger skills for analyzing evidence, agency, and cause and effect on a historical understanding performance measure; greater self-reported civic efficacy and tolerance for others with different views; and more positive perceptions of the classroom climate and the opportunities afforded for engaging with civic matters. Fidelity analysis found these causal effects despite the fact that roughly half of the intervention teachers did not fully implement the program. Conclusions/Recommendations: Educators need evidence-based approaches for teaching complex social, civic, and political issues enabling students of diverse mindsets and backgrounds to engage constructively with one another while obtaining necessary skills and knowledge. These findings provide empirical support for a professional development approach that engages teachers in fostering academic and civic competencies critical to both participation in a democracy and success in college and career.

AB  - Biological energy flow has been notoriously difficult to teach. Our approach to this topic relies on abiotic and biotic examples of the energy released by moving electrons in thermodynamically spontaneous reactions. A series of analogical model-building experiences was supported with common language and representations including manipulatives. These materials were designed to help learners understand why electrons move in a hydrogen explosion and hydrogen fuel cell, so they could ultimately understand the rationale for energy transfer in the mitochondrion and the chloroplast. High school biology teachers attended a 2-wk Students Understanding eNergy ( SUN) workshop during a randomized controlled trial. These treatment group teachers then took hydrogen fuel cells, manipulatives, and other materials into their regular biology classrooms. In this paper, we report significant gains in teacher knowledge and self-efficacy regarding biological energy transfer in the treatment group versus randomized controls. Significant effects on treatment group teacher knowledge and self-efficacy were found not only post-SUN workshop but even 1 yr later. Teacher knowledge was measured with both a multiple-choice exam and a drawing with a written explanation. Teacher confidence in their ability to teach biological energy transfer was measured by a modified form of the Science Teaching Efficacy Belief Instrument, In-Service A. Professional development implications regarding this topic are discussed.

AB  - Background: There is growing interest in school-based interventions for building resilience in children facing trauma and adversity. Recent studies focus on teacher training as an effective way to enhance resilience in their students, and emphasize the need for additional evidence-based practice. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a short-term resilience-building teacher intervention on reducing post-traumatic distress in students in the context of exposure to recurrent rocket attacks in Israel. Methods: A quasi-experimental, cluster randomized design employing intervention and wait-list control groups was implemented with students from grades four-six (N = 563) in four schools in Acre in the aftermath of the Second Lebanon War. We assessed the students’ trauma exposure, posttraumatic symptoms and anxiety before and after the intervention or the wait-list condition. Results: There was a significantly (p < 0.001) greater decrease of posttraumatic symptoms and anxiety levels among the students whose teachers participated in the intervention group as compared to students whose teachers were in the wait-list control group. A multiple regression model showed that this greater decrease in posttraumatic symptoms and anxiety levels was statistically significant after controlling for demographic variables, trauma exposure and past trauma history. Conclusion: The results of this study show that the training of teachers alone in building resilience can effectively lower post-traumatic distress and anxiety in their students. The empowerment of teachers and by building upon their expertise and experience are crucial for creating sustainability in school-based interventions.

AB  - Based on transformational leadership theory, we generate and test a teacher development intervention designed to modify physical education teachers’ transformational teaching behaviors, and their adolescent students’ self-determined motivation, self-efficacy, and intentions to be physically active. Using a randomised control group design (11 teachers, 286 students in the experimental group; 16 teachers, 395 students in the control group), the intervention involved a 1-day experiential workshop with a booster session 2 months later, and with post-test measurements at 2- and 4-months post-workshop. After controlling for baseline measures, adolescents in the intervention condition rated their teachers as displaying significantly higher levels of transformational teaching, and reported significantly higher levels of self-determined motivation, self-efficacy, and intentions to be physically active than those in the control group at the first post-test. Significant between-group differences in students’ reports of transformational teaching and their own self-determined motivation remained at the second post-test measurement.

AB  - This study investigated the perceived feasibility and pattern of implementation following an online training for teachers delivering an integrated intervention encompassing two school-based universal preventive interventions: Promoting Alternative THinking Strategies (PATHS) curriculum and the PAX Good Behavior Game (GBG). Forty-five teachers from three urban elementary schools completed an online training consisting of didactics and video demonstration and received in-person coaching across a 31-week implementation period. Data from 65 teachers from three schools who received in-person training and coaching provided a benchmark for comparison. Most teachers in the online training + in-person coaching (OLT + IPC) condition reported that the technology was easy to use and that the course was as effective as an in-person workshop. Teachers in the OLT + IPC group reported positive attitudes regarding PATHS and the PAX GBG that generally were not significantly different from attitudes reported by teachers who received in-person training + in-person coaching (IPT + IPC). Importantly, teachers in the OLT + IPC condition achieved a high level of implementation quality similar to that demonstrated by teachers in the IPT + IPC condition. The frequency of intervention delivery by OLT + IPC teachers was also not significantly different than that of IPT + IPC teachers. These findings provide evidence that the internet is a promising component in a training sequence designed to teach teachers to deliver evidence-based preventive interventions.

AB  - Parents and teachers of children with special needs face unique social-emotional challenges in carrying out their caregiving roles. Stress associated with these roles impacts parents' and special educators' health and well-being, as well as the quality of their parenting and teaching. No rigorous studies have assessed whether mindfulness training (MT) might be an effective strategy to reduce stress and cultivate well-being and positive caregiving in these adults. This randomized controlled study assessed the efficacy of a 5-week MT program for parents and educators of children with special needs. Participants receiving MT showed significant reductions in stress and anxiety and increased mindfulness, self-compassion, and personal growth at program completion and at 2 months follow-up in contrast to waiting-list controls. Relational competence also showed significant positive changes, with medium-to-large effect sizes noted on measures of empathic concern and forgiveness. MT significantly influenced caregiving competence specific to teaching. Mindfulness changes at program completion mediated outcomes at follow-up, suggesting its importance in maintaining emotional balance and facilitating well-being in parents and teachers of children with developmental challenges.

AB  - Research shows spatial reasoning and an early start to mathematics are key predictors of later school success. This thesis explores educator learning in a professional learning intervention study, focusing on spatial reasoning tasks. A team of JK-Grade 2 teachers, early childhood educators and a math coach spent time implementing a series of playful, research-developed spatial reasoning tasks in mathematics. Educator learning throughout this process was considered, with particular focus on two cases: a kindergarten teacher and a math coach. Results indicate several benefits to educator learning, including learning by observing children, through implementation of research-developed tasks, about mathematics content, and through personal reflection. The co-creation of tasks was highlighted as extremely important for educator learning. It is important for educators to co-create tasks instead of simply implementing existing ones. This intervention study also highlighted some challenges of teacher professional learning, including time, administrator support, educator perceptions and implementation of tasks.

AB  - We used a multi-component single-subject experimental design across three preschool teachers to examine the effects of video self-monitoring with graduated training and feedback on the accuracy with which teachers monitored their implementation of embedded instructional learning trials. We also examined changes in teachers’ implementation of learning trials. In each self-monitoring condition, teachers observed and recorded their implemented learning trials using video and a coding form. Conditions differed in the specificity of prompts on the coding form and the type of training and feedback provided. The combination of training, coding forms with specific prompts for learning trial components, and external feedback generally resulted in more accurate self-monitoring for two of three participants and increases in the fidelity of implementation of learning trials. Findings suggest self-monitoring can be effective for increasing the fidelity with which teachers implement embedded instructional learning trials, but systematic training and feedback are important for ensuring self-monitoring accuracy.

AB  - Project RIME, Reading Instructional Methods of Efficacy, is an interactive, collaborative professional development project designed to support early elementary and special education teachers as they integrate more explicit instruction for children at risk for reading failure into their curricula. Two components of the model are described: the interactive course and the year-long school collaboration. This article focuses on 11 teachers from two schools and compares them to teachers from two other schools. Several evaluations, including measures of teachers' attitudes and knowledge, are described. Results indicate that although teachers became more positive and knowledgeable toward using explicit instruction, their orientation toward implicit, whole-language approaches remained stable. In contrast, teachers' attitudes and knowledge in the comparison schools were unchanged. Results from student performance are also summarized. The perceptions of 3 teachers were explored further using qualitative data analysis techniques. Implications for professional development are discussed.

AB  - Research reviews have shown that the use of formative assessment in classroom practice can substantially improve student achievement. However, a strong research base about how to support teachers’ implementation of such formative classroom practice is lacking. In this thesis, I investigate the effects of a comprehensive professional development programme (PDP) in formative assessment on teachers’ classroom practice and students’ achievement in mathematics. In addition, I identify reasons for the changes made in the teachers’ formative classroom practice. Fourteen randomly selected year - 7 mathematics teachers participated in the PDP. The teachers’ formative classroom practice before and after attending the programme was analysed and described, and reasons for their change in practice were explored. The effect of the changes in formative classroom practice on students’ mathematics achievement was examined using pre- and post-tests administered to both the intervention group and a control group. A mixed methods approach with classroom observations, teacher interviews, questionnaires and student achievement tests in mathematics was used in the studies included in the thesis.The results show that the teachers used aspects of formative assessment in their classroom practice before the PDP, but that there was plenty of room for development towards a more effective formative assessment practice. Several possibilities for developing the practice were identified. After the PDP the teachers believed in the idea of formative assessment and were motivated to make changes towards a more formative classroom practice. The teachers included new formative assessment activities in their classroom practice, but in different ways and to different degrees. The characteristics of these changes were identified, and also the characteristics of the PDP that the teachers found to be influential for their development of the formative classroom practice. Results also show that the teachers’ motivational beliefs held after the PDP was an explanatory factor for their changes in practice. However, the formative assessment practice the teachers implemented did not have a significant effect on their students’ achievement compared to the control group. In addition, there was no correlation between the number of formative assessment activities implemented by the teachers and their students’ achievement gains. Reasons for these non-effects on student achievement, and for the teachers’ degree and type of implementation of formative assessment in the classroom practice, are discussed in the thesis.

AB  - This study evaluates the relationships between aspects of Chilean teachers' explicit vocabulary instruction and students' vocabulary development in kindergarten. Classroom videotapes of whole-class instruction gathered during a randomized experimental evaluation of a coaching-based professional development program were analyzed. The amount of conceptual information about words made available during these discussions was the only significant predictor of students' end-of-kindergarten vocabulary, when controlling for the density and diversity of teachers' language and time spent in explicit vocabulary support, as well as child and teacher demographics. Each additional standard deviation of conceptual information about words provided predicted a 0.11 standard deviation increase in students' vocabulary outcomes. Practice and policy implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - This article presents findings from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) testing the impact of a novel coaching approach utilized as one element of the Double Check cultural responsivity and student engagement model. The RCT included 158 elementary and middle school teachers randomized to receive coaching or serve as comparisons; all participating teachers were exposed to school-wide professional development activities. Pre-post nonexperimental comparisons indicated improvements in self-reported culturally responsive behavior management and self-efficacy for teachers in both conditions following professional development exposure. With regard to the experimental findings, trained observers recorded significantly more proactive behavior management and anticipation of student problems by teachers, higher student cooperation, less student noncooperation, and fewer disruptive behaviors in classrooms led by coached teachers relative to comparison teachers. Taken together, the findings suggest the potential promise of coaching combined with school-wide professional development for improving classroom management practices and possibly reducing office discipline referrals among Black students.

AB  - Two professional development (PD) models for teachers were compared on teacher and student outcomes. Special education teachers participated in Literacy Learning Cohorts (LLC), a PD innovation designed to improve content and pedagogical knowledge for providing reading instruction to upper elementary students with learning disabilities. The LLC, based on Desimone's (2009) framework, included 2 days of initial PD with follow-up meetings, coaching, and video self-analysis. A comparison group received only 2 days of PD. Results of independent t tests and analyses of covariance indicated that LLC teachers demonstrated significant change in instructional time allotted to, and quality of, word study and fluency instruction. LLC teachers also made significantly greater gains on the fluency knowledge measure as compared with the comparison group, but they did not differ in word study knowledge. Hierarchical linear modeling analyses showed that students of LLC teachers made significantly greater gains on word attack skills and decoding efficiency than did students of teachers in the comparison group.

AB  - Purpose: This study examined the extent to which teacher responsivity education affected preschoolers' language and literacy development over an academic year. Additional aims were to determine whether children's initial language abilities and teachers' use of responsivity strategies were associated with language outcomes, in particular. Method: In this randomized controlled trial, preschool centers were assigned to a responsivity education intervention (n = 19 centers, 25 teachers, and 174 children) or a "business-as-usual" control condition (n = 19 centers, 24 teachers, and 156 children). Teachers within the intervention centers received training focused on a set of strategies designed to promote children's engagement and participation in extended conversational interactions across the school day. Results: Hierarchical linear models showed no main effects on children's language skills, although moderating effects were observed such that the intervention appeared to have positive effects for children with relatively high initial language abilities. In addition, teacher use of responsivity strategies was positively associated with vocabulary development. With regard to children's literacy skills, there was a significant main effect of the intervention on print-concept knowledge. Conclusions: Although teacher responsivity education is viewed as benefitting children's language and literacy development, the impacts of this type of intervention on children's skills warrant further investigation.

AB  - This study examined changes in preschool teachers' perceptions of classroom management strategies following group training in the recently revised Incredible Years Teacher Classroom Management Program (C. Webster-Stratton, 2006). The authors used a pre/post follow-up design across 2 groups that each met for 8 sessions over an 8-10-week period for a total of 32 hr of training. Twenty-four preschool teachers from one of the lowest income and highest unemployment counties in the state of Michigan participated in the program. To examine short-term maintenance effects, the authors collected follow-up data 16 weeks after all teachers completed the training. The authors found improvements in teachers' perceptions of positive classroom management strategies and their use. Transporting this evidence-based teacher training program to school-based mental health service delivery settings warrants additional study. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Because research has shown that providing information alone does not have an impact on educators’ behavior, supervisors and other individuals interested in personnel preparation are becoming interested in providing early childhood educators with continuous feedback about their classroom performance. Reviews of the literature on performance feedback have been conducted in the field of organization behavior management; however, a compilation of early childhood information was needed. Nineteen studies conducted in early childhood (i.e., infant/toddler through fourth grade) classrooms were reviewed to determine the characteristics of performance feedback provided to early childhood educators. Intervention effectiveness was then assessed using visual analysis of graphed data. Across studies, an immediate and clear feedback effect was displayed in the majority of tiers (participants, settings, or behaviors), contributing to the conclusion that performance feedback is a promising practice.

AB  - The current era of education reform is characterized by increased standards and higher expectations for teacher performance. Teachers should be given timely, effective access to tools designed to improve their instructional and classroom management practice. One technique that has been used to improve teacher's use of effective classroom management strategies is performance feedback. This review of the literature examines the impact of performance feedback on two evidence-based classroom management strategies: praise and opportunities to respond (OTRs). Findings from the review suggest that performance feedback may be an effective technique for improving teachers' use of praise in the classroom. Performance feedback's impact on teachers' use of OTRs is less clear. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

AB  - Few studies have examined whether training can improve competency in intervening with suicidal youths. In this study we attempted to verify the effectiveness of such a training program on helper competency. Forty-three helpers who received the training were compared with 28 helpers who did not. Participants who received the training improved in knowledge, attitudes, and intervention skills following the training, compared with the control group across measures. Their gains were maintained at 6-month follow-up. In this sample, implementation of a one-time training program improved helpers' competencies in youth suicide intervention. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

Nineteen secondary-school PE teachers in Seoul were randomly assigned into either an experimental or a delayed-treatment control group, and their 1,158 students self-reported their course-related psychological need satisfaction, autonomous motivation, amotivation, classroom engagement, skill development, future intentions, and academic achievement at the beginning, middle, and end of the semester. Observers' ratings and students' self-reports confirmed that the intervention was successful. Repeated-measures ANCOVAs showed that the students of teachers in the experimental group showed midsemester and end-of-semester improvements in all dependent measures.

AB  - Student amotivation is a state of motivational apathy in which students harbor little or no reason to engage in classroom learning activities; it is a motivational deficit that is strongly associated with maladaptive functioning. Using a self-determination theory framework, we designed and implemented a teacher-focused intervention to help experienced teachers develop a motivating style that could increase students' psychological need satisfaction and decrease their psychological need frustration, which are the twin causes of level of amotivation. Sixteen secondary school physical education teachers were randomly assigned into either an experimental or a control group, and their 598 students reported their need satisfaction, amotivation, and engagement at the beginning, middle, and end of a semester. Compared to teachers in the control group, teachers in the experimental group were scored by objective raters and perceived by students as more autonomy supportive and as less controlling. The students of the teachers in the experimental group reported greater psychological need satisfaction, greater engagement, and lesser amotivation than did students of teachers in the control group. We conclude that the intervention was successful in helping teachers decrease student amotivation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Intervention-induced gains in need satisfaction decrease PE students' amotivation. The present study adopted a dual-process model to test whether an intervention could also decrease need frustration and hence provide a second supplemental source to further decrease students' PE amotivation. Using an experimental, longitudinal research design, 19 experienced PE teachers (9 experimental, 10 control) and their 1,017 students participated in an intervention program to help teachers become both more autonomy supportive and less controlling. Multilevel repeated measures analyses showed that students of teachers in the experimental group reported greater T2, T3, and T4 perceived autonomy support, need satisfaction, and engagement and lesser T2, T3, and T4 perceived teacher control, need frustration, and amotivation than did students of teachers in the control group. Multilevel structural equation modeling analyses confirmed the hypothesized dual-process model in which both intervention-induced increases in need satisfaction and intervention-induced decreases need frustration decreased students' end-of-semester amotivation. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of this new finding on the dual antecedents of diminished amotivation.

AB  - This study employed a cluster randomized trial design to evaluate the effectiveness of a research-based intervention for improving the mathematics education of very young children. This intervention includes the "Building Blocks" mathematics curriculum, which is structured in research-based learning trajectories, and congruous professional development emphasizing teaching for understanding via learning trajectories and technology. A total of 42 schools serving low-resource communities were randomly selected and randomly assigned to 3 treatment groups using a randomized block design involving 1,375 preschoolers in 106 classrooms. Teachers implemented the intervention with adequate fidelity. Pre- to posttest scores revealed that the children in the Building Blocks group learned more mathematics than the children in the control group (effect size, g = 0.72). Specific components of a measure of the quantity and quality of classroom mathematics environments and teaching partially mediated the treatment effect. (Contains 5 tables and 1 footnote.)

AB  - Research has focused on increasing the treatment integrity of school-based interventions by utilizing performance feedback. The purpose of this study was to extend this literature by increasing special education teachers' treatment integrity for implementing antecedent and consequence procedures in an ongoing behavior support plan. A multiple baseline across teacher-student dyads (for two classrooms) design was used to evaluate the effects of performance feedback on the percentage of antecedent and consequence components implemented correctly during 1-hr observation sessions. Performance feedback was provided every other week for 8 to 22 weeks after a stable or decreasing trend in the percentage of antecedent or consequence components implemented correctly. Results suggested that performance feedback increased the treatment integrity of antecedent components for 4 of 5 teachers and consequence components for all 5 teachers. These results were maintained following feedback for all teachers across antecedent and consequence components. Teachers rated performance feedback favorably with respect to the purpose, procedures, and outcome, as indicated by a social validity rating measure.

AB  - This article presents findings from a cluster randomised controlled trial of a `blended' (online and face-to-face) training programme for frontline practitioners (n = 222 intervention group, n = 227 control group). The `Relationship Support: An Early Intervention' programme aimed to help practitioners recognise, respond appropriately to and review the need for further support for people experiencing relationship difficulties. Within a three-month time interval between the intervention and outcome measurement, the training had a significantly large positive impact on the way practitioners handled conversations with parents about their relationship difficulties. Practitioners in the intervention group reported being more than twice as likely as those in the control group to be confident in knowing both where and how to refer parents on for further support. The training also increased the likelihood of offering equivalent support in the future. These positive outcomes were evident across the sample, irrespective of practitioners' pre-intervention level of experience or confidence. Implications of this study are outlined in terms of training the relational capability of the wider family support workforce.

AB  - This study is part of a larger randomized efficacy trial examining the impact of Behavioral, Emotional, and Social Training: Competent Learners Achieving School Success (BEST in CLASS), a Tier 2 intervention that targets the prevention of emotional/behavioral disorders in young, high risk children. In this investigation, we examined teachers' implementation and maintenance of instructional practices in early childhood classrooms and the corollary relationships between teacher implementation of the specific instructional practices associated with BEST in CLASS and child engagement and problem behaviors. Fifty-three teachers (26 in treatment and 27 in comparison) and 130 preschool-aged children (66 in treatment and 64 in comparison) participated. Findings indicated that teachers' who received training and coaching in the BEST in CLASS intervention increased their use of specific instructional practices in comparison with teachers in the control condition. In addition, children whose teachers' received the BEST in CLASS intervention demonstrated increased engagement and a decrease in problem behaviors in comparison with those children who were in the control group. Positive teacher-child interactions increased and negative teacher-child interactions decreased in the intervention group in comparison with the control group. Results are discussed in relation to measuring teachers' implementation of instructional practices and implementation science.

AB  - This paper summarises findings from several systematic research reviews about the contribution of research to effective continuing professional development and learning (CPDL) activities and their impact on pupils and teachers. It starts with a review of how teachers engage in and with research as part of CPDL, how teachers and researchers shape professional learning activities and identifies key processes linked to positive outcomes. Finally it explores how different research contributions can be developed to make a more visible contribution to CPDL.The paper highlights common characteristics of effective CPDL, including: sustained collaboration with professional colleagues, including both making use of specialist expertise and structured peer support for embedding specialist contributions; an understanding of and commitment to professional learning, including enquiry-oriented learning and learning to learn from looking; a focus on refining teaching and learning, working towards aspirations for specific pupils side by side with theory; and effective scaffolding and modelling of learning by both teachers and leaders for colleagues and for pupils. The key implications of these findings are explored in the conclusions and include the importance of conceptualising researchers' contributions to CPDL as specialist expertise and/or researchers and Masters tutors harnessing the potential of peer support between teachers. They also explore overlaps between core research and teaching skills and the need for a shared language between teachers and researchers to enable concepts like analysis, theory and criticality to be valued as practical tools for enhancing professional practice.

AB  - Many teachers believe that providing greater emotional and organizational supports in the beginning of the year strengthens their ability to teach effectively as the year progresses. Some interventions, such as the Responsive Classroom (RC) approach, explicitly embed this sequence into professional development efforts. We tested the hypothesis that earlier emotional and organizational supports set the stage for improved instruction later in the year in a sample of third- and fourth-grade teachers enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of the RC approach. Further, we examined the extent to which the model generalized for teachers using varying levels of RC practices as well as whether or not teachers were in the intervention or control groups. Teachers' emotional, organizational, and instructional interactions were observed using the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (Pianta, La Paro, & Hamre, 2008) on five occasions throughout the year. Results indicated a reciprocal relation between emotional and instructional supports. Specifically, higher levels of emotional support earlier in the year predicted higher instructional support later in the year. Also, higher levels of instructional support earlier in the year predicted higher emotional support later in the year. Classroom organization was not found to have longitudinal associations with the other domains across a year. This pattern was robust when controlling for the use of RC practices as well as across intervention and control groups. Further, teachers' use of RC practices predicted higher emotional support and classroom organization throughout the year, suggesting the malleability of this teacher characteristic. Discussion highlights the connection between teachers' emotional and instructional supports and how the use of RC practices improves teachers' emotionally supportive interactions with students.

AB  - Teacher professional learning is of increasing interest as one way to support the increasingly complex skills students need to learn in preparation for further education and work in the 21st century. Sophisticated forms of teaching are needed to develop student competencies such as deep mastery of challenging content, critical thinking, complex problem-solving, effective communication and collaboration, and self-direction. In turn, effective professional development (PD) is needed to help teachers learn and refine the pedagogies required to teach these skills. However, research has shown that many PD initiatives appear ineffective in supporting changes in teacher practices and student learning. Accordingly, we set out to discover the features of effective PD. This paper reviews 35 methodologically rigorous studies that have demonstrated a positive link between teacher professional development, teaching practices, and student outcomes. We identify the features of these approaches and offer rich descriptions of these models to inform those seeking to understand the nature of the initiatives.

AB  - This study with 326 girls-school teachers developed and tested a model of predictors of the likelihood that teachers will intervene in indirect bullying, and evaluated a professional development presentation. Teachers responded to bullying vignettes before and after a presentation on indirect bullying (Experimentals) or adolescent mental health (Controls). In accord with the model, perceived seriousness of indirect bullying mediated between empathy for victims and likelihood of intervening. Self-efficacy also had a direct effect on likelihood of intervention, though level of knowledge of the impact of indirect bullying made only a small contribution. Compared with Controls, the Experimental Group scored more highly, after the presentation, on perceived seriousness of indirect bullying, empathy for victims, likelihood of intervening and self-efficacy, but not on knowledge of impact. It is concluded that teacher education about indirect bullying may be most effective if it focuses on fe)

AB  - We use data from a randomized controlled trial of a middle school science intervention to explore the causal mechanisms by which the intervention produced previously documented gains in student achievement. Our study finds that implementation fidelity, operationalized as a measure of the frequency of implementation of the cognitive science principles taught in intervention teachers' professional development, helped to explain student achievement effects. Integrating findings from a structural equation model using data from 10,281 students and 124 teachers with a small subsample of teacher interviews, we also found that the intervention may work partly through fostering better classroom management and collaborative discussions that elevated practice. Furthermore, our results have implications for informing decisions about how to balance a focus on increasing teacher content knowledge, on one hand, and providing explicit pedagogical strategies linked to the curriculum, on the other. We additionally found that lower achieving classrooms had lower implementation scores, likely due to factors that hindered teachers' ability to use the cognitive science principles, such as less science class time or needing to adapt content to meet the needs of struggling students. Our study highlights the importance of anticipating--and calibrating interventions to--the contextual complexities of real-life classrooms, and it identifies several factors with the potential to contribute to improved design and evaluation of such interventions.

AB  - In Ethiopia there is a severe shortage of child mental health professionals. Identification and intervention for young children's mental health problems is crucial to improve developmental trajectories and reduce the severity of emotional and behavioral disorders. Teachers can play an important role in early problem detection. This role is particularly impactful in developing countries with limited mental health care resources. However, teachers' knowledge about mental health varies dramatically. This study tested the influence of a training intervention to improve teachers' ability to accurately identify preschool children's emotional and behavioral problems in 24 schools in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Sensitivity and specificity of teacher identification, and overall agreement with an established measurement criterion (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire) were examined 2years following training compared to preintervention baseline, and a nonintervention control group of 12 schools. Results indicate that the teacher training was significantly associated with more accurate identification of children's problems.

AB  - The Precision Teaching term "movement cycle" refers to a behavior with a clearly observable movement and a distinct beginning and end. The present experiment examined whether behavior analysts and special education teachers could become fluent identifying movement cycles. A frequency-building intervention called SAFMEDS, an acronym for Say All Fast Minute Every Day Shuffled, required participants to see a picture of behavior on a laminated card and say the movement cycle. A multiple baseline multiple probe design with two groups of four participants revealed the effects of the intervention. Results showed a replication of effects with each group using equivalent SAFMEDS decks. The SAFMEDS intervention produced behavioral fluency and also fostered strong maintenance effects for a majority of the participants.

AB  - Teacher knowledge of science content is an important but under-studied construct. A curricular and professional development intervention consisting of a fifth grade science curriculum, teacher workshops, and school site support was studied to determine its effect on teachers' science content knowledge as measured by a science knowledge test, a questionnaire, and classroom observations. These three measures, along with college science courses taken, were then used to examine the effect of teachers' science content knowledge on student achievement outcomes. The intervention had a significant effect on the treatment group teachers' science knowledge test scores and questionnaire responses compared to the control group, but not on the classroom observation ratings. Teachers' scores on the science knowledge test were found to be the largest significant teacher-level predictor of student achievement outcomes regardless of participation in the intervention.

AB  - Students' inattention is predictive of reading problems and of non-response to effective reading intervention. In this randomized study, 58 first-grade classrooms located in 30 schools were assigned to a control condition or to one of two intervention conditions. In these last two conditions, peer-tutoring activities were conducted to improve classroom reading instruction. In one of the intervention conditions, the Good Behavior Game was also implemented to maximize students' attention during reading lessons. Both interventions were effective: peer-tutoring activities helped students improve their reading skills and attention was generally higher when the Good Behavior Game was implemented. Contrary to expectations however, students identified as inattentive at pretest did not become better readers when the two interventions were implemented.

AB  - This study highlights the connections between two facets of teachers' skills--those supporting teachers' mathematical instructional interactions and those underlying social interactions within the classroom. The impact of the Responsive Classroom (RC) approach and use of RC practices on the use of standards-based mathematics teaching practices was investigated in third-grade classrooms. Eighty-eight third-grade teachers from 24 elementary schools in a large suburban district were selected from a sample of teachers participating in a larger randomized-control study. Results showed that teachers at schools assigned randomly to receive training in the RC approach showed higher use of standards-based mathematics teaching practices than teachers in control schools. These findings were supported by analyses using fidelity of implementation: greater adherence to the intervention predicted the use of more standards-based mathematics teaching practices. Findings support the use of the RC approach for creating classroom social environments that facilitate standards-based mathematical practices. (Contains 3 tables and 1 note.)

AB  - A number of classroom-based interventions have been developed to improve social and behavioral outcomes for students, yet few studies have examined how these programs impact the teachers who are implementing them. Impacts on teachers may affect students and therefore also serve as an important proximal outcome to examine. The current study draws upon data from a school-based randomized controlled trial testing the impact of two prevention programs. In one intervention condition, teachers were trained in the classroom behavior management program, PAX Good Behavior Game (PAX GBG). In a second intervention condition, teachers were trained to use an integrated program, referred to as PATHS to PAX, of the PAX GBG and a social and emotional learning curriculum called Promoting Alternative Thinking Strategies (PATHSA (c)). This study aimed to determine whether both interventions positively impacted teachers, with a particular interest in the teachers' own beliefs and perceptions regarding self-efficacy, burnout, and social-emotional competence. The sample included 350 K-5 teachers across 27 schools (18 schools randomized to intervention, 9 to control). Multilevel latent growth curve analyses indicated that the PATHS to PAX condition generally demonstrated the most benefits to teachers, relative to both the control and PAX GBG conditions. These findings suggest that school-based preventive interventions can have a positive impact on teachers' beliefs and perceptions, particularly when the program includes a social-emotional component. Several possible mechanisms might account for the added benefit to teachers. Additional research is needed to better understand how these programs impact teachers, as well as students.

AB  - The importance of early intervention with children who are at risk for mental health problems is widely recognized. Relationships with significant adults (parents, other caregivers, and teachers) are critically important in young children's lives and can make a tremendous difference in the trajectory of a child's future. This study utilized a waiting-control group design to examine the effects on student behavior and parent stress of play-based interventions designed to improve the relationships between parents and their children (i.e., Filial Therapy), and teachers and their students (i.e., Kinder Training). To incorporate the benefits of group work, the eight-week intervention was delivered to parents in a small-group format. Teachers participated in a one-day group training with weekly coaching and dyadic consultation for on-going support. Results at post-intervention indicated that teachers perceived children in the intervention group to exhibit significantly less problem behavior than students in the waiting-control group. Although results suggest that the intervention had no demonstrable effect on parent stress, qualitative results indicate otherwise. Implications for practice and research are discussed.

AB  - The effectiveness of two professional development interventions, each designed to strengthen teacherchild interactions in preschool classrooms, was tested using a teacher-level randomized controlled trial. Georgia's Pre-K teachers (n = 486 in 336 schools/centers) were randomly selected from specified regions and randomly assigned to one of three conditions: 1) Making the Most of Classroom Interactions (MMCI), a cohort-model where small groups of teachers met for five days of instruction and support; 2) My Teaching Partner (MTP), in which teachers worked one-on-one with a coach using cycles of videotaped observations of teaching, review, and feedback; or 3) control. Each participating teacher received a Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS; Pianta, La Paro, & Hamre, 2008) visit before and after the intervention from a trained, independent, blinded observer. Posttest scores were estimated as a linear function of condition and pretest score, using 2-level hierarchical linear models)

AB  - The study examined whether 7th-graders' knowledge of rational numbers improved when the students' math teachers participated in related professional development activities. The study analyzed data on about 4,500 students and 200 teachers from approximately 80 schools in 12 districts during the 2007-08 academic year. The study found that students in schools where teachers were offered extensive professional development by the study performed no better on a test of math achievement in rational numbers than students in comparison schools at the end of the 2007-08 academic year. However, the study found a significant positive impact of the professional development on one of the three measures of teacher instructional practices examined. Teachers who were offered the study's extensive professional development engaged in 1.03 more activities per hour that elicited student thinking than teachers not offered the study's professional development. The research described in this report is consistent with What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) evidence standards. The study was a well-implemented randomized controlled trial.

Teachers in rural schools in a Northern Plains state took part in professional development activities across a year. Following a randomized control trial design, Native American and White students’ (N = 165) social, behavioral, and academic adjustment was assessed in intervention compared with control schools. Regression analyses, controlling for baseline and demographic variables, indicated that students in intervention schools improved in achievement, and improved or sustained beginning-of-year schooling dispositions, and perceptions of the school social/affective context, in comparison with evident declines for students in control schools. Native American students more so than White students evidenced particular gains in achievement and perceptions of the school social/affective context. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR], Copyrig)

AB  - This study was designed to assess the effectiveness of a multifocused (child-, teacher- and parent-focused) prevention program for Romanian preschoolers, targeting social--emotional competence development, as well as reduction of behavior problems. Fourteen classrooms were randomly assigned to the intervention and control conditions. Subsequent hierarchical linear analyses indicated that intervention-group children performed better on experimental tasks measuring emotion knowledge and social problem-solving strategies, and received higher assessments by their teachers and parents on measures of social--emotional competencies and externalizing problems. These results indicate that a prevention program combining intervention strategies for both high- and low-risk children is effective across a wide range of adaptive and maladaptive behaviors. Moreover, a short four-session parent group training employed to attract parent participation elicited an acceptable overall attendance rate (54%), indicating the sustainability of parent intervention in the context of community-based interventions.

AB  - Young writers, especially students with disabilities, have difficulty writing complete essays, and when asked to revise often make only surface-level changes. Individualized feedback may lead to gains in writing achievement, but finding class time for feedback is difficult. Using a multiple probe across participants design, the effectiveness of asynchronous audio feedback was assessed on the story revision behavior of six 6th grade students with emotional/behavioral disorders in a residential facility in southeastern U.S. Using a self-regulated strategy development (SRSD) instructional framework, the special education teacher modeled the revising process and then transitioned to independent student use. Using Notability, an iPad app, the teacher provided individualized audio feedback simultaneously to multiple students during class. Following intervention, students were more likely to revise, resulting in increased story length and quality. Fidelity of implementation was measured. Social validity was measured qualitatively by documenting spontaneous declarations.

AB  - Teacher training and teacher quality are an important part of the education system, therefore there is a need for new training programs for teachers to gain new knowledge and skills and to support their professional development. In recent years, new programs have been developed to offer knowledge and experience to teachers, and different methods such as consulting to increase the effectiveness of these programs have been suggested. One of these methods is performance feedback which can desirably change teacher behaviors and offer teachers opportunities to experience applying these newly learned methods in their classrooms. The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of performance feedback (PF) which was given daily to teachers following their training in classroom management strategies on the outcome of teacher-student dyads. This study was conducted using three teachers working in mainstreaming classes and their students with special needs. A single-subject design, the multiple-probe design with probe conditions across subjects, and the one group pretest/ post-test design were used to complete the research goal. As a result, performance feedback was found to have positive effects on teacher-use of target classroom management skills (individualization, transitions, and reinforcement). It was seen that intervention increased the preventive classroom management skills and classroom behaviors of teachers. Regarding the outcome for the children, the intervention program increased academic engagement and positive behaviors, while decreasing negative behaviors. Teacher opinions related to the performance feedback intervention were generally positive. Finally, social comparison data indicated that the intervention was socially valid, and by the end of the study the students who were participants in the research displayed more positive behaviors and less negative behaviors than the social comparison groups.

AB  - This study used a delayed multiple-baseline across-participants design to analyze the effects of coaching on special education teachers' implementation of function-based interventions with students with severe disabilities. This study also examined the extent to which teachers could generalize function-based interventions to different situations. In addition, this study examined the effects of function-based interventions on students' problem and replacement behaviors. After an initial training on functional behavior assessment and implementation of function-based interventions, the experimenter coached each teacher. Results indicated a functional relationship between coaching and an increase in teacher fidelity scores. Teachers generalized the strategies to other situations with the target students. Although some improvement in student behavior was noted upon teachers' use of function-based interventions without coaching, this improvement was not consistent for all students and across the replacement behaviors. A functional relationship was found between accurate implementation of the function-based interventions and an increase in the students' primary replacement behaviors. (Contains 4 figures.)

AB  - In this quasi-experimental study, the researcher examined teachers' awareness of the five essential components of reading instruction, teachers' knowledge of the five essential components, teachers' use of professional journals, and teachers' implementation of best practices in the context of a professional development intervention model called "Readings and Meetings Workshops". Participants (N=30) consisted of K-2 teachers in a micropolitan area in the southeastern United States. The "Readings and Meetings Workshops" consisted of 18 hours of professional development during which the participants were provided time to read and discuss professional journal articles related to the five components--phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension. The experimental and control group completed the "Pre- and Post-Survey and Assessment of Awareness, Knowledge, and Use of Professional Journals". Following the "Readings and Meetings Workshops", the experimental group completed the Follow-up Survey of Best Practices . Using RM-ANOVAs to analyze portions of the data, statistically significant differences were found between the experimental and control group following the "Readings and Meetings Workshops" on three of the variables including teachers' awareness of the five essential components of reading instruction, teachers' knowledge of the five essential components of reading instruction, and teachers' use of professional journals, namely "The Reading Teacher". Based on correlation analyses, no significant relationships were found between teachers' knowledge of the five essential components of reading instruction, teachers' use of professional journals, and teachers' implementation of best practices; however, descriptive information is included relevant to the experimental group's reported implementation of best practices. A discussion of implications and recommendations for future research is included. In sum, the "Readings and Meetings Workshops" proved effective as a professional development intervention on teachers' awareness and knowledge of the five components of reading instruction and on teachers' use of professional journals.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of professional development on the knowledge and classroom practices of teachers of science in kindergarten through Grade 5. These teachers, trained to be generalists in the content areas, were strongly prepared in pedagogical practices, reading skills, basic language arts, and mathematics content areas. Science reform has led to more content-specific science standards that were difficult for these unprepared teachers to address without professional development. The researcher implemented a professional development program that used a collaborative model involving 8 teachers in Grade 4. The researcher conducted the professional development, assisted at times by personnel from the New Jersey State Department of Education. The new standards were learned, reinforced, and adopted. The data that were analyzed to determine the effects of the professional development came from a comparison of student achievement of the classes of 2 sets of teachers in Grade 4, one of which was the control set (n = 8). The other was the experimental set (n = 8). The researcher administered pre- and postintervention content tests to both groups to measure teacher knowledge. In addition, the researcher reviewed lesson plans, conducted observations, and administered surveys to determine whether professional development in science impacted teacher practices in the classroom. This limited study suggested that teacher instruction did not significantly differ after professional development intervention. It also suggested that teacher content knowledge did not significantly increase due to the intervention. The researcher believes that local factors influenced the outcome and recommends a more systemic program that includes the involvement of all stakeholders.

AB  - Teaching children with psychiatric disorders can be a challenging task. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of the Good Behavior Game (GBG) in children with psychiatric disorders, and their teachers, in special education. Teachers were trained by licensed school consultants to implement positive behavior support strategies to elicit desired behavior in students. A total of 389 children and their 58 teachers at 11 schools for special primary education were included in the study. Using a cluster randomized controlled design, special education schools were assigned to an intervention condition or an education as usual condition. An increase in emotional and behavioral problems was found in the control group, whereas no change was seen in the intervention group, indicating a modest intervention effect. No effects were found on children's relationships with teachers or peers. The GBG affected teachers' sense of self-efficacy in engaging students in schoolwork, but no effects were found on teachers' self-efficacy in classroom management or on teachers' burnout symptoms. Thus, although children with psychiatric disorders and their teachers in special education can benefit from the GBG, given the partial effects and modest effect sizes, a longer duration program complemented with additional elements is recommended.

AB  - Discrete-trials teaching (DTT) is an evidence-based practice used in educational programs for children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Although there is strong demand for preparing teachers to effectively implement DTT, there is a scarcity of published research on such studies. A multiple baseline across participants design was utilized to determine if there was a functional relationship between individualized clinical coaching within the TLE TeachLivE[TM] virtual classroom laboratory and teachers' fidelity of implementation of discrete trial teaching when working with a student with ASD. Following intervention, participants' DTT accuracy improved on average from 37% to 87%, a 50% increase over a maximum of six, 15 minute sessions. These results indicate that such training has considerable potential for teaching DTT to educators. Implications and suggestions for future research for teacher preparation that utilizes individualized clinical coaching within a virtual classroom are discussed. (Contains 1 figure and 1 table.)

AB  - High pedagogical quality in early childhood education and care (ECEC) is related to developmental outcomes in young children. This review summarizes findings from (quasi)-experimental studies that evaluated in-service training effects for ECEC professionals on external quality ratings and child development. The aggregation of findings at teacher level (including 36 studies with 2,891 teachers) revealed a medium in-service training effect on process quality (effect size [ES] = 0.68, SE = 0.07, p < .001). Furthermore, a subset of nine studies (including 486 teachers and 4,504 children) that provided data on both quality ratings and child development were analyzed, and they showed a small effect at child level (ES = 0.14; SE = 0.02, p < 0.001) and a medium effect at the corresponding classroom level (ES = 0.45, SE = 0.11, p < 0.001). Variance in effect sizes at child level was significantly related to in-service effects on quality ratings (53% explained variance). The results show that quality improvement is a key mechanism to accelerate the development of young children.

The PD course is accompanied by a pretest–posttest study with a nonequivalent control group focusing on the effects of the PD course. The math-related beliefs of n = 51 preschool teachers in the intervention group and n = 48 in the control group were assessed via the KomMa questionnaire (Blömeke et. al, 2015). The results of the t tests indicate that there is an effect on the static orientation and the application orientation depending on the intervention.

AB  - School teachers report high levels of stress which impact on their engagement with pupils and effectiveness as a teacher. Early intervention or prevention approaches may support teachers to develop positive coping and reduce the experience and impact of stress. This article reviews research on one such approach: mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) for school teachers. A systematic review and narrative synthesis were conducted for quantitative and qualitative studies that report the effects of MBIs for teachers of children aged 5-18 years on symptoms of stress and emotion regulation and self-efficacy. Twelve independent publications were identified meeting the inclusion criteria and these gave a total of 13 samples. Quality appraisal of the identified articles was carried out. The effect sizes and proportion of significant findings are reported for relevant outcomes. The quality of the literature varied, with main strengths in reporting study details, and weaknesses including sample size considerations. A range of MBIs were employed across the literature, ranging in contact hours and aims. MBIs showed strongest promise for intermediary effects on teacher emotion regulation. The results of the review are discussed in the context of a model of teacher stress. Teacher social and emotional competence has implications for pupil wellbeing through teacher-pupil relationships and effective management of the classroom. The implications for practice and research are considered.

AB  - The relationship between pre-school teachers and the children in their classrooms directly influences the degree of success the children experience in school and in life. The emphasis on quality pre-K education in the U.S. has resulted in an increased need for highly qualified teachers who are capable of engaging in meaningful interactions with young children. An important component of high-level teacher-child interactions is the teacher's ability to model language for children as they acquire vocabulary and language context. This mixed-methods study was designed to examine the effectiveness of a professional development intervention designed to improve the quality of language modeling with pre-K teachers. Pre-kindergarten lead teachers were selected in three classrooms in each of two facilities. These teachers were surveyed on beliefs and intentions regarding their practice. They were given the opportunity to view and reflect on their use of language, then they were instructed on components of language modeling, followed by an opportunity to practice with further opportunities to review and reflect. Finally, they were interviewed on their perceptions of the intervention model. The teachers were video-recorded based on the professional development guidelines outlined in the "Classroom Assessment Scoring System Pre-K Manual" (Pianta, La Paro, & Hamre, 2008a). Teachers were instructed regarding ways of improving language modeling in their classrooms. Teachers reviewed their video-recorded sessions and evaluated their performance. Findings revealed improvements in the use of language modeling across all six participants. In two cases, teachers struggled with viewing themselves regarding language modeling and needed more coaching before they were able to view, reflect, and challenge themselves to improve their practice. In the interview portion of the study, all participants generally expressed positive impressions of the experience in the study and the need for including similar professional development in teacher preparation programs.

AB  - Despite the strong interest in research about collaboration among teachers, there are few longitudinal studies that have investigated improvements in collaborative activity among teachers through school-wide interventions. Drawing on data from a larger study, this article describes improvements in collaborative activity among 900 teachers at 28 Norwegian schools. The schools participated in two interventions aiming to strengthen classroom management and to prevent and reduce problem behavior. Collaborative activity was a main implementation strategy in both interventions. The impacts of both school- and teacher-level factors were investigated through latent multilevel growth curve models. Although the results indicated that teachers in both interventions improved in collaborative activity, the teachers who participated in one of the interventions improved more than teachers in the other. The teacher- and school-level factors perceived learning environment, initial collaborative activity, work experience and intervention were associated with baseline and/or growth rate results.

AB  - A randomized control trial was conducted to evaluate the impact of the Rural Early Adolescent Learning Program (Project REAL) on teachers' awareness of peer groups at the beginning of the 1st year of middle school. Two schools were randomly assigned to the intervention condition and 2 to the control condition. Thirty-nine teachers and 466 students (252 girls, 214 boys) participated in the study. As part of Project REAL, teachers were taught about social dynamics and early adolescent peer group processes. Social cognitive mapping procedures were used to assess and compare students' and teachers' perceptions of 6th grade peer groups. As compared with teachers in the control condition, intervention teachers were more likely to accurately identify peer groups. In addition, when the analyses were restricted to students who were involved in bullying, intervention teachers were more likely to accurately identify peer group membership. However, there were no significant differences between intervention and control teachers for the accurate peer group membership identification of specific bullying involvement subtypes (i.e., bullies, victims, bully victims).

AB  - Background: Secondary school teachers have low levels of wellbeing and high levels of depression compared with the general population. Teachers are in a key position to support students, but poor mental health may be a barrier to doing so effectively. The Wellbeing in Secondary Education (WISE) project is a cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) of an intervention to improve the mental health support and training available to secondary school teachers through delivery of the training package Mental Health First Aid and a staff peer support service. We will conduct a process evaluation as part of the WISE trial to support the interpretation of trial outcomes and refine intervention theory. The domains assessed will be: the extent to which the hypothesised mechanisms of change are activated; system level influences on these mechanisms; programme differentiation and usual practice; intervention implementation, including any adaptations; intervention acceptability; and intervention sustainability. Methods: Research questions will be addressed via quantitative and qualitative methods. All study schools (n = 25) will provide process evaluation data, with more detailed focus group, interview and observation data being collected from a subsample of case study schools (4 intervention and 4 control). Mechanisms of change, as outlined in a logic model, will be measured via teacher and student surveys and focus groups. School context will be explored via audits of school practice that relate to mental health and wellbeing, combined with stakeholder interviews and focus groups. Implementation of the training and peer support service will be assessed via training observations, training participant evaluation forms, focus groups with participants, interviews with trainers and peer support service users, and peer supporter logs recording help provided. Acceptability and sustainability will be examined via interviews with funders, head teachers, trainers and peer support services users, and focus groups with training participants. Discussion: The process evaluation embedded within the WISE cluster RCT will illuminate how and why the intervention was effective, ineffective or conferred iatrogenic effects. It will contribute to the refinement of the theory underpinning the intervention, and will help to inform any future implementation.

AB  - Commissioned by the Centre for Public Health Excellence on behalf of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), this report was produced by one of the 2 Public Health Collaborating Centres. It is the second in a series of 3 effectiveness reviews on improving the physical and emotional health and wellbeing outcomes for looked after children and young people. Its aim was to identify and synthesise evidence that evaluates the effectiveness of additional training and support provided to approved carers, professionals and volunteers involved in the care of, or working directly or indirectly with, looked after children and young people. The report sets out the methods used and describes and discusses the results. 8 studies were identified as meeting the inclusion criteria - 3 from the US and the remainder from the UK. The content and purpose of the training varied considerably across the studies reviewed, but all concerned training and support for foster carers only. The study found evidence of mixed quality suggesting mixed effects of training and support for foster carers. The authors report that UK research suggested that training programmes for foster carers have limited impact on looked after children and young people's behavioural problems, in contrast to US studies which reported statistically significant benefits. They also note that evidence from 2 UK studies appeared to indicate that training for carers may have some benefit on looked after children and young people's emotional wellbeing, but it was unclear where the benefit may lie.

AB  - Objective: This study evaluated the effectiveness at 1-year follow-up of a psychoeducational eating disorders preventive intervention implemented by specifically trained teachers. Method: Participating teachers participated in a 5-week training program. One hundred forty-one female students attending nine classes at a vocational training school in Mestre (Venice) were assessed via a structured clinical interview (Structured Clinical interview for DSM-IV Axis I disorders) and via the 40-item Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-40). Three classes were randomly selected to participate in a 6-week prevention program conducted by the trained teachers. Results: Our data show that a disturbing number of the girls who were asymptomatic at baseline had developed a full or partial eating disorder 1 year later. This was the case for 2 (5%) participants and 10 (11%) subjects in the control group. Subjects in the prevention group differed significantly from the control group at the 1-year follow-up. This was the case for their EAT Bulimia subscale scores, which showed a significant improvement. The intervention group also revealed a lower development of food restraint and pathologic body attitudes. Discussion: Given the sample size, our findings must be considered cautiously. However, they suggest that students can benefit from participation in a preventive intervention program conducted by teachers, and the benefits appear to be particularly pronounced for bulimic symptoms.

AB  - Objectives: The goal of this study is to build resilience among children exposed to war trauma and childhood adversities using a controlled classroom- based, teacher-mediated intervention. There is a need to collect evidence for universal interventions in developing countries where children experience war and trauma to reach the largest number of students possible. Methods: Students (N = 2,031), their mothers, and teachers (N = 42) from 17 schools completed pre- and postintervention questionnaires on war exposure, home stressors, coping strategies, depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress, and externalizing symptoms. Teachers delivered a manual-based, classroom-based intervention over 13 weekly sessions using cognitive behavioral and mind-body techniques to students in grades 3-7. Sessions were tape-recorded and reviewed by supervisors to rate for quality and adherence to intervention procedures. Results: Clear differences emerged in classroom atmosphere among intervention students compared with control subjects. Pre-postclinically and statistically significant differences in teacher-rated ADHD and impulsivity scores were noted, and these were substantiated by nonintervention teachers as well. In logistic mixed models, depression improved in intervention students compared with control subjects [effect size (ES) = 0.51, P = 0.003], in addition to self-confidence scores in the universal sample group (ES = 0.48, P = 0.043), cognitive distraction scores among war-exposed children (ES = 0.51, P = 0.002), and anxiety scores among war-exposed children (ES 0.24, P = 0.05). Results remained significant after Bonferroni corrections. Conclusions: Meaningful changes took place in internalizing and externalizing symptoms, as well as in personal competencies based on self-confidence and cognitive distraction measures using a universal classroom-based intervention targeting war-exposed children. Dissemination and replication of such models are needed.

AB  - Without intervention, childhood behavioral problems, including aggression and noncompliance, are likely to continue over the lifespan and adversely affect a child’s functioning across several domains. Based on the early emergence of functional impairment and the established negative trajectory of these difficulties, prevention and early intervention programs are critically important. Interventions for disruptive behavior disorders have primarily focused on parent training. However, given the limited access to evidence-based mental health care in many communities and the significant amount of time children spend in school, researchers and clinicians have explored creative ways to provide interventions in the school setting. Increasing attention has been given to prevention efforts. Discussed below are the results of preliminary studies investigating the effectiveness of teacher training in improving behavior management in the classroom. The teacher training is based on the established efficacy of Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) for young children with disruptive behavior disorders and their families. This paper reviews the various teacher-child interaction training models that have been used in different settings (e.g., Head Start, general education) and includes discussion of adaptations for the classroom and for consideration in future study.

AB  - This study assessed the effects of 3 theoretically grounded, school-based HIV prevention interventions on inner-city minority high school students' levels of HIV prevention information, motivation, behavioral skills, and behavior. It involved a quasi-experimental controlled trial comparing classroom-based, peer-based, and combined classroom- and peer-based-HIV prevention interventions with a standard-of-care control condition in 4 urban high schools (N=1,532, primarily 9th-grade students). At 12 months postintervention, the classroom-based intervention resulted in sustained changes in HIV prevention behavior. This article discusses why both of the interventions involving peers were less effective than the classroom-based intervention at the 12-month follow-up and, more generally, suggests a set of possible limiting conditions for the efficacy of peer-based interventions.

AB  - Background: Childhood antisocial behaviour has high immediate and long-term costs for society and the individual, particularly in relation to mental health and behaviours that jeopardise health. Managing challenging behaviour is a commonly reported source of stress and burn out among teachers, ultimately resulting in a substantial number leaving the profession. Interventions to improve parenting do not transfer easily to classroom-based problems and the most vulnerable parents may not be easily able to access them. Honing teachers' skills in proactive behaviour management and the promotion of socio-emotional regulation, therefore, has the potential to improve both child and teacher mental health and well-being and the advantage that it might potentially benefit all the children subsequently taught by any teacher that accesses the training. Methods/Design: Cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) of the Incredible Years teacher classroom management (TCM) course with combined economic and process evaluations. One teacher of children aged 4-9 years, from 80 schools in the South West Peninsula will be randomised to attend the TCM (intervention arm) or to ``teach as normal{''} (control arm). The primary outcome measure will be the total difficulties score from the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) completed by the current class teachers prior to randomisation, and at 9, 18 and 30 months follow-up, supplemented by parent SDQs. Secondary measures include academic attainment (teacher report supplemented by direct measurement in a sub-sample), children's enjoyment of school, and teacher reports of their professional self-efficacy, and levels of burn out and stress, supplemented by structured observations of teachers classroom management skills in a subsample. Cost data for the economic evaluation will be based on parental reports of services accessed. Cost-effectiveness, using the SDQ as the measure of effect, will be examined over the period of the RCT and over the longer term using decision analytic modelling. The process evaluation will use quantitative and qualitative approaches to assess fidelity to model, as well as explore Head teacher and teachers' experiences of TCM and investigate school factors that influence the translation of skills learnt to practice. Discussion: This study will provide important information about whether the Teacher Classroom Management course influences child and teacher mental health and well-being in both the short and long term. It will also provide valuable insights into factors that may facilitate or impede any impact. The trial has been registered with ISCTRN (Controlled Trials Ltd) and assigned an ISRCTN number ISRCTN84130388.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to identify preventive effects of the Incredible Years (IY) teacher classroom management (TCM) programme, which is employed in Norwegian kindergartens for 3-year-old to 6-year-old children. IY TCM is a universal preventive intervention intended to reduce the frequency of inappropriate types of behaviour and support children's social- and emotional competence in kindergartens and schools. IY TCM was implemented in 46 kindergartens and compared to 46 matched kindergartens that did not receive the intervention. A total of 1049 children took part in the trial, 511 from the IY TCM group and 538 from the comparison group. Children's behaviours were measured using well-validated instruments at the beginning and end of a school-year cycle, approximately 9 months later. Findings showed promising reductions in aggression, internalising and attention problems, and increases in social competence in the IY TCM kindergartens. In a sub-sample comprising children who scored equal to or above the 90th percentile on aggressive behaviour before the intervention, promising developments were found in social competence among the children in IY TCM kindergartens. The IY TCM lead to promising preventive effects in young children's aggressive behaviours, internalisation, attention problems, and social competence in kindergartens in Norway. However, even if the changes were statistically significant, effect sizes were small. For children with severe behaviour problems, few positive results were found.

AB  - The purpose of the present study was to examine the effectiveness and feasibility of phonological awareness training, with and without a beginning decoding component. Thirty-three teachers in 8 urban schools were assigned randomly within their schools to 3 groups: control, phonological awareness training, and phonological awareness training with beginning decoding instruction and practice. Following training, teachers in the 2 treatment groups conducted the treatments for about 20 weeks. In each teacher's class, pre- and posttreatment data were collected on 12-14 children (N = 404); 312 children were tested again the following fall. At the end of kindergarten, the 2 treatment groups performed comparably and outperformed controls on the phonological awareness measures. On alphabetic (reading and spelling) tasks, however, the group participating in phonological awareness training with beginning decoding instruction did better than the other 2 groups. In the fall of the next year, many of these between-group differences remained but were less impressive. Implications are discussed for bridging research and practice.

AB  - An experimental study showed that a video feedback intervention improved the interaction skills of early childhood education and care teachers. The teachers who had received the Video Interaction Guidance training appeared more stimulating in their behavior, were more sensitive and more verbally stimulating than teachers from the control group. The training results were still apparent three months after the training. An analysis of the behavior of teachers at micro-level also revealed positive outcomes. These findings show that video feedback training for early childhood educators is a promising method to increase their socio-emotional support and verbal stimulation in childcare practice.

AB  - This study describes the results of an evaluation of the Individualized Learning Intervention, a mentoring program for early childhood educators. This mentoring program includes 3 components: Mentor Teacher Seminar, Mentor teachers supporting professional development of Protege teachers throughout the school year, and Mentor coordinator meetings with Mentor teachers to support them in their mentor role. Sixteen Mentors, experienced teachers who maintained high quality classroom learning experiences, and 16 Proteges, less experienced teachers, in Head Start classrooms were selected and then randomly assigned to treatment and control conditions in the study. The results of this study demonstrate that mentoring, particularly when it is delivered by experienced teachers who have been trained to be Mentors and coupled by support to the Mentors themselves, can enhance the cognitive, language, and social emotional developmental progress of young children. In addition, the experimental Mentors and Protege teachers reported enhanced professional growth.

AB  - Background: The physical education (PE) context has been emphasised as an ideal environment for developing positive behaviours among students. Under the Positive Youth Development paradigm, various initiatives have been conducted with the aim of promoting personal and social responsibility among adolescents. Self-Determination Theory has been widely used to analyse students' motivational processes during PE classes.Purpose: This study aimed to measure the effects of a multidisciplinary intervention with teachers on the development of positive behaviours in PE classes.Participants: Twenty PE teachers participated in the study (M-age=35 years; SD=2.32) along with 777 of their students (M-age=12.81 years; SD=.93). The teachers (male=16; female=4) were between the ages of 29 and 48 years (M=35.2 years; SD=2.32). The students who participated in this study (male=377; female=400) were divided into 52 classes and were between the ages of 12 and 16 years (M=12.81; SD=.93).Research design: A quasi-experimental design was used that consisted of a control group and three groups in which an intervention was developed. In the control group, the teachers did not receive any type of intervention; in the second group, the teachers received a training programme to develop strategies for supporting basic psychological needs and promoting positive behaviours; in the third group, the teachers received a didactic unit to promote positive behaviours; and in the last group the teachers received a combination of the two previous interventions.Data analysis: A repeated-measures ANCOVA (analysis of covariance) was used for every dependent variable included in the study to analyse the effect of GroupxTime interaction, including Gender and Grade Level as covariates. The fixed effects caused by Intercept, Group, Time, and the GroupxTime interaction were calculated using compound symmetry as the type of covariance and restricted maximum likelihood as the estimation method.Findings: By examining the differences between pre-test and post-test, it was determined that in comparison with the students in the control group, the students from the three experimental groups had generally improved scores on the variables related to positive behaviours, such as perceptions of the teacher's support, as well as the development of the targeted behaviours.Conclusions: These results provide information about the efficacy of an intervention programme with teachers that consists of strategies for developing positive behaviour and support for basic psychological needs to promote the development of positive student behaviour.

AB  - This article reviews the international literature on video viewing in teacher education and professional development. Two hundred and fifty-five articles were collected, summarized and categorized using a conceptualization that includes four aspects: teachers' activity as they view a classroom video, the objectives of video viewing, the types of videos viewed, and the effects of video viewing on teacher education and professional development. The findings in each of these aspects suggested three main questions that may profitably guide future research: How can teaching teachers to identify and interpret relevant classroom events on video clips improve their capacity to perform the same activities in the classroom? How can we best articulate the diverse objectives of video viewing and the diverse types of videos in teacher education and professional development programs? How can we create a ``continuum{''} between teacher education programs and professional development programs in such a way that video viewing becomes a routine, familiar professional practice able to produce the desired effects over the course of an entire teaching career?

AB  - This study examined the efficacy of a professional development program for early childhood educators that facilitated emergent literacy skills in preschoolers. The program, led by a speech-language pathologist, focused on teaching alphabet knowledge, print concepts, sound awareness, and decontextualized oral language within naturally occurring classroom interactions. Method: Twenty educators were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. Educators each recruited 3 to 4 children from their classrooms to participate. The experimental group participated in 18 hr of group training and 3 individual coaching sessions with a speech-language pathologist. The effects of intervention were examined in 30 min of videotaped interaction, including storybook reading and a post-story writing activity. Results: At posttest, educators in the experimental group used a higher rate of utterances that included print /sound references and decontextualized language than the control group. Similarly, the children in the experimental group used a significantly higher rate of utterances that included print /sound references and decontextualized language compared to the control group. Conclusion: These findings suggest that professional development provided by a speech-language pathologist can yield short-term changes in the facilitation of emergent literacy skills in early childhood settings. Future research is needed to determine the impact of this program on the children's long-term development of conventional literacy skills [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The purpose of this study was to understand the implementation and impacts of Leveled Literacy Intervention (LLI) in secondary grades. LLI is a short-term, intensive intervention system designed to help teachers provide small-group instruction to struggling readers. Many school districts across the country have used LLI, which has shown promise in improving outcomes for students in early elementary grades. This study used a randomized control trial in ten secondary schools in Oakland, California to study the program's implementation and assess its impacts on reading comprehension and general literacy achievement outcomes during one school year. Schools faced various challenges implementing LLI, leading students to experience different levels of LLI duration, intensity, and fidelity. In addition, LLI had no impact on students' reading comprehension and a negative impact on their mastery of English language arts/literacy standards. Students who received more LLI or were pulled out of other classes to receive LLI were particularly negatively affected, possibly as a result of missing grade-level content. This study's findings highlight the importance of assessing whether the success of intervention programs in one context can be replicated with different populations and conditions.

AB  - Professional development for teachers has historically been fairly didactic in nature (Garet et al., 2001; Rose & Church, 1998), which is believed to limit effectiveness and translation to teacher practice change (Fixsen, Naoom, Blase, Friedman, & Wallace, 2005). One well-established program with a more active, collaborative training approach is the Incredible Years Teacher Classroom Management Program (IYT). Although positive effects on young children's social-emotional competence have been demonstrated for this program when implemented in combination with other Incredible Years programs (Webster-Stratton, Reid, & Hammond, 2001; 2004; Webster-Stratton, Reid, & Stoolmiller, 2008), the program has not been evaluated as an independent intervention or with regard to academic outcomes for early elementary students. As with many teacher-directed universal interventions for behavior problems or social-emotional development, there may be differential effects for students with different risk levels (Bierman et al, 2010). In addition, it is possible that social-emotional learning (SEL) interventions may have varying impact based upon students' developmental levels. Typically, it is believed that such interventions may be more effective for younger students, although there may be other contextual factors that affect outcomes. Thus, moderator analyses can be informative in understanding intervention effects. Overall, this study demonstrates modest effects of a relatively low-cost universal teacher training intervention on classroom climate, student social-emotional outcomes, and reading achievement. It contributes to the efficacy literature for the Incredible Years teacher program, which is supported for use with at-risk children in early childhood settings in combination with other interventions, by showing independent intervention effects in a large, normative sample of early elementary students attending rural schools. It is also the first study of this program to identify specific effects on an academic test, supporting the link between SEL programs and achievement. Tables and figures are appended.

AB  - Objective To assess the effectiveness of a teacher led intervention to improve teenagers' knowledge about emergency contraception. Design Cluster randomised controlled trial. Setting 24 mixed sex, state secondary schools in Avon, south west England. Participants 1974 boys and 1820 girls in year 10 (14-15 year olds). Intervention Teachers gave a single lesson on emergency contraception to year 10 pupils. The teachers had previously received in-service training on giving the lesson. The pupils were actively involved during the lesson. Main outcome measures Questionnaires distributed to pupils at baseline and six months after the intervention assessed their knowledge of the correct time limits for hormonal emergency contraception and for use of the intrauterine device as emergency contraception, the proportion of pupils who were not virgins, the proportion who had used emergency contraception, and the pupils' intention to use emergency contraception in the future. Results The proportion of pupils knowing the correct time limits for both types of emergency contraception was significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group at six months' follow up (hormonal contraception: proportion of boys 15.9% higher (95% confidence interval 6.5% to 25.3%), girls 20.4% (10.4% to 30.4%); intrauterine device used as emergency contraception: boys 4.2% (0.7% to 7.7% girls 10.7% (0.4% to 21.0%). The number of pupils needed to be taught for one more pupil to know the correct time limits was six for boys and five for girls. The intervention and control groups did not differ in the proportion of pupils who were not virgins, in the proportion who had used emergency contraception, and in the proportion intending to use emergency contraception in the future. Conclusions The intervention significantly improved the proportion of boys and girls knowing the correct time limits for both types of emergency contraception. The intervention did not change the pupils' sexual activity or use of emergency contraception.

AB  - This article describes the development, implementation, and outcomes of a pilot intervention designed to enhance preschool programs' ability to support children's social-emotional development. Working with two Head Start programs, the intervention included (1) restructuring existing early childhood mental health consultation services; (2) engaging programs in a mental health-specific strategic planning; (3) providing training to program staff in early childhood mental health best practices; and (4) implementing staff wellness activities to promote a healthy organizational culture. Research Findings: Results from quantitative staff surveys found significant improvement over time in terms of reduced staff stress, increased levels of understanding of best practices in early childhood mental health, and more evidence of a shared understanding of how best to meet children's mental health needs. Results were strongest for management and teaching staff, compared to other staff types. Practic)

AB  - Young children are able to benefit from early science teaching but many preschool teachers have not had opportunities to deepen their own understanding of science or to develop their pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) in relation to specific science topics and concepts. This study presents the results of efficacy research on Foundations of Science Literacy (FSL), a comprehensive professional development program designed to support teachers' knowledge of early childhood science; their PCK around 2 physical science topics (water, and balls and ramps); and their abilities to plan, facilitate, and assess young children's learning during inquiry-based science explorations. Research Findings: In a randomized trial with 142 preschool teachers and 1,004 4-year-old children, FSL teachers demonstrated significantly higher quality science teaching in general and greater PCK in the 2 physical science topics than did teachers in comparison classrooms. Furthermore, children in FSL classrooms performed significantly better than children in comparison classrooms on tasks involving floating and sinking, and an instrumental variable analysis suggests that the quality of classroom science instruction mediated the relationship between teacher participation in FSL and student outcomes. Practice or Policy: Findings support the use of comprehensive early science professional development programs designed to bolster teacher knowledge and PCK.

AB  - A randomized control trial examined the impact of a professional development program on rural teachers' attunement to student social dynamics, and the influence of teacher attunement on students' school experiences. In intervention schools serving Latino and White rural early adolescents, teachers (N = 14) received training on social dynamics and aspects of early adolescent adjustment; control school teachers (N = 12) received no training. Social cognitive mapping procedures assessed and compared students' and teachers' perceptions of peer groups; structured observations assessed teachers' management of social dynamics. Students (N = 225) self-reported their perceptions of the school social-affective context. Intervention and control schools differed on teacher attunement and management of the social environment. Students whose teachers were more attuned to peer group affiliations evidenced improved views of the school social environment. Findings are discussed in terms of attunement as an element of teachers' invisible hand, and for teachers' role in promoting productive contexts for students during the middle school transition.

AB  - Background: The `Supporting Teachers And childRen in Schools' (STARS) study is a cluster randomised controlled trial evaluating the Incredible Years Teacher Classroom Management (TCM) programme as a public health intervention. TCM is a 6 day training course delivered to groups of 8-12 teachers. The STARS trial will investigate whether TCM can improve children's behaviour, attainment and wellbeing, reduce teachers' stress and improve their self-efficacy. This protocol describes the methodology of the process evaluation embedded within the main trial, which aims to examine the uptake and implementation of TCM strategies within the classroom plus the wider school environment and improve the understanding of outcomes. Methods/design: The STARS trial will work with eighty teachers of children aged 4-9 years from eighty schools. Teachers will be randomised to attend the TCM course (intervention arm) or to ``teach as normal{''} (control arm) and attend the course a year later. The process evaluation will use quantitative and qualitative approaches to assess fidelity to model, as well as explore headteachers' and teachers' experiences of TCM and investigate school factors that influence the translation of skills learnt to practice. Four of the eight groups of teachers (n = 40) will be invited to participate in focus groups within one month of completing the TCM course, and again a year later, while 45 of the 80 headteachers will be invited to take part in telephone interviews. Standardised checklists will be completed by group leaders and each training session will be videotaped to assess fidelity to model. Teachers will also complete standardised session evaluations. Discussion: This study will provide important information about whether the Teacher Classroom Management course influences child and teacher mental health and well-being in both the short and long term. The process evaluation will provide valuable insights into factors that may facilitate or impede any impact.

AB  - This final report describes activities and accomplishments of the Home Activity Program for Parents and Youngsters (HAPPY) Rural Outreach Project, a collaborative effort to provide family-focused early intervention services to children with disabilities (ages birth through 5) in rural Nevada, primarily including Native Americans and Hispanics. The program focused on the professional development of rural service providers, especially the following model components: (1) monthly home visits, (2) parent participation in the assessment of the child and the program development, (3) service coordination, (4) consultative therapies, (5) computer-based curriculum, (6) assessment of children using the Developmental Programming for Infants and Young Children scale, and (7) videotaped activity recommendations and consultations. Twenty-five families who participated in home-based services responded to a survey regarding the effectiveness of the curriculum materials developed by the Project. Their evaluations were highly positive. The project also created training modules in the following content areas: home visits, parent participation, computer-based curriculum, assessment of young children, and disability overview.

AB  - Background: Teacher qualifications have been emphasized as a basis of professional development to improve classroom practices for at-risk children's school readiness. However, teacher qualifications have often not been compared to another form of professional development, in-service training. Objective: The current study attempts to investigate contributions of multiple types of professional development to school readiness skills of low-income preschoolers. Specifically, we examined the significance of teachers' education level, degree, teaching certificate, teaching experiences as well as specialized in-service training and coaching support as these teacher trainings are linked to preschoolers' school readiness through proximal classroom practices. Method: We used a multi-level path analysis to examine multiple pathways from teachers' professional development to classroom environments and school readiness with Head Start Family and Child Experiences Survey 2003 (N = 2,159). Results: Teachers with an early childhood education major provided higher-quality provision for learning and social-emotional practices in the classroom; teachers who received coaching provided higher-quality social-emotional and parent involvement practices. Further, children in higher-quality social-emotional classrooms had better math skills, social skills and learning behaviors; children in the classrooms with higher-quality parent involvement practices had higher receptive vocabulary and parent-reported social skills and positive approaches to learning. Conclusions: Along with early childhood education degree, ongoing coaching support would work effectively, improving classroom environments and a broad array of school readiness skills of at-risk children.

AB  - To identify links among professional development, teacher knowledge, practice, and student achievement, researchers have called for study designs that allow causal inferences and that examine relationships among features of interventions and multiple outcomes. In a randomized experiment implemented in six states with over 270 elementary teachers and 7,000 students, this project compared three related but systematically varied teacher interventions -- Teaching Cases, Looking at Student Work, and Metacognitive Analysis -- along with no-treatment controls. The three courses contained identical science content components, but differed in the ways they incorporated analysis of learner thinking and of teaching, making it possible to measure effects of these features on teacher and student outcomes. Interventions were delivered by staff developers trained to lead the teacher courses in their regions. Each course improved teachers' and students' scores on selected-response science tests well beyond those of controls, and effects were maintained a year later. Student achievement also improved significantly for English language learners in both the study year and follow-up, and treatment effects did not differ based on sex or race/ethnicity. However, only Teaching Cases and Looking at Student Work courses improved the accuracy and completeness of students' written justifications of test answers in the follow-up, and only Teaching Cases had sustained effects on teachers' written justifications. Thus, the content component in common across the three courses had powerful effects on teachers' and students' ability to choose correct test answers, but their ability to explain why answers were correct only improved when the professional development incorporated analysis of student conceptual understandings and implications for instruction; metacognitive analysis of teachers' own learning did not improve student justifications either year. Findings suggest investing in professional development that integrates content learning with analysis of student learning and teaching rather than advanced content or teacher metacognition alone.

AB  - To assess the impact of a theoretically based sex education programme (SHARE) delivered by teachers compared with conventional education in terms of conceptions and terminations registered by the National Health Service. Follow-up of cluster randomized trial 4.5 years after intervention. National Health Service records of women who had attended 25 secondary schools in east Scotland. Participants A total of 4196 women (99.5% of those eligible). SHARE programme (intervention group) vs. existing sex education (control group). National Health Service recorded conceptions and terminations for the achieved sample linked at age 20 years. In an 'intention to treat' analysis, there were no significant differences between the groups in registered conceptions per 1000 pupils (300 SHARE vs. 274 control; difference 26, 95% CI -33 to 86) and terminations per 1000 pupils (127 vs. 112; difference 15, -13 to 42) between ages 16 and 20 years. This specially designed sex education programme did not reduce conceptions or terminations by age 20 years compared with conventional provision. The lack of effect was not due to quality of delivery. Enhancing teacher-led school sex education beyond conventional provision in eastern Scotland is unlikely to reduce terminations in teenagers.

AB  - Teachers frequently struggle to cope with conduct problems in the classroom. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of the Incredible Years Teacher Classroom Management Training Programme for improving teacher competencies and child adjustment. The study involved a group randomised controlled trial which included 22 teachers and 217 children (102 boys and 115 girls). The average age of children included in the study was 5.3 years (standard deviation = 0.89). Teachers were randomly allocated to an intervention group (n = 11 teachers; 110 children) or a waiting-list control group (n = 11; 107 children). The sample also included 63 'high-risk' children (33 intervention; 30 control), who scored above the cut-off (>12) on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire for abnormal socioemotional and behavioural difficulties. Teacher and child behaviours were assessed at baseline and 6 months later using psychometric and observational measures. Programme delivery costs were also analysed. Results showed positive changes in teachers' self-reported use of positive classroom management strategies (effect size = 0.56), as well as negative classroom management strategies (effect size = -0.43). Teacher reports also highlight improvements in the classroom behaviour of the high-risk group of children, while the estimated cost of delivering the Incredible Years Teacher Classroom Management Training Programme was modest. However, analyses of teacher and child observations were largely non-significant. A need for further research exploring the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the Incredible Years Teacher Classroom Management Training Programme is indicated.

AB  - Professional development is critical in supporting teachers' use of technological tools in classrooms. This review of empirical research synthesizes the effective elements of professional development programs that support science teachers in learning about technology integration. Studies are examined that explore how professional development supports technology use within inquiry-based and traditional science instruction. Implications for future research are discussed in four areas: understanding and building on teachers' beliefs about science and technology; supporting teacher learning by supporting teachers' examination of students' work; using technology to support teacher communities and social networks; and sustaining teachers' learning beyond formal professional development programs.

AB  - This exploratory study investigated how 2 years of a coaching-based language and literacy intervention were linked to Head Start teachers' classroom environments and instructional interactions, as well as to the vocabulary, alphabet, and sound awareness learning of their preschool students. In total, 16 Head Start teachers participated in the intervention, and 10 teachers participated in a business-as-usual control. In addition, 626 preschoolers participated in the intervention, while 357 children participated in the control condition. The first year of coaching was linked to gains in the quality of teachers' classroom literacy environments and the quality of instructional interactions, and a second year of coaching resulted in additional gains in the quality of instructional interactions. Effects were consistent regardless of the initial quality of the classroom environment and instructional interactions. The intervention was significantly related to all child outcomes, with greater vocabulary gains in the second year of coaching. (Contains 7 tables and 1 note.)

AB  - A comprehensive review of structured family support programs in children’s mental health was conducted in collaboration with leadership from key national family organizations. The goals were to identify typologies of family support services for which evaluation data existed and identify research gaps. Over 200 programs were examined; 50 met criteria for inclusion. Programs were categorized by whether they were delivered by peer family members, clinicians, or teams. Five salient components of family support were identified: (a) informational, (b) instructional, (c) emotional, (d) instrumental, and (e) advocacy. Clinician-led programs were heavily represented (n = 33, 66%), followed by family-led (n = 11, 22%), and team-delivered (n = 6, 12%) programs. Key differences between programs delivered by clinicians or by peer family members were found in the degree of emphasis, research methodology, and outcomes. However, the content of the components was similar across all three program types. There are both important differences in emphasis across typologies of family support provided by clinicians, family members, or teams as well as important similarities in content. Family-delivered support may be an important adjunct to existing services for parents, although the research base remains thin. A research agenda to promote more rigorous evaluations of these services especially those delivered by peer family members is critical. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) can enhance the life chances of all children, and especially socially disadvantaged children. In the Nordic daycare systems, however, it is not clear if ECEC provides equal social and intellectual opportunities for socially disadvantaged children. The VIDA intervention program Knowledge-based efforts for socially disadvantaged children in daycare � a model program presented in this report, aims at improving all children�s well-being and cognitive functioning, and specifi cally improving the situation for socially disadvantaged children through inclusive efforts in daycare. The objective is to improve our knowledge about effective means and methods when implementing a new innovative type of early childhood educational efforts aimed at socially disadvantaged children. This is done by a systematic approach on the basis of methods developed in the VIDA programs. This VIDA Report 1 presents the design and methods used in the inclusive ECEC intervention program. TWO MODEL PROGRAMS Two model programs are introduced: the VIDA Basis program and the VIDA+ parental program. Both programs consist of education and training of VIDA staff by means of three elements: presentation of theoretical and empirical knowledge of children�s learning and wellbeing; education, including giving staff the opportunity to refl ect on their own experiences when working with socially disadvantaged children at their center; and, fi nally, training on how to renew practices at local level on the basis of VIDA program guidelines. The aim of the fi rst program (VIDA Basis) is to support children�s learning and well-being and particularly support socially disadvantaged children, i.e. these children�s socioemotional development and learning through inclusive efforts. The aim of the second program is the same kind of improvement of children�s development butin this program parents are involved in the activities too (VIDA+ program). Thus, the two model programs are similar in that they both direct attention to children in general and disadvantaged children�s well-being and learning particular; however they differ in that VIDA+ particularly directs attention to fi nding new methods for involving parents. INTERVENTION: EDUCATION AND IMPLEMENTATION The aim of the VIDA programs is to enhance the innovative competences of managers and daycare teachers with regard to improving the learning and wellbeing of children. The objective of the VIDA educational programs is to improve the way in which staff works with renewing everyday practices in terms of early efforts for socially disadvantaged children. The two model programs are based on recent evidence-based knowledge and, specifi cally for the VIDA+program, the Danish Clearinghouse of Education has made a research review of effective intervention programs that include parental involvement (see Appendix I). A range of materials and tools have thus been developed for the VIDA educational program, including guidelines for working with children�s learning and well-being through social inclusion. The program builds on three perspectives: 1) a resourceoriented and asset perspective on socially disadvantaged children as children with potential (not defi cit), 2) a learning perspective that views participants in the program (children, teachers and parents) as active, refl ective learners, and 3) an organizational learning perspective (staff qualifi cation in the entire daycare center). The VIDA education and training sessions thus build on methods that improve professionals� ability to convert scientifi c knowledge into practice through knowledge sharing and innovative experiments. Thus the program combines professionals� personal knowledge and practice-based experiences, i.e. combines tacit knowledge with explicit scientifi c knowledge acquisition and sharing. The VIDA and VIDA+ education programs encourage participants to work with both explicit and implicit (tacit) knowledge in order to improve the efforts for children. The role of managers is important as they are central in facilitating this kind of knowledge sharing and these learning processes by involving all employees in the centers. Consequently, as part of the VIDA education program, managers are offered management education and training especially targeted at capacitating employees to implement the VIDA programs through collaboration and joint efforts. EFFECT STUDY VIDA has been implemented and studied in four municipalities; 120 daycare centers were selected, 40 were randomly allocated to one intervention group (VIDA Basis), and 40 were randomly allocated to the other intervention group (VIDA+). The fi nal 40 were allocated to a control group. Staff at the daycare center assesses each child using the well-known Strengths and Diffi culties Questionnaire (SDQ) and Early Learning Outcomes Questionnaire. The latter is inspired by the Effective Provision of Pre-school Education (EPPE) project (Sammons et al, 2004, Sylva et al., 2011). Data has been collected from 7000 children aged between 3 and 6 on three occasions: at the start of the project in March 2010, in March 2011 and at the end in March 2013.Data for case studies are collected through staff surveys (N=235), interviews and follow-up observation studies with a view to learning how the centers are progressing. Statistical methods used in the analyses of the effects of the ASP program will be used to analyze the VIDA data, fi rstly a nonparametric growth-curve model that takes into account the hierarchical nature of the data, and secondly a difference-in-difference method that is solely based on within-child differences between the two intervention groups (VIDA Basis and VIDA+) and the control group. ORGANIZATION, DISSEMINATION AND AFFILLIATION The VIDA project is organized in groups that each has their own area of responsibility. There is a large degree of collaboration and coordination between the groups in order to ensure that every stage follows the overall aims of the programs, as well as the milestones and methods developed. An education group is responsible for implementing VIDA education and training programs. A research group is responsible for the overall design and methods used in the randomized controlled experiment, data collection and analysis. A project group (including representatives from the other groups) is responsible for coordinating design and method development as well as for coordinating all aspects of the program. Moreover, the project�s results are disseminated on a regular basis through reports, at conferences, seminars and schools, and through networking in a manner that ensures that all parties interested in the fi eld will continue to benefi t from the project�s results. A cross-disciplinary group has been established with representative directors and managers from the four municipalities involved in the project, as well as the project manager and partners from the Metropolitan University College involved in order to develop ideas of how to implement the VIDA program at a larger scale on the basis of experiences of the VIDA project and its results. The project will run from 2010-2013 .

AB  - This study tested effects of a program that offers teachers universal classroom management strategies, on teachers' burnout symptoms and self-efficacy, and their teaching behaviors. Data were collected from 147 teachers (mean age = 38.4 years, SD = 10.8) in 15 special secondary education schools for students with emotional and behavioral problems, at the start and end of the school year. Schools were randomly assigned to the experimental condition or a care-as-usual condition. Results show that the program impacted beneficially on self-reported levels of emotional exhaustion, and self-efficacy in engaging students and in classroom management, but not on teaching behaviors. Implications of this study for the professional development of teachers in special education and research are discussed.

AB  - Despite evidence that preschoolers spend the majority of their time in sedentary activities, few physical activity interventions have focused on preschool-age children. Health promotion interventions that can be integrated into the daily routines of a school or other setting are more likely to be implemented. The Study of Health and Activity in Preschool Environments employed a flexible approach to increasing physical activity opportunities in preschools' daily schedules through recess, indoor physical activity and physical activity integrated into academic lessons. Eight preschools were randomly assigned to receive the study's physical activity intervention. Teachers in these schools partnered with university-based interventionists across 3 years to design and implement a flexible and adaptive intervention. The intervention approach included trainings and workshops, site visits and feedback from intervention personnel, newsletters, and physical activity equipment and materials. Teachers reported a high acceptability of the intervention. The purpose of this article is to describe the evolution of a multi-component physical activity intervention in preschools, including (i) a description of the intervention components, (ii) an explanation of the intervention process and approach, and (iii) a report of teachers' perceptions of barriers to implementation.

AB  - Objective: To assess the effectiveness of expert training and consultancy for teachers of children with autism spectrum disorder in the use of the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS). Method: Design: Group randomised, controlled trial (3 groups: immediate treatment, delayed treatment, no treatment). Participants: 84 elementary school children, mean age 6.8years. Treatment: A 2-day PECS workshop for teachers plus 6 half-day, school-based training sessions with expert consultants over 5 months. Outcome measures: Rates of: communicative initiations, use of PECS, and speech in the classroom; Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Generic (ADOS-G) domain scores for Communication and Reciprocal Social Interaction; scores on formal language tests. Results: Controlling for baseline age, developmental quotient (DQ) and language; rates of initiations and PECS usage increased significantly immediately post-treatment (Odds Ratio (OR) of being in a higher ordinal rate category 2.72, 95% confidence interval 1.22-6.09, p <.05 and OR 3.90 (95%CI 1.75-8.68), p <.001, respectively). There were no increases in frequency of speech, or improvements in ADOS-G ratings or language test scores. Conclusions: The results indicate modest effectiveness of PECS teacher training/consultancy. Rates of pupils' initiations and use of symbols in the classroom increased, although there was no evidence of improvement in other areas of communication. Treatment effects were not maintained once active intervention ceased. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - This randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluated the efficacy of the Incredible Years (IY) Teacher Classroom Management (TCM; Webster-Stratton & Reid, 2002) program to assess whether training teachers in IY-TCM principles improve teacher behavior, whether any observed improvements impact pupil behavior classroom-wide, and whether these effects can be demonstrated with children at risk of developing conduct problems. Six intervention and six control classrooms comprising 12 teachers and 107 children (aged 3 to 7 years) were recruited. Children were screened for high or low behavior problems using the cut-off points of the teacher-rated Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (Goodman, 1997). The primary outcome measure was independent classroom observations using the Teacher–Pupil Observation Tool (Martin et al., 2010). Multilevel modeling analyses were conducted to examine the effect of the intervention on teacher, classroom, and child behavior. Results showed a significant reduction in classroom off-task behavior (d = 0.53), teacher negatives to target children (d = 0.36), target child negatives towards the teacher (d = 0.42), and target child off-task behavior (d = 0.48). These preliminary results demonstrate the potential impact of IY-TCM on both teacher and child behavior. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This systematic review was conducted to report on developments in and implementations of mindfulness-based intervention research for in-service teachers, and the status of that research. The review reported on sixteen studies published up to 2015 from an initial search of 1788 records in PsychINFO, EBSCOhost, Education Source, Scopus, Google Scholar and Mindfulness, a major publication outlet for research in mindfulness. Dimensions of the review included research and intervention design, interventionists, intervention results, intervention fidelity, and measurement validity and reliability. Researchers of quantitative studies predominantly used a randomised-control trial design with a wait-list control group. Analysis of results revealed that (a) relatively few mindfulness-based intervention studies have been conducted, (b) interventions were provided primarily to enhance teacher wellbeing and teacher performance, (c) different definitions of mindfulness and components of practice were incorporated into descriptions of mindfulness-based interventions, (d) intervention fidelity was rarely reported, and (e) researchers seldom used both direct and indirect measures of effects. A secondary analysis was conducted of studies using qualitative methods. This highlighted in-service teachers' experiences of learning and practising mindfulness, and provided potential explanations for the effects of mindfulness-based interventions found in primary quantitative studies. The review results are discussed collectively within the framework of evidence-based practice in education. Limitations of the review and future research directions are discussed.

AB  - Low-income preschool children face risks to their social-emotional development that can affect them later on. Although there are promising approaches to promoting preschoolers' social-emotional skills, the evidence base is limited, particularly on their effectiveness when implemented at scale. The Head Start CARES demonstration evaluated the effects of three distinct classroom-based approaches to enhancing children's social-emotional development on a large scale. The Incredible Years Teacher Training Program focuses on teachers' management of the classroom and of children's behavior. Preschool PATHS uses structured lessons to help children learn about emotions and interact with peers appropriately. Tools of the Mind-Play, a one-year program that promotes children's learning through structured "make-believe" play, is adapted from the original two-year "Tools of the Mind" program. A comprehensive professional development package (including teacher training, ongoing coaching, and related technical assistance) supported delivery of the enhancements over the course of one year. The demonstration was conducted with 17 Head Start grantees that generally represent the diversity of Head Start settings nationally. Head Start CARES rigorously evaluated the impacts of the interventions, or "enhancements," by randomly assigning approximately 100 Head Start centers within the grantees to a program group that received one of the interventions or to a control condition without any of them. The estimated impacts should be interpreted as the effects of the enhancements beyond any effects of the existing Head Start program in these classrooms. Head Start CARES tested each enhancement's impacts on teachers' practices and on children's outcomes in the spring of the preschool year, comparing those impacts with the team's theory of change for each approach. Key findings included: (1) All three enhancements changed observed teachers' practices in the expected ways, confirming that their theoretical differences were reflected in classroom implementation. Impacts on classroom climate were fewer and less consistent. (2) Two of the three enhancements showed consistent positive impacts on a range of children's social-emotional outcomes in preschool, although not as predicted. As expected, PATHS showed small to moderate improvements in children's knowledge and understanding of emotions (emotion knowledge), social problem-solving skills, and social behaviors. The Incredible Years improved children's emotion knowledge, social problem-solving skills, and social behaviors. It did not produce expected impacts on children's problem behavior and executive function (except for highest-risk children). Tools of the Mind-Play did not demonstrate expected impacts on executive function or self-regulation; it produced only positive impacts on emotion knowledge. (3) There was no consistent evidence that these enhancements improved children's pre-academic skills during preschool, although those skills were not key targets of the enhancements. While based on very limited information, there were virtually no impacts on outcomes in kindergarten as reported by teachers and parents. (4) Findings show that evidence-based approaches can improve preschoolers' social-emotional competence when implemented at scale with appropriate supports.

AB  - This study was designed to establish the efficacy of Teaching SMART (Teaching Science, Mathematics and Relevant Technologies); a science professional development program for teachers with students in grades 3 through 5. Teaching SMART promotes scientific inquiry and emphasizes the importance of equity, empowerment, exploration, and fun in the classroom. The paper focuses on two primary outcomes for the teachers and students who participated in the three year implementation of Teaching SMART: (1) the impact on science teaching practices of teachers and (2) effects on student achievement in science. This is an analysis of the first cohort of third grade students participating in three years of implementation with 129 initial teachers. In all, there are 964 third grade students from ten treatment and ten control schools. The authors are encouraged by the teachers reported change in practice and the concurrent student reports. The lack of significant effects on measures of student achievement may be due to a variety of factors including contextual pressures emphasizing reading and mathematics achievement. Repeated measures analyses of the recent FCAT scores at the student level may provide greater power. During the implementation of the Teaching SMART program there are a number of issues that may have influenced teacher practices and student achievement. Issues include the district context, and the Teaching SMART program structure and implementation. The school district's support was initially very strong, but waned as the program progressed. The supervisor for elementary science was routinely present for the opening of each of the multiple beginning training sessions and on half of those trainings her supervisor spoke of the district's support for the program. Delivery of the professional development by the resource teachers was always well planned and structured based upon the experience of the Teaching SMART program director. The authors found the implementation among repeated trainings was uniform, but that problems the resource teachers had were not always adequately addressed. Initially the resource teachers tended to deliver the training in didactic manner undermining the inquiry base of the program. Overall these context and programmatic issues may have slowed the growth of teachers participating in the program. This slowed growth for teachers combined with a lag in increases in student achievement scores offers some optimism for the success of the Teaching SMART program. (Contains 1 table and 3 figures.)

AB  - This paper provides outcomes of a study examining the effectiveness of a year-long professional development training series designed to support in-service educators in learning a systematic approach to functional assessment-based interventions developed by Umbreit and colleagues (2007) that has met with demonstrated success when implemented with university supports. Forty-eight educators attended a 4-day, practice-based professional development series, with coaching and applied practice occurring between sessions. Participants completed pre- and post-training surveys to evaluate their perceived knowledge, confidence, and usefulness as well as actual knowledge of 15 concepts and strategies addressed in the training series. Outcomes as well as implications for professional development to support in-service teachers and school personnel in learning how to design, implement, and evaluate functional assessment-based interventions are offered. Results indicated statistically significant improvements in each concept and strategy measured. Findings are discussed in light of noted limitations, with recommendations offered to improve subsequent professional development efforts.

AB  - Collaborative professional development of science and special educators leads to improved access and inclusion of students with disabilities. Yet, despite poor science achievement of students with disabilities, their increasing presence in general education science classrooms, and research that demonstrates effective teaching strategies for students with special education needs, there have been few reports of joint professional development in the literature. The purpose of the study was to examine changes in the teaching practices of science and special educators, grades 4 to 8, as they completed an intense year-long professional development program designed to promote hands-on, inquiry-based science in their classrooms and expand their instructional repertoires to better serve students with disabilities and other learning problems. Quantitative and qualitative measures, including pre and post ratings of teacher classroom performance, action research projects, and teacher self-reports were used to determine changes in teaching practices. Findings indicated all teachers showed improvement in the classroom on many elements related to classroom culture, instructional content, and lesson design and implementation, and the ability to adjust instruction.

AB  - The aim of the intervention was to raise levels of engagement and attainment across English, maths, and science in primary schools by improving the quality of teacher and pupil talk in the classroom. The approach, termed "dialogic teaching", emphasises dialogue through which pupils learn to reason, discuss, argue, and explain in order to develop their higher order thinking as well as their articulacy. The intervention was developed and delivered by a team from the Cambridge Primary Review Trust (CPRT) and the University of York. Year 5 teachers in 38 schools, and a teacher mentor from each school, received resources and training from the delivery team, and then implemented the intervention over the course of the autumn and spring terms in the 2015/2016 school year. Following the intervention, pupils were tested in English, mathematics, and science. This efficacy trial compared the 38 schools (2,492 pupils) in which the intervention took place with 38 control schools (2,466 pupils). During the intervention, the evaluation team also carried out a survey and interviews with a sample of teachers, mentors, and heads, plus case-study visits to three intervention schools. The following are among the key conclusions from the evaluation: (1) Children in Dialogic Teaching schools made two additional months' progress in English and science, and one additional month's progress in maths, compared to children in control schools, on average. The three padlock security rating means we are moderately confident that this difference was due to the intervention and not to other factors; (2) Children eligible for free school meals (FSM) made two additional months' progress in English, science, and maths compared to FSM children in control schools. The smaller number of FSM pupils in the trial limits the security of this result; (3) The intervention was highly regarded by headteachers, mentors, and teachers who thought that the Dialogic Teaching approach had positive effects on pupil confidence and engagement. (4) The majority of participating teachers felt that it would take longer than two terms to fully embed a Dialogic Teaching approach in their classrooms. It could therefore be valuable to test the impact of the intervention over a longer period; and (5) This intervention requires teachers to change classroom talk across the curriculum, supported by training, handbooks, video, and regular review meetings with mentors. Future research could aim to differentiate the effects of these different elements. The process evaluation showed that the Dialogic Teaching approach was highly valued by participating schools. Teachers reported positive effects on pupil engagement and confidence. However, some schools also found the approach very challenging to implement within the two terms that this project lasted (autumn and spring terms 2015/2016). In fact, teachers felt that the impact evaluation was unlikely to show a positive effect on attainment for this reason. This means it is possible that the effect sizes observed in this evaluation are underestimates of the potential impact.

Sixty-two schools from 16 districts in four states were randomly assigned to treatment and control conditions. A total of 182 first-grade teachers and their 1,811 students formed the sample. Treatment teachers received the TSG professional development from October to March. Teachers in the business-as-usual control condition received school/district professional development. A multilevel analysis was conducted to detect impacts. Significant impacts were found for teacher knowledge and observed teaching practice. No impacts were found at the student level.

AB  - Understanding teachers' stress is of critical importance to address the challenges in today's educational climate. Growing numbers of teachers are reporting high levels of occupational stress, and high levels of teacher turnover are having a negative impact on education quality. Cultivating Awareness and Resilience in Education (CARE for Teachers) is a mindfulness-based professional development program designed to promote teachers' social and emotional competence and improve the quality of classroom interactions. The efficacy of the program was assessed using a cluster randomized trial design involving 36 urban elementary schools and 224 teachers. The CARE for Teachers program involved 30 hr of in-person training in addition to intersession phone coaching. At both pre- and postintervention, teachers completed self-report measures and assessments of their participating students. Teachers' classrooms were observed and coded using the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS). Analyses showed that CARE for Teachers had statistically significant direct positive effects on adaptive emotion regulation, mindfulness, psychological distress, and time urgency. CARE for Teachers also had a statistically significant positive effect on the emotional support domain of the CLASS. The present findings indicate that CARE for Teachers is an effective professional development both for promoting teachers' social and emotional competence and increasing the quality of their classroom interactions.

AB  - From 2011 to 2013 a randomized controlled trial has been run in Danish preschools to obtain evidence on improvements of early childhood education by providing training to the preschool teachers. The purpose of the intervention is to improve child socio-emotional outcomes (measured by SDQ), especially for socially disadvantaged children. The intervention preschools received extra training of the preschool teachers, whereas control preschools did not receive any training. The results show improvements in several subscales of the SDQ scale. However, the intervention proves less beneficial for socially disadvantaged children, in particular as a consequence of unfavorable preschool characteristics.

AB  - With the increase in the use of online professional development resources, especially for rural educators, this study evaluated the effects of online training modules on in-service teachers' ability to collect and use instructional progress monitoring data to make instructional decisions for students with significant disability (i.e., moderate to severe intellectual disability, autism). In this randomized control study, 29 teachers across three states participated in online data collection or data collection plus data-based decision making training. In addition, the generalization of teachers' ability to use data-based decisions with their own student outcome data were measured. Results indicated that while the modules did support teachers' acquisition of new information, they were not sufficient to carry over to applied use on their own students' data. Further discussion on the use of module-based professional development will be presented as well as how teachers in rural areas can access this information. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

This study evaluated the effectiveness of two consuliati on-based models for designing academic interventions to enhance the educational functioning of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Children (N-167) meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (4th ed.—text revision; American Psychiatric Association, 2000) criteria for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder were randomly assigned to one of two consultation groups; intensive data-based academic intervention (interventions designed using a data-based decision-making model that involved ongoing feedback to teachers) and traditional data-based academic intervention (interventions designed based on consultant-teacher collaboration, representing "consultation as usual"). Teachers implemented academic interventions over 15 months. Academic outcomes (e.g., curriculum-based assessment, report card grade, and individual goal attainment) were assessed on four occasions (baseline, 3 months, 12 months, and 15 mon)

AB  - Peer coaching provides an attractive alternative to traditional professional development for promoting classroom quality in a sustainable, cost-effective manner by creating a collaborative teaching community. This exploratory study describes the development and evaluation of the Colleague Observation And CoacHing (COACH) program, a peer coaching program designed to increase teachers' effectiveness in enhancing classroom quality in a preschool Head Start setting. The COACH program consists of a training workshop on coaching skills and student-teacher interactions, six peer coaching sessions, and three center meetings. Pre-post observations of emotional support, classroom organization, and instructional support using the Classroom Assessment Scoring System of twelve classrooms assigned to peer coaching were compared to twelve control classrooms at baseline and following the intervention. Findings provide preliminary support that the peer coaching program is perceived as acceptable and feasible by the participating preschool teachers and that it may strengthen student-teacher interactions. Further program refinement and evaluation with larger samples is needed to enhance student-teacher interactions and, ultimately, children's adaptive development.

AB  - Background: Mental disorders often have their first onset during adolescence. For this reason, high school teachers are in a good position to provide initial assistance to students who are developing mental health problems. To improve the skills of teachers in this area, a Mental Health First Aid training course was modified to be suitable for high school teachers and evaluated in a cluster randomized trial. Methods: The trial was carried out with teachers in South Australian high schools. Teachers at 7 schools received training and those at another 7 were wait-listed for future training. The effects of the training on teachers were evaluated using questionnaires pre- and post-training and at 6 months follow-up. The questionnaires assessed mental health knowledge, stigmatizing attitudes, confidence in providing help to others, help actually provided, school policy and procedures, and teacher mental health. The indirect effects on students were evaluated using questionnaires at pre-training and at follow-up which assessed any mental health help and information received from school staff, and also the mental health of the student. Results: The training increased teachers’ knowledge, changed beliefs about treatment to be more like those of mental health professionals, reduced some aspects of stigma, and increased confidence in providing help to students and colleagues. There was an indirect effect on students, who reported receiving more mental health information from school staff. Most of the changes found were sustained 6 months after training. However, no effects were found on teachers’ individual support towards students with mental health problems or on student mental health. Conclusions: Mental Health First Aid training has positive effects on teachers’ mental health knowledge, attitudes, confidence and some aspects of their behavior.

AB  - Studied the effects of a school-based intervention for preventing smoking among 4,441 pupils in 99 Norwegian secondary schools. Ss were followed through annual data collections until they graduated in spring 1997. Schools were allocated to 1 of 4 groups: Group A, control; Group B, intervention, containing classroom program, involvement of parents and teacher courses; Group C, like B, but without teacher courses; Group D, like B, but without parental involvement. Baseline data were collected by questionnaires administered in November 1994 and the 1st follow-up survey was carried out in May 1995. At follow-up the number of smokers had increased by 8.3% in Group A (control) and by 1.9% in Group B (most extensive intervention). As expected, the recruitment of smokers was higher in Groups C and D than in the ideal intervention, but lower than in the control group. Effects of the most extensive program among subgroups of students were examined by comparing Groups A and B. Students are categorized as high or low risk based on scores on scales measuring sensation seeking, physical maturity, antisocial behavior and parental smoking. The effect of the program on recruitment of smokers seems to have been at least as strong or even stronger among high-risk students than among other students.

AB  - Orphaned and vulnerable children (OVC) experience poverty, stigma, and abuse resulting in poor physical, emotional, and psychological outcomes. The Teachers' Diploma Programme on Psychosocial Care, Support, and Protection is a child-centered 15-month long-distance learning program focused on providing teachers with the knowledge and skills to enhance their school environments, foster psychosocial support, and facilitate school-community relationships. A randomized controlled trial was implemented in 2013-2014. Both teachers (n=325) and students (n=1378) were assessed at baseline and 15-months post-intervention from randomly assigned primary schools in Lusaka and Eastern Provinces, Zambia. Multilevel linear mixed models (MLM) indicate positive significant changes for intervention teachers on outcomes related to self-care, teaching resources, safety, social support, and gender equity. Positive outcomes for intervention students related to future orientation, respect, support, safety, sexual abuse, and bullying. Outcomes support the hypothesis that teachers and students benefit from a program designed to enhance teachers' psychosocial skills and knowledge.

AB  - Students’ school success in literacy and numeracy is often hampered by limited prerequisites in these domains, yet the effectiveness of different approaches to support students is unclear. Using professional training programmes for kindergarten teachers, we tested the effects of three kindergarten approaches in a quasi-experimental pre- and post-test-control-group design: (1) the ‘Pyramid Approach’, (2) a domain-specific training programme focusing on literacy and numeracy and (3) a domain-specific Developmentally Appropriate Approach focusing on literacy and numeracy. A control group without any professional training for teachers and therefore without explicit domain-specific support for the children was also tested. Twenty-five kindergartens in Germany with 397 children between 5 and 6 years of age participated. The three intervention groups performed significantly better in terms of achievement in literacy and numeracy than the control group did, but there were no significant effec)

AB  - The purpose of the study was to determine the efficacy of the Class-Wide Function-Related Intervention Teams (CW-FIT) program for improving students' on-task behavior, and increasing teacher recognition of appropriate behavior. The intervention is a group contingency classroom management program consisting of teaching and reinforcing appropriate behaviors (i.e., getting the teacher's attention, following directions, and ignoring inappropriate behaviors of peers). Seventeen elementary schools, the majority in urban and culturally diverse communities, participated in a randomized trial with 86 teachers (classrooms) assigned to CW-FIT, and 73 teachers (classrooms) assigned to the comparison group. Class-wide student on-task behavior improved over baseline levels in the intervention classes. Teachers were able to implement the intervention with high fidelity overall, as observed in adherence to 96% of the fidelity criteria on average. Teacher praise and attention to appropriate behaviors increased, and reprimands decreased. These effects were replicated in new classrooms each of the 4 years of the study, and for all years combined.

AB  - Teacher professional development has long been of interest since it may affect teachers' learning, the practice of teaching, and student learning. Although empirical research has mainly explored the effect of specific professional development interventions on student achievement, these inventions have been initiated outside the school, and little attention has been given to the effect of content-focused teacher activities conducted in the school, as part of teachers' professional development at the elementary school level. Using Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS-K) data of first-grade students, teachers, and schools, I explored both the overall effects and the potential within-classroom equalizing effects of content-focused teacher meetings on students' reading achievement. This paper also examines the distribution effect of content-focused teacher meetings across classrooms of varying students' pretest scores and family SES. Using a two-level hierarchical linear model, the results indicated that content-focused teacher meetings were not only positively associated with classroom-level mean achievement scores but also significantly related to closing the achievement gap between students with initial lower and higher pretest scores. In contrast, teachers' participation in formal learning opportunities introduced from outside the school exacerbated the achievement gap. Among contextual variables, a teacher's number of reading courses taken in college was associated with decreasing the achievement gap. However, there was no difference in the distribution of content-focused teacher meetings between classrooms which were composed of students who had either high- versus low- SES, or high- versus low- pretest scores. The results of this study suggest that beyond individual participation in teacher learning opportunities which are introduced from outside the school, fostering content-focused teacher meetings in the school may be an effective way to accomplish two key purposes of education: to increase overall student achievement and to close the achievement gap.

AB  - Young children are disproportionately exposed to maltreatment but are underrepresented in research on effective treatments. Universal Teacher-Child Interaction Training (TCIT-U), developed from Parent-Child Interaction Therapy, may be especially appropriate for maltreated children as they often experience caregiver disruptions which pose challenges to traditional parent-child treatment. Furthermore, research suggests that teachers can play an important role for children who lack positive caregiving experiences. The current study examined the effectiveness of TCIT-U versus treatment-as-usual (TAU) at a therapeutic preschool for youth exposed to maltreatment. Thirty-eight children (2-5 years old) and eight teachers from four classrooms participated in the study. Teacher behaviors were observed and coded at baseline, mid-treatment, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up. Teachers reported on children's behavior and social-emotional skills at baseline, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up. TCIT-U teachers demonstrated substantial increases in positive attending skills (PRIDE [Praise, Reflection, Imitation, Description, and Enjoyment] skills) and decreases in negative talk and questions during intervention phases, and these skills were maintained at follow-up. In addition, children in the TCIT-U classrooms demonstrated a significantly greater increase in overall social-emotional skills by post-treatment than children in the TAU classrooms, and effect sizes were moderate for all child outcomes. Findings provide preliminary support for TCIT-U's effectiveness in a therapeutic setting for children exposed to maltreatment.

AB  - This study used a quasi-experimental research design to examine the impact of a professional learning program designed to enhance the competency of children with Autism, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Learning Disabilities and to develop knowledge, understanding and skills of teachers and parents in helping them. Data were collected from sample groups including administrators, teachers, students and parents. These sample groups were from 16 target schools, eight from Supanburi and eight from Khon Kaen provinces in Thailand. The instructional approaches were developed by teachers and taught in schools. Students were in Grades 1 to Grade 6. Research tools included parallel lesson plans, teaching materials and intervention techniques for enhancing student learning, a set of achievement tests and reflective forms. It was found that teachers and parents implemented intervention techniques which led to increased student academic performance and the development of a more collaborative approach to supporting children with diverse needs in Thailand.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of an asthma education program on schoolteachers' knowledge. Pre-test-post-test experimental randomized controlled design was used. A multistage-cluster sampling technique was used to randomly select governorate, primary schools, and schoolteachers. Schoolteachers were randomly assigned either to the experimental group (n = 36) and attended three educational sessions or to the control group (n = 38) who did not receive any intervention. Knowledge about asthma was measured using the Asthma General Knowledge Questionnaire for Adults (AGKQA). The results indicated that teachers in the experimental group showed significantly (p < .001) higher knowledge of asthma in the first post-test and the second post-test compared with those in the control group. Implementing asthma education enhanced schoolteachers' knowledge of asthma. The asthma education program should target schoolteachers to improve knowledge about asthma.

AB  - Despite recent shifts in research emphasizing the value of carefully designed experiments, the number of studies of teacher professional development with rigorous designs has lagged behind its student outcome counterparts. We outline a framework for the design of group randomized trials (GRTs) with teachers' knowledge as the outcome and consider mathematics and reading knowledge outcomes designed to assess the types of content problems that teachers encounter in practice. To estimate design parameters, we draw on a national sample of teachers for mathematics and a state Reading First sample to estimate for reading. Our results suggest that there is substantial clustering of teachers' knowledge within schools and professional development GRTs will likely need increased sample sizes to account for this clustering.

AB  - High school students with emotional and behavioral disorders (EBD) often exhibit behavior problems that negatively impact their school performance. Functional behavioral assessment (FBA) is one approach designed to address these difficulties. Although shown to be effective for students with developmental disabilities and young students with more mild disabilities, no research has investigated its effectiveness for high school students with EBD. The purpose of this study was to examine the ability of high school staff to implement FBA with high school students with EBD and to evaluate their perceptions of acceptability and knowledge of FBA. The special education staff at two high schools in the same school district participated in a one-day workshop and were given five months to implement the FBA procedures and develop behavior intervention plans (BIPs) based on the results of these assessments. One high school was given ongoing consultation and support, while the other high school received delayed support. Although a statistical analysis could not be completed due to the small number of FBAs and BIPs completed, the high school with immediate consultation completed six FBAs and BIPs, while the high school with delayed consultation completed one. The staff members who completed FBAs were able to competently implement the procedures, with a somewhat stronger performance by the school with ongoing consultation and support. Staff rated the FBA process as somewhat acceptable, with no significant differences found between the schools over time. Training increased the acceptability of FBA for staff in the short term, but five months later, acceptability returned to near baseline. This same pattern was noted for the group that, in fact, participated in the consultation process; however, a smaller decrease in acceptability after consultation was found for this group, although this was not significant. Technical skills and time needed to implement FBA were rated as the greatest concerns for staff. Staff reported moderate levels of FBA knowledge, with no significant differences found between the two schools or between the two participation groups over time. Staff self-reported knowledge levels increased with training, but after five months, with opportunities to apply the procedures, scores decreased; however, the decrease did not return to original levels of reported knowledge, indicating perceived retention of FBA knowledge. Results obtained supported the ability of staff to competently implement FBA procedures. Results were inconclusive with respect to the effects of ongoing training and support due to the small number of FBAs and BIPs completed and the small number of staff involved in the study.

AB  - Teachers who employ practices associated with positive behavior intervention and support (e.g., provide opportunities to respond, behavior specific praise, and pre-corrections) create superior learning environments. In a randomized-controlled trial, we investigated the effects of a multimedia-based intervention called Content Acquisition Podcasts for Teachers with Embedded Modeling Video (CAP-TV) on high school teachers' implementation of these practices. Direct observations showed that teachers who participated in the CAP-TV condition used significantly more of the practices than those in the control condition and their students were significantly more engaged during class sessions. These findings indicate that multimedia strategies can be used to provide professional development that will help teachers adopt effective teaching practices. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objective To test the hypothesis that depressed adolescents given brief cognitive behaviour therapy by trained social workers will be less depressed after this treatment than depressed adolescents who have routine care from their social workers. Method Open study, two randomized parallel groups. 86 social workers were randomized to training in brief CBT or delayed training by remote telephone randomization. 25 social workers who attended CBT training recruited 29 depressed adolescents. 22 social workers in the control group recruited 23 depressed adolescents. Results Social workers' perceptions of their knowledge and skills in dealing with adolescent depression were better after the training than before. However, in intention to treat analyses, adolescents who had therapy from trained social workers had a similar level of depression post treatment (mean depression score 17.5, 95% CI 11.8 to 23.3) to those who did not have such therapy (mean depression score 16.7, 95 % CI 11.3 to 22.1). There were no significant differences between the groups on other outcomes or at follow-up. Conclusions This study failed to recruit enough cases and probably did not therefore have enough statistical power to detect an effect of the intervention. It was also based on a severely impaired sample with many comorbid problems. However, the results suggest that training community-based social workers in cognitive behaviour therapy is neither practical nor effective in improving the outcomes of their clients.

AB  - Background: Teachers are reported to be at increased risk of common mental health disorders compared to other occupations. Failure to support teachers adequately may lead to serious long-term mental disorders, poor performance at work (presenteeism), sickness absence and health-related exit from the profession. It also jeopardises student mental health, as distressed staff struggle to develop supportive relationships with students, and such relationships are protective against student depression. A number of school-based trials have attempted to improve student mental health, but these have mostly focused on classroom based approaches and have failed to establish effectiveness. Only a few studies have introduced training for teachers in supporting students, and none to date have included a focus on improving teacher mental health. This paper sets out the protocol (version 4.4 20/07/16) for a study aiming to address this gap. Methods: Cluster randomised controlled trial with secondary schools as the unit of randomisation. Intervention schools will receive: i) Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) training for a group of staff nominated by their colleagues, after which they will set up a confidential peer support service for colleagues ii) training in MHFA for schools and colleges for a further group of teachers, which will equip them to more effectively support student mental health iii) a short mental health awareness raising session and promotion of the peer support service for all teachers. Comparison schools will continue with usual practice. The primary outcome is teacher wellbeing measured using the Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS). Secondary outcomes are teacher depression, absence and presenteeism, and student wellbeing, mental health difficulties, attendance and attainment. Measures will be taken at baseline, one year follow up (teachers only) and two year follow up. Economic and process evaluations will be embedded within the study. Discussion: This study will establish the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an intervention that supports secondary school teachers' wellbeing and mental health, and improves their skills in supporting students. It will also provide information regarding intervention implementation and sustainability.

AB  - Background: Secondary school teachers are at heightened risk of psychological distress, which can lead to poor work performance, poor quality teacher-student relationships and mental illness. A pilot cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) - the WISE study - evaluated the feasibility of a full-scale RCT of an intervention to support school staff's own mental health, and train them in supporting student mental health. Methods: Six schools were randomised to an intervention or control group. In the intervention schools i) 8-9 staff received Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) training and became staff peer supporters, and ii) youth MHFA training was offered to the wider staff body. Control schools continued with usual practice. We used thematic qualitative data analysis and regression modelling to ascertain the feasibility, acceptability and potential usefulness of the intervention. Results: Thirteen training observations, 14 staff focus groups and 6 staff interviews were completed, and 438 staff (43.5 %) and 1,862 (56.3 %) students (years 8 and 9) completed questionnaires at baseline and one year later. MHFA training was considered relevant for schools, and trainees gained in knowledge, confidence in helping others, and awareness regarding their own mental health. Suggestions for reducing the length of the training and focusing on helping strategies were made. A peer support service was established in all intervention schools and was perceived to be helpful in supporting individuals in difficulty - for example through listening, and signposting to other services - and raising the profile of mental health at a whole school level. Barriers to use included lack of knowledge about the service, concerns about confidentiality and a preference for accessing support from pre-existing networks. Conclusions: The WISE intervention is feasible and acceptable to schools. Results support the development of a full-scale cluster RCT, if steps are taken to improve response rates and implement the suggested improvements to the intervention.

AB  - The present study investigates whether productive classroom discourse in the form of instructional and motivational classroom discourse (Turner et al., "Journal of Educational Psychology" 94: 88-106, 2002) provides a supportive social context for students that fosters the fulfilment of the basic psychological needs of autonomy and competence (Meyer and Turner, "Educational Psychologist" 37(1): 17-25, 2002; Ryan and Deci, "Contemporary Educational Psychology" 25(1): 54-67, 2000). In order to explore this, we studied the ways in which a teacher professional development programme (Dialogic Video Cycle; Gröschner et al. 2015) might affect the quality of teachers' instructional and motivational discourse. The programme provided video-based professional development on productive classroom discourse for an entire school year. During the same period of time, we explored changes in students' perceptions of autonomy and competence support and possible implications for students' intrinsic learning motivation. The study followed a two-group field-experiment design; 10 STEM classes participated (N = 226 students). The intervention group (IG) was compared to a control group (CG), which participated in traditional professional development on classroom discourse (IG: n[subscript Students] = 136, n[subscript Teachers] = 6; CG: n[subscript Students] = 90, n[subscript Teachers] = 4). The results show significant group differences in the development of instructional and motivational discourse throughout the school year, resulting in significant benefits for the IG. Furthermore, the students experienced their teachers as more autonomy- and competence-supportive throughout the year, leading to increased experiences of self-determination and intrinsic learning motivation. The results are discussed in the light of recent research and theory.

AB  - Even though the importance of sexuality education for students with ID has been emphasized in Korea, there is a lack of sexuality education programs for general education teachers and special education teachers. In order to provide appropriate sexuality education to children with ID, it is important for teachers to gain positive attitudes toward sexuality education and appropriate knowledge on the topic. The objective of this study was to asses the relative effectiveness of two interventions in terms of their effects on the goals, attitudes, factors affecting willingness to teach, and knowledge of both general and special education teachers towards sexuality education for students with ID. Participants were recruited from general and special education schools in Korea that teach students ranging from eight to 20 years of age. Twenty general education teachers and 20 special education teachers were assigned to the control group and another 20 general and 20 special education teachers were assigned to each of the two experimental groups (information only and information plus film). The results indicated that, relative to the teachers in the control group, the teachers in the two intervention groups had significantly higher posttest goals (total and all subscale scores), attitudes, factors affecting willingness to teach, and knowledge scores. The scores of teachers in the two intervention groups, however, did not differ significantly from each other on any of the four measures. Results indicated that special education teachers and general education teachers differed only on the ‘encouraging respect for diversity’ subscale of the goals questionnaire and their attitudes toward sexuality scores. Special education teachers had higher ‘encouraging respect for diversity’ scores than general education teachers. However, special education teachers had significantly less positive attitudes toward sexuality education than general education teachers. There were no significant interactions between treatment condition and teacher type. In addition, teachers' age and the number of years spent teaching sexuality education were significantly correlated with the teachers' attitudes towards sexuality education. Thus, the older the teachers were and the more experienced the teachers were in teaching sexuality education, the more positive were their attitudes towards sexuality education. Furthermore, age level taught was significantly correlated with knowledge in the area of sexuality education. Specifically, the older the age group taught, the better the sexuality education knowledge of the teachers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The authors conducted a cluster‐randomized trial to examine the effectiveness of structured teacher adaptations to the implementation of an evidence‐based summer literacy program that provided students with (a) books matched to their reading level and interests and (b) teacher scaffolding for summer reading in the form of end‐of‐year comprehension lessons and materials sent to students’ homes in the summer months. In this study, 27 high‐poverty elementary schools (75–100% eligibility for free or reduced‐price lunch) were matched by prior reading achievement and poverty level and randomly assigned to one of two implementation conditions: a core treatment condition that directly replicated implementation procedures used in previous experiments, or a core treatment with structured teacher adaptations condition. In the adaptations condition, teachers were organized into grade‐level teams around a practical improvement goal and given structured opportunities to use their knowledge, experience, and local data to extend or modify program components for their students and local contexts. Students in the adaptations condition performed 0.12 standard deviation higher on a reading comprehension posttest than students in the core treatment. An implementation analysis suggests that fidelity to core program components was high in both conditions and that teachers in the adaptations condition primarily made changes that extended or modified program procedures and activities in acceptable ways. Adaptations primarily served to increase the level of family engagement and student engagement with summer books. These results suggest that structured teacher adaptations may enhance rather than diminish the effectiveness of an evidence‐based summer literacy program.

AB  - It is widely recognised that social workers need to increase their emotional resilience to protect their well-being and enhance the quality of their professional practice, but there is little evidence-based guidance on how this might be achieved. This study evaluated a multi-modal intervention that aimed to improve emotional resilience and well-being in newly qualified social workers from children's services in England. More specifically, it examined whether the intervention enhanced several personal resources associated with resilience (emotional self-efficacy, reflective ability, self-compassion and compassion satisfaction/fatigue) together with the overall level of mental health. A repeated-measures waitlist-controlled design was utilised. Twenty-five social workers in their first year of qualified practice in children's statutory services received training over a two-month period. The control group comprised thirty-one early-career social workers also working in statutory children's services. An online survey obtained data before the intervention and two months afterwards. Evidence was found that the intervention was effective in enhancing some personal resources, as well as psychological well-being more generally. The finding that psychological distress and compassion fatigue increased during the study period for the control group raises some concerns. The potential of the findings to inform sustainable, evidence-based interventions to protect and promote well-being in early-career social workers is discussed.

AB  - Purpose. The purpose of this study was to examine the difference between teachers' observations of preschool Hispanic students' behavior changes in treatment and control groups after a Child Teacher Relationship Training [CTRT] (Bratton, Landreth, Morrison, & Helker, in review) intervention. Methods. Perceived differences in children's behaviors were measured by the Internalizing Problems Scale, Externalizing Problems Scale, and Total Problems Scale of the Child Behavior Checklist Caregiver-Teacher Report Form (C-TRF; Achenbach & Rescorla, 2000). There were two identified groups of participants: teachers/aides and children. The target child participant population (treatment group) was at-risk Hispanic Head Start children who scored in the borderline or clinical range on at least one scale as identified by the C-TRF testing protocol. A total of 70 (N = 70) children (35 treatment and 35 control) were included in the study. Teacher and aide treatment participants received two phases of treatment. During Phase 1, teachers (n = 11) and aides (n = 11) attended a two-day intensive training on CTRT. During Phase 2 of treatment, teachers and aides utilized the skills of CTRT for approximately 10 weeks with child participants during center time. The control group teachers ( n = 11), aides (n =10), and children received no treatment. Three independent repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests were used to determine if a difference existed between the treatment and control children across three time points. Findings. The Internalizing Problems Scale yielded results indicating that there was not a significant change in internalizing behaviors for children in the treatment group. The effect size on this scale was small (ηp² = .01). The Externalizing Problems Scale did not yield significant results. The effect size on this scale was small (ηp² = .03). There was also no significance on the Total Problems Scale. The effect size on this scale was small (ηp² = .01). However, treatment group mean scores were higher than control group scores on all three scales. Extraneous variables discussed as possible reasons for the lack of significance include Hurricane Ike, teacher observations, cultural influences and the C-TRF, school atmosphere, and time allotted for the study.

AB  - Inactivity and an unhealthy diet amongst others have led to an increased prevalence of overweight and obesity even in young children. Since most health behaviours develop during childhood health promotion has to start early. The setting kindergarten has been shown as ideal for such interventions. “Join the Healthy Boat” is a kindergarten-based health promotion programme with a cluster-randomised study focussing on increased physical activity, reduced screen media use, and sugar-sweetened beverages, as well as a higher fruit and vegetable intake. Intervention and materials were developed using Bartholomew’s Intervention Mapping approach considering Bandura’s social-cognitive theory and Bronfenbrenner’s ecological framework for human development. The programme is distributed using a train-the-trainer approach and currently implemented in 618 kindergartens. The effectiveness of this one-year intervention with an intervention and a control group will be examined in 62 kindergartens using )

AB  - Study aim: To determine if pupil physical activity and Body Mass Index classifications maintained or improved after a one-year professional development program involving both classroom and physical education teachers. Guskey's model of teacher change guided this study. Material and methods: Indigenous children from ten schools (N = 320) in grades 3-12 from one community participated in this year-long comprehensive school change effort. Classroom (n = 31) and physical education teachers (n = 7) participated in this study as intervention (n = 27) or comparison (n = 11) teachers. Intervention teachers participated in a year-long professional development program to increase physical activity and healthy behaviour knowledge of pupils. Results: ANOVA results for pupil physical activity (measured using pedometry) indicated that both groups of pupils (intervention and comparison) became significantly more active over time. The intervention groups' behaviour was less stable (alpha = 0.71) over time versus the comparison group (alpha = 0.86), suggesting positive behaviour changes. No significant Body Mass Index changes were found. Conclusions: Although the intervention resulted in physical activity increases for both intervention and comparison pupils at the schools, change takes time and these initial findings show progress in increasing physical activity behaviours at school in an understudied and disadvantaged population of indigenous USA youth.

Previous experimental studies demonstrated that one-year interventions based on the DA have a positive impact on teacher effectiveness. The study reported here investigates the impact that a long-term programme based on the DA can have on quality of teaching. In-service primary school teachers were randomly allocated into two groups. The first group received a three-year programme based on the DA whereas the second acted as the control group. Pre- and post-measurement of teaching skills was performed each year. Offering the DA for a longer period resulted in bigger effects on improving teaching skills but no change in the skills of the control group was observed. Differential effects for teachers situated at different levels are also reported. Implications of findings are drawn.

AB  - This study examines the intensity effect of a mentoring intervention for Head Start teachers, the Individualised Learning Intervention (ILI), as it impacts child social emotional outcomes. Pairs of Mentor and Protégé teachers across three sites in two states were randomly assigned to intervention and control groups. Mentors in the intervention group participated in a 50-hour mentor seminar and supported the intervention Protégé teachers’ professional growth and development across one Head Start school year. Mentors themselves were also supported by a Mentor Coordinator. As part of a quasi-experimental study of implementation fidelity effects, the intensity of mentoring intervention was measured by the Intensity of Intervention Scale and the intervention group was divided into high and moderate intensity levels. Evidence is presented for the effects of high intensity levels of the ILI Mentoring programme, relative to moderate intensity and control conditions, on the children in the Protégé teachers’ classrooms. These results lead to practice and policy implications regarding the implementation of mentoring programmes such as the ILI which are designed for early childhood educators and built upon adult self-directed learning experiences and collaborative support.

AB  - Background Fundamental movement skill (FMS) competence is positively associated with physical activity (PA). However, levels of both FMS and PA are lower than expected. Current reviews of interventions to improve FMS and PA have shown that many school-based programs have achieved positive outcomes, yet the maintenance of these interventions is variable. Teachers play a central role in the success and longevity of school-based interventions. Despite the importance of teacher engagement, research into the nature and quality of teacher training in school-based PA and FMS interventions has received little attention. Objective The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the type and quantity of teacher training in school-based physical education PA and/or FMS interventions, and to identify what role teacher training had on the intervention outcome. Methods A systematic search of eight electronic databases was conducted. Publication date restrictions were not implemented in any database, and the last search was performed on 1 March 2015. School physical education-based interventions facilitated by a school teacher, and that included a quantitative assessment of FMS competence and/or PA levels were included in the review. Results The search identified 39 articles. Eleven of the studies measured FMS, 25 studies measured PA and three measured both FMS and PA. Nine of the studies did not report on any aspect of the teacher training conducted. Of the 30 studies that reported on teacher training, 25 reported statistically significant intervention results for FMS and/or PA. It appears that teacher training programs: are >= 1 day; provide comprehensive subject and pedagogy content; are framed by a theory or model; provide follow-up or ongoing support; and measure teacher satisfaction of the training, are more effective at improving student outcomes in FMS and/or PA. However, the provision of information regarding the characteristics of the teacher training was largely inadequate. Therefore, it was difficult to ascertain which teacher training characteristics were most important in relation to intervention effectiveness. Conclusion It is clear that whilst teachers are capable of making substantial improvements in student outcomes in PA and FMS, the findings of this review suggest the teacher training component of school-based PA and/ or FMS interventions is not only under-reported but is under-studied, and, perhaps as a result, the value of teacher training is not widely understood. What remains unclear, due to poor reporting, is what role teacher training is having on these outcomes.

AB  - This study evaluated whether the combination of two proven interventions, one in Head Start classrooms (The Early Education Model, TEEM) and one in the home (Play and Learning Strategies, PALS) resulted in enhanced effects on at-risk 3- to 5-year-old children's school readiness skills when compared to either of these interventions alone. Teachers and parents were trained to use a responsive style and strategies that supported children's school readiness skills with the goal of providing children consistency in responsive practices across the school and home environments. The study was conducted in 77 classrooms with teachers randomized to either the TEEM (n =39) or No TEEM (i.e., control or business as usual, n = 38) conditions. Six to eight children in each classroom were randomly assigned to either have their parents receive PALS (n = 314; 210 after attrition) or to a No PALS condition (n = 309; 221 after attrition) resulting in four conditions: TEEM/PALS, TEEM/No PALS, No TEEM/PALS, and No TEEM/No PALS. Results showed greater gains in the TEEM teachers' language and literacy instructional practices and sensitivity compared to control teachers, but there were few significant findings for child cognitive outcomes. Parents receiving PALS, as compared to those without PALS, showed greater increases across play and book reading contexts in numerous responsive behaviors linked to the attachment and socio-cultural theories. Children whose parents received PALS versus those whose parents did not showed greater gains in direct measures of print knowledge and self-regulation and in social and language skills observed during interactions with their parent. Interactive effects of TEEM plus PALS were seen for increased engagement in shared book reading but not for other cognitive or social outcomes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - As part of a three-year curricular and professional development intervention focused on English language learners (ELLs), this study examined the intervention's effect on teachers' science knowledge and instructional practices after one year of implementation. The P-SELL (Promoting Science Among English Language Learners) intervention comprised curriculum materials for students and teachers and teacher professional development workshops during the summer and throughout the school year. Using a cluster randomized controlled trial design, the study involved 103 fifth grade teachers from 33 treatment schools and 116 fifth grade teachers from 33 control schools across three school districts in one state. The teachers completed a researcher-developed science test and a questionnaire about their instructional practices at the beginning and end of the year. Results indicated a positive effect of the P-SELL intervention on teachers' science knowledge and all four measures of instructional practices: teaching for understanding, teaching for inquiry, language development strategies, and home language use. This positive effect could be attributed to consistent implementation of the key features of the intervention (i.e., standards-based, inquiry-oriented, and language-focused) for all students and ELLs in particular through educative curriculum materials and professional development.

AB  - Children living in low-income families are more likely to experience less self-regulation, greater behavior problems, and lower academic achievement than higher income children. To help prevent children's later socioemotional and academic difficulties, the Chicago School Readiness Project (CSRP) team implemented a clustered, randomized controlled trial (RCT) in early childhood programs with Head Start funding. Head Start sites were randomly assigned to receive CSRP services, which were offered as part of a multicomponent, classroom-based mental health intervention. Here, we provide an overview of the CSRP model, its components, and a descriptive portrait of its implementation. In so doing, we address various aspects of the implementation of three of its components: (1) the training of teachers, (2) MHCs' coaching of teachers, and (3) teachers' behavior management of children. We conclude with a discussion of factors potentially related to the implementation of CSRP and directions for )

AB  - Objective: In this randomized controlled trial, we investigated the effectiveness of a school-based targeted intervention program for disruptive behavior. A child-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) program was introduced at schools in disadvantaged settings and with active teacher support (ATS) versus educational teacher support (ETS) (CBT + ATS vs. CBT + ETS). Method: Screening (n = 1,929) and assessment (n = 224) led to the inclusion of 173 children ages 8–12 years from 17 elementary schools. Most of the children were boys (n = 136, 79%) of low or low-to-middle class socioeconomic status (87%); the sample was ethnically diverse (63% of non-Western origin). Children received CBT + ATS (n = 29) or CBT + ETS (n = 41) or were entered into a waitlist control condition (n = 103) to be treated afterward (CBT + ATS, n = 39, and CBT + ETS, n = 64). Effect sizes (ES), clinical significance (reliable change), and the results of multilevel modeling are reported. Results: Ninety-seven percent of children completed treatment. Teachers and parents reported positive posttreatment effects (mean ES = .31) for CBT compared with the waitlist control condition on disruptive behavior. Multilevel modeling showed similar results. Clinical significance was modest. Changes had remained stable or had increased at 3-months follow-up (mean ES = .39). No consistent effect of teacher condition was found at posttreatment; however, at follow-up, children who received ETS fared significantly better. Conclusions: This study shows that a school-based CBT program is beneficial for difficult-to-reach children with disruptive behavior: The completion rate was remarkably high, ESs (mean ES = .31) matched those of previous studies with targeted intervention, and effects were maintained or had increased at follow-up.

AB  - This article reports on two professional development programs for mathematics teachers and their effects on student achievement. The projects' design and their implementation within a larger municipality in Sweden, working together with over 90 teachers and 5000 students in elementary school, are described by using a set of core critical features of teacher professional development as identified in the research literature. Data on student achievement were collected at the beginning of the projects as well as one year after their implementation. The results demonstrate a significant interaction effect between year and intervention for grades 2, 8, and 9. Upon a closer examination of the descriptive statistics, the first project points at slight improvements for students in grade 2, while the results for grades 8 and 9 indicate a declining trend. The results for the second project are markedly different and indicate an improvement for student achievement in grades 8 and 9, while the results for grade 2 suggest a deterioration. Considering that both projects are conducted within the same context and are very similar when it comes to several of the critical features of professional development as identified in the research literature, these variances in results are noteworthy. Therefore, building on a closer examination of the projects' critical features, the Swedish educational context, and results from teacher evaluations, the article ends with a discussion of possible explanations for the variations found between, as well as within, the two projects' differing impact on student achievement.

AB  - Preschool teachers were randomly assigned to participate in two professional development interventions over two phases, both designed to improve their interactions with children: the NCRECE college course ( N = 169) and MyTeachingPartner video-based coaching ( N = 202). Using Berkel et al.’s (2011) integrated model of intervention implementation, we examined whether the association between teachers' perception of intervention quality and their improvement in instructional interactions was mediated by their responsiveness to the intervention. We tested the model across both professional development opportunities. Findings indicated that preschool teachers were more responsive to the intervention when they reported higher perceived quality for both the course and coaching. The association between perceived intervention quality and improvement in instructional teaching practice was mediated by teacher responsiveness in the coaching intervention only. Findings indicate that professional development implementers need to focus on how participants perceive interventions and what exactly the key aspects within the interventions are, given the importance of their perspective to what they actually do within interventions that lead to change.

AB  - The Teaching American History (TAH) grant program was established to improve teachers' history content knowledge to positively impact student achievement. The purpose of this causal-comparative post-test only study was to investigate the difference between the Tennessee End-of-Course (EOC) U.S. history scores of the students whose teachers participated in the professional development intensive summer trainings and the achievement performance of the students whose teachers did not participate in the trainings. The study also examined the relationship between the 2005/2006 EOC U.S. history scores, teacher experience, and teacher's highest degree earned. The sample for this study was a total of 778 experimental and 799 control group students who attended high school in the Upper Middle Tennessee History Consortium area in the 2004-2005 or 2005-2006 school years and took the Tennessee End-of-Course U.S. history test during the time of this study. The teachers of the experimental group participated in a week-long intensive summer professional development training in 2004 and/or 2005. Control and experimental teachers were matched on characteristics of their schools' National Center of Educational Statistics (NCES) locale rating, the percentage of their schools' economically disadvantaged students, and their years of teaching experience. Statistical significance was found between the EOC U.S. history scores of experimental and control groups. The scores of the students whose teachers did not participate in the professional development trainings were higher than those of the students whose teachers did participate in the trainings. Weak, but statistically significant, relationships at the .01 level were found between the students' EOC U.S. history scores and the years of teacher experience. The teachers with the least experience had the students with the higher scores. There was a weak positive relationship at the .01 level between the teachers' highest degree earned and the student history achievement scores. Teachers with advanced degrees had students with higher scores. For practice and future research recommendations included use of student and teacher academic gain measurements, measurement of student attitudes toward history, use of disaggregated student achievement data, teacher and administrator in-services, and careful screening of teacher participants to determine commitment to building the innovation's sustainability in their schools.

AB  - Background: Despite the health benefits of regular physical activity, most children are insufficiently active. Schools are ideally placed to promote physical activity; however, many do not provide children with sufficient in-school activity or ensure they have the skills and motivation to be active beyond the school setting. The aim of this project is to modify, scale up and evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention previously shown to be efficacious in improving children's physical activity, fundamental movement skills and cardiorespiratory fitness. The `Internet-based Professional Learning to help teachers support Activity in Youth' (iPLAY) study will focus largely on online delivery to enhance translational capacity. Methods/Design: The intervention will be implemented at school and teacher levels, and will include six components: (i) quality physical education and school sport, (ii) classroom movement breaks, (iii) physically active homework, (iv) active playgrounds, (v) community physical activity links and (vi) parent/caregiver engagement. Experienced physical education teachers will deliver professional learning workshops and follow-up, individualized mentoring to primary teachers (i.e., Kindergarten - Year 6). These activities will be supported by online learning and resources. Teachers will then deliver the iPLAY intervention components in their schools. We will evaluate iPLAY in two complementary studies in primary schools across New South Wales (NSW), Australia. A cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT), involving a representative sample of 20 schools within NSW (1: 1 allocation at the school level to intervention and attention control conditions), will assess effectiveness and cost-effectiveness at 12 and 24 months. Students' cardiorespiratory fitness will be the primary outcome in this trial. Key secondary outcomes will include students' moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (via accelerometers), fundamental movement skill proficiency, enjoyment of physical education and sport, cognitive control, performance on standardized tests of numeracy and literacy, and cost-effectiveness. A scale-up implementation study guided by the RE-AIM framework will evaluate the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance of the intervention when delivered in 160 primary schools in urban and regional areas of NSW. Discussion: This project will provide the evidence and a framework for government to guide physical activity promotion throughout NSW primary schools and a potential model for adoption in other states and countries.

AB  - This article describes the results of a multi-year, multi-state evaluation of the effectiveness of an early childhood prevention initiative that translates resilience research into practice. Targeted to children in preschool through the early elementary grades, the intervention comprises teacher training, a year-long classroom curriculum, original materials and music, and a companion parent education program. The evaluation methodology evolved from pre-experimental to true experimental design and encompassed multiple program replications. Child outcome data indicate that the intervention is effective in both: (a) strengthening children's social-emotional competence and positive coping skills and (b) suppressing the development of antisocial, aggressive behavior. The systematic process and outcome evaluation of this prevention initiative fills a gap by providing hard evidence of the effectiveness of a developmentally appropriate, research-based intervention for young children.

AB  - Background Serious case reviews and research studies have indicated weaknesses in risk assessments conducted by child protection social workers. Social workers are adept at gathering information but struggle with analysis and assessment of risk. The Department for Education wants to know if the use of a structured decision-making tool can improve child protection assessments of risk. Methods/design This multi-site, cluster-randomised trial will assess the effectiveness of the Safeguarding Children Assessment and Analysis Framework (SAAF). This structured decision-making tool aims to improve social workers' assessments of harm, of future risk and parents' capacity to change. The comparison is management as usual. Inclusion criteria: Children's Services Departments (CSDs) in England willing to make relevant teams available to be randomised, and willing to meet the trial's training and data collection requirements.

AB  - Professional development (PD) is increasingly used to improve early childhood educators' skills and knowledge in providing quality language and emergent literacy environments for children. However, the literature does not clearly indicate the extent to which such efforts reach their goals, or whether improvements in educator outcomes translate to learning gains for children. In the current synthesis, we conducted meta-analyses to evaluate the effects of language- and literacy-focused PD on process quality, structural quality, and educator knowledge as primary outcomes. Furthermore, we estimated effects for three child outcomes: receptive vocabulary, phonological awareness, and alphabet knowledge. PD produced a medium effect for process quality and a large effect for structural quality but no effect for educator knowledge. PD also produced a small to medium effect for phonological awareness and a small effect for alphabet knowledge, but these were not predicted by gains in educator out

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the feasibility of a classroom management course as a public health intervention. Improved socio-emotional skills may boost children's developmental and academic trajectory, while the costs of behaviour problems are enormous for schools with considerable impact on others' well-being. Design/methodology/approach - In total, 40 teachers attended the Incredible Years (IY) Teacher Classroom Management (TCM) intervention in groups of ten. Afterwards teachers attended focus groups and semi-structured interviews were completed with headteachers to explore whether TCM was feasible, relevant and useful, research processes were acceptable and if it influenced teachers' practice and pupils. Teachers completed standardised questionnaires about their professional self-efficacy, burnout and well-being before and after attendance. Findings - In all, 37/40 teachers completed the course. Teachers valued sharing experiences, the support of colleagues in the group and time out to reflect on practice and rehearse new techniques. Most teachers reported that they applied the strategies with good effect in their classrooms. Teachers' questionnaires suggested an improvement in their self-efficacy in relation to classroom management ( p =0.03); other scales changed in the predicted direction but did not reach statistical significance. Research limitations/implications - Although preliminary and small, these feasibility study findings suggest that it was worthwhile proceeding to a definitive randomised controlled trial (RCT). Practical implications - Should the RCT demonstrate effectiveness, then the intervention is an obvious candidate for implementation as a whole school approach. Originality/value - Successful intervention with one teacher potentially benefits every child that they subsequently teach and may increase the inclusion of socio-economically deprived children living in challenging circumstances in mainstream education.

AB  - The current study used a single-case design to examine two performance feedback conditions varying in intensity on the frequency of naturalistic math instruction in preschool classrooms during non-instructional times (transition, lunch, free play). Three Head Start teachers received professional development that combined information on four math-oriented milieu teaching strategies (incidental teaching, time delay, mand model, and model), milieu teaching scripts, and goal setting. Teachers then received a feedback package of relatively higher intensity associated with a performance criterion followed by lower-intensity, continued support feedback package. Teachers increased the use of math-oriented milieu teaching strategies and positive attention across intervention conditions. In addition, two of the three teachers evidenced generalization of milieu teaching strategies across contexts and content areas.

AB  - Getting Ready for School (GRS) is a new school readiness intervention for teachers and parents, designed to help children develop early literacy, math, and self-regulation skills. GRS was implemented in 19 Head Start classrooms. In the present study we examined variability in different aspects of intervention fidelity including dosage, adherence, and child engagement. In addition, we studied the association among classroom, teacher and student characteristics and fidelity, and whether measures of fidelity were associated with children’s growth in math, early literacy, and self-regulation skills across the preschool year. Findings indicate that on average teachers reported completing almost 80% of the activities assigned, and that they were observed to adhere fairly well to the lessons. Child engagement was observed to be moderate to high across classrooms. Classroom quality, as measured by the CLASS, and age of children were positively associated with adherence. Teachers that had participated in GRS for two years were more likely to complete more activities. Different components of fidelity were associated with child outcomes. Percentage completion of math and literacy activities were positively associated with growth in math and literacy skills. Children in classrooms in which teachers adhered more faithfully to the curriculum made significantly greater gains in literacy, math, and self-regulation skills. Child engagement was positively associated with a measure of executive function. Results highlight the importance of examining implementation fidelity. Implications for preschool teachers are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Low-income preschool children face many risks to their social-emotional development that can affect their school experience and social outcomes for years to come. Although there are some promising approaches to improving young children's social-emotional competence, the evidence base is limited, particularly on the effectiveness of these approaches when operating at large scale. To help address this gap, the Head Start CARES demonstration evaluated the implementation and impacts of three interventions that included classroom-based social-emotional strategies, along with professional development (teacher training and coaching) and related supports for scaling up the program, in Head Start classrooms across the country. "The Incredible Years Teacher Training Program" trains teachers to create an organized classroom climate that supports children's behavior regulation (by both the teacher and by the children themselves) and promotes positive teacher-child relationships. "Preschool PATHS" focuses on improving children's social-emotional problem-solving skills, including defining problems and anticipating the consequences of different solutions. "Tools of the Mind - Play" focuses on training teachers to strengthen children's ability to regulate their behavior by using adult-supported, "make believe" play and other activities. The demonstration was conducted with 17 Head Start grantees that varied by geographic location, organizational setting, and size, and generally represented the diversity of Head Start settings nationally. Centers within these 17 grantees were randomly assigned to one of the three interventions or to a "business as usual" control group. This report describes the extent to which each strategy and the professional development supports were implemented as intended, and the degree to which teachers' practices changed as a result. Taken together, the following findings confirm that the Head Start CARES demonstration provided a fair test of large-scale implementation of the three interventions, thereby providing a sound basis for evaluating their impact on children and classrooms. Key findings include: (1) Teacher attendance at training sessions and the quality of training were generally strong across all grantees and interventions. The dosage (frequency and duration) and quality of coaching for teachers in the classroom were also generally high. (2) Despite challenges, teachers reported that they understood the interventions and were able to implement them. The Incredible Years and Preschool PATHS were easier for teachers to implement than was Tools of the Mind. (3) Classroom implementation varied somewhat across the three interventions in terms of fidelity to the original model, but each intervention was implemented with fidelity at or above a predetermined threshold rating of 3 on a 5-point scale. Fidelity of classroom implementation improved over the course of the school year. (4) Compared with the control classrooms, each intervention improved the specific teacher practice that it was hypothesized to affect. The Incredible Years improved teachers' classroom management, PATHS bolstered teachers' social-emotional instruction, and Tools of the Mind increased teachers' scaffolding of peer interactions and play, in which the teacher supports the children in their attempts to push beyond their current skill level. A separate report examines the impacts of the three interventions on teacher-child interactions, children's preschool outcomes, and children's kindergarten outcomes. Appended are: (1) Head Start CARES Sample and Selection; (2) he Management Information System; (3) Head Start CARES Data Sources for Implementation Report; (4) Cost Estimates for the Head Start CARES Enhancements; (5) Components of the Head Start CARES Enhancements; and (6) Adapted Teaching Style Rating Scale (Adapted TSRS).

AB  - Professional development serves as means of transferring skills and knowledge to in-service educators (Reid, 2010) and of aiding practitioners in maintaining a current knowledge base (Grimes, Kurns, & Tilly, 2006; Jacobson, 1990). Much remains unanswered regarding how to enhance professional development and increase implementation of evidence-based practices in order to improve student outcomes (Guskey & Yoon, 2009; Odom, 2008). This study utilized a non-concurrent multi-element within a multiple-baseline across participants design to investigate the effects of a least-to-most system of supports for professional development to increase implementation of discrete trial training (DTT). Three special educators of young children with moderate to severe disabilities participated in the study. Results were varied across each participant but indicated a relationship between number of DTT components implemented, closed learn units, and behavior-specific praise and the professional development activities (i.e., online module, self-monitoring, coaching). In addition, teachers reported the activities were informative and valuable. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Describes a model of inservice training for regular and special education teachers at the kindergarten through 4th-grade level, with a focus on updating teachers on recent research developments in preventing and treating reading and writing disabilities and on translating this knowledge into classroom practice. The model includes a summer teacher training institute, 3 follow-up sessions during the school year, and ongoing observation and consultation in teachers' classrooms. The effectiveness of the model has been demonstrated in measures of teacher knowledge, classroom practice, and student learning outcome in comparisons with control teachers who have not received training. This article focuses on (1) the domain knowledge teachers are taught that relates to understanding the processes of reading and writing acquisition and instructional approaches for reading and writing, (2) the importance of forming researcher–teacher partnerships in which teachers become the experts in translating research knowledge into classroom practice, and (3) the transformations observed in teachers as they evolved in their level of knowledge and then in their teaching practices.

AB  - Substantial differences exist in how and where physical education (PE) is conducted in elementary schools throughout the US. Few effectiveness studies of large-scale interventions to improve PE have been reported. The Child and Adolescent Trial for Cardiovascular Health (CATCH) was implemented in PE classes in 96 schools (56 intervention, 40 control) in 4 study centers: California, Louisiana, Minnesota, and Texas. The 2.5-yr PE intervention consisted of professional development sessions, curricula, and follow-up consultations. Intervention effects on student physical activity and lesson context in PE were examined by teacher type (PE specialists and classroom teachers) and lesson location (indoors and outdoors). Observations of 2,016 lessons showed that intervention schools provided more moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and vigorous physical activity than controls. Classroom teachers improved physical activity relatively more than PE specialists, but PE specialists still provided longer lessons and more physical activity. The intervention improved PE of both specialists' and classroom teachers' lessons. Interventions need to be tailored to meet local needs and conditions, including teacher type and location of lessons. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This paper considers an innovative model of continuing professional development in addressing the needs of children with literacy difficulties, namely the Special Educational Needs Continuing Professional Development Literacy Project. Stranmillis University College, in partnership with St Mary's University College, Belfast secured £4.06 million over 3 years to enable primary school teachers in Northern Ireland to participate in an online course held in their own school, and for two teachers from each school to attend specialist face-to-face seminars taught at Master's level. One teacher from each school had the opportunity to complete two Master's modules and to be assessed for the award of Approved Teacher Status from the British Dyslexia Association. This project is one of the largest professional development projects to be undertaken in Northern Ireland. The project is aligned to two key Department strategies: one is to address the provision for special educational needs in mainstream schools within an inclusive school environment, and the second is to improve outcomes in literacy; a key focus is on early identification of individual needs and appropriately matched intervention. This paper discusses the design and delivery of this continuing professional development programme using this novel integrated model. It considers how this model has facilitated stronger theory-practice links among practitioners leading to increased confidence and competence in meeting the needs of children with literacy difficulties.

AB  - "Un Buen Comienzo" [A Good Start] was a professional development program implemented with prekindergarten and kindergarten teachers in Chilean public schools serving low-income families. In a randomized trial, the program showed moderate to large impacts on classroom quality but no impacts on targeted child outcomes. To unpack these findings, we examined intervention fidelity (IF) in both treatment and control groups. Specifically, the study examined (a) whether teachers in the treatment group showed greater fidelity to teaching practices prescribed by the intervention, as measured by dosage and adherence, at the end of prekindergarten and the end of kindergarten, than their control-group counterparts; and (b) whether language and literacy instructional dosage predicted gains in children's language and literacy outcomes at the end of prekindergarten and the end of kindergarten. IF data were coded minute by minute from videotapes of study classrooms collected at the beginning of prekindergarten, the end of prekindergarten, and the end of kindergarten. There were significant and large impacts of the intervention on dosage and adherence. Additionally, small but statistically significant associations were found between 2-year accumulated overall program dosage and children's reading and writing skills at the end of kindergarten. Results reveal that teacher practices changed in response to the intervention, but that increases in time spent on language and literacy instruction were not very substantial. This pattern may explain the absence of an overall impact on children's skills in the experimental study. Findings have implications for the design of both future preschool interventions and IF studies.

AB  - Evaluating teachers' professional development initiatives (PDI) is one of the main challenges for the teacher professionalisation field. Although different studies have focused on the effectiveness of PDI, the obtained effects and evaluative methods have been found to be widely divergent. By means of a narrative review, this study provides an extended framework to guide the evaluation of (the effectiveness of) PDI. Furthermore, and in accordance with this framework, an overview of measurement instruments that are currently in use is provided. The study concludes with implications for educational research and developers of PDI.

AB  - Findings from a metasynthesis of 15 research reviews of in service professional development to improve or change teacher content knowledge and practice and student/child knowledge and behavior are described. The research reviews included 550 studies of more than 50,000 early intervention, preschool, elementary, and secondary education teachers, educators, and practitioners. The goal of metasynthesis is to identify the common and core features of in service professional development associated with changes and improvements in educator and student outcomes. In-service professional development experts' contentions about the key characteristics and core features of effective in-service training were used to code and analyze the research reviews. Results showed that in-service professional development was most effective when it included trainer introduction, demonstration, and explanation of the benefits of mastering content knowledge or practice, active and authentic teacher learning experiences, opportunities for teachers to reflect on their learning experiences, coach or mentor supports and feedback during the in-service training, extended follow-up supports to reinforce in-service learning, and in-service training and follow-up supports of sufficient duration and intensity to have discernible teacher and student effects. Implications for improving in-service professional development are described.

AB  - We investigated the effects of My Teaching Partner-Secondary (MTP-S), a teacher professional development intervention, on students' peer relationships in middle and high school classrooms. MTP-S targets increasing teachers' positive interactions with students and sensitive instructional practices and has demonstrated improvements in students' academic achievement and motivation. The current study tested the prediction from systems theory that effects of MTP-S on students would extend beyond the academic domain--that is, the ecology of teachers' behaviors towards students should also influence the ecology of students' behaviors towards one another. Participants were 88 teachers (43 randomly assigned to MTP-S and 45 assigned to a control group that received the regular professional development offerings in their school) and 1423 students in their classrooms. Observations and student self-report of classroom peer interactions were collected at the start and at the end of the course. Results indicated that in MTP-S classrooms, students were observed to show improvement in positive peer interactions, although this pattern was not found in self-report data. However, moderation analyses suggested that for students with high disruptive behavior at the start of the course, teacher participation in MTP-S mitigated a typical decline towards poorer self-reported peer relationships. The relevance of findings for the social ecology of classrooms is discussed. (Contains 4 tables.)

AB  - Purpose: The current study investigated the effects of coaching as part of an emergent literacy professional development program to increase early childhood educators' use of verbal references to print and phonological awareness during interactions with children. Method: Thirty-one educators and 4 children from each of their classrooms (N = 121) were randomly assigned to an experimental group (21 hr of in-service workshops plus 5 coaching sessions) and a comparison group (workshops alone). The in-service workshops included instruction on how to talk about print and phonological awareness during a post-story craft/writing activity. All educators were video-recorded during a 15-min craft/writing activity with a small group of preschoolers at pretest and posttest. All videotapes were transcribed and coded for verbal references to print and phonological awareness by the educators and children. Results: Although at posttest, there were no significant group differences in the educators' or the children's references to print as measured by rate per minute, both the educators and the children in the experimental group used a significantly higher rate per minute of references to phonological awareness relative to the comparison group. Conclusion: Professional development that included coaching with a speech-language pathologist enabled educators and children to engage in more phonological awareness talk during this activity.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of the Professional Learning for Understanding Games Education (PLUNGE) program on fundamental movement skills (FMS), in-class physical activity and perceived sporting competence. Methods: A cluster-randomized controlled trial involving one year six class each from seven primary schools (n = 168; mean age = 11.2 years, SD = 1.0) in the Hunter Region, NSW, Australia. In September (2013) participants were randomized by school into the PLUNGE intervention (n = 97 students) or the 7-week wait-list control (n = 71) condition. PLUNGE involved the use of Game Centered curriculum delivered via an in-class teacher mentoring program. Students were assessed at baseline and 8-week follow-up for three object control FMS (Test of Gross Motor Development 2), in-class physical activity (pedometer steps/min) and perceived sporting competence (Self-perception Profile for Children). Results: Linear mixed models revealed significant group-by-time intervention effects (all p < 0.05) for object control competency (effect size: d = 0.9), and in-class pedometer steps/min (d = 1.0). No significant intervention effects (p > 0.05) were observed for perceived sporting competence. Conclusions: The PLUNGE intervention simultaneously improved object control FMS proficiency and in-class PA in stage three students. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Success for All (SfA) is a whole-school approach to improving literacy in primary schools. Teachers receive training in areas including group learning strategies, phonics, and assessment, and are provided with structured daily lesson plans and teaching materials. There is also support for school leadership in areas such as data management, ability grouping, and parental engagement. In this trial, the programme was delivered over two academic years on a whole-school basis by teachers and classroom assistants who were trained and supported by the Success for All Foundation. In total, schools received 16 days of training and support. Although the intervention was delivered on a wholeschool basis, the evaluation focused only on the outcomes of 1,767 pupils starting in Reception class, following them through until the end of Year 1. Fifty-four schools took part in this effectiveness trial. An implementation and process evaluation ran alongside the trial to explore implementation and delivery challenges. The evaluation took place between September 2013 and June 2016. Key conclusions include: (1) Children who took part in Success for All (SfA) made 1 additional month's progress, on average, after two years compared to children in other schools. The 3 padlock security rating means that we are moderately confident that this difference was due to SfA; (2) Children eligible for free school meals (FSM) made 2 additional months' progress after two years, compared to FSM children in control schools. The smaller number of FSM pupils in the trial limits the security of this result, though combined with other findings in the report it provides some evidence that SfA does improve literacy ability for children eligible for free school meals; (3) Of the 27 schools receiving SfA, 7 dropped out of the programme completely, and 5 did not implement it to the minimum expected level. There is some indication that lack of engagement with the programme resulted in poorer implementation which may have affected the programme's impact; (4) Some schools found SfA prescriptive and adapted the content and delivery of the programme. However, there is some evidence that schools delivering SfA as prescribed by the developers saw larger gains in children's literacy after two years than those that completed fewer aspects of the programme; and (5) Overall, schools that successfully delivered SfA were enthusiastic and valued the programme in their school.

A quasi-experimental study was carried out, with a pre-post evaluation of food knowledge, food consumption and nutritional status. The sample was 25 teachers and 465 students in Los Andes, with 352 students as control group in San Felipe. The nutrition intervention consisted in 9 interactive workshops for teachers during 5 months, transferring the information to the students. In the experimental group there was a significant improvement in food knowledge and a decrease in non-healthy food consumption in students, compared with the control group, without changes in nutritional status. In conclusion, the intervention in teachers improved food knowledge and healthy food consumption in students. As a consequence of the short period of intervention, the nutritional status did not change. If these strategies are maintained over time and incorporated to the school curricula could achieve more significant results, in particular if parents are incorporated in school nutrition education programs.

AB  - Objective: This cluster randomized trial (CRT) evaluated the efficacy of the Classroom Social, Communication, Emotional Regulation, and Transactional Support (SCERTS) Intervention (CSI) compared with usual school-based education with autism training modules (ATM). Method: Sixty schools with 197 students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in 129 classrooms were randomly assigned to CSI or ATM. Mean student age was 6.79 years (SD 1.05) and 81.2% were male. CSI teachers were trained on the model and provided coaching throughout the school year to assist with implementation. A CRT, with students nested within general and special education classrooms nested within schools, was used to evaluate student outcomes. Results: The CSI group showed significantly better outcomes than the ATM group on observed measures of classroom active engagement with respect to social interaction. The CSI group also had significantly better outcomes on measures of adaptive communication, social skills, and executive functioning with Cohen’s d effect sizes ranging from 0.31 to 0.45. Conclusion: These findings support the preliminary efficacy of CSI, a classroom-based, teacher-implemented intervention for improving active engagement, adaptive communication, social skills, executive functioning, and problem behavior within a heterogeneous sample of students with ASD. This makes a significant contribution to the literature by demonstrating efficacy of a classroom-based teacher-implemented intervention with a heterogeneous group of students with ASD using both observed and reported measures.

AB  - We conducted two studies using the Child Teacher Relationship Training (CTRT) model. The first determined whether there is a mean reduction on child behavior problems over time depending on which treatment children's teachers received. The second focused on whether or not teachers were able to generalize child-centered play therapy with individual children for use in the classroom. Teachers received training in either CTRT/child-centered play therapy, or a control training on conscious discipline. Ss were a total of 48 teachers and 84 children in both studies. CTRT is a viable treatment option in addressing the mental health needs of young children with behavioral problems. Teachers and aides were able to learn and use CTRT relationship-building skills in the classroom. Teachers also believed that these skills would be helpful enough to implement them in their daily interactions with students. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Lesson Study is a popular approach to teacher professional development used widely in Japan. It involves a small group of teachers co-planning a series of lessons based on a shared learning goal for the pupils, with one teacher leading the co-constructed lesson and their colleagues invited to observe pupil learning in the lesson. The team then develop their practice further, based on feedback. Some of the features of Lesson Study have been adopted, in a variety of formats, in the U.K. A team at Edge Hill University developed a Lesson Study programme combined with a Talk for Learning content focus, which involved a team of three teachers collaborating to plan, teach, (informally) observe and analyse the impact of teaching on pupil response and progress. Each teacher identified two 'case pupils' in their own class who appeared to be underachieving, and the observation focused on these pupils. The aim of the intervention was to raise pupil attainment by improving teacher effectiveness. This evaluation tested the impact of a particular version of the Edge Hill programme on pupils' Key Stage 2 (KS2) outcomes. Three teachers from each participating school attended five training sessions from September 2013 to July 2015. Each term, they completed one Lesson Study cycle where one of the team taught three co-planned 'research' lessons while the others observed pupil learning, interviewed the case pupils after each research lesson, and met with the teacher to review their practice. Each year, at least one Lesson Study cycle focused on literacy, and at least one on maths; at least one cycle focused on a Year 4 class and one on a Year 5 class. The programme was evaluated using a randomised controlled trial of schools in the South West, East Midlands, and North West. Teachers in 181 schools (teaching 12,747 pupils) took part. The primary outcome was a combination of KS2 maths and reading test scores for pupils who were in Years 4 and 5 in the first year of the trial. The process evaluation involved observation of teacher training, analysis of surveys, school visits, and interviews with participating teachers and senior leaders. Methods, impact evaluation, process evaluation, and findings are discussed herein.

AB  - The present paper reports on the results of a cluster randomized trial of the Incredible Years (R) Teacher Classroom Management Program (IY-TCM) and its effects on early elementary teachers' management strategies, classroom climate, and students' emotion regulation, attention, and academic competence. IY-TCM was implemented in 11 rural and semi-rural schools with K-2 teachers and a diverse student sample. Outcomes were compared for 45 teachers who participated in five full day training workshops and brief classroom consultation and 46 control teachers; these 91 teachers had a total of 1192 students. A high level of teacher satisfaction was found and specific aspects of the training considered most valuable for early elementary teachers were identified. Hierarchical linear modeling indicated a statistically significant intervention effect on Positive Climate in the classroom (d = 0.45) that did not sustain into the next school year. No main effects on student outcomes were observed, although a priori moderator analyses indicated that students with elevated social-behavioral difficulties benefitted with regard to prosocial behavior (d = 0.54) and inattention (d = - 0.34). Results highlight potential benefits and limitations of a universal teacher training program for elementary students, and suggest strategies for future delivery of the IY-TCM program and areas for future research.

AB  - Objective: Our objective was to measure the impact of an educational intervention program on teacher's knowledge about asthma and its management. Material and method: Before and after quasi-experimental study, with control group, of an educational intervention, which had as its aim to improve the teacher's knowledge of asthma and its management, was conducted in some schools of San Sebastian (Gipuzkoa), Spain. The Newcastle Asthma knowledge Questionnaire (NAKQ) was used as a measuring tool, and an adaptation of the asthma, sport and health program was used as an educational intervention. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare the total score of the questionnaire before and after the intervention, and the McNemar test was performed to compare the percentages of correct answers to each item. The Mann-Whitney U test was also performed to compare the baseline score and the score at three months between the intervention group and control group. The size of the effect and the standardised mean response were studied. Results: A total of 138 teachers from 6 schools, which were chosen at random (study group), and 43 teachers in the control group participated in the study. In the study group, the mean score of the NAKQ before the educational intervention was 16.1 +/- 3.4 points, with a median of 16 (range 7 to 23). After the intervention the mean score increased to 22.3 +/- 4.1, with a median of 23 (range, 6 to 29). The mean difference in the overall score of the NAKQ was 7.0 +/- 4.2 points, with a median of 8 (range, -2 to17). Furthermore, the size of the effect was 2.0 (> 0.8) and the standardised mean response was 1.7. After 3 months of the intervention the mean score of the NAKQ was 21.4 +/- 3.0 points, with a median of 22 (range, 12 to 29) which was significantly higher than the score obtained before the intervention (P <.001) and slightly lower than the score obtained immediately after the intervention, assuming a size of the effect of 1.6 and a standardised mean response of 1.2. In the control group, the level of knowledge did not change modified and was lower than the level of the intervention group (P <.001). Conclusions: An educational intervention program conducted among teachers significantly increases their knowledge of asthma. Moreover, the increase reduces slightly but maintains its higher level for at least 3 months. In spite of the fact that some aspects of knowledge improved with the educational intervention, they were not optimal. (c) 2012 Asociacion Espanola de Pediatria. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.

AB  - The Lesson Study for Accessible Science (LSAS) project created middle school teams comprised of both science and special education teachers who engaged in collaborative work to improve instruction in inclusive classrooms. The intervention is based on Lesson Study, a professional development approach that originated in Japan, which supports the systematic examination of practice and student understanding. Using an experimental design, teams of teachers were randomly assigned to the LSAS intervention or to a wait-list comparison group. The results of this study suggest that science and special educators in the LSAS intervention were able to generate more accommodations for students with learning disabilities, and they increased their ability to set an instructional context and adapt an instructional plan to meet science learning goals for all students in an inclusive classroom. They did not, however, show significant increases in their knowledge of science content or learning disabilities. (Contains 1 note, 2 figures, and 6 tables.)

AB  - To test the effectiveness of a telehealth service delivery model for the treatment of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) that provided pharmacological treatment and caregiver behavior training. The Children's ADHD Telemental Health Treatment Study (CATTS) was a randomized controlled trial with 223 children referred by 88 primary care providers (PCPs) in 7 communities. Children randomized to the experimental telehealth service model received 6 sessions over 22 weeks of combined pharmacotherapy, delivered by child psychiatrists through videoconferencing, and caregiver behavior training, provided in person by community therapists who were supervised remotely. Children randomized to the control service delivery model received treatment with their PCPs augmented with a telepsychiatry consultation. Outcomes were diagnostic criteria for ADHD and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and role performance on the Vanderbilt ADHD Rating Scale (VADRS) completed by caregivers (VADRS-Caregivers) and teachers (VADRS-Teachers) and impairment on the Columbia Impairment Scale-Parent Version (CIS-P). Measures were completed at 5 assessments over 25 weeks. Children in both service models improved. Children in both service models improved. Children assigned to the telehealth service model improved significantly more than children in the augmented primary care arm for VADRS-Caregiver criteria for inattention (χ2[4] = 19.47, p < .001), hyperactivity (χ2[4] = 11.91, p = .02), combined ADHD (χ2[4] = 14.90, p = .005), ODD (χ2[4] = 10.05, p = .04), and VADRS-Caregiver role performance (χ2 [4] = 12.40, p = .01) and CIS-P impairment (χ2[4] = 20.52, p < .001). For the VADRS-Teacher diagnostic criteria, children in the telehealth service model had significantly more improvement in hyperactivity (χ2[4] = 11.28, p = .02) and combined ADHD (χ2[4] = 9.72, p = .045). The CATTS trial demonstrated the effectiveness of a telehealth service model to treat ADHD in communities with limited access to specialty mental health services.

AB  - The present randomized controlled trial examined the effectiveness of Parent Management Training Oregon for foster parents with foster children (aged 4-12) with severe externalizing behavior problems in long-term foster care arrangements. Foster children's behavior problems are challenging for foster parents and increase the risk of placement breakdown. There is little evidence for the effectiveness of established interventions to improve child and parent functioning in foster families. The goal of Parent Management Training Oregon, a relatively long and intensive (6-9 months, with weekly sessions) parent management training, is to reduce children's problem behavior through improvement of parenting practices. We specifically investigated whether Parent Management Training Oregon is effective to reduce foster parenting stress. A significant effect of Parent Management Training Oregon, compared to Care as Usual was expected on reduced parenting stress improved parenting practices, and on reduced child behavior problems. Multi-informant (foster mothers, foster fathers, and teachers) data were used from 86 foster families (46 Parent Management Training Oregon, 40 Care as Usual) using a pre-posttest design. Multilevel analyses based on the intention to treat principle (retention rate 73%) showed that Parent Management Training Oregon, compared to Care as Usual, reduced general levels of parenting stress as well as child related stress and parent-related stress (small to medium effect sizes). The clinical significance of this effect was, however, limited. Compared to a decrease in the Care as Usual group, Parent Management Training Oregon helped foster mothers to maintain parental warmth (small effect size). There were no other effects of Parent Management Training Oregon on self-reported parenting behaviors. Child behavior problems were reduced in both conditions, indicating no additive effects of Parent Management Training Oregon to Care as Usual on child functioning. The potential implication of reduced foster parenting stress for placement stability is discussed.

AB  - This article examines the efficacy of a multitiered systemic reading intervention for increasing the intensity and quality of explicit literacy instruction that teachers provide in first-grade classrooms. Schools (j = 16) were randomly assigned to the treatment or comparison condition. In both conditions, teachers (i = 42) provided 90 min of Tier I reading instruction to first-grade students (n = 883). In the treatment condition, Tier I classroom teachers were trained to enhance their core reading instruction by making instruction more explicit and intensive through standardized protocols and ongoing coaching support. At-risk treatment students (n = 240) also received an additional 30 min of Tier II supplemental reading intervention that was highly aligned with Tier I instruction. The focus of this study is on the Tier I portion of the multitiered intervention and the impact of the Tier I Enhancing Core Reading Instruction intervention on teacher practices.

AB  - Objective: To assess the 2-year impact of teacher-delivered, brief, personality-targeted interventions on internalizing and externalizing symptoms in an adolescent U.K. sample. Method: This cluster-randomized trial was run in 19 London schools (N = 1,024 adolescents). Trained school-based professionals delivered two 90-minute, CBT-based group interventions targeting 1 of 4 personality-risk profiles: anxiety sensitivity, hopelessness, impulsivity, or sensation seeking. Self-report depression, anxiety, and conduct disorder symptoms were assessed at 6-month intervals. Results: Interventions were associated with significantly reduced depressive, anxiety, and conduct symptoms (p < .05) over 2 years in the full sample, reduced odds of severe depressive symptoms (odds ratio {[}OR] = 0.74, CI = 0.58-0.96), and conduct problems (OR = 0.79, CI = 0.65-0.96), and a nonsignificant reduction in severe anxiety symptoms (OR = 0.79, CI = 0.59-1.05). Evaluating a priori personality-specific hypotheses revealed strong evidence for impulsivity-specific effects on severe conduct problems, modest evidence of anxiety sensitivity-specific effects on severe anxiety, and no evidence for hopelessness-specific effects on severe depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Brief, personality-targeted interventions delivered by educational professionals can have a clinically significant impact on mental health outcomes in high-risk youth over 2 years, as well as personality-specific intervention effects in youth most at risk for a particular problem, particularly for youth with high levels of impulsivity.

AB  - Responding to the psychosocial health needs of the vulnerable population has been considered as a significant public health issue that must be addressed through access to public health professionals. The study adopted a quasi-experimental design to evaluate the impact of a training program on nurses and teachers’ knowledge of psychosocial health needs of vulnerable children and the impact this had on children’s resilience and psychosocial health outcomes (self-esteem, social connection, anxiety, and depression). The result showed a significant increase in the knowledge mean scores of both nurses and teachers 6 weeks post intervention. Children’s depression scores significantly reduced post intervention. Their resilience, self-esteem, and social connection were also significantly improved, while no significant reduction was found in their anxiety scores. The results of the pilot study suggest that a more rigorous study be conducted to further ascertain the effectiveness of the various interventions used in this study while taking into consideration the challenges raised by the authors.

AB  - The goal of this pilot study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a multi-component consultation package in improving teachers' classroom management skills, particularly among teachers with lower baseline levels of knowledge, skills, and intervention-supportive beliefs. Participants were 58 elementary school teachers (93% female; 50% non-Hispanic White) who received up to eight biweekly consultation sessions focused on general classroom management strategies and implementation of a daily report card intervention with one target student with or at risk of ADHD. Teachers were randomly assigned to either a comparison consultation condition designed to mirror current best practices (Frank & Kratochwill, in: Erchul, Sheridan (eds) Handbook of research in school consultation, Routledge, New York, 2014; Noell & Gansle, in: Erchul, Sheridan (eds) Handbook of research in school consultation, Routledge, New York, 2014) or a multi-component condition designed to simultaneously address teacher knowledge, skills, and beliefs as possible barriers to implementation of classroom interventions. Teachers in both conditions showed significant improvements in labeled praise, appropriate response to student rule violations, and general competence in classroom management. In support of the hypotheses, teachers with lower baseline levels of knowledge, skills, and intervention-supportive beliefs demonstrated more improvement in key outcomes in response to multi-component consultation, as compared to the comparison consultation (Cohen's d ranged from 0.33 to 1.12). Implications for research and practice in school consultation are discussed.

AB  - One important barrier that exists in the adoption of evidence-based practice (EBP) is the attitudes of social work practitioners towards EBP, and their willingness to adopt it in their practice. This study evaluated the impact of a one day continuing education training on the EBP process with 69 community practitioners based in Texas, United States. The study used a replicated one-group pre- and post-test design with 3 month follow-up to test the benefits of the training. Outcome measures assessed the level of: workshop participants’ familiarity with the EBP process; their attitudes toward the EBP process; their perceived feasibility of the EBP process; their intentions to engage in the EBP process; their self-reported engagement in the EBP process; and their knowledge about the EBP process. The results supported the effectiveness of this EBP training model, as there was significant change positive for each of the dependent variables over time. The authors concluded that the findings reinforced the view that the training model outlined should be used in the future to train practitioners in the use of EBP.

AB  - This study was designed to examine whether teacher training facilitates greater conflict resolution strategies and whether conflict resolution training leads to prosocial solutions by preschoolers who are at risk for conflict and violence in their environments. Head Start teachers were trained in a 40-hour college-level course. Teachers were instructed in the theory of conflict, conflict management, and socio-emotional development in addition to following a problem-solving curriculum with their preschool students. Sixty-four children were assessed at 4 and 5 years of age. Results showed that preschoolers of trained teachers had more skills in generating solutions to interpersonal problems. Furthermore, children of trained teachers relied on more relevant solutions and fewer forceful, and thus more prosocial, solutions to solve interpersonal problems. These findings will be discussed in a framework for teaching conflict resolution and social-emotional skills to preschool children. (Contains 3 tables and 1 figure.)

AB  - This article presents the findings of an analysis of the effects of CPD initiatives on the quality of the pedagogical practices of ECEC practitioners. It is part of a larger study commissioned by Eurofound and jointly conducted by VBJK, IOE and PPMI (Eurofound, 2015). In order to draw policy-relevant information that might support decision makers in designing effective ECEC policies in their countries, the study reviewed existing research evidence published on this topic not only in English, but also in all the languages currently in use in EU Member States. Therefore, it involved country experts from EU-28 Member States. The research question was framed by the political priorities identified by the "Council Conclusions on Early Childhood Education and Care" (EU Council, 2011). The systematic literature review methodology elaborated by the EPPI-Centre for informing evidence-based policies in the field of education and social sciences was adopted to review the evidence drawn from primary research studies cross-nationally. The study revealed that long-term CPD interventions integrated into practice, such as pedagogical guidance and coaching in reflection groups, proved to be effective not only in countries with a well-established system of ECEC provision and a high level of qualification requirements for the practitioners, but also in countries with poorly subsidised ECEC systems and low qualification requirements. CPD initiatives based on the active engagement of practitioners and on peer exchanges within a shared scientific framework, proved to be the most effective.

AB  - Children affected by mental disorders are largely unrecognised and untreated across the world. Community resources, including the school system and teachers, are important elements in actions directed to promoting child mental health and preventing and treating mental disorders, especially in low- and middle-income countries. We developed a web-based program to educate primary school teachers on mental disorders in childhood and conducted a cluster-randomised controlled trial to test the effectiveness of the web-based program intervention in comparison with the same program based on text and video materials only and to a waiting-list control group. All nine schools of a single city in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, were randomised to the three groups, and teachers completed the educational programs during 3 weeks. Data were analysed according to complete cases and intention-to-treat approaches. In terms of gains of knowledge about mental disorders, the web-based program intervention )

AB  - The present study investigated the effect of professional development (PD) on preschool teachers' conversational responsivity in the classroom, defined as teachers' use of strategies to promote children's participation in extended conversational exchanges (communication-facilitating strategies) and exposure to advanced linguistic models (language-developing strategies), and the resultant impact on proximal child language outcomes. We randomly-assigned 49 preschool teachers to receive 15-20 h of such PD (PD; n = 25) or to a comparison condition (n = 24). Growth curve analysis indicated that trained teachers used significantly more communication-facilitating strategies across the year but no such difference for language-developing strategies. Moreover, children in these classrooms showed greater linguistic productivity and complexity in their talk. These findings suggest that PD may alter some aspects of teachers' conservational responsivity responsible for increasing the amount and complexity of child language. Alteration of some strategies, however, may require more intensive PD efforts. [Copyright Elsevier B.V.]

AB  - A professional development model was designed for and is being tested in approximately fifty U.S. middle schools in five large urban districts, with half in each district randomly assigned to receive the two-year treatment. Each school forms a mathematics/science leadership team of five to seven members, including at least one administrator. Teams receive professional development in district- level workshops, then work with all math and science teachers in their school. The core idea is to provide teachers with data on their instructional practices and student achievement, then teach them how to use that data to improve their effectiveness. This article documents the successes and failures of treatment implementation and the collection of baseline and outcome data. The focus is on learning about doing place-based randomized trials to test the efficacy of education programs. At the time of this writing, treatment is not yet complete and study results are not available. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

Differential effects of technologically mediated (remote) versus in-person (on-site) delivery of individualized coaching with teachers also were examined in a random assignment design. Hierarchical linear model analyses revealed positive PD intervention effects on general classroom environment (d = 0.99) and classroom supports for early literacy and language development (d = 0.92), and on children's letter knowledge (d = 0.29), blending skills (d = 0.18), writing (d = 0.17), and concepts about print (d = 0.22). No significant intervention effects on teaching practices and children's outcomes related to oral language were found. There were no differential effects of remote versus on-site delivery of literacy coaching. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

In this first article we describe the experimental intervention, the Arbitration Intervention Worker (AIW) service, which was provided to a randomly selected half of the research sample. Our description of the intervention includes an overview of the legal context in which the service was provided, the conceptual foundation for the intervention in Systems Theory, elements of the model emulated in operationalizing the service, phases of the service, issues in staff recruitment and training, and clinical and administrative supervision of AIW case workers. Subsequent articles in this issue describe empirical findings from the clinical trial.

AB  - The overall purpose of this IES-funded Goal 3 study, now entering its third year, is to evaluate the efficacy of Incredible Years Teacher program (IYT) for improving K-2 students' academic achievement, attention, and social-emotional competence. The authors will also examine the extent to which classroom behavior mediates the relationship between teacher management skills and students' academic performance in the classroom. The current poster, based upon teacher data from the first two cohorts, will present preliminary data on whether participation in IYT is associated with change over time in the classroom environment and quality of teacher interactions with students for trained teachers as compared to wait-list control teachers. Data include the CLASS (Pianta & Hamre, 2005) and the Teacher coder Impressions Inventory (TCI; Webster-Stratton, Reid, & Hammond, 2001), which are based on blind observer ratings. The CLASS is a multi-dimensional standardized instrument that has been widely used in early education classrooms and has been associated with gains in students' achievement and social adjustment. The TCI was developed to align more closely with the intervention and has been used primarily in research on the efficacy of IYT. (Contains 2 tables and 3 figures.)

AB  - We evaluated the effects of a research-based model for scaling up educational interventions on teachers’ practices in preschool mathematics. The original participants were from 106 classrooms for 4-year-olds in two distal city districts serving lowresource communities, with 42 schools randomly assigned to one of three groups, of which the two treatment groups were the same throughout preschool (thus, there were 72 treatment classrooms). The intervention, a professional development program based on young children’s mathematical learning trajectories, had a substantial positive effect on teachers’ instructional practices, some of which mediated student outcomes. Teachers also demonstrated sustained levels of fidelity as long as six years after the end of the intervention. Notable is these teachers’ encouragement and support for discussions of mathematics and their use of formative assessment. Finally, teachers taught the curriculum with increasing fidelity over the following six years without support from the project.

AB  - In a common approach for scaling up effective educational practice, schools adopt evidence-based programs to be implemented with fidelity. An alternative approach assumes that programs should be adapted to local contexts. In this randomized trial of a reading intervention, we study a scaffolded sequence of implementation in which schools first develop proficiency by implementing the program with fidelity before implementing structured adaptations. We find evidence supporting the scaffolded sequence: A fidelity-focused approach promoted learning and instructional change more so for teachers inexperienced with the intervention, while a structured adaptive approach was more effective for teachers experienced with the intervention. Students benefited more from the structured adaptive approach but only when their teacher had prior experience with the fidelity-focused version.

AB  - The present study evaluated the efficacy of a multicomponent, classroom-based intervention in reducing preschoolers' behavior problems. The Chicago School Readiness Project model was implemented in 35 Head Start classrooms using a clustered-randomized controlled trial design. Results indicate significant treatment effects (ds = 0.53-0.89) for teacher-reported and independent observations of children's internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Moreover, there was some evidence for the moderating role of child gender, race/ethnic group membership, and exposure to poverty-related risk, with stronger effects of intervention for some groups of children than for others. Findings contribute to a growing area of research on poverty and preventive intervention in early childhood. [Copyright American Psychological Association]

AB  - Pre-school education has been greatly expanded in the United Kingdom in the last two decades and further expansion is planned. Its provision allows parents to take up employment thus increasing family incomes and it is expected to narrow the gap between socially disadvantaged children and their peers. The latter is important as studies have shown that many children start school with poor language skills which threaten their attainment. Studies of the effects of pre-school education on the progress of disadvantaged children have shown inconsistent results and nurseries have been criticised by Ofsted for failing to prepare children for school entry. Nurseries and their staff have been found to vary in quality and in the level of qualifications they have. The provision of evidence based programmes which nursery staff may be trained to use may represent one means of improving their ability and improving the outcomes for pre-school children. We report an effectiveness study of Early Talk Boost a programme for use by nursery staff to improve language skills in three year olds. Nurseries were randomly assigned to use the programme or to act as waiting controls (who received the intervention in the following term). Children were assessed before and three months later after the completion of the programme. The progress of treated and control children differed significantly. Age equivalent scores showed treated children had gained 4.93 months, control children had gained only 2.33 months. We conclude that Early Talk Boost can be effective in advancing the language skills of socially disadvantaged children and improve their school readiness. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This paper presents 2-year follow-up data for a sample of 159,4- to 7-year-old children with oppositional-defiant disorder (ODD) who were randomly assigned to: parent training (PT), parent plus teacher training (PT + TT), child training (CT), child plus teacher training (CT + TT), parent plus child plus teacher training (PT + CT + TT). At the 2-year follow-up, approximately 75% of children were functioning in the normal range according to parent and teacher reports. Twenty-five percent of children were classified as treatment nonresponders at home and/or at school. Teacher training added significantly to long-term school outcomes for children who had pervasive behavior problems. Baseline, post, and 1-year follow-up parenting practices distinguished between home treatment responders and nonresponders (parents of nonresponders were more critical and less positive). For children with baseline pervasive home-school problems, baseline maternal parenting and posttreatment marital discord were associated with poor treatment response at home at the 2-year follow-up. In addition, 80% of pervasive children whose mothers were highly critical immediately posttreatment were classified as school nonresponders at the 2-year follow-up.

AB  - Background: Urban elementary schools in minority communities with high obesity prevalence may have limited resources for physical education (PE) to achieve daily activity recommendations. Little is known whether integrating physical activity (PA) into classrooms can increase activity levels of students attending such schools. Methods: We conducted a cluster randomized, controlled trial among kindergarten and first-grade students from four Bronx, New York, schools to determine feasibility and impact of a classroom-based intervention on students’ PA levels. Students in two intervention schools received the Children's Hospital at Montefiore Joining Academics and Movement (CHAM JAM), an audio CD consisting of 10-minute, education-focused aerobic activities led by teachers three times a day. PA was objectively measured by pedometer. Each subject wore a sealed pedometer during the 6-hour school day for 5 consecutive days at baseline (Time 1) and 8 weeks postintervention (Time 2). Hierarchical linear models were fit to evaluate differences in mean number of steps between the two groups. Results: A total of 988 students participated (intervention group, n = 500; control group, n = 488). There was no significant difference at baseline between the two groups on mean number of steps (2581 [standard deviation (SD), 1284] vs. 2476 [SD, 1180]; P = 0.71). Eight weeks post–CHAM JAM, intervention group students took significantly greater mean number of steps than controls (2839 [SD, 1262] vs. 2545 [SD, 1153]; P = 0.0048) after adjusting for baseline number of steps and other covariates (grade, gender, recess, and PE class). CHAM JAM was equally effective in gender, grade level, and BMI subgroups. Conclusions: CHAM JAM significantly increased school-based PA among kindergarten and first-grade students in inner-city schools. This approach holds promise as a cost-effective means to integrate the physical and cognitive benefits of PA into high-risk schools. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In the United States, recent prevention research has established the efficacy of some child sexual abuse prevention programmes targeting adults. However, less if know about the feasibility of implementing such programmes. This study investigated the feasibility and acceptability of a child sexual abuse prevention programme for child care professionals provided in two different formats: in person and web-based. The sample consisted of 188 child care professionals from a large-scale, multisite, randomised controlled trial in the United States. Findings suggested that both in-person and online training formats were feasible to implement and acceptable to professionals. When comparing format, the in-person format was favoured in terms of comfort level and likelihood of sharing information with others. These findings are significant for dissemination of child sexual abuse prevention programmes for child care professionals. Implications for practice education are discussed.

AB  - Background: Effective methods to prevent adolescent depressive symptoms could reduce suffering and burden across the lifespan. However, psychological interventions delivered to adolescents show efficacy only in symptomatic or high-risk youth. Targeting causal risk factors and assessing mechanistic change can help devise efficacious universal or classroom based prevention programs. Methods: A non-randomized longitudinal design was used to compare three classroom-based prevention programs for adolescent depression (Behavioral Activation with Reward Processing, 'Thinking about Reward in Young People' (TRY); Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT)), and determine cognitive mechanisms of change in these programs. Cognitive mechanisms examined were reward-seeking, negative self-beliefs (assessed with behavioral tasks) and over-general autobiographical memory. 256 healthy adolescents aged 13–14 participated with 236 (92%) and 227 (89%) completing the pre- and post-assessments. Results: TRY was the only intervention associated with a reduction in depressive symptoms at follow-up. Reward-seeking increased following TRY. In the other programs there were non-significant changes in cognitive mechanisms, with more reflective negative self-beliefs in CBT and fewer over-general autobiographical memories in MBCT In the TRY program, which focused on increasing sensitivity to rewarding activities, reward seeking increased and this was associated with decreased depressive symptoms. Limitations: Due to the infeasibility of a cluster randomized controlled trial, a non-randomized design was used. Conclusions: Increased reward-seeking was associated with decreased depressive symptoms and may be a mechanism of depressive symptom change in the intervention with a focus on enhancing sensitivity and awareness of reward. This study provides preliminary evidence to suggest that incorporating activities to enhance reward sensitivity may be fruitful in randomized controlled trials of universal prevention programs for depression.

AB  - Parent training (PT) has been documented as an effective intervention for early ADHD based on parental assessment, but documentation of transfer of its results outside the family context has been limited. Due to the cross-contextual impairments typically caused by ADHD, it has been proposed that PT in combination with an intervention in kindergarten or school based on systematic teacher training (TT) would be better suited. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a combination of PT and TT in a community sample of children with early ADHD problems. Families of 64 3-8-year old children were randomized to either PT alone with ``The Incredible Years{''} PT or to a combined PT + TT intervention. Moderate to large pre-post effect sizes on mother-reported outcomes were revealed in both groups, in line with those generally reported in the literature on PT interventions for early ADHD. With an n of 64, the current study was powered to detect superiority of the PT + TT intervention if the difference was of a moderate effect size (Cohen's d = 0.5). There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups on any of the outcome measures as rated by parents or teachers. In conclusion, the study did not provide support for the combined PT + TT intervention for early ADHD problems as a superior intervention in comparison with PT alone.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of an online format of instruction versus a face-to-face format of instruction in order to determine which format of instruction is most effective in educating teachers to work with students with autism spectrum disorders. Given the current rise in students with autism being served in public schools, their unique learning needs, and the chronic shortage of special education teachers, there is a need for universities and districts to identify additional ways to be able to effectively train teachers to meet the unique needs of this population of students. A review of literature revealed that the numbers of children being identified with autism and served in school districts across the country, and Missouri, continues to rise at an alarming rate. Consequently, there is a need for schools to ensure that appropriate educational services are provided for this population (Feinberg & Vacca, 2000; Simpson, 2004). It is well documented that the unique learning characteristics of this population of students differ greatly from other learners requiring teachers to possess specialized skills in order to adequately meet their needs (Simpson, 2005). Identifying additional avenues for training teachers to work with these students is critical. With the growing number of online education programs, there is an increasing need for scientific studies that evaluate the efficacy of online courses, both on their own, and as they compare to traditional classroom courses. Research on the satisfaction and achievement of students in online versus face-to-face courses has produced mixed results: some findings suggest that students in online course are not as successful or not as satisfied with their courses as students in face-to-face courses and others suggest that online students perform just as well or better than students in face-to-face classes. There are few studies that look at the relationship and variables between these two formats of instruction for training teachers to effectively work with students with autism spectrum disorders (Weissman, et al., 2004) Students participating in this study were enrolled in the pilot course as part of a series of 6 graduate courses in the area of autism being offered for the first time at a university in Missouri. State approval for the program was not obtained until shortly after the course began, and enrollment in the courses was limited and expectedly low. A pre and post survey instrument, the General Competencies in Autism Spectrum Disorders, was developed, and completed by both groups of students before the course began, and then immediately following the completion of the course. Students were asked to complete a Likert-scale format of items to rate their own knowledge and skill level in various areas of general knowledge in autism spectrum disorders. In addition, students participating in each format of instruction completed a survey relative to their particular format of instruction to identify variables they considered beneficial to their particular format of instruction as well as barriers. The results of this study have important implications for designing the remaining courses in the program, as well as additional personnel preparation initiatives for current and future special educators at the university and in the field of autism. The need for additional, effective teachers to work with students with autism is clear. Is an online format of instruction an effective way to reach more educators? Can individuals who participate in these types of learning formats obtain the necessary skills to be able to transfer what they have learned to work effectively with students with autism?

AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of a six-months' nutrition program, delivered and taught by classroom teachers with in-service nutrition training, on the prevention of overweight and obesity among children in grades 1 to 4. In this randomized trial, four hundred and sixty four children from seven elementary schools were allocated to a nutrition educational program delivered by their own teachers. Intervened teachers had 12 sessions of three hours each with the researchers throughout six months, according to the topics nutrition and healthy eating, the importance of drinking water and healthy cooking activities. After each session, teachers were encouraged to develop activities in class focused on the learned topics. Sociodemographic, anthropometric, dietary, and physical activity assessments were performed at baseline and at the end of the intervention. In the intervention group the increase in Body Mass Index (BMI) z-score was significantly lower than in the control group (p = 0.009); fewer proportion of children became overweight in the intervened group compared with the control (5.6% vs. 18.4%; p = 0.037). Our study provides further support to decrease the overweight epidemic, involving classroom teachers in a training program and making them dedicated interventionists.

AB  - Objective. To examine the effects of an intervention program held by teachers previously trained in nutrition, on the consumption of low nutrient, energy-dense (WED) foods, of children attending elementary schools. Method. 464 children (239 female, 6 to 12 years) from seven elementary Portuguese schools participated in this randomized trial. Three schools were allocated to the intervention, and four to the control group. The intervention program was based on the Health Promotion Model and social cognitive theory. Teachers previously trained by researchers in nutrition and healthy eating implemented the intervention in the classroom from November 2008 to March 2009. Sociodemographic, anthropometric, physical activity, and dietary assessments were performed before (2007/2008) and at the end of the intervention (2009). Dietary intake was gathered by a 24-hour dietary recall and two groups of LNED foods were defined, namely SSBs and solid LNED foods. Results. Children from intervention group reported a reduction whereas the control group reported an increase in solid LNED foods consumption. The odds of increasing solid LNED foods consumption was 0.48, 95%CI (0.24, 0.95) in the intervention schools. Conclusion. Our study provides further support for the success of intervention programs aimed at limiting the consumption of solid LNED foods in children. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - We designed a professional development (PD) program to increase the teacher efficacy of mathematics teachers. We randomly assigned 106 Grade 6 teachers in 1 school district to treatment and control conditions in a delayed-treatment design. The PD explicitly addressed 4 sources of teacher-efficacy information identified in social-cognition theory (Bandura, 1997). Treatment teachers outperformed control-group teachers on 3 measures of teacher efficacy, but results were statistically significant only for efficacy for classroom management. We attributed the teacher-efficacy effects of the PD (6% of the variance) to the priority given in the PD to management of classroom discussions and overt attempts by PD leaders to redefine teacher conceptions of classroom success.

AB  - In the introduction is shown that no controlled studies of teacher training programs in children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) have been published in German research literature as yet in spite of high demand for educational inservice training. The aim of the present study is the development and evaluation of a two-step ADHD teacher group training. In step 1 a group training (12h) was performed with 18 advisory teachers. The curriculum included ADHD theory, contingency management and 'antecedent', TEACCH-oriented school-based interventions (Schopler 1997; Bregman and Gerdtz 1997). In step 2 then a subsample of 6 advisory teachers supervised 10 classroom teachers of 11 primary school students (mean age 8.6 yrs.) with ADHD symptoms, who were assigned to two experimental groups. The classroom teachers of the Standard Treatment Group (n = 5 students) received the basic module 'ADHD theory and school-based interventions' (6h), the teachers of the Intensive Treatment Group (n = 6 students) received the same basic module plus the module 'Student-related training in Contingency Management' (in total 14h). The group training process was evaluated by teacher satisfaction ratings and knowledge test. The training effect on student behavior was evaluated by teacher ratings within a two-group-pre-post-follow-up design. The main results are: (a) The group training process was mostly evaluated favorably; knowledge increased significantly; (b) ADHD symptoms were reduced significantly in both treatment groups, with stronger and sustained improvement of problem behaviors and adaptive functioning in the Intensive Treatment Group. These findings provide some consistent evidence, that classroom behaviors of children with ADHD symptoms can be improved substantially by a teacher mediator training approach.

AB  - The current study assessed the effectiveness of Teacher Child Interaction Training (TCIT), an adaptation of Eyberg's Parent Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT), on teacher and child behaviors in preschool and kindergarten classrooms. The sample included four classrooms in urban, socioeconomically disadvantaged and culturally diverse settings. Two preschool classrooms were included in the first study and one preschool and one kindergarten classroom were included in the second study. Both studies used a concurrent multiple baseline design to evaluate the effects of training and coaching on teacher and child behaviors in the classroom. The intervention focused on the development of a friendly attachment relationship, the strategic application of differential social attention and the use of careful discipline, including a 'sit-and-watch' timeout procedure for the most challenging inappropriate behavior in the classroom. Teacher and child behavior changes were measured through observations and clinical ratings. Visual analyses of the graphs indicated teachers increased their skills and children decreased their disruptive behavior. Repeated measures ANOVA's and follow up t-tests indicated changes in increases in protective factors and decreases in maladaptive factors.

AB  - Experimental studies within the education field are rare. The current study used a random effects meta-analytic approach to examine the effectiveness of a teacher expectation intervention across different schools, grade levels, socioeconomic levels, ethnicities, and gender in terms of student mathematics achievement Teachers were randomly assigned to intervention and control groups, and through professional development workshops were trained in the practices of teachers who have high expectations for all students. The intervention related to three key areas: grouping and learning experiences, class climate, and goal setting. No matter which grouping variables were employed in the random effects meta-analyses, effect sizes in mathematics achievement for the students whose teachers were part of the intervention group compared with students with control group teachers were large, ranging from r = 0.61-0.87. The usefulness of the instructional strategies that formed the basis of the intervention is discussed in light of the relevant literature and the educational implications are presented.

AB  - The MathsFlip intervention aimed to improve the attainment of pupils in Years 5 and 6. The programme, developed by Shireland Collegiate Academy, used a 'flipped learning' approach involving pupils learning core content online, outside of class time, and then participating in activities in class to reinforce their learning. The programme used an online learning environment which provided teachers and pupils with resources for learning mathematics outside the classroom, allowed collaborative communication between colleagues and pupils, and provided information to teachers on pupils' progress prior to planning and teaching a lesson. Staff from Shireland trained Year 5 teachers from 12 primary schools in the West Midlands over two days and provided some ongoing support. The project was a randomised controlled trial involving 24 schools: 12 schools received the intervention from April 2014 until April 2015 using MathsFlip to deliver lessons at the start of a new maths topic for the cohort of pupils in Year 5; 12 schools acted as control schools delivering maths lessons in the usual way. Impact was measured using pupils' Key Stage 2 (KS2) maths scores in summer 2015. The process evaluation involved lesson observations and collecting teachers' and pupils' perceptions of the programme through interviews with staff, focus groups, and online teacher surveys. Among the key findings were: (1) Children in MathsFlip schools made the equivalent of one additional months' progress in maths, on average, compared to children in comparison schools; (2) The impact on maths was slightly higher for children eligible for free school meals ('FSM pupils') than for all children in the trial; and (3) The majority of teachers in the trial were very positive about the flipped learning approach and the technical and professional support they received from Shireland staff.

AB  - The success in prevention and intervention on bullying requires awareness about the problem. The goal of this study is to determine the relationship between the level of bullying awareness and the application of the 'Bully Busters Program, a Teacher's Manual'. 150 pre-school teacher students from Guatemala City participated. To assess the effectiveness of the program, the Teacher Inventory of Skills and Knowledge (TISK) test was used. A pre/post-test reversed-treatment control group sequence of tests was done. Paired sample 't-tests' for independent groups were employed. TISK results indicate differences between the media of both groups. The findings indicate a relationship between bullying awareness and the application of the program, since the students exposed to the program, increased their awareness from the initial level and compared to a control group. In order to detect and prevent episode of violence in the classroom, the study concludes the need to include bullying awareness training in the teacher study curriculum.

AB  - The effect of a 15- to 24-month in-service professional development (PD) program on state accountability mathematics test scores for middle school students was examined using a quasi-experimental design. Middle level mathematics teachers (n = 128) from 7 school districts and 64 middle schools volunteered for a PD sequence of content-oriented summer courses and pedagogy-oriented structured follow-up experiences during the subsequent academic year. Student effects of the PD program were measured using Colorado's state mathematics test results for 2 cohorts of students: 1 that received mathematics instruction from participant teachers in the year prior to the PD and another cohort that received mathematics instruction in the year following the PD. The odds of a student achieving a Proficient or Advanced score on the state test were then compared between cohorts. Results showed that student' odds of achieving a score of Proficient or better increased with teacher participation in the PD program. (Contains 5 tables.)

AB  - Framed within Self-Determination Theory, the purpose of the present study was to test the effects of a training program with physical education (PE) teachers. Participants were 21 high school PE teachers (experimental group, n = 10; control group, n = 11), and their 836 students, aged 12 to 16 years. Teachers in the experimental group received a training program consisting of strategies to support autonomy, competence, and relatedness need satisfaction. A repeated measures ANCOVA was carried out for each dependent variable. After the intervention, students in the experimental group significantly increased their scores on autonomy support, relatedness support, autonomy satisfaction, autonomous motivation, controlled motivation, and intention to be physically active, as compared to the control group. These findings emphasize the utility of a training program with PE teachers to promote the students' psychological need satisfaction, and hence, self-determined motivation toward PE classes.

AB  - The present study examines the extent to which participation in a 14-week professional development course designed to improve teacher-child interactions in the classroom moderated the relation between teacher-reported job stress and gains in observed teacher-child interaction quality from the beginning to the end of the intervention. Participants were preschool teachers (N = 427; M age = 42) with an average of 11 years of experience teaching. Teachers reported how intensely they experienced different sources of stress at pre-test only (i.e., prior to being randomized into the treatment condition [course or control]). Teacher-child interactions were measured through classroom observations at pre and post intervention. Results demonstrated that control teachers reporting higher professional investment stress showed fewer gains in observed emotional support relative to control teachers experiencing less professional investment stress. These findings were not evident for teachers in the course condition. Interestingly, teachers with higher professional investment stress showed fewer gains in instructional support in the control condition and greater gains in the course condition, relative to teachers in their respective treatment groups who reported lower levels of professional investment stress. Findings suggest that participation in the professional development intervention had a buffering effect on the negative association between professional investment stress and emotional support. With regard to instructional support, it is possible that teachers' heightened awareness and anxiety over their need to develop professionally may have made them more responsive to an intervention designed to improve practice.

AB  - The present study aims to challenge primary school science teachers' beliefs about education and teaching efficacy, as well as their teaching practices, through a video-case-based intervention programme in a Chinese educational setting. A total of 46 in-service teachers were involved in this study (experimental group = 23, control group = 23). Pre- and post-intervention surveys were administered to examine possible changes in the participants' beliefs about education and science teaching efficacy. Video data were gathered through classroom observations of 9 participants from the experimental group and 9 participants from the control group. The results of one-way analysis of covariance indicate that the reported post-intervention beliefs of teachers who participated in the programme differed significantly from their pre-intervention beliefs. More specifically, teachers in the experimental groups reported fewer traditional and more constructivist beliefs after the intervention, as well as stronger personal science teaching efficacy beliefs. One exception included beliefs about science teaching outcome expectancy. The video data showed that teaching practices became more constructivist in terms of both practical activities and student ICT use.

AB  - Introduction: Early intervention for childhood behavioural problems may help improve health and educational outcomes in affected children and reduce the likelihood of developing additional difficulties. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a common childhood behavioural disorder, recommend a stepped care approach for the identification and management of these problems. Parents of children with high levels of hyperactivity and inattention may benefit from intervention programmes involving behavioural management and educational approaches. Such interventions may be further enhanced by providing training and feedback to teachers about the strategies discussed with parents. In relation to children with high levels of hyperactivity, impulsiveness and inattention, we aim to test the feasibility and effectiveness of a parenting programme (with and without an accompanying teacher session) in primary schools. Methods and analysis: This clustered (at the level of school) randomised controlled trial (RCT) focuses on children in their first four school years (ages 4-8 years) in the East Midlands area of England. Parents will complete a screening measure, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, to identify children with high levels of hyperactivity/inattention. Three approaches to reducing hyperactivity and attention problems will be compared: a group programme for parents (parent-only intervention); group programme for parents combined with feedback to teachers (combined intervention); and waiting list control (no intervention). Differences between arms on the short version of Conners' Parent and Teacher Rating Scales Revised will be compared and also used to inform the sample size required for a future definitive cluster RCT. A preliminary cost-effectiveness analysis will also be conducted. Ethics and dissemination: The outcomes of this study will inform policy makers about the feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness of delivering targeted behavioural interventions within a school setting. The study has received ethical approval from the University of Nottingham Medical School Ethics Committee.

AB  - In recent years, the UK, like many other English first-language-speaking countries, has encountered a steady and continuous increase in the numbers of non-native English-speaking learners entering state primary and secondary schools. A significant proportion of these learners has specific language and subject learning needs, many of which can only be addressed by: (a) specialized teacher training courses and (b) the use of academically appropriate, context- and language-specific materials. At present, such materials are largely non-existent for use in primary school contexts across the country. This article addresses this gap and proposes a set of innovative classroom-based and take-home materials aiming to support the teaching and learning of science at Key Stage 2 of the English National Curriculum. The materials were developed as part of an intervention research project conducted over a period of 24 months (2013-2015) in four state primary schools in Sheffield with a varied density of English non-native-speaking learners. The materials were piloted with nearly 400 learners over a period of 10 months; the teachers were trained in using the materials prior to their trial. In this paper core features of the materials will be highlighted and their main functions discussed. Specific emphasis will be put on the following aspects: (a) support for language development, (b) support for subject knowledge development, (c) use of the first language in learning through the medium of a second language, (d) development of learner autonomy, and (e) promoting learning outside the classroom--making use of parental resources. The article will also argue that the proposed materials can be used equally effectively with non-native and native English-speaking learners.

AB  - This study examined the effectiveness of two tiers of intervention for preventing early reading difficulties among kindergarten children who qualified as at risk of experiencing difficulty in the early stages of learning to read. Participating schools were randomly assigned to one of three treatment conditions: Professional Development for classroom teachers which served as a Tier 1 intervention, small group supplemental Intervention for children which served as a Tier 2 intervention, or both Professional Development for teachers and direct intervention for children. Three cohorts of children were followed from the beginning of kindergarten to the beginning of first grade. The first cohort served as a Baseline Cohort. The experimental treatments were instituted for the second cohort (Implementation Cohort). The third cohort served as a Maintenance Cohort which allowed us to evaluate whether effects of PD were still evident in the year following the implementation of the PD program. Data were gathered on both student achievement and classroom language arts instruction for each cohort. Outcomes suggested that all three treatments were very effective in reducing the number of at risk kindergartners who remained at risk for reading difficulties at the end of the school year although differences in the effectiveness of classroom instruction observed for the Baseline Cohort made it difficult to confidently compare the relative effectiveness of the three treatment conditions. However, comparisons between the Baseline and Maintenance Cohorts clearly revealed characteristics of classroom instruction that were associated with reductions in the number of children who qualified as at risk for reading difficulties at the beginning of first grade.

AB  - Examined the impact on students of a long-term professional development intervention in mathematics for teachers in a low-wealth, urban school district. The emphasis in this assessment design was on obtaining a more accurate picture of student's problem-solving performance, which encouraged raising expectations about student success from improved standardized test score data to an approach that focused on the way students think about mathematical tasks. The design used in this assessment provides a framework for considering teacher development and student assessment simultaneously. Results show that students taught by project teachers performed better in both classroom problem-solving activities and task-based interviews than students taught by nonproject teachers. In addition, there were major differences in the problem-solving behaviors of the two groups. Experimental students (students of project teachers) displayed greater mathematical confidence, and were more likely to see mathematics as a powerful way of thinking about the real world and approach mathematics as such.

AB  - The literature provides solid documentation of the negative consequences of poor psychosocial functioning and behavioral problems in early childhood. Children facing economic disadvantage are at higher risk for poor socio-emotional development and problem behaviors, which draws attention to the need for prevention targeted at this risk group. The aim of our study was to analyze the impact of an evidence-based teacher-training program, the Incredible Years Teacher Classroom Management (IY-TCM), on the behavior of economically disadvantaged Portuguese children. Participants were 1030 children aged 3-6 years, from 65 preschool classrooms selected for their high percentage of children from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. The study followed an experimental randomized controlled between-group design, with pre- and post-intervention assessments. Teachers in the experimental group attended the IY-TCM program, implemented in six monthly workshops, and four sessions of individual in-class support. Children outcomes were evaluated with the Preschool and Kindergarten Behavior Scales—2nd Edition (Social Skills and Problem Behavior scales). After the intervention, preschoolers in the IY-TCM classrooms showed more improvements in their social skills and more decreases in problem behavior. Children with lower levels of social skills (high risk) at pre-intervention and those coming from families in economic need showed greater improvements in social skills, but these effects were not observed for problem behavior. Results support the growing evidence of the effectiveness of the IY-TCM as a stand-alone, non-adapted program in a Portuguese cultural context, which can play a protective role in children’s lives and thus bridge the gap between children coming from different economic backgrounds.

AB  - Purpose - Involvement of parents/carers may increase effectiveness of primary school-based alcohol-misuse prevention projects through strengthening family-based protective factors, but rates of parental engagement are typically low. This paper reports findings from an exploratory trial of a school-based prevention intervention - Kids, Adults Together (KAT), based on the Social Development Model, which aimed to promote pro-social family communication in order to prevent alcohol misuse, and incorporated strategies to engage parents/carers. The purpose of this paper is to assess the feasibility and value of conducting an effectiveness trial of KAT. Design/methodology/approach - The study was a parallel-group cluster randomised exploratory trial with an embedded process evaluation. The study took place in south Wales, UK, and involved nine primary schools, 367 pupils in Years 5/6 (aged 9-11 years) and their parents/carers and teachers. Questionnaires were completed by pupils at baseline and four month follow-up, and by parents at six month follow-up. Findings - Overall KAT was delivered with good fidelity, but two of five intervention schools withdrew from the study without completing implementation. In total, 50 per cent of eligible parents participated in the intervention, and KAT had good acceptability among pupils, parents and teachers. However, a number of "progression to effectiveness trial" criteria were not met. Intermediate outcomes on family communication (hypothesised to prevent alcohol misuse) showed insufficient evidence of an intervention effect. Difficulties were encountered in identifying age appropriate outcome measures for primary school-age children, particularly in relation to family communication processes. The study was unable to find comprehensive methodological guidance on exploratory trials. Research limitations/implications - It would not be appropriate to conduct an effectiveness trial as key progression criteria relating to intervention and trial feasibility were not met. There is a need for new measures of family communication which are suitable for primary school-age children, and more guidance on the design and conduct of exploratory/feasibility trials. Originality/value - KAT achieved high rates of parental involvement, and its theoretical framework and processes could be adapted by other interventions which experience difficulties with recruitment of parents/carers.

AB  - We present an inquiry-based, aquatic science professional development (PD) for upper-elementary, middle, and high school teachers and examine changes in student outcomes in light of participating teachers' characteristics and the grade band of the students. Our study lends support to the assertion that inquiry- and content-focused PD, paired with classroom implementation, can effectively improve student learning. Our findings indicate that students improved in their nature of science (NOS) and aquatic science content knowledge and that these changes depended in some ways on the participating teachers' characteristics and adherence to the program. The students' improvements were amplified when their teachers adhered more closely to the PD activities during their classroom implementation. The teachers' previous science PD experience and pre-PD understanding of inquiry-based teaching also explained some of the variability in student growth. In both NOS and content, students of teachers with less prior science-PD experience benefited more. Grade band also explained variation in student outcomes through interactions with teacher-characteristic variables. In high school, students of teachers with lower pre-PD inquiry knowledge appeared to learn more about NOS. Our results suggest that inquiry and content training through PD may minimize disparities in teaching due to inexperience and lack of expertise. Our study also demonstrates the value of PD that teaches a flexible approach to inquiry and focuses on underrepresented, interdisciplinary content areas, like aquatic science.

AB  - Over the past several years, research on school improvement and professional development has identified a consistent message in regard to the most effective ways to improve student achievement. Collaborative Literacy Intervention Program (CLIP) can be regarded as a more effective way to reach students who were having difficulty in reading. By examining average classroom test scores, this study provides some quantitative evidence regarding the use of CLIP as a professional development tool. The quantitative analysis includes data from two classroom teachers in Tehran, Iran. First, teachers self-selected to be involved in the CLIP training and each teacher had an equal opportunity to participate. Then, four classes were selected as the participants. In general, 65 students in all four classes taught by the two teachers selected for the purpose of this study. Based on PET proficiency test, those placed between one standard deviation above and below the mean were selected. Finally, 38 students were selected as the main participants, 20 for the experimental group taught based on CLIP and 18 for the control group. The TOEFL proficiency test was used as the pretest and posttest for all selected participants. Then, average classroom test scores of students in the class taught based on CLIP training were compared with the class taught without using CLIP training. The results of data analysis indicate that there was a statistically significant difference between the students’ performance in experimental and control group in the results of pretest and posttest. In other words, CLIP training played a significant role in developing the students’ performance in reading, grammar and vocabulary. In conclusion, this study showed that training teachers through CLIP is a suitable pedagogical approach to promote language skills.

AB  - This study investigates the impact of a professional development program that included two distinct components: strategies for infusing student-talk into grade-level lessons in science and mathematics; and school-level learning communities focused on readings and discussions of student-talk research. This article reports the program's impact on longitudinal school-level outcomes in a high-minority, low-socioeconomic school district in the United States. Data include the English Language Arts and Mathematics California Standards Test scores for second-grade students before the professional development began and at the end of each program year. Based on linear regressions that cluster standard errors at the school level, the findings show greater increases in Test scores for English learners (and all students) in participating schools than in non-participating schools. The results suggest that professional development which integrates language with content and focuses on school-level collaboration is a potential model for addressing needs of English learners.

AB  - The results of a large-scale randomized controlled trial of Conjoint Behavioral Consultation (CBC) on student outcomes and teacher-parent relationships in rural schools are presented. CBC is an indirect service delivery model that addresses concerns shared by teachers and parents about students. In the present study, the intervention was aimed at promoting positive school-related social-behavioral skills and strengthening teacher-parent relationships in rural schools. Participants were 267 students in grades K-3, their parents, and 152 teachers in 45 Midwest rural schools. Results revealed that, on average, improvement among students whose parents and teachers experienced CBC significantly outpaced that of control students in their teacher-reported school problems and observational measures of their inappropriate (off-task and motor activity) and appropriate (on-task and social interactions) classroom behavior. In addition, teacher responses indicated significantly different rates of improvement in their relationship with parents in favor of the CBC group. Finally, the teacher-parent relationship was found to partially mediate effects of CBC on several student outcomes. Unique contributions of this study, implications of findings for rural students, study limitations and suggestions for future research are discussed.

AB  - The transportability of an evidence-based teacher professional development program, the Incredible Years Classroom Management Program, was evaluated. This study compared the impact of two training methods: self-administered videotape modeling (VM) and self-administered videotape modeling plus consultation (VMC) on teachers' use of classroom management strategies, reductions in disruptive behaviors, acceptability, and contextual barriers of sustaining EBIs in practice settings. Four pairs of teachers (N = 8) were randomly assigned to VM or VMC conditions in a multiple probe design. Students (1-2 per classroom; N = 13) displaying high levels of externalizing problems also participated. Statistically significant between-groups differences in teacher confidence ratings, use of positive instructional practices, and acceptability favored the VMC condition. Positive trends favoring VMC students, including clinically significant increases in social competence, were also found. Although students in both groups exhibited reductions in disruptive behaviors, significant between-groups differences related to disruptive behavior were not observed. Findings related to contextual variables (e.g., time, cost, institutional support, adaptability of the program) have implications for future adoption of this program.

AB  - Success for All is a comprehensive reform model that uses cooperative learning, tutoring, family support services, and extensive professional development to help high-poverty schools succeed with their students. This article reviews research on Success for All with African American students, focusing on evidence that Success for All reduces the achievement gap between African American and White students. More than 40 studies, including a national randomized experiment, have found positive effects of Success for All in schools serving many African Americans. Implications of these findings for policy and practice are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - To add to the emerging early intervention research on universal supports for children, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of an intervention designed to increase teachers’ use of two universal behavioral supports on target children’s behavior. The children targeted for this study were at elevated risk for problem behavior according to teachers’ nominations and ratings. Three teachers in Head Start settings were selected to participate in this study. The Multi Option Observation System for Experimental Studies coding system was used to collect data on teacher and student behavior. The intervention included providing teachers with specific instruction in implementing precorrective statements and behavior-specific praise statements and then, after the intervention sessions, providing feedback on implementation. A multiple-baseline design was used, and baseline, intervention, and maintenance data were collected. Results indicate that teachers increased their use of the targeted universal supports and a functional relationship was observed between this increase and improvement in children’s behavior. Maintenance data were also promising. The implications and limitations of this study are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This systematic literature review addresses 20 years of intervention research conducted between 1990 and 2010 in which adults in any role serving preschoolers with or without delays or disabilities were taught skills applicable to children in classroom settings. Acceptable inter-observer agreement was reported for (a) the criteria for including research articles in this review and (b) the article content items. Review findings summarised the (a) characteristics of preschool staff, children, and settings, (b) professional development training topics and methods of training, and (c) research characteristics and findings. The 69 studies in this database lend credibility to the use of professional development to improve classroom-related skills in preschool teachers and staff. Most of these studies included professional development methods that have been identified as being indicators of effectiveness: modelling, demonstration by instructors, and feedback to participants both during workshops and classroom-based interventions.

AB  - We conducted a randomized controlled potential efficacy trial to examine effects of two variants of the Tools for Teachers (TfT) professional development (PD) intervention on preschool teachers' implementation of embedded instruction practices and children's developmental and learning outcomes. Thirty-six preschool teachers recruited from three school districts were randomly assigned within each district to one of three PD conditions. Preschool children with disabilities (N = 106) from enrolled teachers' classrooms participated in the study. Results showed that, compared with business-as-usual PD teachers, teachers who received either PD intervention wrote higher-quality learning targets for study children. Teachers who received the PD intervention that included on-site coaching implemented more embedded instruction learning trials compared to teachers in the other two conditions. Compared with children whose teachers participated in BAU PD, children whose teachers received either PD intervention had greater developmental and learning gains as measured by standardized assessments.

AB  - This intervention study examined teachers' use of verbal praise and reprimands as specific components of teacher behavior management that can promote children's development in schools. The impact of teacher praise and reprimands on children's development was examined in the context of a teacher-mediated, classroom intervention. The sample involved 570 children and 30 teachers from second grade classrooms in 15 primary schools. The Good Behavior Game was implemented in half of the classrooms based on random assignment within schools. Teacher behavior management (praise for appropriate behavior and reprimands for inappropriate behavior) was observed during regular classroom lessons. Hyperactive, disruptive, and withdrawn child behavior were assessed using teacher and peer reports, global self-concept and emotional engagement were assessed using child self-reports. All variables were assessed at the beginning (pre-test) and at the end (post-test) of the school year. Multilevel regression models accounted for the nested structure of the data. The results suggested positive effects of fewer reprimands and more praise on child outcomes (except emotional school engagement), although the results differed by informant. We also found indirect effects of the Good Behavior Game (GBG) on child outcomes via teacher praise and reprimands. Overall, the study suggests that teachers' use of praise and reprimands is a malleable classroom factor that influences children's behavioral and socio-emotional development.

AB  - Purpose: This study evaluated the efficacy of a collaborative intervention where a speech-language pathologist (SLP) trained mainstream secondary school teachers to make modifications to their oral and written instructional language. The trained teachers’ uptake of techniques in their whole-class teaching practices and the impact this had on the language abilities of students with language impairment (LI) were evaluated. Method: Two secondary schools were randomly assigned to either a trained or a control condition. A cohort of 13 teachers (7 trained and 6 control) and 43 Year 8 students with LI (21 trained and 22 control) were tested at pre, post, and follow-up times—teachers by structured interview and students by standardized spoken and written language assessments. Results: Significantly increased use of the language modification techniques by the trained teachers was observed when compared to the control group of untrained teachers, with this increased use maintained over time. Results from the trained group of students showed a significant improvement in written expression and listening comprehension relative to the control group of students. Conclusion: This randomized controlled trial is one of the first investigations to evaluate a collaborative intervention that links changes in mainstream secondary teachers’ instructional language practices with improvements in the language abilities of adolescents with LI.

AB  - Classroom practices believed to affect student motivation were assessed for 24 upper elementary school teachers during a unit on fractions. Two groups of mathematics ``reform-minded{''} teachers participated in professional development programs-in either an intensive intervention or an intervention involving primarily teacher support. A 3rd group of teachers implemented traditional, text-based instruction and was not involved in any intervention. For most practices assessed, the 2 reform-minded groups of teachers did not differ significantly from each other, but both differed from the traditional teachers. The reform-minded teachers emphasized effort, mastery, and understanding more; encouraged student autonomy more; and created a psychologically safer environment than the traditional teachers did. The teachers in the intensive intervention, which included training in motivation, made more accurate judgments of students' motivation than the other reform-minded teachers did. There was modest evidence that the teachers who had had only minimal training in reform-minded practices had negative effects on students' motivation (e.g., lower self-confidence and increased concerns about performance).

AB  - Children with social behavior problems need teachers who are prepared to use evidence-based interventions to increase their likelihood of success. However, it is clear that teachers do not feel prepared to support children in this area. One approach for supporting teachers in using more effective interventions for children with behavior needs is the use of coaching. The purpose of this review of the literature is to explore the research to date that specifically targets coaching teachers on the use of social behavior interventions to improve children’s social behavior outcomes. Criteria were established to increase the generalizability of the results of the review and 29 studies met inclusionary criteria. Of these studies, 86% documented positive findings and the remaining documented neutral findings. Only 31% of studies documented a measure of integrity for the coaching process. Main findings and implications for future research are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER], Copyright of )

In total, 177 intervention classroom children and 117 comparison classroom children participated. Children were similar on all measures at start. After 2 years, experimental class children were found to have made significantly greater improvement than their comparison cohorts on measures of cognitive, language, social, and problem behavior, and autism symptoms. Behavior at entry did not predict outcome nor did family socioeconomic status. The fidelity with which teachers implemented LEAP strategies did predict outcomes. Finally, social validity measurement showed that procedures and outcomes were favorably viewed by intervention class teachers. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]

AB  - The current project examined school readiness outcomes of children participating in a preschool professional development initiative, Winning Beginnings Learning Circles, which focused on school readiness and teacher professional development. Children were assessed on knowledge and understanding of school readiness concepts in the fall and spring of each school year, and outcomes were reported back to preschool staff to be incorporated into teaching strategies. Preschool teachers and administrators attended monthly professional development seminars that consisted of workshops in child development and social-emotional health, parent engagement, and use of data as evidence-based best practices. Preschool assessment data from the first 2 years of the project showed significant increases in average scores from pre- to post-assessment on school readiness, self/social awareness, and quantity subtests. Kindergarten assessment data indicated that children who remained in the project for at least one full year outperformed comparable peers and the average for the school district they attended as kindergartners. The results highlight the potential of professional development programs and the importance of teacher quality in promoting positive outcomes for preschool children.

AB  - A systematic review was conducted to identify and describe school-based prevention and early intervention programs for depression and to evaluate their effectiveness in reducing depressive symptoms. Forty-two randomised controlled trials, relating to 28 individual school-based programs, were identified through the Cochrane Library, PsycInfo and PubMed databases. A large proportion of the programs identified were based on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), and delivered by a mental health professional or graduate student over 8-12 sessions. Indicated programs, which targeted students exhibiting elevated levels of depression, were found to be the most effective, with effect sizes for all programs ranging from 0.21 to 1.40. Teacher program leaders and the employment of attention control conditions were associated with fewer significant effects. Further school-based research is required that involves the use of attention controls, long-term follow-ups and which focuses on the training and evaluation of sustainable program leaders, such as teachers.

AB  - Modern learning psychology places an emphasis on the ability of teachers to promote their students' social and emotional learning (SEL) and living a good life. Research on precisely how teachers promote SEL and well-being among their students, however, remains scarce. This study focused on evaluating the Lions Quest teaching workshop (LQ), which aims to improve the knowledge and skills of teachers in SEL and to promote a healthy and meaningful life among students. In total, 153 Finnish teachers participated in LQ. We compared these to 61 Finnish teachers who did not participate in the LQ training as well as a second comparison group consisting of 46 Finnish teachers to investigate the possible effects of pre-testing. We collected data from the intervention group before and after the training and from the first comparison group at approximately the same time points. Data from the second comparison group was collected only once. Using the repeated measures general linear model, we analyzed teachers' readiness to promote the LQ goals from two perspectives, namely from participants' experienced importance of those goals and their perceived competence in promoting them. In addition, we evaluated task values among participants. Teachers participating in LQ rated the goals as more important and relevant after receiving training. Furthermore, participants from the intervention group felt more competent in skills related to the LQ goals than the comparison groups. This study adds to both the theoretical and practical development of teachers' skills in contemporary contexts.

AB  - Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) can reduce teachers' stress. The purpose of this mixed-method study, conducted within the context of a randomized-control trial of an MBI for teachers, was to examine four potential ways by which the MBI reduced teacher stress, including by (1) increasing their efficacy for regulating emotion on the job; (2) improving their ways of coping with stress at work; (3) increasing their efficacy for forgiving colleagues and students at work following conflict, as well as the tendency to do so; and (4) increasing teachers' tendency to feel compassion for people generally, and for challenging students in particular. Public school teachers (n = 59) were randomized to an MBI or a waitlist control condition. They completed surveys at pre/post/follow-up and interviews at post-program designed to assess their coping with work stressors and their appraisals of their most challenging students. Survey data showed that efficacy beliefs and the tendency to forgive changed from pre/post for teachers in the MBI, and partially mediated reductions in stress from baseline to 4-month follow-up. Interview results showed a trend for teachers in the MBI to report more adaptive strategies for coping with job stress, and a tendency to evaluate challenging students in a more positive affective light. Implications for MBIs in teacher professional development are discussed.

AB  - This article describes the effects of an analysis-of-practice professional development (PD) program on elementary school students' (Grades 4-6) science outcomes. The study design was a cluster-randomized trial with an analysis sample of 77 schools, 144 teachers and 2,823 students. Forty-two schools were randomly assigned to treatment, (88.5hours) of integrated analysis-of-practice and content deepening PD (over the course of one year) while 35 schools were randomly assigned to receive an equal number of PD hours in science content deepening alone. Students' content knowledge, as measured by a project-specific test, was compared across treatment groups. The effect size for this comparison was 0.52 standard deviations in favor of students whose teachers participated in the PD that included analysis-of-practice. This effect compares favorably to that of other elementary school interventions whose effectiveness was studied with a narrowly focused outcome measure. Analysis of the demographics of the study schools suggests that the treatment effect could be relevant outside the local study context. Implications for future research include tests of mediation for teacher-level outcomes and efficacy tests of specific teaching strategies (intervention subcomponents).

AB  - "Teach For America" ("TFA") is a highly selective route to teacher certification that aims to place non-traditionally trained teachers in high-need public schools. The What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) identified seven studies of teachers trained through "TFA" that both fall within the scope of the Teacher Training, Evaluation, and Compensation topic area and meet WWC group design standards. The WWC considers the extent of evidence for teachers trained through "TFA" on the academic achievement of students in grades pre-K-12 to be medium to large for two student outcome domains--mathematics achievement and English language arts achievement--and small for two student outcome domains--science achievement and social studies achievement. "TFA" teachers were found to have positive effects on mathematics achievement, potentially positive effects on science achievement, and no discernible effects on social studies achievement and English language arts achievement for students in grades pre-K-12. The WWC identified 24 eligible studies that investigated the effects of TFA teachers on the academic achievement of students in elementary, middle, and high school. Three studies are randomized controlled trials that meet WWC group design standards without reservations, and four studies use quasi-experimental designs that meet WWC group design standards with reservations. The three studies the meet WWC group design standards without reservations are: (1) Clark, M. A., Chiang, H. S., Silva, T., McConnell, S., Sonnenfeld, K., Erbe, A., & Puma, M. (2013).

AB  - Objective: To examine effects of a teacher consultation and coaching program delivered by school and community mental health professionals on change in observed classroom interactions and child functioning across one school year. Method: Thirty-six classrooms within 5 urban elementary schools (87% Latino, 11% Black) were randomly assigned to intervention (training + consultation/coaching) and control (training only) conditions. Classroom and child outcomes (n = 364; 43% girls) were assessed in the fall and spring. Results: Random effects regression models showed main effects of intervention on teacher-student relationship closeness, academic self-concept, and peer victimization. Results of multiple regression models showed levels of observed teacher emotional support in the fall moderated intervention impact on emotional support at the end of the school year. Conclusions: Results suggest teacher consultation and coaching can be integrated within existing mental health activities in urban schools and impact classroom effectiveness and child adaptation across multiple domains.

AB  - School-based interventions involving teacher training programmes have been shown to benefit teachers' ability to identify and manage child mental health problems in developed countries. However, very few studies have been conducted in low-income countries with limited specialist services. The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of the training programme on teachers' knowledge and awareness. A total of 114 primary school teachers from five schools in Karachi participated in a two-day (10-12 hours) workshop to provide them with an understanding of common child mental health problems and train them in basic skills. Their pre-and post-training knowledge was evaluated through a rating scale and open-ended questions. Single tailed "t"-test, involving paired differences, was applied for participants' scores. Pre-/post-training differences were statistically significant. The training sessions were associated with an improvement in teachers' knowledge and awareness of various signs and symptoms of common child mental health problems. The greatest improvement was noted in response to strategies of managing difficult behaviours, as 61% of respondents were able to formulate appropriate behavioural management techniques after the training. In low-income developing countries like Pakistan, teachers should be trained in early-intervention programmes for the identification and school-based management of less complex emotional and behavioural problems. Such interventions can maximise the use of sparse mental health resources.

AB  - Teacher preparation and training appear limited in the area of computer-assisted instruction (CAI) as well as more general instruction and management for students with disabilities including those with attention problems. Research suggests that CAI is a promising intervention for young inattentive students, with several inherent advantages; however, there are a number of implementation challenges that may interfere with more extensive and effective use in the classroom. Lessons learned from a recent randomized controlled trial of a CAI intervention highlight some of these challenges and suggest strategies for addressing them. Implications for instruction are discussed with regard to selection of appropriate CAI programs, integration into the classroom, and strengthening teachers' more general management skills for inattentive students. Recommendations for pre-service training and professional development in CAI are provided.

AB  - Paraeducators are frequent communication partners for young children with complex communication needs (CCN) in early childhood settings. This study examined the impact of instruction to paraeducators in two communication interaction strategies (IPLAN [Identify activities for communication, Provide means for communication, Locate and provide vocabulary, Arrange environment, use iNteraction strategies] and MORE [Model AAC, Offer opportunities for communication, Respond to communication, Extend communication]) on the number of communication opportunities provided by paraeducators during play activities with young children with CCN. Results of the study provide evidence that after 2 hr of one-on-one training, paraeducators increased the number of communication opportunities they provided for children with CCN, and children with CCN took an increased number of communication turns. In addition, paraeducators reported that they found the training beneficial, and the supervising teachers note)

AB  - This study reports the findings of a multisite randomized trial evaluating the separate and combined effects of 2 school-based approaches to reduce violence among early adolescents. A total of 37 schools at 4 sites were randomized to 4 conditions: (1) a universal intervention that involved implementing a student curriculum and teacher training with 6th-grade students and teachers, (2) a selective intervention in which a family intervention was implemented with a subset of 6th-grade students exhibiting high levels of aggression and social influence, (3) a combined intervention condition, and (4) a no-intervention control condition. Analyses of multiple waves of data from 2 cohorts of students at each school (N = 5,581) within the grade targeted by the interventions revealed a complex pattern. There was some evidence to suggest that the universal intervention was associated with increases in aggression and reductions in victimization; however, these effects were moderated by preintervention risk. In contrast, the selective intervention was associated with decreases in aggression but no changes in victimization. These findings have important implications for efforts to develop effective violence prevention programs. (Contains 7 tables, 2 figures, and 7 footnotes.)

AB  - Paraprofessionals are widely employed in response to intervention (RTI) settings to provide instruction to students at-risk for reading disabilities. However, little research has addressed effective and efficient ways to train these paraprofessionals to deliver instruction with high fidelity. In addition, given the limited time and finances available in most districts, training needs to be as efficient as possible. This study assessed the effects of a 5-hour fluency training package on the presentation rates, praise rates, and error correction accuracy of five paraprofessionals providing supplemental reading instruction within an RTI system using a multiple baseline design across participants. Students’ reading accuracy and percentage of intervals with on-task behavior were evaluated. Paraprofessionals generally increased their presentation rates, praise rates, and error correction accuracy. Students’ behaviors were affected less.

AB  - This study examined the effects of a teacher training package on the teacher-delivered naturalistic communication-promoting intervention and the expressive communication of three preschool-aged boys with autism spectrum disorders. Growing numbers of children with disabilities, including autism spectrum disorders, attend community-based and inclusive preschool settings, and the present study provides information on how to support positive adult child social-communicative interactions by embedding noninvasive strategies in the context of natural environments. In this multiple-baseline study, the teachers received training and support in implementing specific, naturalistic communication-promoting strategies to increase child opportunities for expressive communication. As a result of the training, the teachers increased their use of the intervention strategies, and all of the target children showed increases in the frequency of expressive communication. This study emphasizes the importance of language input and how the level of intervention delivery--in this case, frequency of teacher-provided opportunities for communication--appears to influence child communicative behavior.

AB  - Teacher response to intervention and unique impact on student outcomes was evaluated. Sixty-three lead and assistant early childhood educators from 14 Head Start programs participated in a randomized-controlled trial in which 40 teachers were assigned to participate in a classroom management program as part of a multicomponent conduct problem prevention program (intervention) and 23 teachers were assigned to participate in the regular Head Start programming (control). Parents of 328 children were also randomly assigned to intervention and control conditions consisting of parent training or regular Head Start. Teachers rated student classroom behavior problems and social competence, while teachers were independently rated on classroom management strategies and observed frequency of positive and negative behavior with students. Teachers also self-reported level of confidence with classroom management and use of positive approaches with parents. Following trainings, intervention teachers demonstrated significant increases in use of positive classroom management strategies and frequency of praise and decreased frequency of negative interactions and critical statements. Lead and assistant teachers did not significantly differ on any measure. Multilevel modeling results indicated that teachers' change in frequency of positive interactions, use of praise, and implementation of positive classroom management strategies uniquely impacted student behavior and social competence outcomes when parent training participation and student baseline ratings were taken into account. These results indicate that classroom management training affects both early childhood educator behavior and student outcomes and is an important component of conduct problem prevention programs. Implications and future research directions are discussed. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

This study explored whether the effects of interventions delivered by classroom assistants (CAs) were still evident at the end of the first phase of schooling, 16 months after the early intervention finished. Children were divided into 'treatment responder' and 'treatment non-responder' groups based upon post-test decoding skills. The treatment responder group was significantly more likely to achieve average results in nationally administered tests (end of Key Stage 1 tests) and teacher ratings of attainment than the treatment non-responders. Treatment responders were indistinguishable from national averages on the mathematics test, writing test and reading task performance, but differed on reading comprehension test and on teacher-assessed attainment.

AB  - The number of English language learners (ELL) across public schools in the United States continues to rise (Brice & Roseberry-McKibbin, 2006). However, teacher preparation for these students is not growing (McKeon, 2005). This quantitative study explored the relationship between teacher professional development and literacy achievement of Kindergarten Hispanic English Language Learners (ELL). Literature was reviewed in the areas of historical background and policies of ELL, Cummins's Second Language Acquisition Theory, research on literacy achievement of ELL, and teacher professional development and interventions for teaching ELL. Four research questions were examined: (a) how does teacher inservice professional development relate to Fall 1998 literacy achievement of Kindergarten Hispanic ELL?; (b) how does teacher inservice professional development relate to Spring 1999 literacy achievement of Kindergarten Hispanic ELL?; (c) what is the relationship between teachers completing ELL courses for professional development and Fall 1998 literacy achievement of Kindergarten Hispanic ELL?; and (d) what is the relationship between teachers completing ELL courses for professional development and Spring 1999 literacy achievement of Kindergarten Hispanic ELL? Secondary data was utilized from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-1999 (ECLS-K). The sample population of students was 3,762 Kindergarten students that were identified as Hispanic ELLs. The sample population of teachers was 2,811 teachers who attended three or more inservice training days and 1,519 teachers who completed one or more ESL college courses. The statistical method of a t-test was used to analyze the data with a 0.05 statistical significance. The findings from this study were: teachers who attended three or more inservice trainings for the 1998-1999 school year impacted Kindergarten Hispanic ELLs' Fall 1998 and Spring 1999 literacy scores compared to those teachers who did not attend three or more inservice trainings for the 1998-1999 school year; and teachers who completed ELL college courses impacted Kindergarten Hispanic ELLs' Fall 1998 and Spring 1999 literacy scores compared to those teachers who did not complete ELL college courses. The results of this study apply to state education agencies, policy makers, educational administrators, educators, and students. Recommendations for practice are included.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a short intervention program designed to enhance the educators' ability to identify children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD). Twenty early childhood and 20 physical education teachers (n = 40) participated in the study. Participants were randomly assigned into an experimental group (n = 20) and a control group (n = 20). A 3-week intervention program implemented, which comprised of four 2-hour lectures and two practice sections of the same duration and focused on the issue of DCD within the educational setting. After the completion of the program, each educator evaluated four children's motor performance using the Movement Assessment Battery for Children Checklist (Sugden & Sugden, 1991). Subsequently, another assessment took place using the Movement Assessment Battery for Children. The total number of evaluated children was 160. Results showed that the educators who attended the educational program showed higher identification ability. No significant differences were found between physical education and early childhood teachers of the experimental group. On the contrary, in the control group, early childhood teachers exhibited higher identification ability than the physical education teachers. The intervention program significantly enhanced the educators' ability to identify children with DCD. The implication of this study is that the education of school professionals should be a continuous process. (Contains 2 tables.)

AB  - This presentation capitalizes on a three-year, longitudinal, school-randomized trial of the 4Rs Program, a comprehensive, school-based social-emotional and literacy program for elementary schools, to test intervention induced changes in features of classroom climate and key dimensions of teacher affective and pedagogical processes and practices thought to influence children's social-emotional and academic development. Experimental evidence to date suggests the 4Rs Program is effective in improving the quality of classroom climate after one-year of intervention and positively altering the course of children's social-cognitive, emotional, behavioral and academic functioning after two years of intervention. While these results are encouraging, this presentation will extend this work by testing the causal influence of the 4Rs Program on (1) the quality of classroom climate at the end of the second and third years of intervention, and (2) changes in teachers affective and pedagogical processes and practices over three consecutive years of intervention.

AB  - The main objective of the overall Targeted Reading Intervention (TRI) was to help the classroom teacher acquire the key reading diagnostic strategies (e.g., Cooter, 2003; Desimone, 2009; Garet et al., 2001; Timperley & Phillips, 2003) relevant to K-1 struggling readers (e.g., Desimone, 2009; Garet et al., 2001; Guskey, 2002; Joyce & Showers, 2002; Penuel et al., 2007; Taylor, Pressley & Pearson, 2004) through the authors' professional development program. In the present study the authors employed an innovative distance technology model to deliver professional development and real-time collaborative coaching to isolated rural schools. Each experimental classroom received a laptop, webcam, and webconferencing software. This technology was used with each experimental teacher so that the authors could see and hear her working with each of her struggling readers in real time and she could see and hear the literacy consultants at their university thousands of miles away. Through this technology the literacy consultants could coach the classroom teacher in using the TRI strategies and also use the technology of grade level meetings and workshops throughout the year. Findings of this study suggests that the Targeted Reading Intervention, using webcam technology with classroom teachers in kindergarten and first grade, can significantly help struggling readers progress more quickly in all of the basic word reading and comprehension skills over one year. In addition, for the basic word reading skills, the TRI can actually help struggling readers catch up with their non-struggling peers in the same classroom by the end of the school year. Future work is needed to understand what actual teacher knowledge and practice constructs that might mediate the relationship between treatment and student outcomes.

AB  - High stress and burnout are common for early childhood special educators, contributing to high rates of attrition, diminished educational effectiveness, and high turnover. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a promising approach for the prevention and treatment of a wide variety of problems. Using a randomized wait-list control design, this pilot study evaluated whether ACT workshops delivered to preschool teachers who serve children with developmental disabilities would improve stress-related problems of teachers (i.e., stress, depression, and burnout) and increase collegial support. At pretest, measures of "experiential avoidance" (EA) and "mindful awareness" (MA) showed significant relationships to reports of depression, stress, and burnout. The intervention reduced staff members' EA, increased teachers' MA and "valued living" (VL), and improved teachers' sense of efficacy. This suggests that ACT workshops can help influence factors affecting depression, stress, and burnout in an early childhood special education setting. (Contains 6 tables and 1 figure.)

AB  - A group randomized controlled trial tested the efficacy of the Friendly Schools program to reduce student bullying behaviour. This socio-ecological intervention targeted the whole school, classroom, family, and individual students to reduce bullying behaviour. Self-report data were collected in 29 schools over three years from a cohort of 1968 eight to nine-year-olds. Surveys measured frequency of being bullied, bullying others, telling if bullied and observing bullying. Results indicate that intervention students were significantly less likely to observe bullying at 12, 24 and 36 months and be bullied after 12 and 36 months, and significantly more likely to tell if bullied after 12 months than comparison students. No differences were found for self-reported perpetration of bullying. The findings suggest whole-of-school programs that engage students in their different social contexts appear to reduce their experiences of being bullied and increase their likelihood of telling someone if they are bullied.

AB  - Four preschool supervisors were individually trained in a collaborative team approach in which classroom and resource teachers together developed a plan to increase the peer interactions of the entire class, including children with disabilities. The purpose of the research was to assess the generalization of effects to a new program target (children's on-task behavior during circle time) and over time (3 months). The experimental phases of baseline, supervisor training, and follow-up were introduced in a multiple-baseline design across four preschool classes, each containing 2 children with disabilities. Behaviors of teachers, 8 children with disabilities, and 8 comparison children were measured during daily 20-min training sessions (indoor play periods) and generalization sessions (circle time). Results indicated that following supervisor training, teachers increased their focus on groups of children that included children with disabilities in both training and generalization sessions. After supervisor training, children with disabilities and comparison children increased their peer interactions during training sessions and their on-task behavior during circle time. Changes in teachers' and children's behaviors in both settings were maintained at the 3-month follow-up observation. Implications for teacher training and consultation are discussed.

Reports and independent observations were collected at home and school. Following the 6-month intervention, all treatments resulted in significantly fewer conduct problems with mothers, teachers, and peers compared to controls. Children's negative behavior with fathers was lower in the 3 PT conditions than in control. Children showed more prosocial skills with peers in the CT conditions than in control. All PT conditions resulted in less negative and more positive parenting for mothers and less negative parenting for fathers than in control. Mothers and teachers were also less negative than controls when children received CT. Adding TT to PT or CT improved treatment outcome in terms of teacher behavior management in the classroom and in reports of behavior problems.

AB  - This study focuses on how the treatment effects of a teacher professional development initiative in science differed by school capacity. In other words, the authors are primarily concerned with treatment effect heterogeneity. As such, this paper complements ongoing evaluation of the average treatment effects of the initiative over time. The research question considered here is: Did existing school capacity account for heterogeneity in teacher and student outcomes? That is, do treatment effects differ for schools with low, average, or high capacity? Specifically, the authors consider two outcomes: teachers' reported adoption of the targeted curriculum and students' subsequent achievement scores on standardized science tests. Although their primary focus is on student outcomes, teacher behaviors are informative because they represent a necessary mechanism in the causal process that is likely influenced by school capacity. There are clear policy implications of the demonstrated importance and variability of school capacity. The results implore more attention to be paid to the school pre-conditions underlying educational interventions, particularly given that the average school in this study did not have the capacity to successfully respond to this intensive professional development initiative. There are two clear implications for educational evaluation. One is to direct attention to rigorous causal evaluation of school capacity building, especially given that capacity can trump the interventions more commonly subjected to experimental testing. Indeed, the current study's design does not allow the authors to make any casual claims about what works in that arena. The other implication is that more effectiveness evaluations should explicitly consider school capacity as an important mediating dimension. The authors have demonstrated in this study that school capacity as conceptualized in the school organizations tradition is a meaningful tool for opening up the "black box" of a randomized professional development evaluation and their methodology would be relatively easy to replicate.

AB  - Given the vital importance of using a scientific approach for curriculum development, the authors employed a design experiment methodology (Brown, 1992; Shavelson et al., 2003) to develop and evaluate, FUSION, a first grade mathematics intervention intended for students with or at-risk for mathematics disabilities. FUSION, funded through IES (Baker, Clarke, & Fien, 2008), targets students' understanding of whole number concepts and skills and is being designed as a Tier 2 intervention for schools that use a multi-tiered service delivery model, such as Response to Intervention (RtI). In developing this intervention, the authors have drawn extensively from the converging knowledge base of effective math instruction (Gersten et al., 2009; National Math Advisory Panel, [NMAP] 2008) and the critical content areas of first grade mathematics recognized by national bodies (Common Core State Standards for Mathematics, [CCSS-M] 2010). Guiding the FUSION project are three primary objectives: (1) develop a 60-lesson intervention program that fosters students' procedural fluency and conceptual understanding of whole number concepts, (2) assess the feasibility of the FUSION intervention and (3) assess the potential efficacy of the intervention in a subsequent randomized efficacy trial. This presentation focuses on FUSION's initial feasibility study. The feasibility study took place in seven schools in two suburban school districts located in the northwest. Eight teachers (1 male) with varying experience levels participated in the feasibility study. Preliminary analyses indicate that teachers are meeting acceptable levels of implementation fidelity. Overall, teachers have expressed encouraging views of FUSION. Anecdotal records from classroom visits and professional development sessions indicate that teachers are satisfied with FUSION's overall structure and comfortable with lesson implementation. Teachers report that students are benefiting from the program and in particular building conceptual knowledge and procedural fluency in whole numbers. For student performance data, the authors plan to investigate student gains across the academic year. They expect to find strong relationships between FUSION and changes in CBM and ProFusion scores. These preliminary findings would serve as promise of FUSION for positively influencing student math outcomes. Analyses are currently underway. (Contains 2 figures.)

AB  - The last two decades have witnessed a vast expansion in the use of education data to improve classroom instruction and raise student achievement. Schools and districts face important challenges in implementing increased data use for instructional improvement. One key challenge is the need for teachers and administrators to have "data literacy"--the skills to analyze data, and to use a variety of data sources to refine and improve instruction. Data systems and data initiatives have grown at a much faster pace than educator training around data use. This reality justifies the evaluation of a program such as TERC's Using Data, which aims to provide teachers with the needed training. A table and figure are appended. Using school-level random assignment, this study seeks to estimate the causal impact of TERC's Using Data (UD) program on elementary teachers' understanding and use of data to inform mathematics instruction, and on the mathematics achievement of their fourth and fifth grade students. The main questions were: (1) At the end of the first year of the intervention, do fourth and fifth grade students in schools randomly assigned to the UD treatment program show greater levels of math achievement as compared to their counterparts in control schools? (2) After the first year of the intervention, do UD-trained teachers in treatment schools report greater data-use knowledge and skills and more-positive attitudes and beliefs about the value of data to inform instruction as compared to their same-grade counterparts in control schools?; and (3) After the first year of the intervention, do UD-trained teachers in treatment schools reportedly make more use of data or work more frequently with data in a collaborative setting, as compared to their same-grade counterparts in control schools? in comparison to control teachers? A large, urban district in the southeastern U. S. joined the study in March 2011, agreeing to implement the Using Data program. Sixty schools were randomized into the treatment group (30 schools) or the control group (30 schools), with an average of four teacher participants and one data coach from each school taking on the same treatment condition as their school. Our sample includes over 11,000 students and 800 math teachers in the 60 schools. The design was a block-randomized experiment with two levels of treatment--Using Data versus practice as usual. Preliminary analysis of pre/post survey data from teachers suggests that collaborative data use increased in the treatment schools relative to the control schools at statistically significant levels. Tables and one figure are appended.

AB  - Adapting support contingently to student needs by first diagnosing their current understanding, that is, scaffolding, is considered a key aspect of excellent teaching. The use of classroom scaffolding is rare, however. We therefore investigated the benefits to teachers of a professional development program that was based upon a model of contingent teaching (MCT) with the following 4 steps: diagnostic strategies, checking of diagnoses, giving contingent support, and checking of student learning. In our experimental study, 17 of 30 teachers participated in this program. All of the teachers (prevocational education; teaching social studies) taught the same 5-lesson project on the European Union. The frequency and quality of their use of the 4 steps from the MCT were then compared. The teachers who worked with the MCT increased their teaching quality more than the teachers who did not participate, especially with regard to the steps of contingent teaching. They also showed more complete cycles of contingent teaching at postmeasurement than the other teachers. Less successful teachers showed a tendency to provide less support because they mistakenly thought that prompting was not part of scaffolding. Future scaffolding research and professional development efforts aimed at promoting scaffolding can benefit from the MCT, provided that teachers’ understanding of scaffolding is closely monitored.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of productive classroom talk and meta -communication on the development of young children’s oral communicative competence and subject matter knowledge. This study can be characterized as a quasi-experimental study with a pre-test- intervention- post-test design. A total of 21 teachers and 469 children participated in this study. 12 teachers were assigned to the intervention condition and participated in a Professional Development Program on productive classroom dialogue. Multilevel analyses of children’s oral communicative competence pre- and post-test scores indicated that our intervention had a significant and moderate to large effect on the development of young children’s oral communicative competence. No significant effects were found for children’s subject matter knowledge. The results of this study suggest that dialogically organized classroom talk is more beneficial than non-dialogical classroom talk for the development of children’s oral language skills.

AB  - This review provides an overview of the the current state of research on professional development in science education. An analytical frame was used, based on what is known about PD from educational research. Clarke and Hollingsworth's model for teacher professional growth was also used to categorise the studies according to their aims and outcomes. Exemplar studies in each category are highlighted. In total, 44 recent studies were selected, all referring to science PD. The results show an increase in the number of PD studies in science education in recent years. Most PD programmes are aimed at enhancing teacher cognitions as well as classroom practice. Most recently, there seems to have been an increase in programmes that also aim at improving student outcomes through PD. All studies applied most of the characteristics drawn from research on what makes PD effective. However, school organisational conditions were not usually taken into account. Moreover, there has been a very little research on the role of facilitators and their impact on the outcomes of a PD programme.

AB  - Over a decade ago, Bredekamp asserted (1996) that the field of early childhood education lacked a research base to document the effectiveness of approaches to producing highly skilled and effective early educators. The National Center for Research in Early Childhood Education's (NCRECE) Course and MyTeachingPartner (MTP) Coaching were developed to fill the gap in effective PD targeted toward improving teacher-child interactions. In both cases, this PD focused on improving the interactions known to support children's development, as identified by the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS; Pianta et al., 2008). The NCRECE study was intentionally designed to use two distinct professional development approaches, targeted toward the same outcome (improved teacher-student interactions), to examine their unique individual or combined influence on enhancing interactions. As part of the randomized controlled trial, intent to treat results suggest that both the NCRECE Course and the MTP Coaching do change teachers' interactions in ways that support children's development (Hamre et al, in press; Pianta et al., 2011). This paper explores variation in teachers' responsiveness during both the Course and MTP Coaching phases of the NCRECE study. Of particular interest is the identification of classroom and teacher factors that may serve as moderators between participants' responsiveness and change in their instructional practice. A total of 433 teachers were recruited into the course phase of the study. Upon consent, they were randomized at the site location level into the course or control group for the first phase of the study so that approximately half of the teachers participated in each group. A total of 405 teachers were recruited into the consultancy phase of the study. Of teachers in the analytic sample, 41% worked in Head Start programs and a significant portion worked in public schools (37%). Teachers were experienced, with an average of 14 years of experience teaching and an average of 16 years of education. Most of the teachers were African American (47%) or White (31%) with a smaller number of Latino (15%), Asian American (4%), and multi-ethnic (4%). The poverty rate among children in the classrooms taught by teachers in the sample was quite high (mean = 0.88, sd = 0.21). The NCRECE Course and MTP coaching intent to treat findings reported elsewhere indicate there are different types of intervention designs that can improve teachers' practice in ways that matter for children's development (Pianta et al., 2011). The current treatment on the treated study takes this work a step further, looking inside main effects of interventions to begin to understand the mechanisms through which change can occur, and for whom. In this case, participants' personal and classroom characteristics as well as their responsiveness to two different types of intervention were considered, and shown to matter in some ways the same, and in some ways different, across the interventions. Consistent with previous findings (Downer et al, 2009), and across both types of interventions, teachers who have less experience in prek classrooms benefit most from the intervention experiences. This is consistent with other literature on novice teachers, pointing to both their continued need and desire to develop (Darling-Hammond, 2001). Given the persistent concern regarding new teacher quality and retention, tending to the explicit needs of new teachers with interventions known to support effective practice should be a priority. Although there were several teacher/classroom characteristics that related to change in one intervention phase or the other, the main difference of note is how participants' responsiveness in the MTP Coaching intervention, but not in the NCRECE Course, was associated with improved instructional interactions. Given the personal and interactive nature of coaching, responsiveness by the participant may be more critical to change in their practice then attending a course (Pianta et al., 2011). Further, participant responsiveness to MTP and change in practice was moderated by teacher experience and composition of children in the classroom. This points to a need for professional development opportunities that align with the same intended outputs, but use different learning formats or modalities that work best for the individual learner involved. Based on these preliminary findings, future work would benefit from examining a more comprehensive look at intervention responsiveness, as well as unexplored teacher/classroom characteristics.

AB  - This study examined the effectiveness of a classroom teacher intervention, the Targeted Reading Intervention (TRI), in helping struggling readers in kindergarten and first grade. This intervention used biweekly literacy coaching in the general education classroom to help classroom teachers use diagnostic strategies with struggling readers in one-on-one 15-min sessions. Five schools in low-income rural counties were randomly assigned to the experimental or control group. Five struggling and five nonstruggling readers were randomly selected to participate in each experimental and control classroom. There were 34 classrooms and 276 children. Experimental children achieved better gains in letter-word identification than did control children. Significant interactions were found with word attack skills. Children in the experimental group with poor rapid naming and better phonological awareness skills progressed the most compared with the control group. The TRI appeared to be a promising classroom teacher intervention to help young struggling readers.

AB  - This study evaluated whether the Targeted Reading Intervention (TRI), a classroom teacher professional development program delivered through webcam technology literacy coaching, could provide rural classroom teachers with the instructional skills to help struggling readers progress rapidly in early reading. Fifteen rural schools were randomly assigned to the experimental or control condition. Five struggling readers and 5 non-struggling readers were randomly selected from eligible children in each classroom. There were 75 classrooms and 631 children in the study. Teachers in experimental schools used the TRI in one-on-one sessions with 1 struggling reader in the regular classroom for 15 min a day until that struggler made rapid reading progress. Teachers then moved on to another struggling reader until all 5 struggling readers in the class received the TRI during the year. Biweekly webcam coaching sessions between the coach and teacher allowed the coach to see and hear the teacher as she instructed a struggling reader in a TRI session, and the teacher and child could see and hear the coach. In this way the classroom teacher was able to receive real-time feedback from the coach. Three-level hierarchical linear models suggested that struggling readers in the intervention schools significantly outperformed the struggling readers in the control schools, with effect sizes from .36 to .63 on 4 individualized achievement tests. Results suggested that struggling readers were gaining at the same rate as the non-struggling readers, but they were not catching up with their non-struggling peers.

AB  - The targeted reading intervention (TRI) is a professional development program for rural kindergarten and first grade classroom teachers to help them provide effective reading strategies with struggling readers. In two randomized controlled trials, the TRI was delivered two ways: (1) literacy coaches provided support for classroom teachers through face-to-face classroom meetings or (2) coaches provided support to classroom teachers through live webcam technology. The purpose this study was to examine how face-to-face versus webcam coaching was related to teacher and struggling reader outcomes. Regression results suggested greater benefits with webcam literacy coaching for teacher fidelity and efficacy. Both struggling reader groups made equivalent gains across literacy measures, although there were greater gains on one child literacy measure in the webcam group.

AB  - This article reports the results of a randomized controlled trial that replicated and extended research on the Targeted Reading Intervention (TRI), a professional development program for kindergarten and first-grade teachers in low-wealth rural schools that helps enhance literacy skills of struggling readers. In weekly webcam coaching sessions, literacy coaches delivered real-time feedback to classroom teachers as they worked one-on-one with struggling readers. Teachers worked with 1 child for 15 minutes a day for 6 to 8 weeks before moving to another struggling reader. Hierarchical linear models replicated previous findings that struggling readers in TRI treatment classrooms showed greater gains in early literacy compared with struggling readers in control classrooms. This study extended previous TRI work by examining whether teachers who received a second year of TRI training produced greater gains for their students compared with their first year. Results showed no advantage of teachers' 2-year TRI participation.

AB  - After an overview of the characteristics of professional learning communities (PLCs), this manuscript presents a review of 10 American studies and one English study on the impact of PLCs on teaching practices and student learning. Although, few studies move beyond self-reports of positive impact, a small number of empirical studies explore the impact on teaching practice and student learning. The collective results of these studies suggest that well-developed PLCs have positive impact on both teaching practice and student achievement. Implications of this research and suggestions for next steps in the efforts to document the impact of PLCs on teaching and learning are included. [Copyright Elsevier B.V.]

AB  - Lack of knowledge of effective educational interventions for gifted children is a pressing problem in Belgian schools. Most preschool and primary school teachers enter the profession without any training in the best practices for gifted children. This results in many misconceptions about giftedness and gifted education and a diversity of well-intentioned but ineffective interventions in the classroom. In response to the request for help from many schools, the Belgian expertise center ``Exentra{''} designed a professional training program for in-service teachers with the aim to increase teachers' understanding of the characteristics and needs of gifted pupils, and help teachers develop the necessary confidence and skills to effectively teach the gifted in regular, mixed-ability classes. This study shows that the Exentra training is effective in changing teachers' beliefs about gifted education and enhancing teachers' knowledge, abilities, and self-esteem to effectively modify the curriculum for the more capable pupils in the classroom.

AB  - The Parents as Teachers (PAT) program is a parent-education program that includes home visiting and is designed to begin prenatally or at birth. Through home visits, parent educators help parents to strengthen their parenting skills and knowledge of child development and to prepare young children for school. This article describes the PAT program and reports the results of evaluations of 2 randomized trials of PAT: (1) the Northern California Parents as Teachers Demonstration, which served primarily Latino parents in the Salinas Valley; and (2) the Teen Parents as Teachers Demonstration, which served adolescent parents in Southern California. The 2 evaluations revealed small and inconsistent positive effects on parent knowledge, attitudes, and behavior. In the Salinas Valley program, children in primarily Spanish-speaking Latino families benefitted more than either non-Latino or English-speaking Latino families. In the Teen PAT Demonstration, families that received both PAT services and comprehensive case management services designed to help mothers improve their life course benefitted most. Analyses in the Salinas Valley study suggested that children in families that received more intensive services benefitted more than children whose families received less intensive services.

AB  - Background Executive functions (EFs) play a critical role in cognitive and social development. During preschool years, children show not only rapid improvement in their EFs, but also appear sensitive to developmentally appropriate interventions. Aim EMIL is a training program for German preschool teachers that was developed and implemented to improve the EFs of preschoolers. The aim of the present study was to evaluate its effects on the EFs of children between three and six years old. Method The teacher training (eight sessions, 28.5 hours) was implemented in four preschools. The EFs of children of the intervention group (n = 72, 32 girls, M-age = 48 months) and the control group of four other matched preschools (n = 61, 27 girls, M-age = 48 months) were tested before, during, and after the intervention using different measures assessing working memory, inhibitory control, and cognitive flexibility. Results The intervention group showed significant gains on three out of seven EF tests (behavioral inhibition, visual-spatial working memory, and combined EFs) compared to the control group. Post hoc analyses for children with low initial EFs scores revealed that participation in the intervention led to significant gains in inhibitory control, visual-spatial working memory, and phonological working memory as well as a marginally significant difference for combined EFs. However, effect sizes were rather small. Conclusion The results suggest that teacher training can lead to significant improvements in preschooler's EFs. Although preliminary, the results could contribute to the discussion on how teacher training can facilitate the improvement of EFs in preschool children.

AB  - The study examined the effect of a secondary school teacher training and coaching program on student achievement. Eighty-eight teachers were randomly assigned to either the My Teaching Partner-Secondary (MTP-S) group or the control group. Of these teachers, 76 participated in the study during the intervention year (when they received coaching) and 61 participated in the study during the post-intervention year (when they no longer received coaching). Data from two student cohorts were analyzed. The first cohort included about 1,300 students of the teachers who participated during the intervention year; the second cohort included about 1,000 students of the teachers who participated during the post-intervention year. Analyses of the intervention year did not find a statistically significant difference in achievement between students of MTP-S teachers and students of control group teachers. Analyses of the post-intervention year found that achievement among students of MTP-S teachers was significantly higher than among students of control group teachers. The effect size of 0.22 is roughly equivalent to an increase in student achievement from the 50th to the 59th percentile. However, the What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) has reservations about these results, as unaccounted-for differences between the two groups of students may have existed before the intervention. The analyses based on the intervention year meet WWC evidence standards. The analyses based on the post-intervention year meet WWC evidence standards with reservations. (Contains 1 footnote.)

AB  - The purpose of this article is to clarify the role of "teacher training initiatives" aimed at improving social, emotional and behavioural outcomes of primary school aged children through improved classroom management. Systematic searches were conducted using a range of electronic databases from inception up to September 2011. Included studies were controlled trials that described training provided to teachers in classroom management techniques designed to improve primary school children's behavioural and social outcomes. Study selection and appraisal of quality were carried out by two researchers and a narrative synthesis was carried out. A total of 14 studies were included involving 8 interventions. Results show that statistically significant effects are limited, with only 20 outcomes showing significant effects in the desired direction. Effect sizes ranged from g = -0.17 (95%CI: -0.32, -0.02) to g = 1.88 (95%CI: 0.55, 3.21). Overall, the programmes indicate an improvement in some outcomes of interest. However, further research into the implementation and comparative effectiveness of such programmes is needed before implications for educational policy and practice can be established.

AB  - Coaching is gaining attention as a promising professional development approach in early education. However, in practice, many adult educators continue to rely on methods with inconsistent effectiveness, such as one-time trainings and workshops. In addition, there is limited evidence supporting the use of specific coaching models in early education. This article describes the development and pilot study of a coaching model developed to support early education teams in implementation of the supplemental intervention for preschoolers with autism, Advancing Social-communication and Play (ASAP). Two early education teams were assigned to each of the following groups: those who received ASAP training, those who received ASAP training and coaching, and a control group that received no support related to the intervention. Through descriptive analysis of qualitative and quantitative data, preliminary results of this pilot study suggest the coaching model impacted teams' collaborative practices)

AB  - This article examines the impacts of a partial year of implementation of Learning to Read in a Healing Classroom (LRHC), a curricular and social-emotional teacher professional development intervention in southeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, on teacher professional well-being. Using a cluster-randomized control trial, this study assesses LRHC impacts on a sample of 346 teachers from 64 primary schools. We find statistically significant increases in job dissatisfaction for female teachers and increases in motivation for the least experienced teachers. Implications are discussed for the role of teacher professional development and well-being in improving education in low resource and conflict-affected contexts. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim of this study was to pilot test a classroom-based intervention focused on facilitating play and joint attention for young children with autism in self-contained special education classrooms. Thirty-three children with autism between the ages of 3 and 6 years participated in the study with their classroom teachers (n = 14). The 14 preschool special education teachers were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (1) symbolic play then joint attention intervention, (2) joint attention then symbolic intervention, and (3) wait-list control period then further randomized to either group 1 or group 2. In the intervention, teachers participated in eight weekly individualized 1-h sessions with a researcher that emphasized embedding strategies targeting symbolic play and joint attention into their everyday classroom routines and activities. The main child outcome variables of interest were collected through direct classroom observations. Findings indicate that teachers can implement an intervention to significantly improve joint engagement of young children with autism in their classrooms. Furthermore, multilevel analyses showed significant increases in joint attention and symbolic play skills. Thus, these pilot data emphasize the need for further research and implementation of classroom-based interventions targeting play and joint attention skills for young children with autism.

AB  - Compared the social validity of behavior therapy vs. support group interventions for reduction of parent-adolescent conflict among families of adolescents with diabetes. Families were randomized to 10 sessions of an Education and Support group (ES) or 10 sessions of Behavioral Family Systems Therapy (BFST). We compared participants' social validity ratings of BFST and ES using the Treatment Evaluation Questionnaire (TEQ). Mean TEQ scores were significantly more positive for BFST than ES and, for 13 of 20 items, BFST was rated significantly more positively by parents and/or adolescents. Adolescents rated ES less positively than did parents. Fathers' responses reflected fewer differences between ES and BFST. Results extend previous research on BFST and confirm its superiority over ES for targeting family conflict.

AB  - The Regional Educational Laboratory - Southwest (REL Southwest) conducted a systematic and comprehensive review of the research-based evidence on the effects of professional development (PD) on growth in student achievement in three core academic subjects (reading/ELA, mathematics, and science). The primary goal of this study was to address the question, What is the impact of teacher participation in professional development on student achievement? Nine studies emerged as meeting What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) evidence standards, from more than 1,300 manuscripts identified as potentially relevant. Although the number of studies that met evidence standards was small, the average overall effect size of 0.54 was observed when examined within the three content areas included in the review. The consistency of this effect size indicates that across all forms and content of PD, providing training to elementary school teachers does have a moderate effect on their students' achievement. However, because the average number of contact hours averaged almost 49 hours across the nine studies, the total contact hours must be substantial to get such an effect size. Because of the limited number of studies and the variability in the PD that was represented among the nine studies we examined, we were unable to make any conclusions about the effectiveness of specific PD programs or about the effectiveness of PD by form, content, or intensity. The following are appended: (1) Methodology; (2) Protocol for the review of research-based evidence on the effects of professional development on student achievement; (3) Key terms and definitions related to professional development; (4) List of keywords used in electronic searches; and (5) Relevant studies, listed by coding results.

AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Discourse and Conversation Analytic Approaches to the Study of Autism Spectrum Disorder This randomized, controlled trial, comparing the Comprehensive Autism Program (CAP) and business as usual programs, studied outcomes for 3-5 year old students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Participants included 84 teachers and 302 students with ASD and their parents. CAP utilized specialized curricula and training components to implement specific evidence-based practices both at school and home. A comprehensive set of outcome areas was studied. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to estimate the treatment impact. CAP had small positive impacts on the students' receptive language (effect size of .13) and on their social skills as rated by teachers (effect size of .19). Treatment effects were moderated by severity of ASD.

AB  - Background: Several parent training programmes and behavioural teacher training programmes built on learning theory have been developed for problem prevention and treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and/or oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) during the last few decades. Group format has often been used for parent training but single-subject designs are more common in teacher training. More studies have focussed on pre-school children than on older children, and a minority have been conducted in public mental health settings. Aim: This study aimed to evaluate a combined parent and teacher manual-based group training programme for children with ADHD conducted by the staff at a child and adolescent psychiatric clinic in Sweden. Method: The intervention was a modified version of Barkley's programme. Children were randomized to an Intervention or a Control group. Sixty-one parents and 68 teachers answered questions about ADHD and ODD symptoms, and about behavioural

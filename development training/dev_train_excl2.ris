AB  - The number of students with mental health disorders (MHDs) in postsecondary institutions is increasing. Teachers' attitudes are among the main factors that influence these students' academic success. Unfortunately, their attitudes are little studied, in part because of lack of validated scales. Therefore, this article has two purposes: (1) analyse the construct validity of new scales assessing teachers' attitudes, as well as existing scales without an established construct validity; and (2) report the correlations between the variables assessed in these scales, with a special focus on two variables: (a) teachers' negative attitudes; and (b) the measures offered to students by teachers. The participants are 232 teachers from 16 French and English CEGEPS in Quebec, Canada. The questionnaire includes three scales created by the research team and three scales from the Mental Illness Awareness Survey. Correlational and factor analyses were conducted. The scales present good construct validity. Four variables were associated with the two variables of interest: confidence in one's ability to convince a student to seek help; familiarity with MHDs; knowledge and understanding of MHDs; favourable perception of the accommodations offered by adapted and psychosocial services. Based on these results, strategies are proposed to improve teachers' attitudes.

AB  - We describe the development and validation of an instrument for measuring the affective component of primary school teachers' attitudes towards self-regulated learning. The questionnaire assesses the affective component towards those cognitive and metacognitive strategies that are especially effective in primary school. In a first study (n = 230), the factor structure was verified via an exploratory factor analysis. A confirmatory factor analysis with data from a second study (n = 400) indicated that the theoretical factor structure is appropriate. A comparison with four alternative models identified the theoretically derived factor structure as the most appropriate. Concurrent validity was demonstrated by correlations with a scale that measures the degree to which teachers create learning environments that enable students to self-regulate their learning. Retrospective validity was demonstrated by correlations with a scale that measures teachers' experiences with self-regulated learning. In a third study (n = 47), the scale's concurrent validity was tested with scales measuring teachers' evaluation of the desirability of different aspects of self-regulated learning in class. Additionally, predictive validity was demonstrated via a binary logistic regression, with teachers attitudes as predictor on their registration for a workshop on self-regulated learning and their willingness to implement a seven-week training program on self-regulated learning.

AB  - Background: Due to the increasing complexity of medical education and practice, the preparation of healthcare professionals for leadership roles and responsibilities has become increasingly important. To date, the literature on faculty development designed to promote leadership in medical education has not been reviewed in a systematic fashion. Aim: The objective of this review is to synthesize the existing evidence that addresses the following question: 'What are the effects of faculty development interventions designed to improve leadership abilities on the knowledge, attitudes, and skills of faculty members in medicine and on the institutions in which they work?' Methods: Search strategy: The search, which covered the period 1980-2009, included six databases (Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, ERIC, and ABI/Inform) and used the following keywords: faculty development; in-service training; doctor; medic; physician; faculty; leadership; management; administration; executive; an)

AB  - Reviews the book The Power to Spring Up: Postsecondary Education Opportunities for Students with Significant Disabilities by Diana M. Katovitch (2009). 'Forget everything you thought you knew for sure.' In her book The Power to Spring Up, secondary special education teacher Diana M. Katovitch challenges her readers to forget the notion that students with significant disabilities do not belong in college. The book is divided into three sections. The Power to Spring Up is well researched and well written. It is both inspiring in its portrayal of the increasing possibilities for individuals with disabilities and practical in laying out the steps to making those possibilities a reality. The target audience is families, teachers, and students themselves with a range of challenges from intellectual disability to autism spectrum disorders to physical impairments. However, physicians and other professionals who work with adolescents and young adults with disabilities can also benefit from this excellent resource.

AB  - The quality assurance of teaching and learning as part of universities' governance and quality management has become a major subject in higher education and higher education politics worldwide. In addition, increasing academic attention has been paid to the quality assurance of teaching and learning, as is evident from the growing number of articles in specific journals of higher education. This paper maps the development and content of research in the literature regarding the quality assurance of teaching and learning. For this mapping, a bibliometric analysis of 1610 articles from 399 different journals from 1996 to 2013 was performed using SCOPUS. The aim of this mapping is to answer the following research question: Has the quality assurance of teaching and learning become a research specialty? A co-citation analysis identifies the following four thematic clusters: an Assessment-Cluster, a Quality-Cluster, a Quality-Management-Cluster and a Student-Evaluation-of-Teaching-Cluster. Based on a categorization of the literature's core content, two distinct views on the quality assurance of teaching and learning become evident, representing an antagonistic tension in the research between an education strand and a management strand of research. Several indications from the empirical evidence in this paper suggest that the quality assurance of teaching and learning is (becoming) a specialty. The identification and awareness of a specialty as a cognitive organizing characteristic combining two and more categories of research topics are of great importance for the creation of knowledge in the complex interdisciplinary research field of higher education.

AB  - Background: Healthcare professionals’ person-centered communication skills are pivotal for successful group-based diabetes education. However, healthcare professionals are often insufficiently equipped to facilitate person-centeredness and many have never received post-graduate training. Currently, assessing professionals’ skills in conducting group-based, person-centered diabetes education primarily focus on experts measuring and coding skills on various scales. However, learner-centered approaches such as adequate self-reflective tools have been shown to emphasize professional autonomy and promote engagement. The aim of this study was to explore the potential of a self-assessment tool to identify healthcare professionals’ strengths and areas in need of professional development to aid effective facilitation of group-based, person-centered diabetes education. Methods: The study entails of two components: 1) Field observations of five different educational settings including 49 persons with diabetes and 13 healthcare professionals, followed by interviews with 5 healthcare professionals and 28 persons with type 2 diabetes. 2) One professional development workshop involving 14 healthcare professionals. Healthcare professionals were asked to assess their person-centered communication skills using a self-assessment tool based on challenges and skills related to four educator roles: Embracer, Facilitator, Translator, and Initiator. Data were analyzed by hermeneutic analysis. Theories derived from theoretical model ‘The Health Education Juggler’ and techniques from ‘Motivational Interviewing in Groups’ were used as a framework to analyze data. Subsequently, the analysis from the field notes and interview transcript were compared with healthcare professionals’ self-assessments of strengths and areas in need to effectively facilitate group-based, person-centered diabetes education. Results: Healthcare professionals self-assessed the Translator and the Embracer to be the two most skilled roles whereas the Facilitator and the Initiator were identified to be the most challenged roles. Self-assessments corresponded to observations of professional skills in educational programs and were confirmed in the interviews. Conclusion: Healthcare professionals self-assessed the same professional skills as observed in practice. Thus, a tool to self-assess professional skills in facilitating group-based diabetes education seems to be useful as a starting point to promote self-reflections and identification of healthcare professionals’ strengths and areas of need of professional development.

AB  - When terrorism and natural disasters strike it is extremely important to be able to effectively manage America's schools. From the crises of Columbine, to Red Lake Minnesota, the World Trade Center and Katrina, we are reminded that schools are not immune from such disasters. It is essential that schools and communities review and augment their safe school plans and partnerships so that they can respond effectively in times of crisis. It is critically important to assess local preparedness, to update, train and practice crisis response. School officials should have specific plans in place that focus on crisis prevention, crisis preparation, crisis response and crisis recovery. This article addresses those key concerns that every school system should place on their educational agenda. Additional resources and strategies are also suggested that will promote safe and welcoming schools for all of America's children. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Improvement of sex education in schools is a key part of the UK government's strategy to reduce teenage pregnancy in England. We examined the effectiveness of one form of peer-led sex education in a school-based randomised trial of over 8,000 pupils. Methods: 29 schools were randomised to either peer-led sex education (intervention) or to continue their usual teacher-led sex education (control). In intervention schools, peer educators aged 16-17 years delivered three sessions of sex education to 13-14 year-old pupils from the same schools. Primary outcome was unprotected (without condom) first heterosexual intercourse by age 16 years. Analysis was by intention to treat. Findings: By age 16 years, significantly fewer girls reported intercourse in the peer-led arm than in the control arm, but proportions were similar for boys. The proportions of pupils reporting unprotected first sex did not differ for girls (8.4% intervention vs 8.3% control) or for boys (6.2% vs 4.7%). Stratified estimates of the difference between arms were -0.4% (95% CI -3.7% to 2.8%, p=0.79) for girls and -1.4% (-4.4% to 1.6%, p=0.36) for boys. At follow-up (mean age 16.0 years [SD 0.32]), girls in the intervention arm reported fewer unintended pregnancies, although the difference was borderline (2.3% vs 3.3%, p=0.07). Girls and boys were more satisfied with peer-led than teacher-led sex education, but 57% of girls and 32% of boys wanted sex education in single-sex groups. Interpretation: Peer-led sex education was effective in some ways, but broader strategies are needed to improve young people's sexual health. The role of single-sex sessions should be investigated further. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This paper aims to provide practical advice for creating a placement test for English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) or English-as-a-foreign-language (EFL) instruction. Three forms of concrete assistance are provided: a detailed literature review; detailed steps focusing on the creation of placement tests; and a set of recommendations focusing on individual parts of placement tests. The literature review defines a placement test, explores the components of the test in methodical detail covering listening comprehension, speaking, grammar, vocabulary, reading, writing, and language test creation, methodology, and practice. Recommended steps to take in the creation of a useful and accurate placement test include assembling an assessment team, defining test takers and objectives, developing rubrics and rating scales, testing the test itself, and training the scorers and administrators of the test. Recommendations focusing on individual parts of the placement test cover listening, reading, speaking, writing, and grammar. (Contains 28 references.) (KFT)

AB  - Child health psychologists work in a broad range of settings, including pediatric hospital units, outpatient clinics, intensive care units, and private practice settings. Physical and health-related concerns are among the presenting problems encountered in each of these settings, but they are most likely to be seen by child health psychologists working in hospitals. In order to maintain the focus on the unique aspects of the provision of services offered by child health psychologists, this chapter is primarily limited to those issues relevant to working within a traditional medical setting. Within this context, the chapter focuses on developmental and systemic issues relevant to working with a pediatric population and how these issues impact methods of assessment and intervention used to assess child and families in adapting to medical stressors.

AB  - Primary school-aged children with conduct problems are at risk of future antisocial and criminal behaviour, particularly when there are additional family-level risk factors. However, little is known about how school-related factors can reduce that risk. This qualitative longitudinal study investigates school-related influences on changes in the behaviour of at-risk children in high-need families over a period of 5years. Families of 11 children with serious behaviour problems were followed over the transition to secondary school. In-depth interviews with mothers, and with practitioners who support the child or family, explored school-related factors which appeared helpful or unhelpful in improving children's behaviour over time. The analysis found that the disjuncture between the nurture experienced at primary school and a lack of nurture later at secondary school was problematic. Children tended to change primary school until they found one prepared to offer them a high level of nurture and supervision. Consistent relationships with supportive adults were important, but were rare after the transfer to secondary school. Literacy problems remained unrecognised or unaddressed for too long, contributing to children's lack of engagement. Inconsistent disciplinary responses to minor behaviour issues tended to escalate problems and most children were eventually excluded from mainstream education. Communication between parents and school staff was often problematic; parents sometimes experienced school contacts as burdensome, ill-informed and unsupportive. However, good communication could aid development of successful approaches to supporting children with difficult behaviour.

AB  - The objective of this study was to provide what we believe to be the first report of the establishment of a clinical psychology service to provide accessible psychological assessment, intervention and crisis support, integrated within an existing East London sexual health clinical and outreach service for commercial sex workers (CSWs). Data are presented on referral patterns, demographics, presenting issues to clinical psychology, interventions and outcomes for the first year of the service. Women presented with a range of psychosocial needs. Psychological interventions included direct therapy, signposting to other services and consultation with staff. We concluded that this flexible model of service provision improves access to mental health services within the context of a specialist sexual health and outreach service for CSWs. The provision of a named, female clinical psychologist who provides both the clinical sessions and attends outreach has been an important factor in developing trust and familiarity, leading to better uptake of the clinical psychology service.

AB  - Reviews the book, Mourning and dancing for schools: A grief and recovery sourcebook for students, teachers and parents by Sally Downham Miller (2000). This book is a follow-up to the author's earlier memoir published by Health Communications in 1999. The book addresses issues which face grieving students and their teachers and parents. Missing is any specific treatment of the role of school counselors. Perhaps this is due to the author’s personal experiences as a teacher and school administrator and the strong personal feel of this work. The book is much like hearing a presentation by the author. It flows in a logical sequence, building a case step by step for the need to prepare school communities and education professionals to respond to loss. This book, and the program it contains, will be helpful to a school that wants to develop a training program for its own faculty and staff.

AB  - Legible written communication is essential for students to share knowledge (Rogers and Case-Smith 2002). If students lack proficiency in written communication, their composition skills will suffer, which can affect their self-esteem and grades. Whether or not this proficiency is in handwriting or keyboarding is a question worthy of discussion. In this article the authors define motor learning, examine the overlapping principles of motor learning in handwriting and keyboarding skill development, and discuss the need for fluency. The principles of motor learning indicate that handwriting precedes keyboarding when comparing skills and time needed to gain competency. Also discussed are correlations between handwriting and keyboarding skills and the impact of teacher attitudes toward each. As occupational therapists, the authors' recommendations are based on the review of literature and evidence their combined with their extensive experience as school-based occupational therapists. Using a school-based consultative model of occupational therapy at the continuing education or university educational level can facilitate the sharing of this knowledge with early childhood education teachers.

AB  - The purpose of this pilot project was to test the feasibility of a telephone support group intervention for persons with hemophilia and HIV/AIDS and for their family caregivers. Their support needs were unique because they did not identify with predominant groups of persons with AIDS and were geographically dispersed from peers. The 12 week intervention involved separate telephone support groups for hemophiliacs and for family caregivers. The two groups, comprised of a predetermined maximum of six people, were co-led by a professional and a peer. The support group for family caregivers involved six people and the group for men with hemophilia included five people, including one peer facilitator and one professional facilitator in each group. The telephone support group discussions were taped, transcribed, and analyzed for prevalent themes. The peer and professional facilitators maintained weekly field notes. All participants reported that the telephone groups had a positive impact on meeting their support needs. They believed that they had benefitted from sharing information and that the support groups had decreased their feelings of isolation and loneliness. Participants, however, contended that the intervention should be longer than 12 weeks. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - To track the quality of instruction delivered at the University of Western Australia, the university surveys all units using its Students' Unit Reflective Feedback (SURF) metrics, and faculties use these metrics to benchmark student satisfaction. Consequently, teaching staff are actively encouraged to adopt teaching practices that will increase the average levels of these metrics. Using a 'before-after' approach, we compared these metrics before and after the implementation of improved teaching practices that addressed specific weaknesses identified through student responses for two undergraduate units. Despite the implementation of improved teaching practices, SURF scores did not increase significantly for the two units assessed, due possibly to the components of the academic programme covered by the SURF questions, the field-based nature of the units, and the difficulty in measuring an increase in the SURF scores of units which already score highly. This poor sensitivity of the SURF metrics to the implementation of improved teaching practices could have implications for their use for performance assessment by the university.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is twofold: first, to introduce MEDIA PROTECT, a multi-modal intervention for parents and teachers with six components preventing problematic, and in the long run addictive, use of screen media by children; second, to present results of a formative evaluation of the teacher training, an important component of the intervention. Design/methodology/approach: In presenting the intervention, the authors used a common framework to describe complex interventions systematically. For the evaluation, participants were recruited from German schools and kindergarten for a cluster-controlled trial. As part of a formative evaluation, the participants completed written questionnaires to determine the importance of different components of the intervention in addition to their overall satisfaction. Additional qualitative interviews with teachers were conducted. Findings: The authors recruited n = 50 kindergartens and n = 9 schools; n = 30 received the intervention. N = 222 teachers participated in the training and n=192 completed the questionnaire (86 per cent). Seven qualitative interviews were conducted. Participants exhibited high levels of overall satisfaction with the training, considered it moderately to highly relevant to their work, and exhibited varying satisfaction levels with different components and multipliers. The qualitative data support these findings. Originality/value: Few interventions to date have pursued a universal approach to the prevention of problematic screen media use. This evaluation of MEDIA PROTECT is the most recent study in Germany, which involves a complex programme through which teachers are taught ways to promote the age-adequate use of screen media in the family, parents are provided with guidance and healthy leisure time activities for children are fostered.

AB  - In this case study, we examined how a school, committed to emotional intelligence (EQ) as a central pillar, used assessment data to build positive school climate and strengthen the EQ of students and all community members. School leaders used multiple EQ and school climate assessments, over several years, to acquire data to enhance individual success, enrich classroom practice, and provide a strategy for schoolwide improvement. Teachers used data to help both youth and adults increase self-awareness, make better choices, and create a more supportive learning community. Assessment results guided curriculum development and classroom management. Administrators examined their own effectiveness individually and as a team and planned teacher professional development and parent workshops. A three-part benchmarks framework for schoolwide implementation of social emotional learning is used to analyze (a) student and adult competencies, (b) classroom practices, and (c) whole school approaches, including school climate and administrative team leadership.

AB  - We examined the impact of a teacher-led intervention, implemented during regular classroom instruction and homework, on fourth-grade students' preference for self-regulated learning, finding main ideas in expository texts, and reading comprehension. In our quasi-experimental study with intact classrooms, (a) students (n = 266, 12 classrooms) who received regular classroom instruction (REG) were compared with (b) students (n = 268, 12 classrooms) who were taught text reduction strategies (TEXT) and (c) students (n = 229, 9 classrooms) who were introduced to text reduction strategies within the framework of a 7-step cyclical model of self-regulated learning (SRL = TEXT). Participating classrooms were semi-randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 conditions, with the restriction that teachers from one school could not be in different intervention conditions. Both in their posttest and follow-up test results (11 weeks after the intervention), SRL + TEXT students showed a stronger preference for self-regulated learning than students of the 2 other groups. The SRL + TEXT students also identified more main ideas over the course of the intervention. Positive effects on reading comprehension in a standardized test were restricted to students without migration background.

AB  - In response to “The Child Welfare Cartel,” defenders of the National Child Welfare Workforce Institute (NCWWI) make three errors: First, restricting federal funds to schools of social work is not authorized by the statute cited in the creation of NCWWI. Second, social work is not the only discipline engaged in child welfare, denying the emergence of Child Advocacy Studies as a competitor. Third, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are not implausible in child welfare due to the complex issues presented by maltreated children and troubled families. This incorrect contention ignores the numerous field experiments deployed in psychology and nursing to the considerable benefit of those disciplines. Apologists for NCWWI thus make assertions typical of a cartel, resulting in outcomes that are unnecessarily substandard and expensive. If social workers are superior to nonprofessionals in child welfare, defenders of NCWWI should conduct an RCT putting that claim to test. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR])

AB  - This article examines the practices of school psychologists who work within an urban school district. Participants (N = 86) rated 20 specific practices on their current use, their importance, and their level of competence. Overall the school psychologists rated their involvement in traditional assessment activities as significantly more common than consultation/collaboration and prevention/ intervention; however, they indicated consultation and prevention/intervention activities as significantly more valued than traditional assessment practices. Participants also noted prevention, intervention, and functional assessment as their top priorities for professional development. Thus, a practice gap was noted with regard to what this group of school psychologists' value and what they do. Results are discussed within the context of current educational reform initiatives.

AB  - Little research has been conducted on the evidence base for educational interventions implemented by teachers targeting students with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder (HFASD). Research examining particular techniques perceived as effective may facilitate guidelines for the application of evidence-based practices. A principal and teacher of students with HFASD from each of 29 different schools provided information on their current teaching interventions. Principals participated in an online survey designed to ascertain support for HFASD learners in their school, whereas teachers completed an online reflective journal to document methods they used in the classroom. Both teachers and principals found numerous strategies such as structure and incorporating needs to be successful. Inappropriate communication, disorganisation, and a lack of understanding were considered unhelpful. These results have implications for current practices in classrooms.

AB  - The Response to Intervention (RtI) is an education practice designed to provide high-quality scientific-based instruction to students having academic or behavior difficulties. Response to Intervention is a tiered intervention system that uses a team problem-solving method to plan for the educational needs of students with learning or behavior problems. The severity of the intervention and educational services depends on the student's monitored progress. The research found variations and commonalities in the perspectives of the elementary general education teachers concerning the RtI process. The most of the teachers indicated having knowledge of the RtI process, but still felt more information was needed. Although the RtI process is team oriented, the general education teachers reported being primarily responsible for most of the procedures and practices. The majority of teachers indicated that additional staff development was needed to gain more knowledge of scientific-based interventions and RtI processes: they also would attend. A descriptive study using a quantitative survey was employed to gather data from an elementary general education teacher random sample to better understand their perspective of the RtI process in the areas of knowledge, procedures, roles of team members, and staff development. Demographic information was also gathered. The participating teachers were from a rural school district northeast of Atlanta, Georgia. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Since its development, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) has been widely used in both research and practice. The SDQ screens for positive and negative psychological attributes. This review aims to provide an overview of the psychometric properties of the SDQ for 4- to 12-year-olds. Results from 48 studies (N = 131,223) on reliability and validity of the parent and teacher SDQ are summarized quantitatively and descriptively. Internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and inter-rater agreement are satisfactory for the parent and teacher versions. At subscale level, the reliability of the teacher version seemed stronger compared to that of the parent version. Concerning validity, 15 out of 18 studies confirmed the five-factor structure. Correlations with other measures of psychopathology as well as the screening ability of the SDQ are sufficient. This review shows that the psychometric properties of the SDQ are strong, particularly for the teacher version. For practice, this implies that the use of the SDQ as a screening instrument should be continued. Longitudinal research studies should investigate predictive validity. For both practice and research, we emphasize the use of a multi-informant approach.

AB  - This study capitalises on the gradual introduction of learning support professionals (LSPs; e.g., school social workers) into an urban school district’s elementary schools (n = 71) between 2001–2002 and 2008–2009. The time series allowed for a school-level investigation of associations between the presence of LSPs and aggregate school achievement utilising fixed-effects methodology. Schools with an LSP in a given year, as well as the cumulative years in which a school had an LSP, were both positively associated with the percentage of students who scored at or above proficient in reading achievement on the California Standards Test and were negatively associated with the cumulative number of years a school was in programme improvement status, but not associated with mathematics achievement. Findings suggest that school social workers function as a school resource and indicate the utility of fixed-effects methodology in assessing the impact of social work services in schools.

Data were analyzed for the number of functional communication utterances used by groups of preschool children with and without disabilities who participated in activities. Results suggest pre-service teachers' use of evidence-based communication strategies was related to increased functional communication by children in the inclusive preschool classrooms. Implications for future research and classroom practices are discussed.

AB  - Title: Professional Team Sports Clubs: Emotional Attachments or a profitable business? (Danish title: Kommercielle sportsklubber - f�lelser eller forretning?) The peculiar logics of professional team sports have puzzled economists for years. In their classic papers on the specificity of sports business, Rottenberg (1956), Neale (1964), Davenport (1969) and Sloane (1971; 1980) took the first steps towards what has become a distinct, established discipline of sports economics. Since then, academic knowledge of the sport business sector has been continuously refined. However, contemporary scholars examining professional team sports have failed to develop a satisfying understanding of the emotional aspects of the sector and their effects on club �profitability�. To address some of these aspects, this thesis deals with the commercialization of Danish football, Danish team handball and European soccer, focusing in particular on Danish professional team sports clubs (PTSCs). Drawing on an argument from systems theory (Luhmann) which suggests that sport serves as a mirror system in (late-) modern society, several improvements are suggested in order to develop a consistent theoretical perspective capable of explaining the paradox that seems to be a fundamental and distinctive trait of the sector: Why do European professional team sports clubs chronically operate on the brink of insolvency without going out of business? Why is the survival rate of PTSCs so high when they perpetually generate losses? The answers � laid out in a model of PTSC characteristics � are given by pointing to the fundamental emotional side of the mirror function that finds its material representation in organizational systems such as a professional team sports club.

AB  - The main purpose of this study was to explore preschool teachers' ratings of both the-perceived importance of and their comfort levels implementing interventions for children with AD/HD. Participants included 138 teachers from licensed child care facilities. Teachers completed a questionnaire that required them to rate, on a 7-point Likert-type scale, the importance of 43 interventions and how comfortable they would be executing the strategy if asked to do so in the classroom. Overall, teachers concluded that the majority of the interventions were mostly important and believed they would be comfortable using the strategies. In addition, findings indicated that preschool teachers' importance and comfort ratings were highly correlated. Teacher variables (i.e., years of teaching experience, educational level, and having a student with AD/HD) were not correlated with, or discriminative of, comfort and importance ratings. The implications of these findings are discussed. (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - School professionals need to be prepared to support children with emotional and behavioral problems. Teachers in particular should be aware of the resources provided by their school as well as the evidence-based practices available to support children with behavioral problems. This study explored general education teachers' knowledge of 10 evidence-based interventions as well as resources and data collected at their schools to support children with mental health problems. Participants included 239 general educators from 5 school districts. Overall, most teachers had not heard of 9 out of 10 of the evidence-based programs presented. Teachers were also not sure whether their schools provided specific assessments and interventions to support children. One particularly noteworthy finding was that 57% of teachers were not sure whether their schools provided functional behavioral assessment and intervention planning. Findings illuminate a need for continued work in this area. [ABSTRACT FROM)

AB  - This study examines factors related to engagement in the services offered by police officer-advocate teams on the basis of police and clinical records for 301 female victims referred to the Domestic Violence Home Visit Intervention (DVHVI) program. The authors find that the severity of intimate partner violence charges and ethnicity of the victim, advocate, and police officer are all significantly related to engagement in the DVHVI, with Hispanic women served by Hispanic advocate-officer teams more engaged in services than African American or Caucasian women. The data suggest that this intervention model may be particularly beneficial for Hispanic victims of intimate partner violence when implemented by a Spanish-speaking officer-advocate team.

AB  - The technology policies included on instructors' syllabi vary greatly and, in some cases, may unfavorably influence students' perceptions of the instructor. To examine this hypothesis, we randomly assigned college students enrolled in psychology courses at two different institutions (N = 163) to groups in which they viewed different syllabi for a community psychology course. The syllabi varied by the hypothetical instructor's technology policy (encouraging of appropriate technology use in the classroom, discouraging of all technology use, or a mixture of both) and instructor gender. Results showed that students rated instructors similarly on the Competency/Communication factor across all conditions but rated them significantly lower on the Rapport factor when the syllabus included a discouraging technology policy. Rapport ratings were also associated with students' self-reported dependence on technology. High instructor Rapport was associated with high levels of students' technology dependency in the encouraging technology policy condition (r = 0.29, p < 0.05), but low levels of technology dependency in the discouraging condition (r = -0.31, p < 0.05). Our findings suggest that if instructors include technology policies on their syllabi that restrict inappropriate technology use, they should also indicate situations in which technology use is appropriate.

AB  - Pathfinders are problem-solving, adaptive learning systems. The pathfinder approach is an established strategy for bringing about change in complex situations. In the context of complex initiatives such as Getting it right for every child the pathfinder approach works well when there is a genuine partnership between central government, local government, all the different services and agencies participating in the partnership and the pathfinder development team. The pathfinder area in Highland comprised the city of Inverness and its immediate hinterland. The evaluation began in late 2006 and has been carried out by a team seconded to the Scottish Government Getting it right team from the University of Edinburgh. Initially the evaluation focused on the development and implementation phases in the Highland pathfinder area. The aim here was to focus on the policies, strategic planning processes, governance and strategic management, the delivery frameworks and the development and implementation of a practice model and accompanying guidance and training for practitioners to support them in delivering the Getting it right approach. Evaluation data were gathered through the following methods: interviews with a wide range of practitioners in all the relevant services and agencies; interviews with strategic and operational managers in those services and agencies; analysis of the documentation that emerged to support the change process; observations of meetings where children’s needs were assessed and plans were developed and reviewed; observations of a sample of training sessions for Lead Professionals and Named Persons; focus group discussions with service groups of practitioners and multiagency groups; an evaluation of samples of completed records and plans for children and young people from 0 to 16 years, with a diversity of needs and concerns. Once the new systems, procedures, pathways and practices had been implemented within the pathfinder area the focus of the evaluation shifted to gathering evidence on: the extent to which practitioners are using the new processes and systems, how the new processes are making a difference to children and families, and how the training programme, processes and tools transfer to other parts of the host authority when Getting it right is rolled out.

AB  - Researchers engaged in a collaborative, yearlong study with a seventh-grade language arts teacher who integrated activities to enhance students' understanding of mindsets with content instruction. Lessons emphasized four aspects of mindsets: belief that learning abilities can grow with the investment of effort, willingness to address challenging tasks and persevere, development of stronger learning strategies, and ability to articulate connections between effort and accomplishment. During the school year, the team observed lessons, gathered work samples, and conducted interviews with 12 students. Work samples showed that most students articulated a general understanding of the concepts related to mindset emphasized during instruction. Case studies documented patterns and differences in ways students articulated connections among concepts. Although limited by sample size, results suggested that seventh graders can understand the construct of mindsets, especially when offered guidance and support. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The positive outcomes of coordination of healthcare services are to an increasing extent becoming clear. However the complexity of the field is an inhibiting factor for vigorously designed trial studies. Conceptual clarity and a consistent theoretical frame-work are thus needed. While researchers respond to these needs, patients and providers face the multiple challenges of today's healthcare environment. Decision makers, planners and managers need evidence based policy options and information on the scope of the integrated care challenges they are facing. The US managed care organization Kaiser Permanente has been put forward as an example for European healthcare systems to follow, although the evidence base is far from conclusive. The thesis has five objectives: 1) To contribute to the understanding of the concept of integration in healthcare systems and to identify measurement methods to capture the multi-dimensional aspects of integrated healthcare delivery. 2) To assess the level of integration of the Danish healthcare system. 3) To assess the use of joint health plans as a tool for coordination between the regional and local level in the Danish healthcare system. 4) To compare the inputs and performance of the Danish healthcare system and the managed care organization Kaiser Permanente, California, US. 5) To compare primary care clinicians' perception of clinical integration in two healthcare systems: Kaiser Permanente, Northern California and the Danish healthcare system. Further to examine the associations between specific organizational factors and clinical integration within each system. The literature was systematically searched to identify methods for measurement of integrated healthcare delivery. A national cross-sectional survey was conducted among major professional stake-holders at five different levels of the Danish healthcare system. The survey data were used to allow for analysis of the level of integration achieved. Data from the survey were additionally used to investigate the use of joint health planning as a tool for coordination of regional-local healthcare delivery. Analysis of secondary data from the Danish healthcare system and Kaiser Permanente, California were used to compare population characteristics, professional staff, delivery structure, utilisation, quality measures and direct costs. A cross-sectional survey among primary care clinicians in Denmark and in Kaiser Permanente, Northern California was completed to allow for comparison of clinical integration in the two systems and system specific associated factors. In this thesis a conceptual framework and a model for assessment of the conditions for integrations as an intermediate healthcare system outcome are presented. Furthermore, the results show that integrated healthcare delivery can be measured: 24 methods are available and some are highly developed. However, the field is still in its early phase and guidelines for how to proceed are devised. It was confirmed on a national level that integration of care is a widespread challenge, and that only half or less than half of patients in need of integrated services receive such care. Options for decision makers and managers are discussed. From a theoretical perspective joint health plans as applied in Denmark do not match the degree of complexity in the healthcare system. It was therefore in agreement with the theoretical findings when major stakeholders agreed that the joint health plans had not been effective as a tool for coordination. Joint health planning processes should actively engage all stakeholders and a high degree of recurrent feedback are warranted. When comparing Kaiser Permanente, California with the Danish healthcare system, our study suggest that Kaiser Permanente has a population with more documented disease and higher operating costs, and performs better than the Danish healthcare system on the observed quality measures. Substantial differences were found in the perception of clinical integration in the two settings. More primary care clinicians in the Northern California region of Kaiser Permanente reported being part of a clinical integrated environment than did Danish general practitioners. By measuring the level of clinical integration in Kaiser Permanente using the Danish healthcare system as a point of reference our findings support the literature that points to the importance of integrated healthcare delivery as a driver for the performance results of Kaiser Permanente. However caution must be advised before making concrete conclusions due to the complexity of the matter and until more studies have been conducted. With this thesis an initial step has been taken into a new research field. Ongoing research will make it possible to deliver the evidence needed by decision makers, planners and managers - ultimately to benefit the patients.

AB  - Aim The aim of this study was to describe a study protocol for a study evaluating the effectiveness of a mobile cooperation intervention to improve students' competence level, self-efficacy in clinical performance and satisfaction with the clinical learning environment. Background Nursing student-nurse teacher cooperation during the clinical practicum has a vital role in promoting the learning of students. Despite an increasing interest in using mobile technologies to improve the clinical practicum of students, there is limited robust evidence regarding their effectiveness. Design A multicentre, parallel group, randomized, controlled, pragmatic, superiority trial. Methods Second-year pre-registration nursing students who are beginning a clinical practicum will be recruited from one university of applied sciences. Eligible students will be randomly allocated to either a control group (engaging in standard cooperation) or an intervention group (engaging in mobile cooperation) for the 5-week the clinical practicum. The complex mobile cooperation intervention comprises of a mobile application-assisted, nursing student-nurse teacher cooperation and a training in the functions of the mobile application. The primary outcome is competence. The secondary outcomes include self-efficacy in clinical performance and satisfaction with the clinical learning environment. Moreover, a process evaluation will be undertaken. The ethical approval for this study was obtained in December 2014 and the study received funding in 2015. Discussion The results of this study will provide robust evidence on mobile cooperation during the clinical practicum, a research topic that has not been consistently studied to date.

AB  - Objectives: To identify and appraise study findings on the use of mobile devices, in particular for what purposes and how, in nursing student-nurse teacher cooperation during the clinical practicum. Data Sources: A systematic literature search was conducted using the PubMed/Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO and ERIC for primary empirical studies published in English. Review Methods: An integrative literature review was undertaken. Quality appraisal of the included studies was conducted using design-specific standardized checklists. Studies were thematically analyzed. Results: Based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, eleven studies were included in the review. Weaknesses in designs, samples, questionnaires and results, compromised comparison and/or generalization of the findings of the studies. Three main themes were identified: (1) features of mobile devices (2) utility of mobile devices and (3) barriers to the use of mobile devices. Problems of connectivity were the main challenges reported in the use of mobile devices. Participants used mobile devices primarily as reference tools, but less frequently as tools for reflection, assessment or cooperation during the clinical practicum. Interest in mobile device use during the clinical practicum was reported, but training and ongoing support are needed. Conclusions: As only a small number of eligible primary empirical studies were found, it is not possible to draw firm conclusions on the results. In the future, rigorous primary empirical studies are needed to explore the potential of mobile devices in providing a supplementary pedagogical method in nursing student-nurse teacher cooperation during the clinical practicum. Robust study designs, including experimental ones, are clearly needed to assess the effectiveness of mobile devices in nursing student-nurse teacher cooperation during the clinical practicum.

Data for this case study were collected in the form of fieldnotes, interviews, and focus group discussions in a Ugandan primary school. The findings indicate that the use of stories expands the repertoire of teaching methods and topics, and that this use is influenced by teachers' social capital, financial factors, and policies. This exploration of teachers' resourcefulness, needs, and realities provides a foundation for enhancing existing practices. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Research Findings: This study evaluated the impact of a self-monitoring intervention on preschool teachers' use of language and on children's language growth. Nineteen classrooms from Santiago de Chile participated (10 intervention, 9 control). Twice a week, intervention teachers filled out a checklist to monitor the language stimulation they offered children. Research personnel used the checklists to elaborate a monthly summary of the language opportunities offered to each child in that month and discussed this information with teachers. Results revealed a significant advantage for intervention teachers in frequency of book readings and word discussions but not on children's language growth. Dosage analyses showed that children identified by the self-monitoring device as receiving more language-learning opportunities improved significantly more from beginning to end of the school year in receptive vocabulary. Practice or Policy: Contextual barriers such as large numbers of children and unawareness of the impact of some language interactions can prevent teachers from engaging in important practices. Reminding teachers of the importance of those practices and helping them monitor their frequency may be a low-cost way of improving language opportunities for children in contexts where more intensive professional development is not possible.

AB  - Research Findings: This study examines the association between preschool classroom activity and the quality of the language spoken by teachers and children. Eighteen classrooms serving low-income children between the ages of 3 and 4 in Santiago de Chile were audio-recorded during one morning shift. Recordings were transcribed and segmented into activities (greeting, learning experience, book sharing, book discussion, breakfast, lunch, free play and other noninstructional time). A total of 113 activity segments were identified. Characteristics of teacher and child language were measured in each segment. Differences between the eight activities were examined using analysis of variance. Activities were classified as instructional or noninstructional, and the association between this dimension and language characteristics was examined using multilevel path analysis. Results show that most of the variance in language outcomes occurs within classrooms. Analyses show that a significant portion of the variance in the way teachers and children talk is explained by the instructional/noninstructional dimension. Instructional activities are characterized by more language stimulation, more teaching, fewer directives, and more child talk than noninstructional activities. Practice or Policy Implications: We discuss implications for teacher professional development and early childhood education improvement in general and for Latin-America specifically.

AB  - This action research enquiry interrogates my own teaching practices in the context of new cultures of pedagogy in Bhutan. Teaching at the tertiary level for the last 11 years, I have realised that student engagement, particularly behavioural and cognitive engagement, has not been satisfactory. This motivated me to undertake an action enquiry to improve my teaching to engage student-teachers more in their own learning. The analysis of baseline survey data collected from a class of 29 final-year Bachelor of Education Primary pre-service student-teachers in a curriculum studies module confirmed three areas of concern about my capacity to encourage student engagement: lack of open communication in my classes, lack of care and concern, and inability to provide active learning opportunities. I implemented intervention strategies in my teaching to address these concerns. Ongoing data about the effectiveness of the intervention strategies were collected through observations of lessons by a critical friend and by maintaining a self-reflective diary. Post-intervention data were gathered using the same questionnaire, through interviews conducted by a critical friend with four randomly selected student-teachers and research diaries. I have noticed measurable improvement in all three areas of concern that facilitated enhancement of both behavioural and cognitive engagements of student-teachers. However, I also realise that there is still room for improvement in the areas of motivating students to change their mindset about activity-based teaching and the need for me to show more interest in their personal and professional problems.

AB  - Background: The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends influenza vaccinations for all children 6 months to 18 years of age, which includes school-aged children. Influenza immunization programs may benefit schools by reducing absenteeism. Methods: A systematic literature review of PubMed, PsychLit, and Dissertation Abstracts available as of January 7, 2008, was conducted for school-located vaccinations, using search words "School Health Services" and "Immunization Programs"; limited to "Child" (6-12 years) and "Adolescent" (13-18 years) for PubMed and "mass or universal" and (immuniz* or immunis* or vaccin*) and (school or Child or Adolescen*) for PsychLit and Dissertation Abstracts. Fifty-nine studies met the criteria for review. Results: Strategies such as incentives, education, the design of the consent form, and follow-up can increase parental consent and number of returned forms. Minimizing out-of-pocket cost, offering both the intramuscular (shot) and intranasal (nasal spray) vaccination, and using reminders can increase vaccination coverage among those whose parents consented. Finally, organization, communication, and planning can minimize the logistical challenges. Conclusions: Schools-based vaccination programs are a promising option for achieving the expanded ACIP recommendation; school-located vaccination programs are feasible and effective. Adhering to lessons from the peer-reviewed scientific literature may help public health officials and schools implement the expanded recommendation to provide the greatest benefit for the lowest cost. Given the potential benefits of the expanded recommendation, both directly to the vaccinated children and indirectly to the community, prospective, well-controlled trials to establish the cost-effectiveness of specific vaccination strategies should be high priorities for future research.

AB  - Young children with special needs and their families often experience transitions across multiple environments in the early childhood years. Many transitions are identified as stressful for children and families. In the present study, a series of focus groups involving administrators, practitioners, and family members were held around the United States to identify transition practices that have been implemented effectively for children, families, staff, administrators, and communities. Two major themes emerged from the data: critical interagency variables, defined as strategies that support an interagency process involving multiple parties; and transition practices and activities, defined as practices that address child, family, staff, program, and community-specific activities. Outcomes from these focus groups included identification of transition strategies for young children with special needs that are considered valuable by parents, providers, and administrators and that are consistent with theoretical frameworks described in the transition literature.

AB  - Weight-Based Victimization is a frequent experience for adolescents who are overweight or obese, and is associated with numerous psychosocial and physical consequences for those who are targets of victimization. Assessing targets' preferences for different types of support and intervention has been absent in the context of weight-based victimization, but is needed to help inform potential interventions, motivate action, and identify strategies to help adolescents cope with experiences of weight-related teasing or bullying. Adolescents (14-18 years, N = 361, 40% female, 71% Caucasian) enrolled in national weight-loss camps completed an on-line survey. Participants who reported previous experiences of weight-based victimization were surveyed about their preferred interventions from peers, friends, teachers, Physical Education (PE) teachers/coaches, and parents. Participants indicated their preferences for specific strategies pertaining to target support, bullying intervention and prevention (e.g., inclusion in peer activities, confronting the bully, telling an adult, and improving anti-bullying policies). Friends (66%) and peers (58%) were the most highly preferred intervention agents followed by teachers (55%), PE teachers/coaches (44%), and parents (43%). Participants who experienced more weight-based victimization expressed increased desire for intervention. The frequency of victimization, social support from friends and family, and perceived likelihood and helpfulness of intervention significantly influenced participant preferences for certain types of intervention, although preferences were generally consistent across participants' characteristics. The current study is the first to document youth's preferences for interventions in response to weight-based victimization. The findings have important implications for encouraging appropriate intervention and informing bystanders, which may help to reduce the prevalence, recurrence, and consequences for youth who are targets of weight-based teasing or bullying.

AB  - The study was conducted to investigate the effect of increasing balanced dietary protein for hyper-prolific lactating sows. In total 544 sows (parity 1–4) was allotted to one of six diets from day 2 post-partum until weaning. The diets were analyzed to have a standardized ileal digestible (SID) crude protein (CP) level of 104.3, 113.3, 120.9, 128.5, 139.2 or 150.0 g/kg. At d 2 post-partum litters were standardized to 14 piglets and body weight (BW), back fat (BF) thickness of sows and litter weight were recorded. Body weight, BF thickness and litter weight was also recorded at weaning. On a subsample of 70 sows (parity 2 and 3) milk samples were obtained at day 3, 10 and 17 post-partum and analyzed for fat, CP and lactose. In the analysis of the dose-response data the dietary SID CP concentration were used as explanatory variable. The abovementioned response variables were fitted with linear broken-line, quadratic broken-line and linear regression models. Sow BW and BF loss reached a break point at 143 g SID CP/kg and 127 g SID CP/kg, where sows lost 0.58 kg/d and 3 mm, respectively (P < 0.001). Multiparous sows had a higher average daily gain of the litter than first parity sows (3.07 vs. 2.53 kg/d) at the break point at 135 g SID CP/kg (P < 0.001), but litter size (13.0 ± 1.2 piglets) at weaning was unaffected by dietary treatment (P = 0.30). Milk CP increased to 5.0 g/100 mL until a breakpoint at 136 g SID CP/kg, milk lactose decreased until a breakpoint at 120 g SID CP/kg to 5.3 g/100 mL (P < 0.001) and milk fat increased linearly (P < 0.05). The daily output of milk protein was increased at day 17 until a breakpoint at 130 g SID CP/kg (663–670 g/d; P < 0.001). The content of milk fat increased linearly with increasing dietary SID CP (P < 0.05). There was a tendency towards an increased number of total born piglets in next litter with increased dietary SID CP (P = 0.06), whereas the weaning-to-estrus interval was unaffected by treatment (P = 0.83). In conclusion, increasing dietary SID CP up till 135 g/kg or 850 g SID CP/d increased ADG of the litter, and this increase was caused by increased milk yield and increased daily protein output in milk.

AB  - Computer programming tools for young children are being created and used in early childhood classrooms more than ever. However, little is known about the relationship between a teacher's unique instructional style and their students' ability to explore and retain programming content. In this mixed-methods study, quantitative and qualitative data were collected from N = 6 teachers and N = 222 Kindergarten through second grade students at six schools across the United States. These teachers and students participated in an investigation of the relationship between teaching styles and student learning outcomes. All participants engaged in a minimum of two lessons and a maximum of seven lessons using the ScratchJr programming environment to introduce coding. Teachers reported on their classroom structure, lesson plan, teaching style and comfort with technology. They also administered ScratchJr Solve It assessments to capture various aspects of students' programming comprehension, which were analyzed for trends in learning outcomes. Results from this descriptive, exploratory study show that all students were successful in attaining foundational ScratchJr programming comprehension. Statistically significant findings revealed higher programming achievement in students whose educators demonstrated flexibility in lesson planning, responsiveness to student needs, technological content expertise, and concern for developing students' independent thinking. Implications for research in the development of computational thinking strategies are discussed, as well as suggestions for successfully implementing early childhood classroom interventions with ScratchJr.

AB  - In most physical education (PE) syllabuses, promoting life skills constitutes an important educational objective. The aim of this study was to implement a coping training program (EPHECT) within regular PE and to evaluate its effects on coping and stress among vocational students. Eight classes from a vocational school were selected for study; four were allocated to the intervention group (IG) and four to the control group (CG). The study examined intervention effects between pre- and post-intervention, and postintervention and 6-months follow-up. Compared to the CG, the IG showed improved coping skills from pre- to post-intervention. From post-intervention to follow-up, stress decreased for the IG. A path analysis suggests an indirect effect on stress perception at follow-up via improved adaptive coping skills. The findings support EPHECT as a positive contribution to the development of adaptive coping skills. The project further shows how physical educators can translate psychological theory into practice.

AB  - This paper reports on a case study of the teacher's role as facilitator in computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) settings in science. In naturalistic classroom settings, the teacher most often acts as an important resource and provides various forms of guidance during students' learning activities. Few studies, however, have focused on the role of teacher intervention in CSCL settings. By analyzing the interactions between secondary school students and their teacher during a science project, the current study provides insight into the concerns that teachers might encounter when facilitating students' learning processes in these types of settings. The analyses show that one main concern was creating a balance between providing the requested information and supporting students in utilizing each other's knowledge and understanding. Another concern was balancing support on an individual versus group level, and a third concern was directing the students' attention to coexisting conceptual perspectives. Most importantly, however, the analyses show how teacher intervention constitutes the pivotal glue that aids students in linking and using coexisting aspects of support such as peer collaboration, digital tools, and instructional design.

AB  - As part of a multiyear research study on the preparation of educators to use assessment data for instructional improvement, the present study is a pilot test of a research-based professional development intervention for career-technical teachers. Forty-eight educators at nine sites in five states participated in a 1-day workshop followed by several months of mentoring either on site, by teleconference, or website. To extend the professional learning of the workshop, educators were mentored for several months as they developed a plan for instructional improvement. To complement the mentoring, a project-specific website was the focus of a community of practice where the participants could exchange information and create threaded discussions about the process of data-driven instructional improvement. Educators need an orientation to the website features, reinforcement for their online interactions, and specific activities to complete in a timeframe if they are to use web-based professional learning communities to the fullest.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the impact on high school students of a video-based antistigma program portraying real life experiences of individuals with schizophrenia and lesson plans to guide classroom discussions and active learning. Method: We used a pre- and posttest design to measure the short-term impact of the program on student's knowledge of schizophrenia and its treatment as well as students' self-reported socially distancing behaviours. Participants (571 students) were from 8 high schools across Canada. Results: Following the Reaching Out antistigma program, high school students were significantly more knowledgeable and less socially distancing. Impact also varied by age group and sex. Conclusions: Video-based antistigma programs are comparable to programs that deliver educational messages through direct contact with individuals with mental illnesses. Video-based programs are more easily disseminated on a broad scale. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Recent years have seen increasing interest in and attention to evidence-based practices, where the 'evidence' generally comes from well-conducted randomized trials. However, while those trials yield accurate estimates of the effect of the intervention for the participants in the trial (known as 'internal validity'), they do not always yield relevant information about the effects in a particular target population (known as 'external validity'). This may be due to a lack of specification of a target population when designing the trial, difficulties recruiting a sample that is representative of a prespecified target population, or to interest in considering a target population somewhat different from the population directly targeted by the trial. This paper first provides an overview of existing design and analysis methods for assessing and enhancing the ability of a randomized trial to estimate treatment effects in a target population. It then provides a case study using one particular method, which weights the subjects in a randomized trial to match the population on a set of observed characteristics. The case study uses data from a randomized trial of school-wide positive behavioral interventions and supports (PBIS); our interest is in generalizing the results to the state of Maryland. In the case of PBIS, after weighting, estimated effects in the target population were similar to those observed in the randomized trial. The paper illustrates that statistical methods can be used to assess and enhance the external validity of randomized trials, making the results more applicable to policy and clinical questions. However, there are also many open research questions; future research should focus on questions of treatment effect heterogeneity and further developing these methods for enhancing external validity. Researchers should think carefully about the external validity of randomized trials and be cautious about extrapolating results to specific populations unless they are confident of the similarity between the trial sample and that target population.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study is to test whether participation in the Smoke-Free Class Competition (SFC), a classroom-based smoking prevention program, reduced smoking and increased smoking-related knowledge among those with and without smoking peers compared to control groups. Method: Including smoking peers as a moderator in multilevel models, a quasi-experimental design with a post-test at seven months was used to analyze data from 1035 students in Switzerland (2011; mean age 13.3, 53.2% female). Results: Completing the SFC decreased smoking prevalence (OR = 0.7; CI = 0.5–1.0; ns) and increased smoking-related knowledge (b = 1.0; p < .01) compared to control classes. However, the former effect was only significant among those without smoking peers (OR = 0.3; CI = 0.2–0.5; p < .001). With smoking peers, smoking prevalence was even higher at post-test (OR = 3.7; CI = 1.7–8.2; p < .01) in the classes that completed SFC compared to controls. No effect was found in classes that started SFC but had to pull out. Conclusions: The results indicate that SFC should be applied early in adolescence, when individuals are less likely to have classmates who smoke and are therefore less likely to have to pull out of the program. This is particularly important because SFC was only effective among those who completed the program and did not have smoking peers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The term three-tier model of intervention is a model consisting of three well-defined and separate processes running on different levels within a system. In New Mexico, this principle has been applied to develop a model of student intervention for school-aged students. The model has three distinct levels of instructional interventions that account for all students within a learning system. Each tier encompasses a layer of intervention or instruction that responds to student needs. As a student has more intense learning or behavioral needs, he or she may progress to the next tier that provides more intense intervention. Tier I provides primary intervention in the form of universal screening, appropriate classroom instruction, and school-wide interventions to all students. The majority of school-aged students at this level will respond successfully in the regular education classroom to appropriate instruction based on state and district standards. Tier II is designed to provide early intervention for a small percentage of students who are performing above or below standards in academics and/or behavior. Interventions for these at-risk students either are provided as targeted individual interventions in one or more areas. That is done through a Student Assistance Team (SAT) Intervention Plan, a Section 504 Plan, or through a specialized school program that includes small-group instruction. Tier II interventions are provided in addition to the appropriate instruction provided in Tier I. The interventions are designed to prevent, alleviate, or accommodate challenges a student may be facing, and may be short-term or they may continue for an entire school year. Tier III serves a very small percentage of students who demonstrate a need for an individualized program to accommodate and/or modify their learning or behavioral needs. Special education teachers, related service providers, and regular education teachers provide Tier III interventions that consist of specially-designed instruction and supplementary aids and services. Tier III interventions are provided to a student through an Individualized Education Program (IEP). This guide discusses characteristics of successful interventions, major areas of need, sample strategies, SAT responsibilities, and reproducible forms for data collection and record keeping.

AB  - This paper describes lessons learnt whilst using an online peer review system in an undergraduate unit for pre-service teachers. In this unit, students learn to use information technologies as part of their future teaching practice. The unit aims to foster graduates who become lifelong reflective educators by providing opportunities to explore and reflect on how they might use technology in authentic learning situations. Whilst peer review is an appropriate activity for supporting critical thinking and reflective practice in this kind of unit, it requires a number of decisions to be made in relation to student preparation and support, implementation strategy, and technological infrastructure to make it work in specific contexts. Much research has been conducted in recent years to inform educators in making these decisions. However, there are still gaps in the research, particularly in how to improve the quality and consistency of feedback that students give to each other in their feedback. This paper describes the experiences of implementing an online peer review system aiming to improve quality and consistency of feedback. This exploration has revealed that we can learn much about ways to improve our teaching practices by giving students an opportunity to review each other's work and give feedback.

AB  - We systematically reviewed the data-based peer-reviewed research examining student service members/veterans (SSM/V) in higher education. Compared to civilian peers, SSM/V exhibit disproportionately higher rates of health risk behaviors and psychological symptoms, and personal and educational adjustment difficulties (i.e., inability to connect with peers and faculty on campus). Combat-related trauma is a contributing factor to these differences. The current evidence-base is scant, lacking nationally representative and/or longitudinal data to inform policies and programs for SSM/V.

AB  - Sunnyside High School in rural Washington faces many tough issues common to urban schools but has shown a remarkable ability to help students at risk for academic failure. The Sunnyside Intervention Program was developed for students with a history of poor academic performance, many of whom were involved in dangerous activities, including gangs. These students worked to retrieve credits in order to graduate on time, disengage from damaging environments and relationships, and begin to look to the future for what they wanted in life and how they were going to get there. In addition to addressing risk factors and cultivating resilience, the Intervention Program also provided opportunities for students to experience meaningful relationships, develop visions for the future, and participate in personally rewarding academic and extracurricular activities. After a review of salient research on risk and resilience, those dimensions are explored through student perceptions. Resilience research and student interviews reveal how relationships, a vision of the future, and meaningful participation in learning can transform troubled lives.

AB  - Northern Ireland has invested heavily in the use of technology enhanced learning at all levels of education. Alongside this, radical changes to the school curriculum and the planned move away from academic selection towards a more inclusive system are challenging those involved in Initial Teacher Education to find ways to improve teaching and learning for more inclusive classrooms. This study reviews a pilot programme that integrated problem-based and blended e-learning pedagogy to support student teachers learning in the area of special needs and inclusion education. Findings indicate that using a carefully constructed blended programme can effectively support key teaching and learning aspects of pre-service training and help develop skills in critical reflection. It also offers initial teacher educators in Northern Ireland insight into some of the most pressing problems experienced by student teachers during training, and provides a rationale for continued programme development.

AB  - In this conceptual article, we integrate existing literature on early school transitions, ecological systems theory, and student-teacher relationships to propose a framework for investigating the transition to school for children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). A review of the literature suggests that the quality of early student-teacher relationships may play an important role in this process for young children with ASD. Factors important in predicting student-teacher relationship quality, and ultimately, early school outcomes, are derived from the existing literature, which is heavily focused on the experiences of typically developing children. Hypothesized direct effects of child characteristics, teacher factors, classroom/school characteristics, and parent-school connectedness on student-teacher relationship quality are set forth. Potential moderators of the relation between student-teacher relationship quality and child outcomes are proposed, including child cognitive functioning, child relationships with other school staff, classroom placement, and parent involvement. Continued research on these factors will help identify malleable targets for school-based intervention with teachers and children with ASD to enhance student-teacher relationship quality and, in turn, school adjustment for this student population.

AB  - Students in a teacher training college in Israel have developed and taught curricula on the intelligent use of the Web. The educational programs were based on activities thematically related to the world of digital citizenship, such as the rights of the child and the Internet, identity theft, copyrights, freedom of expression and its limitations, etc. This study examines the characteristics, advantages and shortcomings of the educational approaches used by 180 students. Most of the students chose balanced approaches for developing and teaching curricula on the subject, relating both to the benefits and dangers of using the Web. Quite a few chose a negative critical approach focusing on the dangers and harmful effects of the Internet. A marginal minority chose a positive approach stressing only on the beneficial uses of the Web. In light of the analysis of the students' reflection questionnaires, it is able to identify those factors that assist and those that inhibit the teaching of the subject based on each of the approaches. In addition, recommendations were made for optimally adapting an approach for developing and teaching sub-topics of the curricula, which enhance the advantages and reduce the disadvantages of using web.

AB  - Students with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) demonstrate behavior that distracts other students and requires additional attention from the teacher. Their "acting out" often becomes a model for other students wanting the same amount of attention. As educators, one must learn to identify and then redirect negative behavior in ways that discourage and prevent it in the future. When a student moves through a crisis, different stages of negative behavior become apparent and teachers must learn to recognize the stages and respond appropriately. Wyka (1987) classifies the stages as: anxiety, defensive, acting out, intimidation, and tension reduction. Here, the author recommends steps for physical educators to be effective in establishing positive classroom management as one of the best ways to prevent negative behavior and potential crises.

AB  - This study reviews the definition of lifelong learning in the context of the European Union policy agenda as sets out in the Lisbon strategy. The paper also reports on the mental health service users' and trainers' perceptions of a "successful" lifelong learning training intervention. The work reported in this paper was part of a larger study which examines EMILIA lifelong learning training in one EMILIA demonstration site. The study interviewed a number of mental health service user-trainees and service user-trainers using focused group in order to get a deeper understanding of the experience and results--"success" or otherwise--of EMILIA training model as applied to adults with long-term mental illness. Analysis was based on an interpretative technique--specifically recursive abstraction--of the interviews. The results show that students (trainees) perceived the training intervention as successful because of students were involved in setting the "ground rules," prefer and enjoy varied teaching methods, had the opportunity to network socially and, more importantly, realised that by participating they could achieve and succeed on the course. The review part of the study suggests that, although the European Union, as indeed most member states, predicates lifelong learning policy on mainly economic factors--i.e. economic growth and jobs--tackling exclusion or promoting social inclusion remains a central plank of strategies for lifelong learning at both national and European levels.

AB  - This paper explores the intersection of reflection, journal writing and creativity. Undergraduate students who participated in a residential field camp were required to keep a creative reflective journal to demonstrate their theoretical and practical understandings of their experience. This study reports on the content analysis of 42 student journals and interviews with eight students that explored if and how an invitation to be creative in a reflective journaling assignment was appropriated or rejected (as evidenced by the content analysis) and experienced (as evidenced by the interviews) by students. Content analysis revealed that 14% of journals contained no creativity, 50% had basic levels of creativity, 31% had moderate levels and 5% had high levels. Interviews were analyzed using themes of relevance, ownership, control and innovation and provided insight into reasons why students did and did not use creativity to support their journals. In the discussion, the concepts of deep and surface approaches to learning provide some insightful explanation as to why students were creative in their reflective journal. This paper concludes by providing several support strategies to help students enhance their skills related to reflection, journal writing and creativity.

A growing body of literature reports on the positive features of international education, yet little attention has been focused on preparing social work programs and the faculty who lead them to handle the emergencies that can arise during study abroad. This paper uses a case study of an actual emergency in a study abroad program to examine how the event was handled and to assess its short- and long-term consequences. Elements of the case are analyzed in an effort to identify general issues for study abroad programs to consider.

AB  - This PhD study explores the long-recognized challenge of integrating social science knowledge into NRM public involvement practice theoretically and empirically. Theoretically, the study draws on research from adult learning, continuing rofessional education and professional knowledge development to better understand how social science knowledge can benefit NRM public involvement practice. Empirically, the study explores the potential of NRM continuing professional education as a means for introducing social science knowledge to public NRM professionals. The study finds social science knowledge can be of value to NRM public involvement prospectively and retrospectively; and that continuing professional education can be an effective means to introducing social science knowledge to public NRM professionals. In the design of NRM continuing professional education focused on social science knowledge for public involvement practice the study suggests the development of an eclectic mix of social science knowledge for public NRM professionals to work with interpretively; and linking public NRM professionals� practice-derived informal theories with the social science knowledge being introduced. While NRM continuing professional education is found to be a useful means for introducing social science knowledge to public NRM professionals the study also cautions that education is not a panacea for addressing all the public involvement challenges NRM professionals face.

AB  - Purpose: To be effective, evidence-based programs should be delivered as prescribed. This suggests that adaptations that deviate from intervention goals may limit a program's effectiveness. This study aims to examine the impact that number and quality of adaptations have on substance use outcomes. Design/methodology/approach: The authors examined 306 video recordings of teachers delivering "All Stars", a middle school drug prevention program. Multiple observers coded each recording, noting the number and type of adaptation each teacher made. Each adaptation was given a valence rating. Adaptations that were deleterious to program goals received negative valence ratings; positive ratings were given for adaptations that were likely to facilitate achievement of program goals; neutral ratings were given to adaptations that were expected to have neither a positive nor negative impact on program goals. Findings: All teachers made adaptations. Teachers were consistent across time in the types of adaptations they made, suggesting each teacher has a personalized style of adapting. Those who made few adaptations, and whose average adaptation was rated as being positive had a higher percentage of students who remained non-drug users. In contrast, teachers who made many adaptations, whether their average valence rating was positive, neutral or negative, failed to have as many students remain non-drug users. Measures of fidelity, including quality of delivery and teacher understanding, were related to valence of adaptations, with better performance related to making positive adaptations. Practical implications: Through training and supervision, teachers should be guided and encouraged to follow programs directions, making few adaptations and ensuring that adaptations that are made advance the goals of intervention. Programs should define acceptable and unacceptable ways they may be adapted. Originality/value: This study provides significant evidence about the challenges that face disseminated evidence-based programs. (Contains 7 tables and 1 note.

It also explores the impact that the intervention program had on children’s emotions while exploring these concepts and illustrates how it affected their behavior. The findings suggest that the intervention had a constructive impact on children’s understandings of grief and grieving along two important dimensions. First, the intervention helped children better define emotional responses to loss (grief). Second, children seemed to overcome their anxiety while talking about grief and grieving and were able to share relevant personal experiences. The study has important implications for curriculum development, pedagogical practice, and teacher training on death education.

AB  - In light of the strengthened position of dance in forthcoming changes in Swedish upper secondary school and teacher education, the present article deals with issues tied to the professionalization and education of dance teachers. Particular attention is paid to specific instances which eventually led to the establishment of a government-sponsored educational program in 1964. My aim is to highlight the changes, here understood as turning points, within the dance teaching area during parts of the twentieth century. These changes can be described in the form of three major themes: initiation, expansion, and establishment. The context under study is the Swedish one, but in close connection to international work in the area of dance and education.

AB  - This article highlights the problem of substance use and abuse among adolescents and discusses the important role of school leaders in addressing this problem. Drug and alcohol use among adolescents is a significant and serious problem. In fact, an alarmingly high number of students report that they have used drugs or alcohol. Substance use and abuse is societal problem that schools alone cannot fix, but they can play an important role in education, prevention, and intervention. School leaders can help students, parents, and staff members be aware of the risks associated with substance use and abuse, the ways of preventing students from using and abusing substances, and the treatment resources that are available for students who may need help. Principals also can collaborate with community service providers to ensure that school policies and programs are supported by community services. Their commitment to addressing substance use and abuse is integral to creating safe and productive learning environments for all students. Principals will be most effective if they take a proactive approach to drinking and substance use, empower faculty and staff members to implement evidence-based programs, and provide the resources necessary to support such programs.

AB  - Reviews the book, Teacher Preparation for Bilingual Student Populations: Educar Para Transformar edited by B. B. Flores, R. H. Sheets, and E. R. Clark (2010). This book point out, providing pre- and in-service teachers with the preparation necessary to serve bilingual and Latino/a students has long been a neglected area of scholarship. The book has many strengths as a text for graduate students in introductory bilingual education courses. Its scope is ambitious, covering many aspects of education in order to demonstrate how language and culture might be a relevant concern throughout the curriculum, a point which makes the text relevant to a wide audience of students potentially enrolling in such a course. The book links theory to practice quite effectively. However, it draws extensively on theoretical frameworks from sociocultural theory and critical pedagogy. To fully appreciate the arguments laid out in the book, graduate students should have a background in these theories. In addition to supplementary readings on sociocultural theory and critical pedagogy, the book also lacks readings critiquing the notion of culturally relevant pedagogy as essentializing identities, cultures, and ethnicities. Future teacher educators should keep these critiques in mind as they engage with ideas about drawing on students' cultures and identities in pedagogical practice. As a result, it would be advantageous to supplement the text with such readings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This final report describes the outcomes of a 3-year federally funded outreach project that was designed to increase access to quality center-based child care for infants and toddlers with disabilities. The project served 14 child care centers in West Virginia, 12 child care centers in Texas, 13 child care centers in Alabama and 6 child care centers in the Virgin Islands. A review of the relevant data sources showed that access to and enrollment in center-based child care for infants and toddlers with disabilities increased significantly in these programs during the three years of the project. These increases appeared to be related to four key outcomes: (1) changes in the attitudes of the program directors regarding the inclusion of young children with disabilities in typical settings; (2) an increase in collaborative relationships between local child care and early intervention programs; (3) changes in policies to reflect a commitment to inclusive child care, and; (4) changes in child care directors' perceptions of the competence of child care providers. The report includes a list of the project's dissemination activities, a discussion of the potential replicability of the project findings, recommendations for the future, and copies of 3 surveys used to evaluate the project.

AB  - Background. Existing research shows significant effects of pedometer interventions on students’ physical activity (PA). The current study investigates motivational aspects of quantitative increases in PA in the course of a school-based pedometer intervention for adolescents using qualitative data analysis. In addition, critical issues regarding pedometer use in adolescence were examined. Method. Data were obtained in the “läuft.” evaluation trial. Students of the intervention group received pedometers and took part in class competitions over a time period of 12 weeks. Qualitative data were collected through focus groups (n = 34) with students of the intervention group as well as through in-depth interviews with teachers (n = 33) who implemented the intervention. A grounded theory approach was used to analyze qualitative data. Results. Five major motivational aspects for subsequent increases in PA were examined among students participating in the “läuft.” PA program issues: (1) affordance of the pedometer, (2) awareness of the own PA, (3) self-determination with regard to time and type of PA, (4) individual goal setting, and (5) social comparison and competition. Conclusions. Findings provide a deeper understanding of which aspects of pedometer interventions might be especially important in adolescence and help design effective future interventions for the promotion of PA.

AB  - This meta-analysis summarizes empirical results on the correspondence between teachers' judgments of students' academic achievement and students' actual academic achievement. The article further investigates theoretically and methodologically relevant moderators of the correlation between the two measures. Overall, 75 studies reporting correlational data on the relationship between teachers' judgments of students' academic achievement and students' performance on a standardized achievement test were analyzed, including studies focusing on different school types, grade levels, and subject areas. The overall mean effect size was found to be .63. The effect sizes were moderated by use of informed versus uninformed teacher judgments, with use of informed judgments leading to a higher correspondence between teachers' judgments and students' academic achievement. A comprehensive model of teacher-based judgments of students' academic achievement is provided in the Discussion.

AB  - Background. Children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) are a heterogeneous group who have a marked impairment in the performance of functional skills. Provision for these children is usually made via a paediatrician through occupational or physiotherapy though, with a prevalence rate of 5%, regular provision is not possible due to limited professional resources. Aims. The study aimed to determine the extent to which parents and teachers, with guidance, can assist in the management of children with DCD; whether children with DCD are helped in this way and how this may contribute to our understanding of the condition. Sample. Thirty-one children with DCD aged 7 to 9 years participated in the study. Methods. Following assessment, individual profiles were developed and each week teachers and parents were given guidelines for working with the children and each child had three to four sessions a week lasting approximately for 20 minutes. In Phase 1, one group of children worked with teachers and the other group worked with parents. In Phase 2, the two groups of children swapped over. The children were assessed regularly throughout the project using the Movement ABC, together with diaries and comments from teachers and parents. Results. At the end of the 40-week study, 27 children showed significant improvement in their motor skills. Conclusions. Both teachers and parents were able to provide effective intervention for the majority of the children. It is possible that the children who did not improve have difficulties that are of a more complex type which require more specialist therapy to meet their need.

AB  - Suicide is the third leading cause of death in individuals ages 10 to 24. Researchers approximate that 17% to 29% of secondary school students seriously consider suicide and 8% attempt suicide. Students diagnosed with a disability may be at an even higher level of risk than their general education peers. Clearly knowing how to identify and how to access assistance for students considering suicide is important for those who work with all students. Although educators do not want their students to consider suicide as an option, they sometimes do. The purpose of this article is threefold: (1) to discuss suicide as it pertains to students diagnosed with high incidence disabilities; (2) to help special education teachers identify students at risk for suicide; and (3) to identify how special educators can help intervene when a student is considering suicide. Identification and intervention practices are illustrated through a case study of a hypothetical student, Marcia, and her teacher, Sarah.

AB  - School psychologists often are involved with the provision of services to students with chronic physical health conditions and mental health problems. However, collaborative efforts between school psychologists and the medical professionals who treat these youth often are lacking despite the benefits that may result from interdisciplinary collaboration. To address this disconnect, the authors discuss various ways school psychologists and medical professionals can collaborate to enhance the provision of services to youth with health and mental health problems in a response-to-intervention framework. Specifically, the authors discuss ways in which school psychologists can improve interdisciplinary collaboration across multiple tiers of service provision. In addition, the authors provide a case example to illustrate the benefits of interdisciplinary collaboration among school psychologists, allied health professionals, and physicians.

AB  - Millions of youth who attend schools in the United States suffer from clinically significant anxiety. Left untreated, these students often experience significant disruptions in their academic, social, and family functioning. Fortunately, promising treatments exist for childhood anxiety that are amenable for delivery in school settings. However, educational law and new service delivery paradigms such as response-to-intervention (RtI) affect the delivery of anxiety interventions. In light of extant laws and practices that govern education, this article discusses the provision of supportive services to address childhood anxiety. Specifically, this article reviews how RtI, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act guide service delivery and subsequently impact school-based anxiety treatments. Suggestions are provided to address childhood anxiety within a framework that allows for graduated and fluid service delivery. [ABSTRACT F)

AB  - Supporting the development of professional skills is a central role of professional degree programmes. This case study considers how one audiology degree programme implemented reflective writing to support student professional development during periods of practical training. In particular, the case considers how much and what type of reflection can be seen in the students’ reflective writing, and whether improvement in reflection based on formative feedback is a valid base for differential grading. An analysis of 72 pages of student reflective writing written during the final long period of practical training in the clinic showed that both the way reflective processes were taught and how it was to be assessed framed and limited the quality of the reflection. For example, the taught model of reflection was strictly followed and, in all cases, the catalyst chosen was the extraordinary event. On the basis of our analysis we propose that reflective writing to support professional development should not form part of a student’s assessment. Supporting the development of reflective skills without the stress of being assessed, we believe, will give the students space to reflect upon the everyday and feel less restrained by the taught model of reflection.

AB  - High prevalence rates of aggression during adolescence and associated adjustment difficulties for perpetrators and victims highlight the need for effective violence prevention programs. School-based prevention programs are advantageous as they occur in a key setting for youths' social and emotional development. The current study compared the efficacy of a combined universal violence prevention approach that included individual-level skill-building (i.e., lessons from Second Step) and school environment (i.e., Olweus Bullying Prevention Program; OBPP) interventions to OBPP alone. Participants were 231 sixth, seventh, and eighth graders (ages 11-15; M=12.6, SD=1.0) in middle school (48% male, 67% African American). A total of 14 classrooms were randomly assigned to the combined intervention (seven) or OBPP only comparison (seven) condition, split evenly across grades. Intervention effects were moderated by disability status and gender. Among students without disabilities those who received the combined intervention reported greater increases in anger regulation coping skills than those in the comparison condition. In contrast, among youth with disabilities greater increases in teacher-rated social skills were found for students in the combined intervention than students in the comparison condition at posttest. Gender-moderated effects included greater decreases in teacher ratings of externalizing problems and bullying behaviors for boys in the combined intervention versus the comparison condition at posttest. Study results inform school-based violence prevention programs and are discussed along with implications.

While librarians at The George Washington University’s Himmelfarb Health Sciences Library continue to provide traditional reference services, they have gone beyond their comfort zone in many cases to become involved in activities that are outside of the librarian’s established role. This article describes the current roles of Himmelfarb’s reference librarians, as well as the way these librarians prepared for these roles and addressed the associated challenges.

AB  - Background: Comprehensive School Health models offer a promising strategy to elicit changes in student health behaviours. To maximise the effect of such models, the active involvement of teachers and students in the change process is recommended. Objective: The goal of this project was to gain insight into the experiences and motivations of teachers and students involved in a choice-based Comprehensive School Health model - Health Promoting Secondary Schools (HPSS). Setting: School communities in British Columbia, Canada. Design and methods: HPSS engaged teachers and students in the planning and implementation of a whole-school health model aimed at improving the physical activity and eating behaviours of high school students. The intervention components were specifically informed by self-determination theory. A total of 23 teachers and 34 school committee members participated in focus group interviews. The minutes of planning meetings were collected throughout the intervention process. Results: Analysis of the data revealed five themes associated with participants' experiences and motivational processes: (a) lack of time for planning and preparation; (b) resources, workshops and collaboration; (c) teacher control impacts student engagement; (d) teacher job action inhibited implementation of HPSS action plans; and (e) choice-based design impacts participants' experiences. Conclusion: Findings from this study can facilitate future school-based projects by providing insights into student and teacher perspectives on the planning and implementation of school-based health promotion programmes and implementing choice-based educational change initiatives.

Seventy teacher participants will be randomly allocated into the CPD intervention and control groups. A total of 50-h of CPD will be completed by teachers during an eight-month period. Teachers will complete physical literacy and self-efficacy questionnaires prior to, and at the end of the CPD program. Following the completion of the PD program, teachers will deliver an 8-month curriculum intervention in schools focused on developing student physical literacy. Prior to, and following the curriculum intervention students will complete questionnaires on their physical literacy, motivation and enjoyment of PA and measured daily PA levels. Teachers' physical literacy and self-efficacy can be regarded as major determinants of effective physical education teaching, which in turn, influences students' physical literacy and PA participation.

AB  - Despite the increased worldwide acknowledgment of the importance of teachers' use of formative and/or summative assessment data to improve teaching and learning, empirical research on its impacts on student learning is sparse. Even more so is the lack of studies on the best ways for school leaders to develop teachers' capacity. Teachers generally have low efficacy in using student data to inform their day-to-day instructions. Teachers lack the basic skills to understand, interpret, and analyze data, develop instructional strategies based on data, and implement research-based instructional strategies in classrooms to address the weaknesses reflected from data analysis results. Any gap in this chain of instructional actions would lead to ineffective teaching and learning in classrooms. This study synthesizes research located from on-line databases on teachers' data use conducted in the last 14 years and examines the nature, impacts, and shapers of teachers' use of student formative and/or summative assessment data to improve teaching and learning. This review provides a much-needed guide to school leaders and policy makers in the USA, as well to other jurisdictions that want to make evidence-based decisions in the hopes of improving student learning and teachers' capacity in data use.

AB  - Hoping to spur dramatic school turnaround, the federal government channeled resources to the country's lowest-performing schools through School Improvement Grants (SIG). However, prior research on SIG effectiveness is limited and focuses primarily on student achievement. This study uses a difference-in-differences strategy to estimate program impacts on multiple dimensions across the 3-year duration of the SIG award in one urban school district. Following 2 years of modest improvement, we find pronounced, positive effects of SIG interventions on student achievement in Year 3, consistent with prior literature indicating that improvements from comprehensive school turnarounds emerge gradually. We also identify improvements indicating the process through which change occurred, including reduced unexcused absences, increased family preference for SIG schools, improved retention of effective teachers, and greater development of teacher professional capacity.

AB  - This paper focuses on several models of supervision in public schools with respect to needs in physical education. A literature review examined the traditional, counseling-based, self-analysis, competency-based, and systematic supervision models. Findings include the use of each model and the failure of each in the physical education setting. One systematic tool, the Academic Learning Time-Physical Education (ALT-PE) is presented; it measures the portion of time that a student is involved in motor activity at an appropriate success rate. This tool can best be used within the competency-based supervision system. A second tool, the "Qualitative Measures of Teaching Performance Scale (QMTPS)," helps to determine why some teachers are better at effecting student learning than other teachers. This instrument would be best used in clinical supervision and self-analysis models. The study concludes that the systematic supervision model is best for physical education because it combines the best aspects of all the models. Recommendations for the future of physical education in Mississippi are suggested. Appendices provide the two supervision tools (the ALT-PE and the QMTPS). (ND)

AB  - In a randomized controlled trial of a teacher data-use intervention, the Linking Study tested the impacts of a cyclical and collaborative process that linked teachers' data on instructional practice with data on their students' learning. This article describes the theory of the intervention and its roots in the literature as a backdrop for an intervention with 64 teachers in 27 professional learning communities and their students. The researchers found moderate and significant effects on external judgments of the quality of instruction caused by the intervention and small and marginally significant impacts on student performance on end-of-unit tests. There were no effects on teachers' perceptions of the importance of data or their self-reported proficiency using data. The article concludes with a discussion of the ways that data-use interventions might be strengthened to support instructional improvement and student learning.

School supports should include analysis of school plans and student strengths and needs to ensure that students with disabilities have the best opportunity to be safe in school crises. Recommendations include developing individual emergency and lockdown plans to provide procedures for explicit instruction and needed supports for students with disabilities during a crisis. Implications for such plans and support for their development are included.

However, this landscape is threatened by various problems. Here we analyze the relationships among Balinese teachers, student teachers, and students, and review their knowledge, attitudes, and experiences toward subaks. This study finds that most of the Balinese teachers, student teachers, and students had limited knowledge and experiences regarding subaks, although their overall attitudes were positive. We conclude by discussing the study's implications for relocating environmental education into the local context.

AB  - Response-to-intervention (RtI) models utilize a proactive, prevention approach that requires the implementation of a sophisticated, multi-tiered problem-solving process in the regular education environment. Effective and sustainable implementation of these models will necessitate a mechanism to support professional development, treatment fidelity, and the transportability of evidence-based interventions to the unique ecologies of individual school sites. This paper discusses problems related to the implementation of RtI models and outlines professional development issues related to implementation. A case is then made for the use of consultee-centered consultation, because of its focus on consultee development, to sustain the implementation and dissemination of RtI models in schools. The article ends with a presentation of how one RtI model, Instructional Consultation, integrates consultee-centered consultation into its implementation and professional development procedures.

Ss were a male special education teacher and 2 female and 7 male fifth-grade students (aged 10–11 yrs) in a self-contained classroom for students with EBD. Using an ABAB withdrawal design, the rate the teacher's behavior-specific praise was increased to a criterion level during each intervention phase. Results indicate that the students' on-task behavior increased when the teacher's behavior-specific praise increased and they decreased during the brief withdrawal phase. Implications for research and practice are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

Evidence-based programs designed to address these young children’s behavior problems exist, but there are a number of barriers to implementing these programs in early childhood settings. Advancing the science of treatment integrity measurement can assist researchers and consumers interested in implementing evidence-based programs in early childhood classrooms. To provide guidance for researchers interested in assessing the integrity of implementation efforts, we describe a conceptual model of implementation of evidence-based programs designed to prevent EBD when applied in early childhood settings. Next, we describe steps that can be used to develop treatment integrity measures.

AB  - Research has consistently linked early problem behavior with later adjustment problems, including antisocial behavior, learning problems and risk for the development of emotional/behavioral disorders (EBDs). Researchers have focused upon developing effective intervention programs for young children who arrive in preschool exhibiting chronic problem behaviors; however, Tier-2 interventions that can be delivered by teachers with fidelity in authentic settings are lacking. This study examined the effect of BEST in CLASS, a Tier-2 intervention delivered by teachers, on child problem behavior, teacher-child interactions and teacher-child relationships using a cluster randomized controlled trial design. Participants were 465 children (3-5 year olds) identified at risk for the development of EBDs and their 185 teachers from early childhood programs located in two southeastern states. Significant effects were found across both teacher reported (ES ranging from 0.23 to 0.42) and observed child outcomes (ES ranging form 0.44-0.46), as well as teacher-child relationships (ES ranging from 0.26 to 0.29) and observed teacher-children interactions (ES ranging from 0.26 to 0.45), favoring the BEST in CLASS condition. Results suggest the promise of BEST in CLASS as a Tier-2 intervention for use in authentic early childhood classroom contexts and provide implications for future research on transactional models of teacher and child behavior.

AB  - Teachers sometimes struggle to deliver evidence based programs designed to prevent and ameliorate chronic problem behaviors of young children with integrity. Identifying factors associated with variations in the quantity and quality of delivery is thus an important goal for the field. This study investigated factors associated with teacher treatment integrity of BEST in CLASS, a tier-2 prevention program designed for young children at risk for developing emotional/behavioral disorders. Ninety-two early childhood teachers and 231 young children at-risk for emotional/ behavioral disorders participated in the study. Latent growth curve analyses indicated that both adherence and competence of delivery increased across six observed time points. Results suggest that teacher education and initial levels of classroom quality may be important factors to consider when teachers deliver tier-2 (i.e., targeted to children who are not responsive to universal or tier-1 programming) prevention programs in early childhood settings. Teachers with higher levels of education delivered the program with more adherence and competence initially. Teachers with higher initial scores on the Emotional Support subscale of the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS) delivered the program with more competence initially and exhibited higher growth in both adherence and competence of delivery across time. Teachers with higher initial scores on the Classroom Organization subscale of the CLASS exhibited lower growth in adherence across time. Contrary to hypotheses, teacher self-efficacy did not predict adherence, and teachers who reported higher initial levels of Student Engagement self-efficacy exhibited lower growth in competence of delivery. Results are discussed in relation to teacher delivery of evidence-based programs in early childhood classrooms.

AB  - This study investigated if training and practice-based coaching in an evidence-based program was associated with higher observed treatment integrity (adherence and competence) and if these treatment integrity components were associated with teacher report of child behavioral outcomes in the BEST in CLASS efficacy trial. Participants were 462 children (M = 4.32 years, SD = 0.53; 65% male; 17.0% Caucasian, 66.0% African-American, 5.0% Hispanic, and 12.0% other) identified as having problem behavior and their 185 teachers (M = 12.09 years teaching experience; 99% female; 47.0% Caucasian, 48.0% African-American, 1.0% Asian/Pacific Islander, 3.0% Hispanic and 1.0% other). Teachers and focal children were randomly assigned to the intervention (teacher n = 92, children n = 230) or control condition (teacher n = 93, child n = 232). Results of a multilevel mediation analysis indicated that the BEST in CLASS intervention had a positive effect on teacher report of child problem behavior (SSIS-RS) and externalizing problems (C-TRF), as well as having a positive effect on teachers' adherence and competence of delivery of the intervention. There was an indirect effect through competence of delivery for externalizing problems, but not problem behavior. No indirect effects for adherence were found. Implications of these findings and directions for future research are discussed.

AB  - Developing effective interventions for students with challenging behaviors may require functional behavioral assessment (FBA), now mandated by IDEA ’97. While the assistance of students, parents, and teachers is crucial, it is the educational diagnostician who likely will be responsible for orchestrating the tasks involved in conducting a proper FBA. It stands to reason that diagnosticians, as assessment professionals, must be thoroughly knowledgeable about FBA. This article synthesizes available information from the special education literature about FBAs, including the law and FBA, working definitions, basic assumptions underlying FBA, the role of the diagnostician, the role of special educators, the steps to conducting an FBA, the methods of FBA, and tools for the diagnostician.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to review the limited literature on the emotional aspects of teachers' lives. First, a multicomponential perspective on emotions is described, then the existing literature on teachers' positive and negative emotions is reviewed and critiqued. Next is a summary of the literature suggesting that teachers' emotions influence teachers' and students' cognitions, motivation, and behaviors. Four areas for future research are proposed: management and discipline, adoption and use of teaching strategies, learning to teach, and teachers' motivation. An overview of research methods used in a multicomponential perspective on emotions is provided. This review draws on a variety of research literatures: educational psychology, social and personality psychology, educational sociology, and research on teachers and teaching.

AB  - This article focuses on teacher professional development (TPD) in natural science through the 5E model as mediating artifact. The study was conducted in an upper secondary school, grounded in a school-based intervention research project. My contribution to the field of research on TPD is founded on the hypothesis that teachers would be best facilitated to make their practice more inquiry based if they are provided with a mediating artifact. In this study the artifact is a model 5E, which is a conceptual way of thinking, to help teachers reflect on their practice. The aim is to encourage teachers to make changes themselves, by applying extended use of inquiry into their practice. This mediated artifact could thus be used across different national contexts. The main research question is;how can the 5E model as a mediating artifact enhance TPD?The article addresses the processes of the use of the 5E model and its influence on teachers’ perception of the model. This is in order for teache)

AB  - The aim of this study is to explore how mentors, in this case university supervisors and student teachers, make sense of their experience with the support of reflection on teaching practice during post-lesson group interviews (reflective seminars). Review of the literature suggests that there is little known specifically about how mentors and students perceive support of reflection. The perspective of seven university supervisors and eight student teachers is presented. One of the principal findings in the in-depth phenomenological analysis is that for trainees to be able to reflect during the seminars, it is necessary first to set up an alternative paradigm of teaching.

AB  - In this work, we examined the problem of preparing future faculty (graduate students) regarding their development in multiple roles, focusing on students in science and engineering disciplines. The purpose of the presented research was to address the questions, "Do graduate students believe that their current experiences align with the roles they will perform in their academic careers?" and "How do graduate students' perceptions of their professional roles change during the process of constructing portfolios?" We used the theoretical lens of role identity to guide this work; academic careers are typically categorized in terms of teaching, research, and service, which can be mapped as professional identity roles. We conducted a survey and focus groups with participants working through an ePortfolio development curriculum. Our findings suggest that there is a perception of misalignment between current and future roles, and that the construction of ePortfolios can be utilized to promote reflective practices leading to changed perceptions of those roles.

AB  - Reviews the book After the orphanage: Life beyond the children's home by Suellen Murray, John Murphy, Elizabeth Branigan and Jenny Malone (2009). One of the key recommendations of the Australian Senate’s 2004 report, Forgotten Australians, was that attention be paid to documenting the experiences of the more than 500,000 children who spent time in out-of-home care. After the orphanage is Victoria’s MacKillop Family Services response to this call. Funded by an ARC Linkage Grant, it draws on interviews, conducted by academics from RMIT, with 40 individuals who spent time in Catholic orphanages in the period 1945-1983, focusing on their experiences of life after ‘‘care’’. This review argues that social workers will gain much from reading this book. Although the large institutions which housed these informants no longer exist, the dilemmas around ‘‘care’’ remain. The 40 stories woven through After the orphanage are, the authors emphasize, individual, but they nevertheless reflect many of the issues which arise when families are disrupted and children, as young adults, are cast adrift in the world.

AB  - Early childhood teachers are often required to sing, which requires confidence. The purpose of the present study was to treat early childhood teachers who self-identified as uncertain singers using either a group singing (GS) approach, or a talking approach, based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). The aim of the study was to increase measures of singing confidence. Forty teachers enrolled in the workshops and were assigned to either ACT or GS. Overall it was found that both ACT and GS resulted in significant improvements in singing confidence. Both interventions were similar on increased confidence measures and the GS outperformed ACT on an overall rating of improvement in self-perceived tone-deafness. We suggest that the interventions had benefits for participants through the group experience itself; that being prepared for music increased their confidence, and that gaining some knowledge of singing techniques led to a sense of empowerment. Implications and future research are discussed.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the effectiveness of a paraprofessional home visitation program (HVP) to improve home safety and prevent injuries among children living in low-income settings. Methods: The HVP was implemented in two low-income communities in South Africa. In each community, approximately 200 households were randomly selected for the trial. Eligible households were those with children aged ≤10 years. Intervention households received four visits, one every two weeks, by trained paraprofessionals that focused on a specific injury topic and consisted of: information dissemination about specific injury prevention practices; home inspection accompanied by information about home hazards; and the supply of safety devices. The key outcomes to measure the presence of home hazards were scores for burns (safety practices, paraffin, and electrical), poisoning, and falls. Results: Significant reductions were found for injury risks related to burn safety practices. For injury risks related to electrical burns, paraffin burns, and poisoning, a decline was also noted although this was not statistically significant. No decline was noted for fall-related risks. Conclusions: Subject to further replication and evaluation, home visits by paraprofessionals providing safety education, home inspection, and safety devices be considered for integration into a comprehensive child injury prevention strategy in low-income communities.

AB  - Sociocultural and dialogic theories of education have identified the need to integrate both pedagogical content and language knowledge into teachers' professional development to promote effective interaction with students about subject content. In this intervention study, a meta-perspective on language was developed to understand how experienced teacher educators (N = 29) conceptualize ongoing language development in professional learning and teaching (referred to as language-developing learning in this study) as part of their pedagogical content knowledge. The data were analysed using content analysis. Language-developing learning was mainly conceived as teacher-oriented professional development. In this process, the language aspect was regarded not only as a tool that applies regulatory and explanatory language but also as a target that connects academic knowledge and interpersonally oriented language. The results increase our awareness of teacher educators' practical knowledge of academic and interpersonal language in specific disciplinary contexts of teacher professional development in higher education.

AB  - This study measured the effectiveness of a 9 a.m. nutrition break after it had been implemented for 1 academic year at an inner-city high school. Effectiveness was measured by student participation rates, student and teacher evaluations of hunger-associated symptoms experienced by students, and teacher evaluations of the effects on the learning environment. Sixty-nine percent of students participated. The most frequently cited reason for nonparticipation was dislike of the food offered (53%), with an additional 15% citing problems with food distribution. As the frequency of participation rose, the frequency of inability to focus, tiredness, stomachache, headache, and midmorning hunger fell. All of the associations were statistically significant except for headache. Seventy-four percent of staff stated that the nutrition break had positive effects on the learning environment, and 71% referred fewer students to the school nurse.

AB  - The KiVa Anti-Bullying Program (KiVa) seeks to meet the growing need for anti-bullying programming through a school-based, teacher-led intervention for elementary school children. The goals of this study were to examine how intervention dosage impacts outcomes of KiVa and how teacher factors influence dosage. Participants included 74 teachers and 1409 4th- and 5th-grade students in nine elementary schools. Teachers and students completed data collection at the beginning and end of the school year, including measures of bullying and victimization, correlates of victimization (depression, anxiety, peer rejection, withdrawal, and school avoidance), intervention cognitions/emotions (anti-bullying attitudes, and empathy toward victims), bystander behaviors, and teacher factors thought to relate to dosage (self-efficacy for teaching, professional burnout, perceived principal support, expected effectiveness of KiVa, perceived feasibility of KiVa). The dosage of KiVa delivered to classrooms was measured throughout the school year. Results highlight dosage as an important predictor of change in bullying, victimization, correlates of victimization, bystander behavior, and intervention cognitions/emotions. Of the teacher factors, professional burnout uniquely predicted intervention dosage. A comprehensive structural equation model linking professional burnout to dosage and then to child-level outcomes demonstrated good fit. Implications for intervention design and implementation are discussed.

Methods. Head Start families were divided into 4 groups based on passive smoke exposure and child chronic illness status. Analyses of covariance controlling for parent education, parent employment, marital status, and residence were conducted to identify group differences in the Family Map risk areas. Results. Families of chronically ill, passive smoke–exposed children demonstrated the highest levels of risks across a range of areas including: meeting basic needs, family conflict, parenting stress, and parental depression and anxiety. Conclusions. Children living in poverty with a chronic illness who are exposed to smoke are likely to face many challenges in addition to their illness.

AB  - Abstract Background Early childhood educators have the potential to influence children's dietary outcomes through daily interactions. However, existing research suggests that educator practices are often suboptimal. Previous research has often focused on individual characteristics that affect practices. There is less study of contextual influences of practices of early childhood educators. Objective The purpose of this study was to understand and describe contextual factors evident in narratives of early childhood educators influencing mealtime and nutrition promotion practices. We use the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services framework to consider how contextual factors related to practices of early childhood educators. Design This cross-sectional, qualitative study collected data through in-depth interviews with early childhood educators. Analyses of the data reflected a factist perspective and semantic approach to complete thematic content analysis of in-depth interviews. Participants The study used a stratified purposive sampling approach to recruit 28 educators to balance across educator role, agency type (Head Start vs state-funded), and obesity prevalence in the community. Early childhood educators were mostly lead teachers (62%), between the ages of 30 and 49 (82.1%), and white (75%) or African American (14.3%). Results The coders identified three primary themes: Mealtime Structures, Resources, and Classroom/Center Atmosphere. Mealtime Structures associated with detrimental practices included cafeteria meals with rigid schedules. Mealtime Structures associated with evidence-based practices (EBPs) included classroom meal service. Resources associated with detrimental practices included limited funding. Resources associated with EBPs included meals paid for early childhood educators and classroom food experiences. Classroom/Center Atmosphere factors associated with detrimental practices included poor food offerings and policies that conflicted (eg, allowing children to bring in outside foods). Classroom/Center Atmosphere factors associated with EBPs included clarity around meal service rules and healthy, appealing food offerings. Conclusions This study highlighted that it may be difficult for an early childhood educator to adopt and maintain EBPs in certain contexts. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Reviews the book, Visable Learning for Teachers Maximizing Impact on Learning by John Hattie (2012). This book is essentially a follow up to John Hattie’s earlier book, Visible Learning. This book expands on some aspects of the earlier research, and structures the information in a style that is more user friendly for teachers. Thus there are sections on preparing lessons, the start of lessons, the flow of lessons, the place of feedback in lessons and the end of lessons. The book contains step-by-step guidance on lesson preparation and student feedback. It offers checklists, exercises, case studies and best practice scenarios to assist in raising standards. It also contains whole school checklists and advice to school leaders. Most importantly all this advice is based firmly on evidence gathered by John Hattie and his team on exactly what has been shown to work. Although this book is aimed at trainee and practicing teachers it is also of immense value to educational psychologists. It reaffirms the central role of the teacher as the most important and influential figure in determining the success of children’s learning and behavior. Whether we are asked for advice about individual children, groups of children or to help at a whole school level this book will tell us not only what are the important variables we should be investigating but more importantly how best to advise teachers, parents and schools to improve the outcome for children.

AB  - Although links have been found between parents' and teachers' (caregivers') attitudes about aggressive behavior, their responses to aggressive behaviour in children, and those children's own use of aggressive behaviour, most research has focused on primary and secondary school contexts and has examined the influence of parents and teachers separately. The current study explored both parents' and teachers' beliefs and intervention strategies for relational and physical aggression in early childhood settings. Teachers ( N = 18; Mage = 34.8 years) and parents ( N = 68; Mage = 32.2 years) were presented with vignettes portraying relational and physical aggression. Following each vignette, their perceptions of the seriousness of the act, empathy for the victim, likelihood to intervene, and intervention strategies used to respond to each vignette were assessed. Teachers were also interviewed about examples of aggression that have been seen in preschool age children. Results indicated that caregivers viewed relational compared to physical aggression as more normative, and had less empathy for, and were less likely to intervene in instances of relationally aggressive behaviour. They also recommended more passive intervention strategies towards relationally aggressive children and more direct strategies towards physically aggressive children. Interview responses indicated that teachers perceived the primary cause of aggression to be related to developmental characteristics of the child. Implications for how these findings about adult-child interactions impact the development of relational and physical aggression are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The study aimed to identify participants' teaching preferences and the underlying reasons that support the implementation of the reproduction and production teaching approaches. Ten physical education (PE) teachers (6 males and 4 females) participated in the research. The phenomenological analysis indicated that the majority of the sampled PE teachers implemented the reproduction rather than the production approach. The findings revealed a pattern between the class goals the PE teachers' set as top priority and their teaching preferences. Furthermore, a variety of factors that influence their teaching preferences were identified including class management, time management, active time, discipline and students taking responsibility.

AB  - Background: Game-centred approaches (GCA) have been promoted as a more meaningful way to teach games and sports due to their connections with constructivist learning principles. However, the implementation is dependant on the teacher implementing it rather than just the model. There has been little research into what it means to use a GCA well and make judgements in relation to this. Purpose: The paper will focus on presenting the conceptualisation and development of the GCA assessment tool and demonstrating its use in action. Participants: The participants are third-year students in their fourth of five practical studies' courses in games and sports. Data collection: Data were collected during GCA lessons for fellow students in net court category. The exchanges were recorded on an iPod and categorised into "Emerging", "Developing" and "Developed" levels of use, based on aligning key characteristics of GCAs with principles evident in constructivist learning environments. Intervention: Physical education teacher educator (PETE) undergraduates were required to teach a mini lesson using a GCA in the fourth of five practical studies' courses and assessed using a systematic assessment tool that allowed judgements to be made in relation to levels of use. Research design: To understand how GCAs vary in use, an ethnomethodological approach was used. This allowed the author to demonstrate how the Scaffold was developed and used in practice. Data analysis: The data were analysed by the GCA Assessment Scaffold and used to show how this systematic assessment of GCA features and constructivist learning principles can be used in practice. Findings: The study examines the development and practical application of the GCA Assessment Scaffold in practice. It demonstrates that GCA lessons are reliant on the teacher using the model, not just the model and shows that lessons that have all of the features of GCA can either produce high quality-learning outcomes or shallow, depending on the teacher. Conclusion: The paper aims to begin a conversation on both how to assess GCA and how a further development of this tool can improve teaching practices in GCA and other constructivist teaching strategies.

AB  - Looked-after children and young people (LACYP) are educationally disadvantaged compared to the general population. A systematic review was conducted of randomised controlled trials evaluating interventions aimed at LACYP aged ≤18 years. Restrictions were not placed on delivery setting or delivery agent. Intervention outcomes were: academic skills; academic achievement and grade completion; special education status; homework completion; school attendance, suspension, and drop-out; number of school placements; teacher-student relationships; school behaviour; and academic attitudes. Fifteen studies reporting on 12 interventions met the inclusion criteria. Nine interventions demonstrated tentative impacts. However, evidence of effectiveness could not be ascertained due to variable methodological quality, as appraised by the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Theoretical and methodological recommendations are provided to enhance the development and evaluation of educational interventions. [ABSTRA)

AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of the combination of teacher-led feedback and peer review (TF + PR) and a single TF method on the writing performance of English as a foreign language (EFL) university students within a collaborative online learning system. The students' perceptions of the writing course were also examined. An experimental PR + TF group and a comparison TF group, with a total of 107 undergraduate students majoring in nursing, participated in this study during the fall semester of 2011. The results revealed that the students in the TF + PR group demonstrated greater improvements than those who received only TF in terms of holistic writing skills and the subscales of content, organization, grammar, mechanics, and style. The PR perceptions of the TF + PR group learners and the manner in which they adopted strategies for coping with peer feedback are discussed.

AB  - This article describes a group of Druze preschool and kindergarten teachers from Northern Israel who participated in an in-service course in their community. The focus of the training experience was to improve the social climate of the classroom by implementing a life-world approach. Analysis of their reports shows that the children’s meaningful learning, improved emotional coping with ordinary hardships, and mutual social support are a product of intervention that involves multiple, interrelated activity channels: staff collaboration, guided small group discussions, informal discussions, cooperation with parents and community agents, and free play. Each activity channel is associated with a compatible, dominant, learning modality and a predominant interpersonal process—free play, for example, is mainly associated with free inquiry and discourse among children, whereas group activity is also likely to be associated with learning guided by educators.

AB  - Transition services can be used to forge family, school, and community partnerships and foster a successful shift to adult life for students with intellectual disabilities (ID). School psychologists can play a valuable additive role in supporting the transition process due to their graduate training in interpersonal skills; consultation services; data-based decision-making; academic, social, and emotional interventions; and progress-monitoring. This paper introduces a three-phase cyclical intervention framework designed to improve comprehensive, evidence-based transition services for secondary students with ID by enhancing school psychologists' knowledge of transition practices. By utilizing the Transition Planning, Implementation, and Evaluation (TPIE) model, school psychologists can proactively work with students, families, school personnel, and community agencies to foster post-school success in youth with ID in all phases of the transition process. This paper will discuss the theory, structure, and implementation of the TPIE phases. Strategies to bridge the research to practice gap in transition service delivery will also be discussed.

AB  - THIS QUALITATIVE CASE STUDY explored the professional philosophies and experiences of preschool teachers and their support staff regarding the use of assistive technology devices (ATDs) in an early intervention inclusive preschool class. Using face-to-face individual interviews as data collection measures, the researchers aimed to understand these practitioners' teaching philosophies and experiences in terms of how they use ATDs with young children with disabilities in their class. A framework analysis of data identified three themes: establishing values for inclusive education, maintaining positive attitudes to overcoming challenges and orchestrating inclusive learning. The paper concluded that in order for the use of ATDs to thrive and make full impact on all children's learning and development, stronger frameworks for developing the inclusive values, philosophies, professional knowledge and practice principles of preschool teachers and their support staff are needed.

AB  - In global, short-life-cycle supply chains, the Make-to-Order (MTO) principle of purchasing is dominant in securing the match between customers� commitment and ordered goods. Risk can be addressed by linking knowledge on inbound logistics to the market by use of e-business solutions. This chapter describes a multi-method approach using both traditional B2B and B2C methods of sales initiatives as an e-business system connecting inbound and outbound supply chains. Initiatives can be reverse auctions, time limited discounts, co-selling, bundling, short campaigns supported with letters, e-mails, giveaways, discount schemes, and payment conditions. Interlinking is to secure full transparency at any given point in time. The discussed solution has the potential of diverting goods to retailers instead of warehouses with the probable effect of increasing revenue of both wholesale and retail with 5 � 10%. Concurrently, the attention created from selling on-ship creates side effects like higher store replenishment rate and attracts frequent shoppers interested in continuously new offerings.

AB  - Objective: This trial compared attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) treatment alone, intensive reading intervention alone, and their combination for children with ADHD and word reading difficulties and disabilities (RD). Method: Children (n = 216; predominantly African American males) in Grades 2-5 with ADHD and word reading/decoding deficits were randomized to ADHD treatment (medication + parent training), reading treatment (reading instruction), or combined ADHD + reading treatment. Outcomes were parent and teacher ADHD ratings and measures of word reading/decoding. Analyses utilized a mixed models covariate-adjusted gain score approach with posttest regressed onto pretest. Results: Inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity outcomes were significantly better in the ADHD (parent Hedges's g = .87/.75; teacher g = .67/.50) and combined (parent g = 1.06/.95; teacher g = .36/41) treatment groups than reading treatment alone; the ADHD and Combined groups did not differ significantly (parent g = .19/.20; teacher g = .31/.09). Word reading and decoding outcomes were significantly better in the reading (word reading g = .23; decoding g = .39) and combined (word reading g = .32; decoding g = .39) treatment groups than ADHD treatment alone; reading and combined groups did not differ (word reading g = .09; decoding g = .00). Significant group differences were maintained at the 3- to 5-month follow-up on all outcomes except word reading. Conclusions: Children with ADHD and RD benefit from specific treatment of each disorder. ADHD treatment is associated with more improvement in ADHD symptoms than RD treatment, and reading instruction is associated with better word reading and decoding outcomes than ADHD treatment. The additive value of combining treatments was not significant within disorder, but the combination allows treating both disorders simultaneously.

AB  - Previous research has identified numerous obstacles that counteract attempts to involve pupils in democratic processes in schools. Drawing from deliberative democratic theory and sociolinguistic research on dialogic teaching we discuss an intervention grounded on the ideas of deliberative communication and decision-making in an elementary classroom in Finland. We show that deliberative communication can provide pupils with opportunities for democratic participation. This process involves altering conventional classroom interactional patterns and the power processes they uphold. The possibilities of expanding deliberative communication from isolated democratic meetings to everyday schooling are considered.

AB  - After supervising nursery school teachers (N = 21) took an applied behavior analysis workshop at the Support Center for Developmental Disorders in Japan, immediate effects of the workshop on supervising teachers' support behavior and pervasive effects on the supervisee teachers' support behavior (praise for children's positive behavior) and the nursery school children's behavior were examined. The workshop, consisting of 3 weekly 3-hour sessions and a follow-up session 2 months later, trained the supervising teachers in behavioral definitions, direct behavioral observation, functional assessment, planning behavioral support, and implementing behavioral programs for the children in their schools who were exhibiting behavior problems. In the practicum, the participants each implemented the workshop contents with 1 child in their school who had behavioral problems. Immediate effects of the workshop were evaluated through questionnaires completed by the participants. To evaluate the pervasive effects of the workshop, observations of the behavior of the teachers supervised by the workshop participants and the children were conducted. The results indicate an increase in the use of praise for positive behavior not only by the workshop participants, but also by the supervisee teachers. The children's positive target behaviors improved, but the negative target behaviors did not. The present study suggests that an applied behavior analysis workshop for supervising nursery school teachers is an efficient and effective community-based intervention.

AB  - Aim: The aim of the present study was to examine the intervention effects of intensive interpersonal psychotherapy for depressed adolescents with suicidal risk (IPT-A-IN) by comparison with treatment as usual (TAU) at schools. Methods: A total of 347 students from one-fifth of the classes of a high school in southern Taiwan completed the Beck Depression Inventory-II, the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation, the Beck Anxiety Inventory and the Beck Hopelessness Scale for screening for suicidal risk. Of them, 73 depressed students who had suicidal risk on screening were randomly assigned to the IPT-A-IN or TAU group. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed to examine the effect of IPT-A-IN on reducing the severity of depression, suicidal ideation, anxiety and hopelessness. Results: Using the pre-intervention scores as covariates, the IPT-A-IN group had lower post-intervention severity of depression, suicidal ideation, anxiety and hopelessness than the TAU group. Conclusion: Intensive school-based IPT-A-IN is effective in reducing the severity of depression, suicidal ideation, anxiety and hopelessness in depressed adolescents with suicidal risk.

AB  - Metadiscourse, or metatalk, is a discursive resource used in virtually any text or conversation to organize its content or signal the author's stance toward the content. Despite its prevalence in classroom talk, few have examined the role of metadiscourse and how it assists teachers and students to manage classroom communication of scientific knowledge. Thus, the purpose of this study is to analyze how science teachers use metadiscourse to construct scientific knowledge with their students. Based on a corpus of classroom video data, I developed a typology of metadiscourse commonly found in science classroom discourse. The typology comprises six major categories of metadiscourse, namely text connective, knowledge connective, activity connective, attitude marker, epistemology marker, and interpretive marker. In addition, I showed how the analysis on metadiscourse was necessary to complement the gaps from classroom analysis focusing on the interaction and content development aspects of classroom talk, particularly during the opening and reviewing stages of constructing a scientific explanation. With a better understanding of metadiscourse, its potential use as a pedagogical intervention to promote science learning is then discussed.

AB  - To evaluate the relative efficacy of two reading programs with and without adjunctive stimulant medication for children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and comorbid reading disorder (ADHD+RD). Sixty-five children (7-11 years in age) were assigned randomly to one of three intensive remedial academic programs (phonologically or strategy-based reading instruction, or general academic strategy and social skills training) in combination with either immediate-release methylphenidate or placebo. Multiple-blind procedures were used for medication/placebo, given twice daily. Children received 35 hours of instruction in 10 weeks, taught by a trained teacher in a separate school classroom, in small matched groups of 2 to 3. Children's behavior and reading abilities were assessed before and after intervention. Stimulant medication produced expected beneficial effects on hyperactive/impulsive behavioral symptoms (reported by classroom teachers) but none on reading. Children receiving a reading program showed greater gains than controls on multiple standardized measures of reading and related skills (regardless of medication status). Small sample sizes precluded interpretation of possible potentiating effects of stimulant medication on reading skills taught in particular reading programs. Intensive reading instruction, regardless of treatment with stimulant medication, may be efficacious in improving reading problems in children with ADHD+RD and warrants further investigation in a large-scale study.

AB  - The first objective of this work is to systematically list the international studies about the inclusion of students with disabilities in physical education (PE) from the teachers' perspective. Sixty studies met our selection criteria and are listed. The second objective is to analyse the content of the literature according to the inductive and thematic approach of Thomas and Harden (2008). Our thematic analysis highlights: a) the factors that influence PE teachers' positive or negative attitudes and predispositions towards the inclusion of students with disabilities and b) the factors that can positively influence the inclusion of students with disabilities in PE classes, according to the teachers' representations. Based on these sets of factors, we propose some adapted PE training content for PE teachers. These training content proposals form the basis of research perspectives. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to achieve this goal, we conducted a search for articles published between 1990 and 2004. We analyzed and interpreted the most important aspects of each paper. Blindness is responsible for a poor and confusing body image, which is formed mainly by tactile, kinesthetic and audible information. Blind children tend to present self-concept and self-esteem levels related to those they believe their parents' are, and also related to the quality of their social life.

AB  - This study investigated the use of organizational learning community principles to effectively manage organizational change. Target is a pseudonym for a small public school in Southern New Jersey that has provided educational services to students with special needs since 1969. In 2004 Target began providing services to a new population of students who exhibited challenging maladaptive behaviors, which constituted a profound organizational change. I was employed to provide Target staff with information about the new students and intervention strategies to address student behaviors including self-injury, physical aggression, property destruction, and other problematic misconduct. Target staff received instruction on the use of positive behavioral support (PBS) strategies, which are widely accepted as appropriate interventions for students with behavioral challenges (Carr et al., 2002; Sugai et al., 2000; Turnbull et al., 2000). Organizational learning principles were also introduced as a means of helping the Target organization adapt to change. Senge's (1990, 1994) five disciplines of organizational learning provided the structural framework for staff development activities intended to facilitate an organizational learning orientation. The study explores the development of an organizational learning orientation at Target and the efficacy of introducing organizational learning principles to help staff adapt to a new student population. The study results indicate that the Target employees responded favorably to the introduction of organizational learning principles and evidence from the study supports a shift toward an organizational learning orientation. The study further revealed that the development of an organizational learning orientation appeared to enhance the staff's capacity to adapt to the change in student population and improved their ability to effectively implement positive behaviors support strategies. An examination of my leadership performance throughout the study helped me evaluate my leadership decisions. I identified my espoused leadership principles, which were rooted in democratic, transformative, and servant leadership principles. The study showed that I remained focused on my espoused leadership goals despite difficult leadership challenges. Reflective practice strategies were useful in helping me track my leadership growth throughout the study and enabled me to identify the circumstances that presented the greatest challenges to my espoused leadership goals.

AB  - The present study examined effects of junior high school students' group experiences in their classrooms when preparing dramas for school festivals. Classroom teachers used the classroom activities to form the students into groups. The main results were as follows : (1) Through the drama activities, students increased their recognition of their own activities (independence, cooperation, and management) and of mutual understanding with others. This effect was larger in the more advanced students than those who were behind the rest of their class. (2) Helpful interventions by the classroom teachers promoted the development of the students' groups. The teachers' interventions influenced the students' recognition of their own self-evaluation, as well as their mutual understanding with others. (3) In ``divisional cooperation,{''} students did each activity while aiming at a common goal. The students' understanding of the class group was greater in students who showed higher divisional cooperation than in those who were less cooperative.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to reveal the contribution of the digital storytelling to the peer assessments experiences of pre-service teachers within the teaching practices. Design/methodology/approach - The study is carried out as a special case study. Both qualitative and quantitative data gathering tools were used together to investigate a special case in depth (Yıldırım and Şimşek, 2011; Çepni, 2007). In this study, the case investigated was the process whereby the senior year pre-service teachers enrolled in the faculty of education provided assessments of themselves and their peers through the teaching practice course, using digital storytelling. The contributions of the assessment method employed, in the experiences and personal development of the pre-service teachers, were investigated through interviews with pre-service teachers involved. Findings - The results suggested that pre-service teachers' perspectives were quite positive toward the use of digital storytelling for peer assessment in their teaching practices. The prominent contributions were: they caused easily tolerate personally as they did not take a direct form, and that they considered peer assessment through digital storytelling as an alternative means of assessment to effectively reflect the process. Receiving more detailed feedback about their classroom experiences and their teaching skills was helpful for pre-service IT teachers. Suggestions due to the findings were also included. Originality/value - In the study, peer assessment digital stories in the teaching practice courses offers the benefits of confidence with, different perspectives, satisfaction, and objectivity. These benefits can help pre-service teachers to focus on shortcomings regarding their teaching experiences, and take care for the correction. Further studies can be provided about the digital storytelling processes in various assessment processes of the instructions to reveal the potential of digital narratives in other domains as well.

AB  - The stated goal of current education reform is the redesign of education systems in pursuit of quality. Systems that consistently `come out on top' have excited much interest in uncovering the features that have contributed to their success; notably among these is the preparation of future teachers. Research on teacher education quality assurance processes has begun to provide evidence that common features shared by successful systems include the design of teacher education programmes around criteria such as that set by accreditation requirements, in part because they are intended to help shape programmes' intentions and approach, curriculum design, and outcomes. An important question for the field of teacher education is how to boost the research on diverse approaches' outcomes to improve programme design as indicated by successful practice, while taking into account the role of economic and socio-cultural factors in the process.

AB  - Families who face a multitude of severe and persistent problems in a number of different areas of life are commonly referred to as multi-problem families in Dutch child welfare. Although evidence suggests that short-term crisis interventions can have positive effects in these families, they have up to now not sufficiently succeeded in facilitating sustainable change. Interventions, which offer integrated care over longer periods of time, have been piloted in different European countries, but only few evaluation studies are available yet. In our study we therefore explored an integrated flexible family support program from the Netherlands, called ‘Ten for the Future’ [in Dutch: Tien voor Toekomst]. The research included 122 families over a period of four years and seven months. Analyses on group level and individual case level were carried out. Our results suggest that the intervention is associated with a decrease in family stress. Furthermore, families with lower initial parental stress were found to have a higher chance to end the program significantly earlier. Child behavior problems and family functioning, as perceived by care workers, show less coherent patterns of change. This might be connected to a main focus of family coaches on the direct work with parents alone. We conclude that the care program has potential to decrease family stress and suggest focusing on the further development of a dual key worker approach that offers allocated care for children next to parenting support in families with multiple problems.

AB  - Great teaching is characterised by the specific actions a teacher takes in the classroom to bring about learning. In the context of model-based teaching (MBT), teachers' difficulty in working with students' models that are not scientifically consistent is troubling. To address this problem, the aim of this study is to identify the pedagogical micro-actions to support the development of scientific models and modelling skills during the evaluation and modification stages of MBT. Taking the perspective of pedagogical content knowing (PCKg), it identifies these micro-actions as an in-situ, dynamic transformation of knowledges of content, pedagogy, student and environment context. Through a case study approach, a lesson conducted by an experienced high-school physics teacher was examined. Audio and video recordings of the lesson contributed to the data sources. Taking a grounded approach in the analysis, eight pedagogical micro-actions enacted by the teacher were identified, namely `clarification', `evaluation', `explanation', `modification', `exploration', `referencing conventions', `focusing' and `meta-representing'. These micro-actions support students' learning related to the conceptual, cognitive, discursive and epistemological aspects of modelling. From the micro-actions, we identify the aspects of knowledges of PCKg that teachers need in order to competently select and enact these micro-actions. The in-situ and dynamic transformation of these knowledges implies that professional development should also be situated in the context in which these micro-actions are meaningful.

AB  - Portfolios are widely used in a range of education programmes at different levels in a number of countries. They are also well established at all stages in social work education. However, in the literature there is surprisingly little critical analysis of the application of the portfolio in social work. In this paper the authors' objective is to contribute to professional knowledge about the use of portfolios in social work. The authors are all members of the Higher Education Funding Council Self-Assessment in Professional and Higher Education Project and are concerned to develop self-assessment in social work and enhance the development of life-long learning. They begin by examining the literature about portfolios from the field of education. Findings are then analysed from a small exploratory study of the use of portfolios in practice learning on a Diploma in Social Work course. Five different but related conceptual themes which emerge from the analysis are discussed: compiling the portfolio; issues of evidence; reflection in a context of assessment; the practice teacher and the learning dialogue; and the challenge of assessment. Suggestions are offered for effective portfolio practice

AB  - In contrast to the primary grades when children are learning to read, students in grades 4 through 12 are expected to learn content as they read, yet they may still struggle with reading basics. This book provides a realistic and systematic process for improving reading and writing while enhancing content knowledge and skills. Based on proven evidence in multiple schools over a 10-year period, this excellent new resource presents specific strategies and successful examples that educators can immediately implement to improve day-to-day classroom success, while also boosting the success rate on standardized assessments. Aligned with the National Reading Panel Report, this book helps teachers focus on: (1) creating a classroom community that is academically and psychologically safe for learning; (2) responding to non-negotiable expectations of daily practice; (3) building vocabulary, reading comprehension, and higher-order and critical thinking skills; (4) developing fluency in reading; and (5) engaging families and the community. Teachers can create the best environment and instructional experience for all students to maximize literacy learning and standards-based achievement. This outstanding book will be a source of reflection for continuous improvement. Following a preface, this book is divided into seven parts. Part 1, The Fail-Safe Classroom: Improving Reading, Writing, and Content Learning, presents: (1) Introduction; (2) Academically and Psychologically Safe to Learn; (3) Nonnegotiable Expectations of Daily Practice; (4) Nonnegotiable Expectations of Daily Practice and Writing; and (5) Practical Tips for Creating Fail-Safe Classrooms for Literacy and Content Learning.

AB  - In the UK, there is rapid and far-reaching policy change designed to provide integrated services to children, young people and their families, linking education, social care, health, youth and community, criminal justice and other professions. Higher education institutions must play a significant role in this process given the large proportion of its graduates who will join the Children's Workforce. In 2007, a University of Sussex team was commissioned by the Higher Education Academy Subject Centres for Social Policy and Social Work; Education; Health Sciences and Practice; Medicine, Dentistry and Veterinary Science; and Psychology, in collaboration with the Children's Workforce Development Council and the Children's Workforce Network to undertake a Knowledge Review of integrated children's services in higher education.

AB  - African Americans are underrepresented at all points in the STEM pipeline from K-12 coursework into professional careers. The reasons for this underrepresentation are varied and reflect a myriad of contributing factors based on early academic experiences, sociocultural influences, and the effects of standardized testing. The three-fold purpose of this study was to implement a counseling program to inform nine African American study participants about the dual enrollment opportunity at their high school, to gain perspective about the factors which shaped their STEM disposition, and to determine the effect of the program on their attitudes about dual enrollment participation. The study employed qualitative methods to collect data from surveys, interviews, field notes, and observations. The data analysis was grounded in four theoretical constructs: Critical Race, Self-Efficacy, Sociocultural, and Culturally Relevant Pedagogy Theory. The study findings indicated that the participants' STEM disposition could be attributed to a broad range of factors, with some of the most significant of these being ineffective teachers, limited access to meaningful STEM learning experiences, narrowed curriculum options, and an inadequate supply of role models.

AB  - Over time, developmental theories and empirical studies have gradually started to adopt a bidirectional viewpoint. The area of intervention research is, however, lagging behind in this respect. This longitudinal study examined whether bidirectional associations between (changes in) parenting and (changes in) aggressive child behavior over time differed in three conditions: a child intervention condition, a child + parent intervention condition and a control condition. Participants were 267 children (74 % boys, 26 % girls) with elevated levels of aggression, their mothers and their teachers. Reactive aggression, proactive aggression and perceived parenting were measured at four measurement times from pretest to one-year after intervention termination. Results showed that associations between aggressive child behavior and perceived parenting are different in an intervention context, compared to a general developmental context. Aggressive behavior and perceived parenting were unrelated over time for children who did not receive an intervention. In an intervention context, however, decreases in aggressive child behavior were related to increases in perceived positive parenting and decreases in perceived overreactivity. These findings underscore the importance of addressing child-driven processes in interventions aimed at children, but also in interventions aimed at both children and their parents.

AB  - It is hypothesized that factors related to teacher burnout influence treatment adherence. This study examines the relation of teacher burnout to the frequency and quality of behavioral intervention implementation. A sample of 45 general and special education teachers were trained to implement the Good Behavior Game, an intervention designed to assist teachers in the management of problem behaviors in the classroom, and asked to implement it each day for 28 weeks. Direct observation data were collected from teacher implementation of the Good Behavior Game. A multiple regression analysis was used to examine the predictive relation between three subsets of the Maslach Burnout Inventory: (a) Emotional Exhaustion, (b) Depersonalization, and (c) Personal Accomplishment, and two indicators of adherence: (a) mean frequency of implementation of the Good Behavior Game and (b) Likert ratings of quality of implementation. Significant main effects were found for Emotional Exhaustion and Personal Accomplishment on Adherence. A post hoc analysis conducted to explore directional relations between independent and dependent variables resulted in the following conclusions: (a) Group membership in low, moderate, or high levels of any single burnout factor was not statistically significant as an individual predictor of adherence and (b) group differences exist between factors of Emotional Exhaustion and Personal Accomplishment confirming relation between high levels of exhaustion and low levels of satisfaction with personal accomplishment. Further examination of means plots determined directional relation between high levels of emotional exhaustion and greater adherence.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to provide a best-evidence synthesis of studies on preservice teachers' conceptions of teaching and learning and to describe their implications for teacher education. The studies that focus on preservice teachers' conceptions were grouped according to five themes. They include: (1) general orientations to teaching and education; (2) perspectives concerning diversity and multicultural education; (3) elementary and secondary contrasts; (4) gender constrasts; and (5) traditional and nontraditional contrasts. Although some patterns emerge within each theme, teacher educators must exercise caution in generalizing these findings to all teacher candidates. Within some of the presented studies, preservice teachers' conceptions of teaching and learning vary considerably. (Contains 37 references.) (AA)

AB  - This article reviews literature about partnerships between teacher education faculties and schools that indicates not just heightened interest in recent years, but also significant progress. Despite interest and progress, conceptual and practical difficulties remain in establishing, developing, nurturing and implementing successful partnerships so that core interests of partners are satisfied. Against this background, the article examines the experiences of an Australian teacher education faculty that sought to enhance its arrangements with local schools by reorganizing and staging a teacher education program through a community of practice. Data drawn from a study of the emergent partnership confirm the trends in the literature and provide additional information about what appear to be essential partnership elements. The article concludes with speculative remarks about the trends in the literature and the study findings that may frame future research directions. (Contains 1 table.)

AB  - This paper reports on the analysis of state statutes and department of education regulations in fifty states for changes in teacher evaluation in use since the passage of No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. We asked what the policy activity for teacher evaluation is in state statutes and department of education regulations, how these changes in statutes and regulations might affect the practice of teacher evaluation, and what were the implications for instructional supervision from these policy actions. Teacher evaluation statutes and department of education regulations provided the data for this study, using archival records from each state's legislature and education departments that were placed into a comparison matrix based on criteria developed from the National Governors Association (NGA) goals for school reform (Goldrick, 2002). Data were analyzed deductively in terms of these criteria for underlying theories of action (Malen, 2005), trends, and likely effects on teacher evaluation and implications for supervision. The majority of states adopted many of the NGA strategies, asserted oversight and involvement in local teacher evaluation practices, decreased the frequency of veteran teacher evaluation, and increased the types of data used in evaluation. Whether or not the changes in teacher evaluation will improve student learning in the long run remains to be seen. (Contains 4 tables and 1 footnote.)

AB  - This study explored elementary school teachers' expectations of student behavior in terms of teachers' demographic characteristics as well as level (primary vs. intermediate vs. combined) and program type (general vs. special educator). Teachers identified which social skills they viewed as critical for success in their classrooms. Results showed that primary and intermediate teachers view skills in the areas of self-control and cooperation as equally important for success and perceive assertion skills as substantially less important. General and special educators placed similar value on the importance of assertion and self-control skills, but general educators viewed cooperation skills as more essential for success than did special educators. Implications for prereferral intervention and service delivery for special education students are discussed.

AB  - Children and youth with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) or emotional and behavioral disabilities (E/BD) often exhibit challenging behavior including aggression, self-injury, non-compliance, or property destruction (Kamps, Kravits, Rauch, Kamps, & Chung, 2000; National Autism Center, 2009). As a result, students with ASD or E/BD often miss out on critical opportunities for learning due to their challenging behavior. Fortunately, the literature provides information on the effectiveness of functional behavioral assessment (FBA) to assess or reduce challenging behavior and increase appropriate behavior of children and youth with ASD or E/BD (e.g., Hanley, Iwata, & McCord, 2003; Horner, Carr, Strain, Todd, & Reed, 2002; Lane, Kalberg, & Shepcaro, 2009; Simpson, 2005). Functional analysis (FA), conducted as a component of FBA or alone, is specifically used to identify the function of targeted challenging behavior via a systematic experiment. The literature suggests the importance of FA as a more valid method than indirect methods or descriptive analyses in identifying behavioral functions (Asmus, Vollmer, & Borrero, 2002). FA is the only method that can demonstrate a causal relationship between an antecedent stimulus or reinforcer and a behavior (Asmus et al., 2002); however, FA is rarely used in school settings. A possible reason is associated with the complexity of FA procedures (e.g., manipulating stimuli accurately) and time constraints. To address these issues, many variations to the standard FA have been made, including trial-based FA (i.e., TBFA). In addition to the need for accurately identifying the function of students' challenging behavior, there is also a critical need for the design and implementation of function-based interventions (FBI) for students in school settings (Scott & Kamps, 2007). Interventions based on behavioral functions are essential in educational settings, especially for students with ASD or E/BD due to their susceptibility to receive disciplinary actions because of their challenging behavior. In order for FBI to be effective in addressing challenging behavior, research on FA and professional development for special education teachers is crucial. The current study used a multielement research design (Kazdin, 1982) to determine the function of six student participants' challenging behavior using TBFA in the classroom setting. Data on teacher participants' acquisition of skills learned after TBFA and FBI training and performance feedback, and their effect on students' challenging and replacement behaviors were evaluated using a multiple-probe-across-participants research design (Horner & Baer, 1978) in the classroom setting. Findings indicated that all three teacher participants were able to implement TBFA during TBFA with feedback conditions and FBI during FBI with feedback conditions with high procedural integrity. In addition, two of three teachers maintained high procedural integrity during generalization measures. Findings also indicated a reduction in students' challenging behavior and an increase in replacement behavior after training. Finally, social validity data suggested teachers felt that TBFA and FBI had an overall positive impact on student behavior. Limitations of the study, suggestions for future research, and implications for practice are also discussed.

AB  - The compelling force behind education is improving teacher quality. This research study was designed to find out how improving teacher quality in terms of RTI knowledge occurred at differing levels of instruction and how faculty perceived the changing role of general education teachers and administrators with regard to RTI. Participants in the study included 13 faculty instructors and 196 of their students. Instructors had experience ranging from three to 14 years and experience in public school settings varied from eight to 17 years teaching K-12 and from four to 20 years as administrators. The instrumentation and data collection consisted of the administration of a student survey and face-to-face interviews with education administrator students and faculty. This was a descriptive mixed methods study. For the quantitative phase, I used SPSS 21 to collate descriptive data and then to explore relationships among variables. The survey contained (a) Likert-style questions, with the resulting data classified as nominal or scalar; (b) questions that produced nominal data; and (c) questions that produced binary data. Descriptive data were provided for each variable based on its measurement level. Frequencies for each nominal variable were generated. Qualitative analysis showed that student teachers and administrators were learning about RTI, but apart from education majors, not through their coursework. Awareness of RTI correlated positively with the perceived effect of not being instructed in RTI; however, knowing more did not correlate with perceiving RTI to be important.

AB  - This presentation will answer the following research questions: (1) What was the intended implementation of the training and coaching component of Foundations of Learning (FOL)?; (2) To what extent was the training and consultation implemented as intended?; and (3) How did the combined training and coaching model utilized in the FOL project influence children's behavior and approaches to learning? FOL emerged from early lessons from CSRP, a randomized trial of 18 Head Start centers directed by Dr. Cybele Raver that tested the effectiveness of a uniquely designed two-pronged integrated strategy that combined teacher training and classroom consultation (most models only utilize one of these methods). The FOL project was launched in Newark, New Jersey, in two phases: a smaller-scale pilot phase during the 2006-2007 school year, followed by a second larger scale phase in the 2007-2008 school year. In Chicago, Illinois, the project was launched during the 2008-2009 academic year. The implementation and impact findings in Chicago, coupled with the earlier analysis of the Chicago School Readiness Project and FOL-Newark, indicate a positive benefit to classrooms and students for the combined training and consultation model. Classrooms appear to be better managed by teachers, and students are more positively engaged and exhibit less conflictual behavior. Notably, having an explicit and manualized process for consultation and clear standards and access to support about the various phases of consultation, was a critical driver of the intervention implementation process and provided a standard from which to understand if consultation occurred as intended. However, the data varied slightly across these studies and follow up data is limited in FOL. Further studies would benefit from a consistency in measures across sites and include pre and post measurement of both classrooms and children. As mentioned in the finding sections, independent observations and assessments appear to be less biased, more fine-tuned instruments for illustrating the differences across groups of children and classrooms. In addition, while there has been some focus and follow up on outcomes for children beyond the intervention year, further data collection on the impact of the model on teachers in subsequent years could more fully illustrate the model's potential impact.

AB  - Teaching and coaching are two different occupational roles, and teachers who also coach have stressful work environments common to all educational settings, but each occupational role has specific stress and burnout problems. The responsibilities of physical education (PE) teachers and coaches are distinguishable from one another. These different roles and role conflicts may create stress among PE teachers who also coach. The history of physical education shows that there are contextual factors that promote PE teacher-coach role conflict. The aim of this paper is to analyse these contextual factors via using a literature review analysis and to provide suggestions about teacher-coach role conflict for school-based physical education in USA.

AB  - Teacher-child relationship building (TCRB) is a play-based professional development programme adapted from kinder training and filial therapy. Intended for early education teachers and students, TCRB is designed to strengthen the teacher-child relationship, improve student behaviour, enhance academic involvement and develop teachers' classroom management skills. In the current study, we utilised a phenomenological approach to examine teachers' perceptions of the initial implementation of TCRB through identifying individual and collective perspectives in the summation of themes. Findings indicated that the teachers perceived the TCRB model to be informative, well organised, appropriately structured and effective in enhancing teacher-child relationships, improving classroom management skills and reducing behavioural problems among child participants. Limitations of the study, implications and suggestions for future research are discussed.

AB  - Gifted students' development is asynchronous in the social, emotional, physical and cognitive domains. Because of this, unique interventions must be used by teachers of the gifted in order to best serve their developmental and educational needs. This qualitative study used transcendental phenomenology to examine and describe the experiences of teachers of the gifted with asynchronous development in their classrooms. Results showed that teachers of the gifted have a rich understanding of asynchronous development in their gifted students as well as appropriate interventions to use in the classroom. These teachers are not gaining their knowledge through their teacher preparation courses, but rather through personal research. Recommended from the results is the examination of teacher preparation programs for all teachers and to provide teachers of the gifted with the knowledge and resources they need to appropriately address asynchronous development in gifted students prior to entering the gifted classroom.

AB  - The use of a school wide positive behavior intervention and support (PBIS) framework is well established as a beneficial model for the majority of students taught in general education classrooms (e.g., Bradshaw, Mitchell, & Leaf, 2010). Some students, whether at-risk for or school-identified with emotional behavioral disorders (EBD) or other disabilities (e.g., learning disabilities, autism), may need individualized instruction and reinforcement related to their behavior to be successful in inclusive settings. Today's special education teachers must work closely with general educators to provide useful and practical interventions and supports within multitiered systems (Hoover & Patton, 2008; Simonsen et al., 2010). Effective communication and collaboration between special educators and their general education colleagues is essential for this process to succeed. This article describes challenges facing this effort and offers suggestions for teachers as they work together to promote positive behavior for all students. It concludes with an overview and implementation steps of an evidence-based intervention, Check-In Check-Out (CICO; Fairbanks, Simonsen, & Suggai, 2008) as an example of a collaborative strategy.

AB  - This study sought to determine teachers' level of awareness and usage of non-violent strategies/interventions for the maintenance of discipline in secondary schools in Anambra State, Nigeria. Corporal punishment has become an unwritten sine qua non for the maintenance of school discipline--often the first thought that comes to the minds of teachers in treating acts of indiscipline and deviance. From the Nnewi Education Zone, comprising four local government areas (LGAs), 200 teachers were selected for descriptive survey out of 996 teachers. Stratified random sampling was used such that the schools were stratified into co-educational and single-sex schools, and from each randomly selected school, 10 teachers were selected. Two research questions and four null hypotheses guided this study, and questionnaire was used to collect data. The mean was used to answer the research questions and t-test for the hypothesis at the 0.05 level of significance. The study recommended in-service training for teachers in educational psychology, particularly behaviour modification methods, parental input and interest in school discipline as well as the cessation of corporal punishment among others.

AB  - The vast majority of schools today are not prepared to support children's social behavior needs. One challenge is that teachers may not be knowledgeable of evidence-based practices that can be utilized with children. This study explored teachers' agreement ratings for evidence-based and nonevidence-based behavior management practices for children with emotional and behavior needs, and whether specific teacher characteristics (educational level, amount of education and training using behavioral interventions, and position as a special or general educator) yielded differences in ratings. A survey was developed based on an extensive review of the literature in this area. The survey questions that were the main focus for this study were taken from an Institute for Educational Sciences practice guide. A total of 363 teachers of early childhood and elementary-age students served as participants. Overall, special educators had higher ratings for evidence-based practices and lower ratings for nonevidence-based practices than general educators' ratings. Special educators also reported more confidence in their interventions. Graduate level of education was associated with lower ratings for nonevidence-based practices than undergraduate level. Teacher-rated level of training and education implementing behavior interventions was not associated with agreement with evidence or nonevidence-based practices. These findings are discussed.

AB  - School connectedness has been shown to be an important protective factor in adolescent development, which is associated with reduced risk-taking behavior. Interventions to increase students' connectedness to school commonly incorporate aspects of teacher training. To date, however, research on connectedness has largely been based on student survey data, with no reported research addressing teachers' perceptions of students' connectedness and its association with student behavior. This research attempted to address this gap in the literature through in-depth interviews with 14 school teachers and staff from two Australian high schools. Findings showed that teachers perceived students' connectedness to be important in regard to reducing problem behavior, and discussed aspects of connectedness, including fairness and discipline, feeling valued, belonging and having teacher support, and being successfully engaged in school, as being particularly important. This research enables the development of school-based intervention programs that are based on both student- and teacher-focused research.

AB  - This contribution explores the relationship between teaching practices, teaching discourses and teachers' implicit representations and mental models and the way these dimensions change through teacher education (T.E). In order to study these relationships, and based on the assumptions that representations underlie teaching practices and that T.E might affect these representations, a T.E course was designed and implemented in Argentina. The course focused on teacher intervention in personal narrative telling in kindergarten. It was based on a reflection-onaction process. The personal narrative activities of 10 in-service teachers before and after the course were analysed employing the Process of Constant Comparison (Glaser & Straus, 1967). A case study was then conducted in order to infer possible transformations in one of the teachers' implicit representations and mental models, through Content Analysis (Krippendorf, 1990) of in-depth interviews before, during and after the course.

AB  - In vocational education, students have to develop competences for reflection to self-regulate their development during their career. Students' reflection can be supported by teachers interacting with students and giving them prompts. In this study, 46 videotaped feedback dialogues of 23 teachers and their individual students were analysed. A total of 16 teachers participated in a training programme and 7 teachers formed a control group. The study aimed to investigate teachers' questions and responses and students' reactions, and the effects of the training programme. Analysis showed that, in the post-test, the trained group used a broader repertoire than the control group. The trained group, on average, used more hybrid prompts, deep reasoning questions, and prompt responses, which potentially stimulate students to elaborate and reflect.

AB  - In this article, the authors present the findings of an intensive training series designed to train school-site teams in functional assessment procedures. They examined the extent to which participation in an intensive training series that included on-site follow-up was sufficient to provide participants with the knowledge and skills necessary to design, implement, and evaluate a function-based intervention. The resulting interventions included the core components necessary (e.g., social validity, treatment integrity, and generalization and maintenance) to draw accurate conclusions about intervention outcome. The results of the study indicate that two teams were able to decrease problem behaviors and increase the use of functionally equivalent replacement behaviors. The authors discuss several limitations regarding the present study and provide thoughts on future efforts in this area.

AB  - Problems with handwriting can negatively impact the writing of students with learning disabilities. In this article, an example is provided of a fourth-grade special education teacher's efforts to assist a new student by using a problem-solving approach to help determine an efficient course of action for special education teachers who are trying to fit handwriting intervention into a busy schedule of instruction. A problem-solving approach (Vargas, 2013) is an iterative process that involves (1) problem identification; (2) problem analysis; (3) determination of a solution; and (4) implementation and evaluation of progress. Problem identification involves first spotting an area of difficulty for students. Problem analysis is digging deeper into the area of difficulty and identifying specific components to address. The step of determining a solution draws on research-based findings from the literature and professional wisdom to address the specific components. The implementation and evaluation step informs how well the solution has worked and what changes need to occur. After careful consideration to the specific problems shown on assessment and selection of one or more of the research-based solutions presented in this article, students may experience more success with handwriting within a well-organized, deliberate schedule of instruction.

AB  - Background: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of a nutrition education program designed to teach elementary school students and their parents, and to distinguish between more healthful and less healthful choices in diverse food categories. Methods: Three schools were assigned to receive the Nutrition Detectives[TM] program and 2 comparable schools served as controls. A total of 1180 second, third, and fourth grade elementary school students were included, with 628 students in the intervention and 552 in the control group. The program, delivered by physical education instructors over several sessions totaling less than 2 hours, taught the children how to read food labels and detect marketing deceptions, while learning to identify and choose healthful foods. Parents were introduced to the program through written materials sent home and at school functions. Assessments included a food label quiz, dietary pattern, and body mass index (BMI). Results: Students in intervention schools showed a significant increase in nutrition label literacy (p less than 0.01). Third grade students showed the most improvement, 23% (p less than 0.01). The parents of intervention group students also showed a significant increase in nutrition label literacy by 8% (p less than 0.01). Total caloric, sodium, and total sugar intake decreased nonsignificantly among students in the intervention group (p greater than 0.05). BMI did not change over the short duration of the study. Conclusions: Nutrition Detectives effectively enhances the ability of students and their parents to identify more nutritious food choices. Further evaluation of the program and its potential to influence dietary pattern, BMI, and health outcomes in students and their families is warranted. (Contains 3 tables and 1 figure.)

The theoretical framework that supports this inquiry is presented, including how ID is viewed and consequently taught (the designer's view), how ID is used by teachers (the teacher's perspective), collaboration between teacher and designer, and teacher inquiry into their teaching. The research method is described, including the co-participatory, reflexive approach to instruction, in which all participants were viewed as learners who continually reflected and appraised joint efforts at teaching and learning ID. Findings are summarized and related to ways that teachers used to describe and represent their practice in ID projects, personal ID models, and course evaluation. How the co-participatory approach helped teachers and designers to learn from each other is discussed. (Contains 50 references.) (MES)

AB  - An alternating treatments design was used to compare the effectiveness of activity-based intervention and didactic instruction to teach sight word reading to four young children with developmental delays attending an inclusive child care centre. Following the collection of baseline measures, the two interventions, counterbalanced for word lists and order of intervention, were implemented twice a week for six weeks. Acquisition of the sight words was assessed by the interventionist in pre-teaching probes and also by a special education teacher known to the children but independent of the research team. Maintenance data were collected three weeks after the intervention was completed. The results indicated that there were no differences between the two instructional approaches in relation to acquisition and maintenance of sight word reading for three of the four children. Features of each intervention and the implications of the findings are discussed. (Contains 7 tables and 1 figure.)

AB  - This study used the Take Action goal attainment lesson package and assistive technology to teach nine high school students with mild to moderate disabilities to attain annual transition goals. The Take Action lessons increased students' goal attainment knowledge, and this knowledge generalized to improved Plan Organizers, and slightly increased students attaining transition goals. Added weekly teacher check-ins improved adjusting plan components that did not work and goal attainment increased. Students who took action on four or five Plan Organizer components attained the most goals, and on average, students used four weekly Plan Organizers to attain a goal. Stronger interventions need to be developed to enable more students to increase the action taken on Plan Organizer components.

AB  - This article explores trends in research since the 1975 passage of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act (now known as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act), notes gaps in the literature, and offers suggestions for future directions music education researchers could take in exploring the needs and experiences of music teachers and their students with disabilities. A majority of existing literature examines teacher perceptions and attitudes toward students with special needs and preservice music teacher preparation. As the number of students served under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act continues to grow, and policy changes create more complex expectations of teachers, music education researchers need to continue to study these topics and broaden research to include outside perspectives, assessment and evaluation, and more research on classroom practices and voices of students with disabilities in order to better serve music teachers and their students.

KW  - T
AB  - Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) has been introduced as a conceptual framework for the knowledge base teachers need to effectively teach with technology. The framework stems from the notion that technology integration in a specific educational context benefits from a careful alignment of content, pedagogy and the potential of technology, and that teachers who want to integrate technology in their teaching practice therefore need to be competent in all three domains. This study is a systematic literature review about TPACK of 55 peer-reviewed journal articles (and one book chapter), published between 2005 and 2011. The purpose of the review was to investigate the theoretical basis and the practical use of TPACK. Findings showed different understandings of TPACK and of technological knowledge. Implications of these different views impacted the way TPACK was measured. Notions about TPACK in subject domains were hardly found in the studies selected for this review. Teacher knowledge (TPACK) and beliefs about pedagogy and technology are intertwined. Both determine whether a teacher decides to teach with technology. Active involvement in (re)design and enactment of technology-enhanced lessons was found as a promising strategy for the development of TPACK in (student-)teachers. Future directions for research are discussed. (Contains 2 tables, 1 figure, and 1 note.)

AB  - The recent proliferation of technology in educational settings is giving teachers new and innovative methods of teaching an inquiry-based curriculum within a constructivist framework. One problem within the nation's schools is the growing cultural divide. The cultural divide is the extent of the cultural barrier that exists between educators and students of one culture with those of others. Current researchers are working to document the extent of the cultural divide and the methods of reducing this divide through technological innovations in preservice education programs, software development, and in the classroom.

AB  - Research increasingly recognises the importance of student bystander and adult educator shared responsibility for successful bully prevention. The role of teacher observations versus student reports of bullying, as well as staff preparedness, as predictors of teacher involvement was investigated in 115 middle school teachers. Being told by students about bullying incidents was the strongest predictor of teacher involvement. However, the relation between being told about bullying, or observing it, and coaching students on how to manage bullying was most evident when teachers felt highly prepared to handle bullying situations. Results from this study point to the pivotal role that both teacher preparedness and student reporting play in teacher responsiveness to bullying. Implications for training school professionals and bully prevention programmes are discussed. (Contains 2 tables.)

AB  - Background: Breast cancer and cervical cancer are the most common cancers among women in the world. Many studies on the early detection of cancer have been conducted among women worldwide, but few studies have been performed in the world on female teachers regarding breast self-examination (BSE), mammography (MMG) and Pap smear test (PST). As teachers interact with students, this could play an important role in health education and in developing healthy behavior such as cancer screening. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of a structured teaching program on breast and cervical cancer screening on the knowledge and practice of teachers. The other objective was to encourage teachers to transfer this knowledge to the women who attended their courses. Methods: Semi -experimental designs with pre-intervention, post-intervention and six month follow-up tests were used in this study. The data were collected from 37 volunteer teachers and their 64 volunteer students with a sociodemographic form, a questionnaire form for breast and cervical cancer, and a Transtheoretical Model of behavior change for BSE, MMG and PST. Behavior of the teachers related to BSE, MMG, PST was evaluated in pre-training and in the first, third and sixth months post-training, and the behavior of the students was evaluated with point follow-up in the sixth month. Results: In post-training, it was determined that the teachers' knowledge of breast cancer increased from 11.70 +/- 2. 80 to 14.81 +/- 3.22 and their knowledge of cervical cancer increased from 7.75 +/- 5.60 to 17.68 +/- 3.79. For BSE behavior, 47.8% of teachers were in the action and maintenance stage in pre-training, but this ratio was 81.1% in the sixth month post-training. For MMG behavior, all of the teachers were in the precontemplation stage in pre-training, and 38.9% of them were in the action and maintenance stage in the sixth month post-training. For PST, while 24.3% were in the action and maintenance stage in pre-training, this ratio was 45.9% in the sixth month post-training. Conclusion: It was determined that the behavior change for BSE, MMG, PST was positive. Similarly, knowledge transfer from teachers to students was also effective.

AB  - Four quantitative meta-analyses examined whether teachers' expectations, referrals, positive and neutral speech, and negative speech differed toward ethnic minority students (i.e., African American, Asian American, and Latino/a) as compared with European American students. Teachers were found to hold the highest expectations for Asian American students (d = -.17). In addition, teachers held more positive expectations for European American students than for Latino/a (d = .46) or African American (d = .25) students. Teachers made more positive referrals and fewer negative referrals for European American students than for Latino/a and African American students (d = .31). Although teachers directed more positive and neutral speech (e.g., questions and encouragement) toward European American students than toward Latino/a and African American students (d = .21), they directed an equal amount of negative speech (e.g., criticism) to all students (d = .02). In general, teachers' favoring of European American students compared with African American and Latino/a students was associated with small but statistically significant effects. The meta-analyses suggest that teachers' expectations and speech vary with students' ethnic backgrounds.

AB  - Inquiry-based learning methods, coupled with advanced technology, hold promise for closing the science literacy gap for English learners (ELs) and students with learning difficulties (SWLDs). Project ESCOLAR (Etext Supports for Collaborative Online Learning and Academic Reading) created collaborative online learning units for middle school science to meet the needs of ELs, SWLDs, and general education students. In a randomized controlled trial with 1,451 students, 28 teachers implemented one of two online units in their classrooms after completing a Web-based professional development course. Results showed that treatment condition students, including ELs and SWLDs, significantly improved science knowledge compared to controls; ELs' gains indicated a knowledge gap reduction compared to general education students. Findings suggest that quality science curriculum and effective technology practices can help all students learn science and prepare for future global scientific challenges.

Results of a randomised controlled trial with 2,303 middle school students and 71 teachers across 13 schools in two states indicated that online units effectively deepened science knowledge across all three student groups. Comparing all treatment and control students on pretest-to-posttest improvement on standards-based content-specific assessments, there were statistically significant mean differences (17% improvement treatment vs. 6% control; <italic>p</italic> < .001); no significant interactions were found between treatment condition and learning disability or English learner status, indicating that these two groups performed similarly to their peers; students with learning disabilities had significantly lower assessment scores overall. Teachers and students were moderately satisfied with the units. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

Based on this theoretical proposition, the purpose of the present study was to test the effects of a training program for three physical education newly qualified teachers on the aforementioned teachers’ overt behaviors and students’ psychological needs satisfaction, self-determined motivation and engagement in sport-based physical education. After a baseline period of four lessons, the teachers attended an informational session on adaptive student motivation and how to support it. The training program also included individualized guidance during the last four lessons of the cycle. Results revealed that from pre- to post-intervention: (1) teachers managed to improve their teaching style in terms of all three dimensions, and (2)

AB  - This article provides a review of Roberts-2, an individually administered narrative measure published by Western Psychological Services. Roberts-2 is a substantial revision of the earlier version of this measure, the Roberts Apperception Test for Children (RATC; McArthur & Roberts, 1982). Roberts-2 is composed of 16 stimulus cards that direct youngsters to tell a complete story that includes a beginning, middle, and end and the thoughts and feelings of the characters. It is intended to be used in conjunction with other methods used by school and clinical psychologists to assess youth referred for special education or mental health-related social, emotional, or adjustment problems. The theoretical underpinnings of Roberts-2 are grounded in developmental psychology in that a child's expressive language skills can provide an index of the child's social-cognitive skills (e.g., Piaget & Inhelder, 1971). Thus, the measure is intended for use with a varied group of referred youth and should be compatible with major theoretical orientations such as cognitive-behavioral, humanistic, and psychodynamic.

AB  - School-based social workers, collaborating with teachers, can contribute to the development of the skills, knowledge, and attitudes required for individuals to live healthy lives both in the short and long term. This article reports on a case study that investigated the effectiveness of the input of social work into a school-based health promotion model. Results indicated that cross-disciplinary collaboration was dependent on a number of factors: commitment to the value of cross-disciplinary collaboration, the clear identification and articulation of the expert skills and knowledge that each discipline brings to the collaboration, and on the effective negotiation of the contribution of each discipline's expert skills and knowledge to the collaboration. When these factors are embedded in a school's formal and professional arrangements, then cross-disciplinary collaboration is more effective.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a tailored 7-month training intervention "Trust Before Restraint," in reducing use of restraint, agitation, and antipsychotic medications in care home residents with dementia. Methods: This is a single-blind cluster randomized controlled trial in 24 care homes within the Western Norway Regional Health Authority 2011–2013. Results: From 24 care homes, 274 residents were included in the study, with 118 in the intervention group and 156 in the control group. Use of restraint was significantly reduced in both the intervention group and the control group despite unexpected low baseline, with a tendency to a greater reduction in the control group. There was a significant reduction in Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory score in both the intervention group and the follow-up group with a slightly higher reduction in the control group, although this did not reach significance and a small nonsignificant increase in use of antipsychotics (14.1–17.7%) and antidepressants (35.9–38.4%) in both groups. Conclusions: This study reports on the statistically significant reduction in use of restraint in care homes, both prior and during the 7-month intervention periods, in both intervention and control groups. When interpreted within the context of the current climate of educational initiatives to reduce restraint and a greater focus on the importance of person-centred care, the study also highlights the potential success achieved with national training programs for care staff and should be further evaluated to inform future training initiatives both in Norway and internationally.

AB  - Twenty years after democracy, the legacy of apartheid and hitherto unmet challenges of resourcing and teacher development are reflected in a severely inequitable and underperforming education system. This paper focuses on second language writing in the middle years of schooling when 80% of learners face a double challenge: to move from "common sense" discourses to the more abstract, specialised discourses of school subjects and, simultaneously, to a new language of learning, in this case English. It describes an intervention using a systemic functional linguistic (SFL) genre-based pedagogy involving 72 learners and two teachers in a low socio-economic neighbourhood of Cape Town. Using an SFL analytical framework, we analyse learners' development in the information report genre. All learners in the intervention group made substantial gains in control of staging, lexis, and key linguistic features. We argue that the scaffolding provided by SFL genre-based pedagogies together with their explicit focus on textual and linguistic features offer a means of significantly enhancing epistemic access to the specialised language of school subjects, particularly for additional language learners. Findings have implications for language-in-education policy, teacher education, curriculum, pedagogy, and assessment in multilingual classrooms.

AB  - Parenthood is a concrete experience that develops while having a psychological existence in its background. It is heard in two voices simultaneously: the overt, concrete one versus the covert, psychological one. It moves between four intersecting axes, which together create the "Parental Voice" model. Axis 1--Parenthood between fantasy and the concrete child, and in parallel with the child's development stages. These characteristics are the focus of what educators have to deal with when interacting with parents of young children. Axis 2--Parenthood between the "intergenerational transference" mechanism and adjustment to the current reality in which the parent and child are growing. Axis 3--"Whose child is it?" -ecological and systemic aspects: struggles and congruencies between the educational system and the family. Axis 4--Parenthood as a psychological existence that develops between the three structures of Self (Private Self, Professional Self and Parental Self).

AB  - Reading problems are one of the most frequent reasons students are referred for special education services and the disparity between students with reading difficulties and those who read successfully appears to be increasing. As a result, there is now an emphasis on early intervention programs such as RTI. In many cases, early intervention in reading instruction focuses primarily on foundational reading skills, such as decoding. However, with much of the focus on fluency, reading comprehension may be overlooked. How can special educators implement an effective reading comprehension strategy with young students who exhibit reading comprehension problems? The authors taught the RAP strategy to Gary, Betty, and Jean, third-graders with reading comprehension problems. RAP which stands for Read a paragraph, Ask yourself, "What was the main idea and two details?" and Put information into your own words, is a simple strategy that is easily incorporated into existing curriculum without taking time away from critical content instruction. This three-step strategy can improve the reading comprehension of students with and without disabilities and is extremely flexible. It requires students to engage in reading materials through questioning and paraphrasing to increase their comprehension of the material. (Contains 2 figures and 3 tables.)

AB  - With universities seeking to increase their enrolment of international students, and the increasingly diverse domestic market, it is not surprising that researchers' interest has turned to the impact of a diverse university population. The focus of this paper is a model that has been implemented to enable higher levels of achievement on the professional experience or practicum component of a teacher preparation programme at The University of Queensland, Australia. The participants were students from backgrounds that were non-English speaking. The programme has been provided since the academic year beginning January 2004 and has sparked interest in transferring the model to other areas of the university. While the study was conducted in Australia, the issues it raises, and the model developed, appear to be applicable to any programme on offer in any university with culturally and linguistically diverse students.

AB  - The AIDS epidemic has created many orphans around the globe. A majority of these orphans live in sub-Saharan Africa. Children orphaned by HIV/AIDS face many daunting challenges in their struggle to cope with life. The issues they face due to the loss of their parent(s) include poverty, the stigma associated with HIV/AIDS and stress. This study carried out by Morgan Chitiyo of Southern Illinois University Carbondale, Darlington Changara of Midlands AIDS Caring Organisation and George Chitiyo of Tennessee Technological University discusses how different psychosocial and educational interventions have been developed to help the children to overcome these challenges. However, few of the interventions have been empirically tested to determine their efficacy. The authors set out to evaluate the treatment acceptability of a psychosocial support programme using a group of teachers who had received training and were participating in the implementation of the programme across their schools. Findings from the study indicate high acceptability ratings of the programme.

AB  - This booklet describes a framework for helping preservice teachers learn and implement behavioral intervention strategies in inclusive classrooms. A partnership of Human Services Consultants and Bloomsburg University taught 19 preservice early childhood and elementary teachers behavioral intervention strategies for mainstreamed students with severe behavior disorders. During week 1, students received orientation, completed a pretest survey, toured buildings and facilities, discussed agency and district policies and rules, received information about target students, and established visitation and conference times. During weeks 2-13, students received one-to-one and/or group support and intervention including behavior modification techniques and proactive strategies to stabilize pupils. They worked collaboratively with the team, developed schedules, and received training. The training focused on behavior management interventions; basic behavior techniques (teamwork, diversity, and ethics); identifying challenging students; teaching social skills; developing self-esteem; helping children handle anger; and meeting student needs in inclusive classrooms. The project produced a manual, a consultant bank of resources, a vehicle for collaboration, and professional development among preservice teachers, inservice teachers, behavioral specialists, and university faculty. This booklet offers training session summaries, behavioral support project sample case studies, and reflections from participants. Nine appendixes include program evaluation; student teacher pretest and posttest questionnaires; behavioral support content-specific questionnaire; oral debriefing report; Behavioral Support Internship syllabus; internship time sheet; release form; and resources.

AB  - There has been much policy interest on the theme of children's services in recent years. For example, the 1998 National Child Strategy explicitly aims to ensure good quality, affordable childcare for children aged 0 to 14 in every neighbourhood, including both formal childcare and support for informal arrangements. The sector has a changed a lot in recent years and a there are a range of data sets that explore aspects of how it works. This report explores and describes available data sources on the early years children's workforce, focusing particularly on childcare. We have investigated what administrative or survey data sets are available and how the data sources could be linked together. We start the report with a general introduction to what we mean by the children's workforce' and the sort of questions that could be asked. We summarise the data sets we have looked at, briefly commenting on how they could be used in research. In a detailed appendix, we discuss each of these data sets in turn, highlighting key strengths and limitations. In the core of the text, we provide an analysis of the children's workforce in the Labour Force Survey (occasionally supplemented with information from the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings). Finally, we discuss future directions for research in this context. (Contains 5 figures, 4 tables and 29 footnotes.)

AB  - In the field of reading research, studies that focus on improving the reading achievement of high school students with learning disabilities are lacking. Although collaborative interventions for elementary age students have been shown to be effective, a gap exists in the current research regarding effective collaborative reading interventions for high school students with learning disabilities. The theoretical framework of this study was based on auditory processing deficits contributing to reading disabilities as proposed by Tallal. A quasi-experimental research design was conducted that included a collaborative model group of 52 high school students who participated in a collaboration model within a special education resource specialist program and a comparison group of 52 high school students without collaboration. A secondary analysis from archival data during the years of 2009 to 2013 from the California Standards Tests English language arts scores for the population was conducted. No differences between the two groups 1 year of participation in the collaboration model was observed. Also, the Friedman test for repeated measures was conducted to assess the effect of the collaboration model for learning disabled students over three years and found a significant decrease on performance on the California Standards Tests reading scores. This study is an important contribution to the existing literature for consideration in monitoring instructional services for high school students with learning disabilities. The current study of the collaboration model assists with the approach to social change by determining the effectiveness of reading strategies for high school students.

AB  - The participation rates of girls in post-compulsory information technology courses of Australian universities and high schools have remained low (less than 30%), despite three decades of research and analysis. In seeking to better understand this phenomenon, this paper draws upon data collected during an Australian Research Council Linkage project to investigate first, the reasons that teachers and students in contemporary Australian high schools put forward to account for girls' underrepresentation; second, the assumptions about gender that underpin these explanations; and third, the extent to which teachers appear able to respond to the full range of factors shaping girls' decision making. The paper argues that attempts to improve girls' participation rates might continue to falter unless teacher education programs explicitly prepare teachers to conceptualise educational reforms based on understandings of post-structural perspectives on gender; perspectives that challenge the more common explanations for girls' behaviour associated with both essentialist and socialisation mindsets.

AB  - Two important topics in early literacy development in Slovakia are discussed in this paper: the conceptual framework for its stimulation by efficient preschool curriculum, and the continuity of formal elementary school education with respect to children's preceding developmental achievements. The paper discusses the ongoing research project focused on the possibilities of early literacy intervention--the project is conducted by the Department of Social and Biological Communication in collaboration with the Department of Preschool and Elementary School Education, University of Bratislava, Slovakia. It notes that teacher education students participate in the project, and that the program aspires to be reflective of the current educational trends and needs and to offer an alternative to the traditional preschool educational program. The paper states that two groups of preschool children (5-6 years) have been investigated, and their phonological awareness, pre-reading, and pre-writing strategies have been analyzed. It presents some preliminary results showing the children's pre-reading and pre-writing skills as they naturally emerged in highly stimulating literacy. (Includes a table and 8 charts.) (NKA)

AB  - When student teachers experience difficulty during lesson implementation, seasoned cooperating teachers choose among 6 alternative strategies by which to assist. Collectively called "cooperating teacher I's," the strategies are as follows: ignore, intervene, interject, interact, interrupt, and intercept. Appropriate use of these strategies can be taught directly or made more explicit to cooperating teachers as a means to facilitate quick resolution of problems; maintenance of student teacher confidence, self-esteem, and classroom authority; cooperating teacher confidence in the mentor role; and active or passive choices as they may be appropriate to specific circumstances. Included is a brief summary of research about cooperating teachers and their feedback practices, a description of behaviors that generally prove to be ineffective in response to these situations, detailed descriptions of the 6 cooperating teacher I's that appear to be effective, and a discussion of general observations and implications.

AB  - Immigration is an integral phenomenon of our globalising world. The increasing flow of people creates new challenges for educational institutions and workplaces. The purpose of this article is to address challenges that vocational teachers face with diversity at colleges and workplaces. Two research questions are addressed: how do teachers prepare immigrant students for working life? What challenges related to intercultural competence do teachers preparing immigrant students for working life face? The theoretical background lies in cultural-historical activity theory, developmental work research and in the concept of intercultural competence. The change laboratory method used in study is a formative intervention method evolved within developmental work research. The data comprised two change laboratories organised at the same vocational college in 2001 and 2011. The results showed that teachers' work with multicultural students and groups can be developed by following five perspectives: preparation, reflection, contribution, guidance and responding. Intercultural competence is constructed contextually and is intertwined with activities such as teaching, facilitating students' learning and cooperating with wor kplaces. The participants of the change laboratories experienced it as a good instrument for their intercultural work. Based on the results, some implications are suggested.

AB  - Evidence-based and highly effective, "coaching" helps early childhood practitioners support other professionals and families as they enhance existing knowledge, develop new skills, and promote healthy development of young children. This hands-on guide shows professionals how to conduct skillful coaching in any setting--home, school, or community. An expanded, more practical follow-up to the groundbreaking "Coaching Families and Colleagues in Early Childhood", this is the guidebook that walks professionals step by step through the coaching process and shows them explicitly what best practices look like. Developed by the foremost authorities on coaching and informed by the authors' staff development and technical assistance activities with other professionals, this book directly addresses the real-world challenges of coaching and gives readers concrete guidance on successful strategies and interactions. Preservice and in-service early childhood professionals will: (1) master the five characteristics of coaching practices--observation, action, reflection, feedback, and joint planning; (2) see exactly how to conduct a positive coaching session, with transcripts of successful coaching in action; (3) learn about the qualities of effective coaches, including openness to experiences, adaptability, empathy, and honesty; (4) adjust coaching techniques to meet the specific needs of early childhood educators, parents, and caregivers; (5) incorporate coaching into professional development programs to ensure immediate use of the latest best practices; (6) understand how coaching differs from other collaborative models, such as consultation, direct teaching, and counseling; and (7) discover cutting-edge early childhood research that demonstrates the effectiveness of a coaching approach. To keep their skills sharp and ensure adherence to best coaching practices, readers will get easy-to-use, photocopiable tools (see box) that help them implement coaching consistently and effectively. They'll also have samples so they can see how to use the tools to evaluate and improve their interactions. With this essential coaching guidebook, every early childhood professional including developmental specialists, Early Head Start and Head Start staff, early literacy specialists, infant mental health specialists, nurses, occupational therapists, physical therapists, psychologists, social workers, service coordinators, speech-language pathologists, and teachers will provide effective support to families and other professionals to enhance developmental outcomes for all young children.

AB  - This publication reports findings from the first year of an implementation study of the Early Childhood Cluster Initiative (ECCI). ECCI is a prekindergarten program in ten elementary schools and a community child care center in Palm Beach County, based on the design of the High/Scope Perry Preschool model. The initiative is characterized by low teacher-child ratios, the use of certified teachers, the availability of ongoing staff training, and an intensive program of activities to strengthen parent involvement. Interviews and surveys with participants and program assessments indicated continued support for the initiative's goals and activities and progress in implementing the High/Scope curriculum, although both program quality and support for the curriculum varied across sites and participants. Accomplishments of the first year included implementation of the High/Scope curriculum in the classroom, developing relationships with families, and training and mentoring teachers. Relationships with service provider staff were also established. However, much work remains to integrate the ECCI program into the school setting and build foundational relationships with school administrators and other service providers. In order for ECCI to be successful in the school setting, ECCI services should be regarded as integral rather than as supplemental within the context of the school. To that end, written policies and procedures are needed outlining for administrators and provider staff their roles and responsibilities in relation to the ECCI classrooms, as well as the structures and facilities that should be in place in order for ECCI to function. Successful implementation of ECCI ultimately depends on the development and maintenance of positive relationships between ECCI staff and school staff and frequent communication and coordination between them. Teachers and teacher trainers need to be cognizant of the limitations of the school policies and procedures, and creative in finding ways to resolve problems and negotiate differences between High/Scope and school policies. Just as it will take teachers time to learn the High/Scope curriculum, it will take time for school administrators and other school staff to understand and appreciate the principles underlying the ECCI program and develop ways of working with ECCI staff and integrating ECCI into the life of the school. Three appendixes include: (1) Overview of High/Scope Curriculum; (2) ECCI Year 1 Interview Guide; and (3) ECCI Year 1 Survey for Teachers and ELAs. Bibliography is included. (Contains 19 footnotes, 1 figure and 15 tables.) [For the first-year executive summary, see ED500595.]

AB  - This study examined the impact of explicit instruction on metacognitive reading strategies among 18 K-8 teacher candidates in a literacy methods course. They received weekly explicit intervention about these strategies over one semester. Collected data included pre- and post-scores of the Metacognitive Awareness of Reading Strategies Inventory (MARSI) before and after intervention, quickwriting notes, literacy lesson plans, and reflection papers. The results showed that the teacher candidates increased their awareness of metacognitive reading strategies after the intervention. They also shared their positive attitudes toward learning about these strategies and plan to implement them in their future classrooms.

AB  - State education departments, in discussions with Regional Educational Laboratory (REL) Southeast, identified low reading achievement as a critical issue for their students and expressed an interest in identifying effective strategies to promote the foundational skills in young students that might improve reading achievement. The Mississippi State Department of Education has focused specifically on interventions that might enhance students' vocabulary knowledge. Kindergarten PAVEd for Success (K-PAVE) was selected to be tested in Mississippi for three reasons. First, there were only a small number of vocabulary interventions appropriate for this age group to be considered. Second, among these, PAVE--the preschool version of the intervention--was the only one for which an impact study had been completed that provided some evidence of effects. Third, K-PAVE was the only curriculum that had developed teacher training materials and a training protocol, which meant that it could be implemented with sufficient fidelity across a variety of districts and school settings. The primary research question for the study addressed the impact of K-PAVE on kindergarten students' expressive vocabulary. Secondary research questions addressed the impacts on kindergarten students' academic knowledge and listening comprehension. Although the study was concerned primarily with the impacts of K-PAVE on students, impacts on intermediate classroom instruction outcomes were also assessed to provide context for understanding potential impacts on students. The study addressed research questions about impacts on classroom instruction in vocabulary and comprehension support, instructional support, and emotional support. Finally, the study examined whether the introduction of K-PAVE had the unintended consequence of reducing the time spent on areas of literacy instruction other than vocabulary and comprehension (such as phonological awareness, alphabet knowledge, print concepts, and decoding). The study found that kindergarten students in schools using K-PAVE as a supplement to the regular literacy instruction performed better than kindergarten students in control schools on the Expressive Vocabulary Test-2 administered at the end of the school year. The study also found that kindergarten students in K-PAVE schools performed better than students in control schools on the measure of academic knowledge administered at the end of the year. K-PAVE caused a positive and statistically significant impact on one of the three kindergarten classroom instructional practices examined: vocabulary and comprehension support, which includes introducing vocabulary words during read-alouds, introducing vocabulary words throughout the school day, asking higher order questions during read-alouds, and providing comprehension support during book read-alouds.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of pre-service teachers' participation in a constructivist intervention supported by technology on their confidence in their own ability to plan and create six technology-supported, constructivist, learning activities, as well as to understand their perceptions of the experience. Participants were 23 pre-service teachers accepted into the College of Education's Masters program at the University of Tennessee Knoxville and enrolled in an introduction to instructional computing course during the summer of 2001. A survey was used to assess pre-intervention confidence levels and experience with six technology-supported, constructivist, learning activities. Students were then situated in a class that employed constructivist methodology to facilitate their own exploration of constructivist pedagogy supported by technology. Once students completed the class, they were asked to re-take the survey. A paired samples t-test was used to compare pre-intervention confidence levels with post-intervention confidence levels. The results revealed a significant difference, p less than or equal to 0.001, in each of the six areas. Journals, focus groups, and interviews were used to gain insight into the participants' perceptions of the experience and suggested a reflective process. (Contains 1 table.)

AB  - A language and literacy intervention was implemented in 10 Head Start classrooms. Teachers were trained in specific book reading and conversation strategies. The focus of the intervention was to train teachers how to increase opportunities for language and vocabulary development in young children. At the end of the year, children in the intervention classrooms performed significantly better than children in the control classrooms on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-III and the Expressive One-Word Vocabulary Test (3rd ed.). In addition, teachers in the intervention classrooms used strategies that promoted language development during book reading and other classroom activities. Head Start teachers can be trained to implement strategies that have positive effects on children's language and literacy development.

AB  - Four student interns were taught to use environmental arrangement strategies and delayed prompts to enhance the number of teaching occasions and to facilitate communicative requesting of students with severe language delays. A multiple-probe design across interns was implemented to evaluate the effects of the training on interns' use of the intervention procedures. Three of the four interns immediately increased their use of the strategies when the intervention was introduced. A specific component of the intervention, researcher-generated vs. intern-generated teaching occasions, was analyzed separately. The use of researcher generated and intern generated teaching occasions varied across interns with no clear preference found. To assess observer reactivity, unobtrusive data were gathered and revealed fewer teaching occasions for all participants (relative to scheduled observations), but their rates remained above those in baseline. Limitations and implications of this investigation for practice and research are discussed. (Contains 3 tables and 3 figures.)

AB  - The increase in the rate and intensity of child maltreatment within the last decade is worrisome. In 1996, 44 out of every 1,000 youths under the age of eighteen were maltreated (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1998). Special educators should consider the possible effects of maltreatment on children with learning disabilities. When these children are maltreated by their caretakers, their learning disabilities can be intensified and become more resistant to interventions. This article defines the types of maltreatment, their possible effects on learning, and school interventions that can assist the children with learning disabilities.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of coaching on special education teachers' implementation of function-based interventions with students with severe disabilities through the use of a delayed multiple baseline across participants design. This study also sought to examine if teachers could generalize the ability to implement function-based interventions to different situations with their students. Additionally, this study examined the effect of the function-based intervention on the students' problem and replacement behaviors. After an initial training on completion of FBAs and implementation of function-based interventions, coaching was provided by the researcher to each teacher. Results indicated that there was a functional relationship between implementation of the coaching procedure and an increase in teacher fidelity scores. Teachers demonstrated the ability to generalize the strategies to another situation with the target student. While some improvement in student behavior was noted upon teachers implementation of the function-based intervention without coaching (e.g., teacher baseline), this improvement was not consistent for all students and across the replacement behaviors. A functional relationship was found between accurate implementation of the function-based interventions (e.g., the coaching phase) and an increase in the students' primary replacement behaviors.

AB  - This study compared the impact of three different facilitation approaches on elementary teacher candidates' interactions in an asynchronous discussion board as well as their satisfaction with an online educational technology course. These participants were enrolled in three different sections of the same online course. In the first section (Group 1), the instructor responded to each student's initial message regarding the discussion question and then required students to respond to at least two of their classmates' postings. In the second section (Group 2), the instructor responded to each student's initial message to the discussion question, but did not require students to respond to other classmates' postings. Instead, it was the student's voluntary choice. In the third group (Group 3), the instructor did not respond to each student's initial message on the discussion question, but required students to respond to at least two classmates' postings. Data were analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively, by using ANOVA, social networking analysis (SNA) and content analysis. The results indicated that in Group 2, voluntary interactions among students rarely occurred, resulting in the instructor primarily providing feedback to the students, with a low number of cues for social presence. In comparing Groups 1 and 3, when students were required to respond to one another, too much instructor intervention did not lead to more interactions among the students. Rather, when the instructor's intervention was minimal, students tended to more freely express their thoughts and opinions, with a large number of cues for social presence. However, more interactions among students, occurring in a required setting, may not have correlated with student satisfaction with the online course ratings and the instructors' ratings.

AB  - Token economies have a long research and applied history within clinical settings and classroom education (Kazdin, 1982). However, despite reported successes in improving physical activity behaviors (Alstot, 2012), research examining token reinforcement implemented specifically in physical education is virtually nonexistent. Therefore, the purpose of the current study was to examine the effects of a peer-administered token economy on the jump rope behaviors of elementary physical education students. An alternating treatments design was used to assess the effects of the intervention. Participants were alternated between five baseline and five token economy sessions while response differentiation between the two phases was assessed. Results indicated that nine out of ten participants showed an increase in the number of successful jump rope practice trials during token reinforcement sessions as compared with baseline sessions. Based on the results of the study, it was concluded that peer-administered token economies can be useful tools for physical educators. (Contains 2 tables, 3 figures and 1 note.)

AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of the Family-Involved Self-Determination Learning Model of Instruction (SDLMI) on academic engagement and goal attainment of middle school students with disabilities who exhibit problem behavior. Intervention was provided to the experimental group (12 students with their families and special educators) in Korean language classes for seven months while no treatment was provided to the control group (12 students). As a result, academic engagement in the experimental group, measured by behavior rating and direct observation, increased at a significantly higher rate than that of the control group. Also, the goal attainment of Korean language in the experimental group improved significantly compared to the control group. Finally, discussions of the results, limitations of the study, and suggestions for future studies are presented. (Contains 1 figure and 6 tables.)

AB  - Researchers have found that teacher preparation programs are not universally preparing teacher candidates in concepts associated with the alphabetic principle. Yet, the majority of students with reading disabilities or who struggle with beginning reading have difficulty with phonology and concepts associated with the alphabetic principle. The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of a series of multimedia modules on participants' (N = 76) knowledge and skills related to early reading instruction. The multimedia modules covered basic literacy concepts primarily related to phonology and phonics. Results from the experimental, control-group design indicated that the modules were successful in teaching foundational literacy constructs to participants. Thus, multimedia modules may be a promising avenue for providing instruction for teacher candidates. Additional research, however, is needed to ensure mastery of knowledge and to evaluate how principles of effective instruction can guide multimedia module use by teacher educators.

AB  - ADHD affects millions of people-some 3 to 5% of the general population. Written by a neuroscientist who has studied ADHD, a clinician who has diagnosed and treated it for 30 years, and a special educator who sees it daily, "The Energetic Brain" provides the latest information from neuroscience on how the ADHD brain works and shows how to harness its potential for success. It distills the latest research findings to give readers the most up-to-date information available and provides practical strategies for managing ADHD-and thriving-at school, at work, and at home, from childhood through adulthood. This book debunks popular (and destructive) myths about ADHD. It covers how to manage ADHD with medication or without, what parents can do to help, and how to thrive with ADHD throughout the lifespan. It also offers effective academic and behavioral interventions for school, and helpful accommodations for the workplace. "The Energetic Brain" provides a truly thorough view of ADHD, making it an invaluable guide for parents, teachers, and those living with ADHD. [Foreword by Sally E. Shaywitz.]

AB  - The Enterprise Zone-Preschool Inclusion Project (EZ-PIP) was a four-year demonstration project funded by the U.S. Department of Education, Office of Special Education Programs. The purpose of the project was to expand, implement, evaluate and disseminate a model program designed to promote the inclusion of young children with disabilities into early childcare programs in economically depressed areas of a major metropolitan city. The model included three components, which are detailed in this manual: training; technical assistance by special instruction consultants; and mentoring. Book 1 of the manual consists of the curriculum used to train childcare staff regarding children with disabilities and how to include these children successfully in their childcare settings. Book 2 describes the technical assistance component of the project and includes a description of the role of the special instruction consultant, sample case studies, lists of concerns and strategies, a copy of the Children Medical Services (CMS)/Special Instruction Consultant Standards, and a technical assistance resource manual. Book 3 describes the mentoring component of the project and includes a sample mentor application package and a mentoring training program. Book 4 presents the findings and accomplishments of the project. (SG)

AB  - The introduction of applied diplomas for 14-19-year-olds from September 2008 in England is leading to increased numbers of young people of current school age (14-16) attending further education (FE) colleges, where aspects of these new qualifications are taught. Although students aged 14 and 15 have previously attended FE, the numbers involved are now set to be larger. However, traditionally, initial teacher training (ITT) for FE has focused on adult learning and prepared trainees to work with more mature students. This article draws upon existing literature as well as empirical data from small-scale research into the circumstances and perceptions of staff and 14- and 15-year-old students at college. Deriving from this, it makes some tentative suggestions for how teacher trainers can respond to younger students in FE and so better prepare their trainees. However, any such response and the impact it may have is constrained by the political and social context for FE in England and specifically by the tight control the government maintains over teacher training in FE. This current strategy ignores the complexity of FE, so this article argues for a more radical transformation of ITT, based upon the concept of learning cultures, to enable and encourage new teachers to make professional judgements relevant to the particular circumstances of their own students.

AB  - This keynote address tells the personal journey of a former teacher who is now involved in educational research. Educational research is topical at the moment in Design and Technology (D&T) Education, as many initial teacher training (ITE) courses make the transition to masters level accreditation, something endorsed by the teacher training and development agency (TDA) as a means of enhancing the status of the teaching profession. The implication being that ITE courses will develop a significant research component to their courses. This paper argues against relying on experience only, or anecdotal accounts as a means for understanding or explaining the nature of the phenomena being studied. The case for conducting educational research that is "systematically, sceptically and ethically" (Robson, 2002) conducted, is seen as a means understanding human behaviour, in a way that leads to conclusions that are credible (Cohen, 2007). The author draws on his experience as both a teacher in school, and as a Principal Investigator of a large, Gatsby funded research project, which looked at creativity in design and technology which is influencing policy and practice both nationally and internationally.

KW  - eppi-reviewer
AB  - The purpose of this document is to provide a historical perspective of the evolution of special education in Iowa through the voices of the people who created the system of support for individuals with disabilities. In addition to the interviews, extensive historical literature reviews were conducted. One hundred and thirty individuals were interviewed across three years. The participants ranged from those involved in special education in the 1950s to people currently practicing, and from those serving children from birth to those providing special education support to graduating seniors or students aging out of special education services. The individuals were parents of children with disabilities, special and general education teachers, school psychologists, school social workers, special education consultants, occupational therapists, physical therapists, speech language pathologists, early childhood social workers and consultants, school administrators, attorneys for parents and school districts, and many more. This documents includes a number of tables and graphs regarding student population changes over time, state and federal legislative efforts that changed practices, legal principles and the implications for funding and services, progress monitoring data, and race/ethnicity percentages across time. The document traces the history of special education from before the 1960s, through each decade from 1960 to the present. Each decade is introduced by providing a context of what was occurring at the world, national, and state level in current events, civil rights, and special education. Each decade is then, in turn, concluded by reflecting on advances in the disability awareness in that decade. Between the beginning and ending of each decade are the important advocacy, legislative, and improved practice events of that time period. This is brought alive through the stories of those that advocated and provided services for individuals with disabilities. The results revealed through interviewing the people who had lived the adventure, and who had created the future, the incredible story of developing services for individuals with special education needs. The evolution of special education in Iowa is the story of people who exhibited, and in many cases are still demonstrating, a sustained passion for helping others improve the quality of life for individuals with disabilities and their families. Educators' benefit from understanding the history of the development of special education supports and services in the past to be better prepared to enhance services in the future. Appendices include: (1) Participants in Conversations; and (2) Image Credits.

AB  - This study furthers the discussion of teachers as public servants who are essential to the maintenance of the democratic state. The study demonstrates how teachers' actions on September 11, 2001 in New York City show the essential qualities of public service, including selflessness and placing the needs of others above their own needs. By focusing on the personal, emotional and professional responses of teachers to the attacks as compared to the same responses of individuals in the private sector, the study shows a specific contrast, particularly in the professional responses between teachers and student teachers in public service and individuals in occupations in the private sector. The second objective is to include the voices of women, primarily elementary teachers, but also women in the private sector, in the historical narrative of the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center. Hopefully, this inclusion will encourage the use of personal accounts and narratives in the study of historical events (M. White,1965; H.White, 1980).

AB  - In many fields and in education in particular, researchers, such as teachers, are inclined to believe that because they are enmeshed in the field or have good relationships with students, issues of politics, power and status will exert minimal influence and that access to the field will be smooth and unproblematic. In this paper, three doctoral students with varying degrees of insider status, working in the Australian context, reflect on the rocky journeys they experienced obtaining and maintaining access to field sites. The authors argue that despite a body of literature addressing this issue, many of the commonly used texts devoted to educational research do not adequately tackle the subject. The novice researcher often remains unsuspecting and under prepared for the range and depth of difficulties encountered in the process of gaining access. The question is posed, what might be the role of the academy in preparing researchers?

AB  - School psychology, the professional application of psychology to education environments and programs, has evolved during the last hundred years to become a critically valuable source of support for the learning and development of children and youth throughout the world. This review of "The Handbook of International School Psychology" found it to be the best available source for understanding the profession's history of development, nature, present status characteristics and the challenges and potentials for its future internationally and for the diverse sample of 43 countries included for specific attention. The book's editor-authors and country chapter authors have produced quite interesting and useful material in a highly readable form. The review gives the future of the profession and its yet un-reached potential particular attention, noting constraints limiting the profession's practices and contributions such as traditionally heavy emphasis on the provision of assessment and preventive/ corrective interventions focused on problems in learning and students with disabilities, oversight and control by non-psychologists and narrowly dedicated funding. Suggestions are made for a more expansive future of contributions by clarifying the professions' purposes, broadening the meaning of special needs, employing an assets model, bringing interventions to the foreground, shifting to a stronger internal locus of control and drafting a new social contract with communities emphasizing promotion of the full healthy development of all children and youth. Recommendations are also made for transforming the "Handbook" into a living internet process of information provision, discourse on issues, consensus development, resource support and guidance for the profession.

AB  - Adolescents are physically inactive and non-Caucasian adolescents achieve the least amount of physical activity. Hence, supporting teachers' efforts to increase their students' physical activity during physical education is important. We examined the influence of a social cognitive theory-based intervention on teachers' efficacy to teach physically active physical education lessons (i.e. Exemplary Physical Education Curriculum [EPEC] efficacy) and efficacy to overcome common barriers (i.e. barrier efficacy) to teaching physically active lessons. Forty-seven elementary physical education teachers from a large inner-city school district in the USA participated. We paired experienced teachers (n = 15) with novice teachers (n = 15) while learning how to teach a physical activity curriculum and compared them with a group of teachers (n = 17) who received no intervention. We hypothesized that the intervention teachers, relative to the comparison group, would improve in their efficacy to teach the EPEC and overcome barriers. All 47 teachers completed EPEC and barrier efficacy scales pre and post intervention. Analyses indicated a variety of significant main and interaction effects with mean scores in the expected directions. Both groups of intervention teachers improved their efficacy to teach the EPEC and their efficacy to overcome barriers. The comparison teachers' efficacy remained stable or decreased. In general the significant results, combined with meaningful effect sizes, supported the effectiveness of our intervention and the importance of professional development training in a physical activity curriculum on teacher's efficacy.

AB  - Background: Little is known about the role of behavioural executive functioning (EF) skills and level of intelligence (IQ) on math abilities in children with mild to borderline intellectual disabilities. Method: Teachers of 63 children attending a school for special education (age: 10 to 13 years; IQ: 50 to 85) filled out a Behaviour Rating Inventory for Executive Function for each student. Furthermore, students took a standardised national composite math test and a specific math test on measurement and time problems. Information on level of intelligence was gathered through school records. Multiple regression analyses were performed to test direct, moderating and mediating effects of EF and IQ on math performance. Results: Behavioural problems with working memory and flexibility had a direct negative effect on math outcome, while concurrently, level of intelligence had a positive effect. The effect of IQ on math skills was moderated by problems with inhibition: in children with a clinical level of inhibition problems, there was no effect of level of intelligence on math performance. Conclusions: Findings suggest that in students with mild to borderline intellectual disabilities and math difficulties, it is important to address their strengths and weaknesses with respect to EF and adjust instruction and remedial intervention accordingly.

AB  - Purpose: The paper seeks to report the impact of a partnership training intervention on trainee teachers' confidence to teach Personal, Social and Health Education. Design/methodology/approach: This intervention required trainee teachers to work in 15 groups of four across subject disciplines. Each group was required to negotiate, plan and deliver their intended lesson on PSHE in a partnership school. The initiative was evaluated on a pre- and post-test basis by getting each trainee to complete a PSHE Key Skills Confidence Scale that consisted of 45 items, 25 pertaining to working together and 20 to communication. Findings: Results revealed a significant change in trainees' confidence in all of the key PSHE-related skills. Trainee teachers reported increased confidence in "agreeing what else could have been done to improve working relationships and methods," "using role play strategies," "reaching agreement on whether or not the activity fulfilled its objectives," "considering strategies that will empower pupils to make informed choices about their health," "determining pupils' attitudes and views of health and healthy living"; "ensuring that pupils received information about the factors which affect health," "identifying factors that influenced the learning outcome," and "encouraging pupils to be assertive and resist unwanted peer pressure and other influences." Originality/value: It is recommended that all trainee teachers are assessed on their ability to deliver and evaluate PSHE lessons as part of the award of Qualified Teacher Status. Furthermore, it is essential that trainee teachers receive specific resistance/life skills training as part of their initial and continuing professional development. (Contains 6 tables.)

AB  - Background: In recent years, due to deliberate educational policy in various places around the world, children with dyslexia study in regular classes with non-dyslexic classmates. They do not appear handicapped, because their disabilities do not stem from physical deformities, and therefore, it is not easy to identify them in a group where the majority of the children are non-dyslexic. As a result, these children continually brave the hardships inherent to a human environment, while being largely unaware of their situation. Purpose: The aim of this study was to test the effectiveness of VR technology in enhancing the teacher's knowledge and awareness of dyslexia, a phenomenon that is very difficult to explain. Not only it is a very difficult phenomenon to communicate, but also the research community still needs to suggest and accept a unified typology of the disorder. Population and Setting: Eighty teachers of various subjects participated in this study. They were selected randomly from a variety of schools in the Tel Aviv metropolitan area. Each of the teachers in the experimental group (N = 40) experienced a virtual reality simulation that simulated 10 virtual worlds corresponding to the 10 types of dyslexia we found in the literature. The experience took 20 minutes to complete and was conducted in a VR laboratory in a clinical setting. The teachers, in the control group (N = 40) each separately watched a 20-minute film on the subject of dyslexia and reading disorders. All the subjects filled out questionnaires before and after the intervention. Research Design: The teachers were divided into an experimental and a control group. In the experimental group, the teachers were exposed to ten 3D virtual worlds that simulated 10 cognitive experiences of dyslexic students. The teachers in the control group viewed a film that elaborated on similar experiences. All the subjects filled out questionnaires before and after the intervention. The questionnaires tested the teachers' level of cognitive awareness of the dyslexic students' experiences when encountering the written word. In addition, the subjects in the experimental group were interviewed before and after the intervention. Conclusions: The research results clearly suggested that experiencing a variety of simulated types of dyslexia via virtual reality can bring about a greater improvement in teacher awareness of the dyslexic pupil's cognitive experiences than is achieved by viewing a film about dyslexia.

AB  - The purpose of this action research study was: (a) to explore the relationship of student achievement in reading employing the Woodcock Interpretation and Instructional Interventions Program (WIIIP) within the Response to Intervention (RTI) model (b) to examine the relationship between the WIIIP and the rate of progress of four students who participated in Reading Mastery, one student who participated in Corrective Reading, and one student who participated in both Reading Mastery and Corrective Reading and (c) to determine if staff involved in the intervention process believe the WIIIP data program interventions impacted the rate of progress for each student. Methods included quantitative and qualitative elements that involved case studies of six students attending one of three elementary schools implementing an RTI model during the 2010-2011 school year as well as data about each student's reading progress over time. In addition, the study included an analysis of documents and interviews with those educators engaged in the diagnosis and interventions for the students. The staff involved included the school psychologist, special education teacher, intervention instructor, and general education teacher involved with the case study students. These data produced information that contributed to the understanding of factors that impact the staff roles and experiences implementing RTI, the RTI implementation process, the alignment of specific reading interventions, awareness and communication, and the overall perceptions of staff and assessment data regarding the impact on individual reading progress.

AB  - The purpose of this mixed-methods research was to examine the impact of mediated cognitive strategy intervention on the reading comprehension and self-efficacy of Palestinian-Arab middle school students with learning disabilities. Eighteen seventh-grade students with LD who were placed in two self-contained special education classrooms and their two special education teachers participated in this experiment for eight weeks. A multi-cognitive strategy reading comprehension intervention (the Five Mediated Cognitive Strategies: 5MCS) based on existing cognitive strategy models was introduced. The two classrooms were divided into two conditions: (a) an Extended Condition, in which students received the cognitive strategy instruction for the full length of the intervention while using culturally relevant texts at the fourth grade level, and (b) the Reduced Condition where students received four weeks of traditional instruction followed by the cognitive strategy instruction combined with the same texts that were provided for the Extended Condition. All students were assessed for their vocabulary and comprehension at pre and post intervention using a standardized measure and researcher-made weekly tests for their comprehension. Further, the students were assessed for their self-efficacy in reading using self-report surveys at three times and focus group interviews at pre and post intervention. Repeated-measures ANOVA results indicate that both groups improved their vocabulary and comprehension from pre to post intervention on both standardized and researcher-made comprehension measures. However, the Extended Condition achieved statistically significant gains in comprehension at posttest, whereas, the Reduced Condition achieved significant gains in vocabulary at posttest. No significant differences were found between the two conditions by time. Mixed results were revealed for self-efficacy in reading comprehension. Students who were identified as good decoders reported an increase in their self-efficacy from Prue to post intervention, whereas students with poor decoding abilities reported a declined self-efficacy at post intervention. Thematic analysis of interviews with the participating teachers revealed that they considered themselves and their students to have benefitted from the 5MCS intervention. Implications for the study are discussed and recommendations for further investigations are provided for policy makers and educators.

AB  - This study investigated how video-based observation may alter the nature of post-observation talk between supervisors and teacher candidates. Audio-recorded post-observation conversations were coded using a conversation analysis framework and interpreted through the lens of interactional sociology. Findings suggest that video-based observations impacted the content and extent of teacher candidate reflection during post-observation discussions, enabling candidates to comment at greater length about their teaching, initiate topics, and cite evidence through reference to the video data. Implications for the role of supervisors and the potential of video-informed post-observation conferencing are discussed.

AB  - This article presents a research project that challenges the skills-based approach to classroom management in teacher education, particularly in the domain of responding to student misbehaviors. In 90-minute narrative-based interviews, 16 first-year Chicago Public School (CPS) teachers were prompted for narratives of their experiences responding to student misbehaviors. A thematic analysis of these interviews using a grounded theory methodology revealed three ways in which identity affected teachers' student behavior management decisions: (1) their desire to be seen as "a certain kind of teacher" by their students, (2) their desire to perceive themselves as a certain kind of person and teacher, and (3) identity concerns superseding effectiveness in teachers' selection of interventions. Implications of these findings are discussed. An experiential approach to identity development in teacher education is endorsed as a corrective to the predominantly skills-based approach to classroom management. An outline of a more coherent model of teacher identity is presented that may lend support and direction to this identity-based instruction and to future research in teacher identity.

AB  - Today, some researchers have focused on the impacts of new and easily applicable non-invasive methods on physical education. The purpose of this study is to examine the vibration-related acute change in rotary pursuit coordination performance soon after arm vibration. In the study, 27 students in School of Physical Education and Sport were divided randomly into two groups. In order to eliminate the effect of learning, vibration and non-vibration rotary pursuit test was applied to each group rotationally. Group 1 (n[subscript group1] = 14) was subjected to 4 rotary pursuit (40 s) tests each involving 3 vibration (30 s, 50 Hz, 2 mm) interventions. Two weeks later, the same participants were subjected to rotary pursuit tests with 30 s. rests instead of vibration interventions. Group 2 (n[subscript group2] = 13) first received the non-vibration test and then the vibration test in the same order. According to the results of repeated measure of ANOVA, a significant improvement (F[subscript (3,24)] = 9.08, p = 0.00) was found in the rotary pursuit performance with vibration (1st: 28.28 ± 5.21., 2nd:29.59 ± 4.61, 3rd: 30.51 ± 5.31, 4th: 31.42 ± 4.29 s). A significant improvement was not found (F[subscript (3,24)]=1.80, p=0.17) in the rotary pursuit coordination practice without vibration (1st: 27.42 ± 4.80., 2nd:28.54 ± 4.45, 3rd: 29.03 ± 3.58, 4th: 28.60 ± 4.21 s). The study revealed that acute hand vibration positively affected rotary pursuit coordination. This positive impact is considered to have originated from the reconstructive effect on the sense of joint position of acute vibration. It is believed that the results of this research might inform physical education teachers working on hand-eye coordination.

AB  - Networked learning communities are growing and they offer new opportunities for reflection on practice in education. Many authors have studied the processes followed and the contents produced by such communities. On the other hand, few have observed how collective asynchronous discourse can be enacted in the classroom. This objective was pursued in the context of this exploratory research. Data was provided by asynchronous discourse written on the Knowledge Forum by five pre-service teachers during a 14-week practicum throughout the winter 2011 semester, as well as in situ observations from their university supervisor, while they were teaching students. Qualitative and descriptive quantitative analyses were conducted. In particular, results showed participants were highly concerned with quality of teaching when elaborating collectively in the electronic forum regarding ideas of interventions, and with the importance of properly handling the possible enactment of such ideas in the classroom while teaching.

AB  - Background: Teachers commonly adopt instructional styles that thwart student motivation. As such, researchers have examined interventions based within the self-determination theory to identify changes in teaching behaviors. Results of these studies have demonstrated a level of success in teachers adopting a more motivationally supportive teaching context. While important results to the development and implementation of quality motivational pedagogy, these results may have occurred due to an increased focus on specific behaviors as espoused by the self-determination theory. What is absent to date is an examination of current pedagogical approaches that align with aspects of self-determination theory that might inherently influence the motivational instruction of teachers. A model of instruction that has been aligned with self-determination theory and may provide a new avenue for the development and implementation of motivationally supportive instruction is the Sport Education Model (SEM). Purpose: The purpose of this study was to provide an initial examination into the influence of using the Sport Education approach on pre-service teachers autonomous instruction. Participants and setting: 50 pre-service physical education teachers (PT's) were enrolled in a secondary physical education methods course and randomly assigned to teach a 15-lesson unit using Sport Education or skill-drill-game approach. Data collection: Collection of teacher instruction utilized an observational tool that coded distinct teacher-student interactions into one of fifteen categories. As a result, each teacher was provided an overall frequency of statements that were further classified into an overall level of autonomy-supportive, controlling and neutral statements. In addition, students within each of the classes were asked to complete the Learning Climate Questionnaire (LCQ) and Sport Motivation Scale (SMS) that provided a score for perception of autonomy-support and individual motivation. Teacher instruction was collected daily, while LCQ and SMS data were collected at four time points within the unit. Data analysis: Analysis of data was conducted using repeated measure ANOVA's for teacher instruction, student perceptions of autonomy-support and motivation. Significant ANOVA calculations were further analyzed using follow-up tests to examine where the significance occurred. Results: Statistical analysis revealed that teachers within distinct phases of Sport Education provided a significantly higher level of autonomy-supportive statements. In addition, students engaged within Sport Education reported similar significance related to the second and third phases of the model. Conclusion: As a result of this study, utilization of Sport Education seems to provide support that teachers may adopt a more autonomy-supportive social context within their instructional practices.

This study examined the influence of a discussion leader intervention on the quality of online argumentation and interactivity. Subjects were 44 undergraduate students who participated in online discussions on a technology issue over two weeks. Participants who received pre-determined instructions from the leader prior to the issue discussion were more likely to produce enriched argumentation and increased interaction than the control participants who did not receive specific instructions prior to the issue discussion. Results indicated that students participating in groups receiving specific argumentation instructions from the leader produced better online argumentation for the second week and exhibited increased interactivity patterns for both weeks.

AB  - This review of the research literature focuses on the interconnectedness of the roles of mentor teachers and pre-service teachers. In order to examine the interconnectedness of mentors and mentees, the paper firstly delves into what mentoring is and what contextual factors influence mentoring in pre-service teacher education. It then examines the research literature on mentors and mentees and the roles they undertake in a mentoring relationship. Emerging from the examination of the roles is identification of how the relationship functions with regard to the mentor and mentee who work together to achieve specific goals. The paper highlights the fact that limited research has examined mentor and mentees as interconnected partners in mentoring relationships. The paper outlines how the mentoring relationship participants can actively participate and interact. In conclusion, the paper provides a definition for mentoring that embraces essential mentoring components for pre-service teacher education contexts. (Contains 5 figures.)

AB  - Designed to increase awareness and understanding about interveners and their role in the field of deafblindness, this paper describes the work of interveners in early intervention and educational settings provided under the Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP) and the Individualized Education Program (IEP) for children and youth who are deafblind, birth through 21 years of age. It begins by explaining the process of intervention. The needs of children and youth who are deafblind are then discussed in the areas of access to environmental information, communication, and social and emotional well-being. The primary role of the intervener is explained as facilitating the access of environmental information usually gained through vision and hearing, facilitating the development and/or use of receptive and expressive communication skills by the individual who is deafblind, and developing and maintaining a trusting, interactive relationship that can promote social and emotional well-being. Specific strategies are listed for accomplishing each of these goals, and recommendations for IFSP and IEP program planning tips are provided. Intervener training, supervision and support are also addressed. The paper closes with answers to frequently asked questions concerning the role of the intervener. (CR)

The components of WHS were designed to be scientifically sound, maximally useful to elementary school teachers, and effective in increasing students' social skills. Results from feasibility and social validity testing showed that teachers felt the program was easy to implement and highly recommended its use. The initial efficacy evaluation of WHS conducted with 70 classrooms randomly assigned to intervention and control conditions showed that teachers in the intervention group scored significantly higher on self-efficacy than teachers in the control group. Students in the intervention classrooms were rated significantly higher on key social skills by their teachers at posttest compared to students in the control group. Implications for further testing of WHS are discussed, along with study limitations and recommendations for future research and practice.

AB  - This quantitative research study examined Iu Mien high school students of one high school in the Sacramento Valley for possible connections between their acculturation level and academic achievement to address the following research questions: 1. What impact does the degree of acculturation have on the academic success of the Iu Mien high school student? 2. What are appropriate instructional practices to assist Iu Mien high school students? The research study utilized two established Likert-type self-rating surveys to address research questions one (East Asian Acculturation Measure, EAAM, Barry, 2001) and two (Culturally Responsive Beliefs and Practices of General and Special Education Teachers Implementing Response to Intervention in Diverse Elementary School, RCELD, Robinson, 2010). Thus this quantitative research study provided the opportunity to triangulate student acculturation level, cumulative GPA, and learning environment conducive to multicultural education. The research study resulted in following four main findings: 1) The Iu Mien high school students rated themselves as being integrated, 2) The instructional faculty felt that they have implemented relevant multicultural education to support RCELD student needs in the following areas: Effective school-wide and classroom academic differentiated intervention pedagogy, and effective school-wide collaboration, 3) The school is participating between pervasive tolerance and pervasive acceptance level of multicultural education (Nieto, 2004), and 4) The cumulative assessment of the three previous finds indicated that there were no significant differences between Iu Mien students classified as being assimilated and integrated.

AB  - This study aims at finding out the parents' level of satisfaction with the integration of their daughters with learning disabilities in regular schools in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The study sample consisted of 283 parents of female students. The instrument of data collection was a questionnaire consisting of 59 items for 10 domains. The study results indicated that the services provided by the resources rooms in regular schools gained the highest parents' satisfaction, followed by the services related to the means and methods used by the resources room's teacher. However, the extracurricular services gained the lowest level of parents' satisfaction. In light of the results of the current study, a number of pedagogical implications can be presented to decision makers to improve the resources room which leads to an increase of the satisfaction level of female learning disabilities' parents with their kids' integration in regular schools in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

AB  - Response to intervention (RTI) can be considered an everyday practice in many parts of the United States, whereas, in Finland, only recently has a new framework for support in learning taken shape. Choosing Finland as the comparative partner for this policy paper is justified as its educational system has been widely referenced on the basis of good Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) results. The results of the present comparative article showed first, that the U.S. RTI was primarily intended for diagnosing and preventing learning disabilities whereas the Finnish RTI is mainly an administrative structure for support. Second, the U.S. RTI includes clear definitions regarding the intensity, duration, and content of support provided within each tier whereas the Finnish version contains no explicit guidelines for support. Third, the U.S. RTI assumes no special educational services in the first two tiers, but the Finnish framework includes special educational services from the onset of support. Implications for policy and practice are discussed.

AB  - The ultimate goal of this concurrent embedded mixed-method study was to describe the implementation of Response to Intervention (RTI) and understand the role of Response to Intervention at the fourth-grade elementary school level on the academic performance. This study examined both qualitative and quantitative data. In the qualitative phase, a case-study method was utilized by collecting data in the form of interviews, observations, and corresponding data collection. The quantitative data examined student data based on progress monitoring in math and reading. The researcher analyzed and graphed the students' data to determine a trend of student performance when provided with Response to Intervention services. From the qualitative phase, the researcher identified four major themes: Response to Intervention Implementation; Response to Intervention Evaluation and Identification; Collaboration; and the Participants' Preparation for Response to Intervention. In the quantitative phase, the researcher found two general patterns of change on the students' data. These patterns were growth and non-growth. The findings showed that general education teachers, special education teachers, and interventionists supported the implementation of Response to Intervention and its processes. The quantitative data reflected the successful practices of practitioners engaged in the implementation of Response to Intervention. The data showed that students did not fall further behind when they received interventions within the Response to Intervention framework. The interpretation of these findings led the researcher to examine the future implications for practitioners of Response to Intervention and policy makers. Overall, there was a need for further research into the implementation of Response to Intervention, how behavior should be included into the Response to Intervention framework, and the importance of in-depth quality training and professional development for educators.

AB  - The history of civil rights in Canada illustrates a growing trend by the government to support the physical, emotional, mental, legal, and financial needs of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered citizens. However, the education system presents a slightly different climate. Despite numerous policies and initiatives, gay and lesbian students continue to report incidents of homophobia and an overall lack of emotional support by educators and administration. This article examines current research on gay and lesbian students' emotional needs, polices that address them, and the vital role that teacher training plays in setting the stage for equitable practices in education.

AB  - This literature review presents a systematic analysis of 113 empirical studies conducted between 1996 and 2009, portraying a picture of the rationales, goals, activities, roles, and outcomes in the different practicum settings in teacher education programs. The review shows that the rationale, goals, and activities in the different practicum settings are focused on teaching competencies and acquaintance with the pupils' diversity. The supervisors' role is focused mainly on the preservice teachers' inner world, and only few studies examined school students' achievements as a result of preservice teachers' instruction. The individual relationships between mentors, supervisors, and preservice teachers were attended by tension and conflicts ensuing from different interests, educational philosophies, and status differences that were not bridged. Preservice teachers' acquaintance with staff and principals at the host school were a negligible part of the practicum descriptions. The discussion will portray two kinds of asymmetric relations between the host schools and the teacher education programs, and one kind of symmetric relations emerging from the descriptions of the practicum. The implications will suggest a broader view of the practicum, designing a new teacher education program embedded in school organizational culture.

AB  - Meeting the needs of children with disabilities requires strategies for engaging each and every child as an individual and facilitating their participation as a member of a group. The use of the project approach meets the needs of individual children by building on an awareness of children's interests and high expectations. All early childhood teachers should be intentional in their instruction, curriculum design, and interactions with children. In this time of standards-based education, early childhood special educators are even more fully expected to be accountable and explicate the purpose and goals of activities they implement in their classrooms. This article explores the alignment of the project approach with key practices necessary for successful inclusive environment. It aims to describe the utility of the project approach in inclusive settings and its reflection of strategies recommended for use with children with disabilities. (Contains 2 tables.)

"Occupational Experience as the Basis for Alternative Teacher Certification in Vocational Education" (Richard L.

AB  - The ability for a novice teacher to confidently address inappropriate behavior has a substantial impact on student achievement, teacher attrition, and the reduction of bullying instances (Allen, 2010; Marzano, 2003). Classroom management plays a critical role in the success of the student as well as the teacher. The authors propose an intervention that potentially may have considerable impact on a novice teachers' confidence regarding classroom management. The idea of providing guidelines for novice teachers to implement while redirecting student behavior could perhaps impact self-efficacy with classroom management. This paper describes the implementation of the Redirect Behavior Model (RBM) with pre-service teachers during a five week practicum. The RBM is a proactive communication model that provides scripted guidelines for teachers to follow while they redirect inappropriate student behavior. The pre-service teachers were given extensive training on the RBM and was able to implement the model during an extensive field placement. Participants were 31 undergraduate pre-service teacher candidates, majoring in secondary education and enrolled in a junior-level classroom management course. The participants were trained in all three phases of the RBM prior to engaging in an extensive field practicum. Participants responded to an informal survey to explore students' self-efficacy about their knowledge and ability to manage student behavior. Paired samples t tests were used to evaluate possible differences between pre- and posttests for the two sets of items (knowledge and self-efficacy). The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of training in the RBM on pre-service teachers' self-efficacy in classroom management.

Participants included 83 first- through fourth-grade students who met research criteria for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and evidenced academic difficulties and their general and/or special education teachers. Reading interventions were developed through individualized, data-driven consultation (IDAI) or generic, menu-based consultative services (TDAI). Results suggested a moderate, positive relationship between treatment integrity and acceptability for both consultation groups, although the relationship was statistically significant for the IDAI group only. Furthermore, although there was a significant difference between consultation groups on treatment integrity, differences between groups on treatment acceptability were not statistically significant. Implications for practice and future research are discussed. (Contains 1 table.)

Participants were 134 preservice teachers enrolled at a large university in a southeastern state. A discriminant analysis revealed a statistically significant relationship between discipline orientation and educational beliefs. The effect size was moderate. The standardized coefficients and structure coefficients indicated that teacher candidates who were the most interventionist also tended to be the most transmissive. Similarly, teacher candidates with the most non-interventionist orientation tended to be the most progressive. Implications are discussed. (Contains 38 references.) (Author/SM)

AB  - Students with disabilities across the nation, including Baltimore City, are failing to achieve their academic potential. Inadequate instruction and other inappropriate or unlawful practices cause and conceal the dysfunction of special education. At long last, the illusion and broken promises of special education have been publicly exposed. Under the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB), school systems across the country have been forced to disclose the abysmally low academic test scores of students with disabilities. Education Week, the national education newspaper, put out a special edition in January 2004 focused solely on special education. Its survey found a chasm between the performance of general and special education students in every state, with differences typically ranging from 30 to 40 percent. "Thanks to the NCLB generated data that's now flowing in, we know more about the disability gap," says one observer. "On average, disabled students lag farther behind their non-disabled classmates than African American and Hispanic students lag behind their white classmates." In the Maryland School Assessments for this year (2003-2004) in reading, the percentages of BCPSS special education students who achieved a "proficient" or higher score were: grade 3, 28.6 percent; grade 5, 22.6 percent; grade 8, 5.4 percent; and grade 10, 4.9 percent. For mathematics, the scores were even lower. The percentages of special education students who achieved "proficient" or above were: grade 3, 24.6 percent; grade 5, 16.9 percent; grade 8, 1.7 percent; and high school geometry, 0.5 percent. The third grade and fifth grade scores improved over the prior year. Yet all scores remain very low or rock-bottom. Even more alarming, the vast gap between general and special education students has widened in recent years and now averages more than 35 percentage points in reading and more than 29 percentage points in math. Furthermore, BCPSS special education students trail far beir counterparts in the rest of Maryland. The longer students receive special education services, the steeper their academic decline. Beyond low test scores, other indicators of negligible academic achievement are the high dropout and low graduation rates. The report recommends actions that should be taken by BCPSS: (1) BCPSS must change its culture of denial of the practices that underlie the lack of academic achievement of students with learning difficulties; (2) openly examine the special education system and raise expectations based on research showing that these students can achieve at much higher levels if research-based instruction is delivered; (3) stop exaggerating the progress made by these students; and (4) shift the focus of special education from procedural compliance to quality of instruction, undo the inappropriate or unlawful practices described in this article, and allow special educators to exercise their professional judgment in prescribing and delivering services without fear of retribution. All the while, BCPSS must continue to improve identification and intervention for early reading difficulties among its general education students. The best way to solve most of the problems of poor special education instruction is to prevent most students with learning difficulties from entering special education in the first place. When interventions are not provided in general education, children fall behind quickly, and special education is then asked to bear the burden of remediation. But remediation is much harder to achieve than early prevention of reading problems. Reform efforts along these lines would shine the national spotlight on BCPSS while illuminating similar issues in school districts across Maryland and the country. We owe our children and our teachers a much better system. The legal and moral right to special education programs can be fulfilled for many more students. But these transformations will happen only if all of us - in education, the political arena and the general public - sound the alarm and advocate for change. The Abell Report also includes "Abell Salutes", recognizing "The Baltimore Stars Coalition," Teaching young basketball players how to "use basketball instead of being used by basketball."

AB  - Special education instruction in the Baltimore City Public School System (BCPSS) for students with learning difficulties is shamefully ineffective. These students, usually classified as having a "Specific Learning Disability" or "Speech and language impairment," comprise more than half of all children receiving special education services. Most of them have the cognitive ability to meet high academic standards or to achieve at higher levels than they do. Yet their test scores are abysmally low and far behind their non-disabled peers. The fault doesn't lie with front-line special educators. They and their students alike are set up for failure by a system that does not give teachers and other service providers the training and resources to get the job done. Worse, the special education system conceals its shortcomings. It fails to recognize the huge gap between the academic performance of students and their academic potential. It gives the false impression that it is providing research-based instruction. It exaggerates student progress. And it buries the poor academic performance of students under a mountain of excessive bureaucratic paperwork. This report traces these flaws to BCPSS practices that violate or undermine federal and state laws intended to enable students with learning difficulties to succeed academically. Most tellingly, special education is defined under federal law as "specially designed instruction" to meet the child's unique needs. Yet special educators lack knowledge of research-based instructional practices and, because of staffing shortages and procedural burdens, lack time to individualize the design of instruction in Individual Education Programs (IEPs) for students. The context of this report must be clearly understood. First, BCPSS's dismal academic results and inappropriate or unlawful practices are similar in many respects to national patterns. The report, therefore, is intended not only to spur BCPSS reform but also to inform the emerging national debate over the quality of special education instruction. Under the federal No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB), special education students must generally meet the same high academic standards and show the same "adequate yearly progress" as all other students. These new, tough requirements will force school districts across the country to pay attention at long last to the shame and sham of special education instruction. (Contains 119 endnotes.)

AB  - The inclusion of the Knowledge about Language strand in the recently introduced Australian Curriculum: English (AC:E) is both promising and challenging. For the first time, students across primary and secondary years of schooling are expected to develop "a coherent, dynamic, and evolving body of knowledge about the English language and how it works" (ACARA 2009). Yet, it has been documented that teachers are not well equipped with their linguistic and pedagogic knowledge to translate that knowledge into productive pedagogic practices (Hammond and Macken-Horarik 2001; Jones and Chen 2012). This challenge is confounded by the debate regarding what constitutes an appropriate pedagogy for contemporary grammar teaching. Grammar teaching bears the weight of its own history of practices that were often decidedly "undialogic". Unless new ways of fostering the development of students' knowledge about language are developed, the potential of the innovative English Curriculum risks being undermined. In this study, we consider what dialogic teaching principles (Alexander 2008) might offer an engaging, productive pedagogy for grammar teaching. We offer a linguistic account of the dialogic principles as they are enacted in this classroom. Thus providing insights into the complexities of the principles in action. We also argue for knowledge of classroom talk as a resource for engaging learners with grammar and for fostering the metalinguistic understandings imagined in this curriculum reform.

One hundred and fifty students participated in the first trial course of which 96 followed through the entire course and 70 fulfilled the overall course requirements. The course was built up of 12 lectures covering different basic and advanced topics within bioinformatics. The lectures consist of streaming video and synchronized slides with follow-up discussion forums and a final assessment. It draws on experts from diverse institutions to share their teaching expertise and resources via distance learning. A major goal of S-Star is to provide free introductory web-based education. Here we present the outline of the course, experiences from a global collaboration, and feedback from the first trial of the on-line S-Star course. (Contains 2 tables, 1 figure and 1 footnote.)

AB  - Principals who are determined to help their teachers inspire all students to bold accomplishments while identifying the right strategies for their most complex and struggling learners need to have a relentless focus on making "learning" the core business of school. This isn't the same as emphasizing assessment data, standards, and instruction. Rather, it means focusing on the foundation upon which all those initiatives rest: an understanding of "how" people learn. This article discusses how findings from neuroscience and cognitive and behavioral science and their implications for learning can help principals equip their faculty members with strategies and tactics that make personalized and successful learning plans a reality. Equally important, their schools will unearth the unique strengths and affinities of uniquely wired minds. Not only will more students become successful learners but also schools will nurture many more diverse and creative minds. When minds are no longer misunderstood and interventions address students' "weak wiring," teachers, students, and parents replace old habits of frustration and defeat with a hopeful and optimistic sense that students can be successful and discover their strengths.

AB  - This literature review intends to highlight some of the critical research that has been synthesized on the perspectives of both teachers and students and their attitudes to teaching and learning in an STS-themed learning environment. The first portion draws on the perspectives of elementary and secondary school teachers both locally and abroad. The information collected is intended to illustrate some of the major successes, as well as barriers to implementation in several different classrooms. The review will present data focusing on the overall attitude and educational successes of students that participate in an STS-enriched learning environment. By examining the current research on STS, it is expected that a clear picture will be created demonstrating the place of STS in the overall science curriculum. The conclusion of the review will also aim to indicate disparities still present in the growing body of STS research and areas of future focus.

AB  - Social validation is the value judgment from society on the importance of a study. The social validity of behavior goals used in the social competence intervention literature was assessed using the Q-sort technique. The stimulus items were 80 different social competence behavior goals taken from 78 classroom-based social competence intervention studies published between 1970 and 2000 for preschool children. Participants (N = 36) were early childhood special educators, early childhood educators, and administrators. Participants generated three distinct viewpoints concerning valued social competence behavior goals: Factor 1, reduction in negative behaviors; Factor 2, pro-social; and Factor 3, communication and good manners. Recommendations for research in the area of social competence interventions are discussed in light of these findings. (Contains 4 tables.)

AB  - The status of career and technical education (CTE) teacher preparation programs was examined through a survey sent to all CTE program chairs and teacher educators with administrative responsibilities. The survey was also posted on the World Wide Web. Data were received from 227 programs from 164 institutions (response rate, 44%). Ten percent of the responses were obtained from the Web survey. The respondents reported that their teacher preparation programs remain very traditional from the standpoints of course structure and delivery. However, many respondents stated that they planned to double their distance education course offerings via the World Wide Web within the next 3 years. With an average of 6 credits per program, the teacher preparation curriculum was emphasizing academic-technical integration, an area that did not appear in the curriculum 10 years ago. Overall, the number of CTE teacher education programs had declined by approximately 11% over the past 10 years. The following items are among those appended: list of respondents by institution and program areas; characteristics of program administration; grade-point average requirements for program entry, exit, and transfer; and numbers/types of program entry and exit criteria listed by respondents.)

AB  - Student feedback is a valuable asset in curriculum evaluation and improvement, but many institutions have faced challenges implementing it in a meaningful way. In this article, we report the rationale, process and impact of the Student Curriculum Review Team (SCRT), a student-led and faculty-supported organization at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. SCRT’s evaluation of each pre-clinical course is composed of a comprehensive three-step process: a review of course evaluation data, a Town Hall Meeting and online survey to generate and assess potential solutions, and a thoughtful discussion with course directors. Over the past two years, SCRT has demonstrated the strength of its approach by playing a substantial role in improving medical education, as reported by students and faculty. Furthermore, SCRT’s uniquely student-centered, collaborative model has strengthened relationships between students and faculty and is one that could be readily adapted to other medical schoo)

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationships between preservice teacher preparation, teacher in-service practice, and outcomes for students with special needs. A fuller understanding of the "teacher preparation greater than teacher practice greater than student outcomes" connection will inform teacher preparation programs as they work to better equip general and special education teachers with the knowledge and skills that will lead to improvements in student achievement. This exploration of the literature sheds light on these relationships but reveals a dearth of studies that would bring real illumination. Finally, specific recommendations to direct further development of policy, research, and practice--and the interactions between the three--are provided. (Contains 8 footnotes.)

AB  - The objectives of this paper are: to briefly describe how teaching portfolios, in tandem with the Teaching/Learning Framework (Sprinthall & Thies-Sprinthall, 1983) can be employed as a developmental intervention to promote stage growth in teacher candidates; to report developmental stage change (moral judgment/principled thinking) results from three developmental portfolio intervention studies; and to draw implications as to the potential use and value of a deliberate, developmental teaching portfolio intervention in the promotion of teacher candidate professional growth. Findings relative to the intervention impact on teacher candidate development (moral judgment) are reported. The data were extracted from three portfolio studies whereby the teaching portfolio intervention, employing a cognitive developmental framework, served as the independent variable. The common dependent variable amongst studies was moral judgment, as measured by Rest's (1986) Defining Issues Test (DIT). Studies 1 and 2 participants were enrolled in the internship semester of their teacher education program. Study 3 consisted of a cohort in their final three semesters of coursework. DIT pre- and post-tests were conducted prior to and following the intervention. Participants were comprised of intact groups (voluntary participants); therefore, findings cannot be generalized except to similar populations. Both one-semester implementation studies revealed no significant gains in moral judgment reasoning. However, significant differences in DIT gain scores were reported for the cohort that received the developmental portfolio intervention. The time factor (continuity) may be a critical factor in promoting stage growth in moral development. (Contains 37 references.) (Author/SM)

AB  - It goes without saying that the terms people use in their daily discourse constantly change. Today the term "nursery school" is referred to as preschool and Pre-K. Perhaps it reflects the contemporary view that the main mission of early education is preparation for school, i.e. "school readiness." But that particular shift in terms is not as disconcerting as the current tendency to refer to child care as an "industry." A related concern is the increasing use of the term "workforce" when referring to those who staff preschool and child care programs. Another term that seems to have crept into the daily chatter is that of "delivery." Frequent references are made to "delivering" education or curricula or instruction to the wide range of educational settings. The reasons behind these terminology changes are not clear to this author. They are likely to be due to a variety of shifts and changes in the care of young children, who are spending more time earlier in their lives away from their own homes. One factor might be the sheer numbers of children and service providers now involved in the field, which might convey the size of an industry. Another might be the wide diversity of services that are provided to preschool-age children, including family day care, Head Start, cooperative nursery schools, parochial preschools, chain-linked corporate-run preschools, and more. Whatever the terms currently in use, the author urges caregivers and teachers of young children to come together to provide a good quality public service and continue to strive to become the best public servants they can be.

The program was developed to meet the needs of the growing number of deaf and hard of hearing children in Mississippi who were not receiving early intervention services. In addition, the increase in the use of cochlear implants has made it more important that children receive timely post-operative services which focus on speech and language development.

AB  - Simulations and games have been used in education for decades, but most of this development has been in the areas of business and economics. Well-designed simulations and games have been shown to improve decision-making and critical thinking skills as well as teaching discipline-specific concepts. Active learning also helps students develop interpersonal and communications skills. It is believed that simulations can be adapted and developed in other areas of education. In this paper, a description of a simulation that has been developed and used in a human development course in the teacher education program is reviewed. Students were divided into groups and the groups were given specific roles related to a scenario dealing with a dysfunctional family. The roles included the parents, advocates for the children, the children?s teachers, psychologists, and judges. The groups were given information at the beginning and during the simulation. The advocate groups made their presentations to the judges and the judges decided the case. The simulation was constructed so that there was no "right" or "wrong" answer. The most important part of the scenario was the debriefing that occurred after the judges reached a decision. At this time, the participants discussed the reasons related to the responses and the problem solving process used within the simulation. By dissecting the motives and actions of the individual participants, it was possible to identify the underlying themes. In the simulation described here, the students were able to identify cooperation and cooperative learning, problem solving, communication, self-efficacy, motivation, and application as important themes. The simulation provided students with a hands-on exercise that illustrated and reinforced those concepts and skills that will be important in their careers.

AB  - The use of video modeling (VM) procedures in conjunction with the picture exchange communication system (PECS) to increase independent communicative initiations in preschool-age students was evaluated in this study. The four participants were 3-year-old children with limited communication skills prior to the intervention. Two of the students had been diagnosed with autism and two students exhibited developmental delays. An alternating treatments design was used to examine the effects of using VM as a priming technique to enhance the efficacy of students acquiring PECS and increasing the number of independent communicative initiations. Based on the data, the authors concluded that all students learned to use PECS and increased the number of independent communicative initiations; however, the students' rate of learning was quicker when using VM. Conclusions are discussed in the context of using empirically based interventions to teach communication skills to students with disabilities and limited verbal skills.

AB  - Background REDD+ programs rely on accurate forest carbon monitoring. Several REDD+ projects have recently shown that local communities can monitor above ground biomass as well as external professionals, but at lower costs. However, the precision and accuracy of carbon monitoring conducted by local communities have rarely been assessed in the tropics. The aim of this study was to investigate different sources of error in tree biomass measurements conducted by community monitors and determine the effect on biomass estimates. Furthermore, we explored the potential of local ecological knowledge to assess wood density and botanical identification of trees. Results Community monitors were able to measure tree DBH accurately, but some large errors were found in girth measurements of large and odd-shaped trees. Monitors with experience from the logging industry performed better than monitors without previous experience. Indeed, only experienced monitors were able to discriminate trees with low wood densities. Local ecological knowledge did not allow consistent tree identification across monitors. Conclusion Future REDD+ programmes may benefit from the systematic training of local monitors in tree DBH measurement, with special attention given to large and odd-shaped trees. A better understanding of traditional classification systems and concepts is required for local tree identifications and wood density estimates to become useful in monitoring of biomass and tree diversity.

AB  - The out-of-school factors that low-income children face can impact their wellbeing and ability to learn (Rothstein, 2010), leading to low academic performance, and, in turn, high levels of stress among their teachers. One of the numerous potential strategies that exist to address this problem is the implementation of systemic student support interventions, which are hypothesized to support teachers in addition to students (Ball & Anderson-Butcher, 2014). Using the City Connects intervention as an example of a comprehensive, systemic student support intervention that has demonstrated positive effects for students, this dissertation study examines the impact of this same intervention on teachers. The study used data obtained from annual surveys administered to all teachers in public schools (across several districts) where the City Connects intervention was implemented. The sample consisted of 656 responses from teachers in Boston Public Schools that were participating in the City Connects intervention during three designated school years (2012-13, 2013-14, and 2015-16). The study implemented a mixed-methods approach that allowed for an in-depth analysis of teachers' perceptions of support from the City Connects intervention through both quantitative and qualitative data sources. Following exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of the survey instrument itself, survey data was analyzed using the Validating Quantitative Data Model (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2007), in which quantitative findings were confirmed and expanded upon through analysis of data from a small number of open-ended survey questions. The results of this dissertation study support the continued use of systemic student support interventions in schools, as data confirm that teachers in schools with City Connects report being supported by the intervention. These results hold for veteran teachers who have been teaching for over sixteen years and have participated in the City Connects intervention for over ten years. Ultimately, the findings of this dissertation study suggest that, in addition to leading to positive changes in students' developmental trajectories, student support interventions can improve the experiences of other members of the school community.

AB  - Dr. James Gallagher published widely on most topics in gifted education, and was often invited to provide commentary on basic theories of giftedness for audiences of psychologists and educators. His own background as a psychologist and special educator as well as a gifted educator positioned him well to hold the theoretical views he did on the nature of giftedness and how it might be nurtured. Dr. Gallagher, trained as a clinician, articulated superbly for more than half a century the evolving theories of giftedness that framed our understanding of gifted children and their needs in his writings and his talks. His intellectual clarity on these issues was without peer and will be sorely missed in a field so in need.

AB  - This volume addresses the complex issues surrounding language teacher education, especially in EFL, and the development of professionalism in this field. By applying such concepts as Shulman's "pedagogical content knowledge", the development of teachers' knowledge base is investigated in a variety of settings, thus underpinning the contextual nature of teacher learning. The vital role of critical reflection at all stages of teacher development is shown to be an integral part of language teachers' knowledge constructions in areas such as pedagogical grammar, assessment and testing. The contributions shed light also on the perception and development of teacher expertise. This volume sets out to bridge the gap between theory and practice, and in so doing shows that these constructs are far from monolithic. Rather, both theory and practice are created and developed dynamically in close interrelation. Part 1: Conceptualising the Issue of Theory and Practice, contains the following chapters: (1) Closing the Gap, Changing the Subject (Henry G. Widdowson); (2) The Dialectics of Theory and Practice in Teacher Knowledge Development (Amy B.M. Tsui); and (3) Moments of Practice: Teachers' Knowledge and Interaction in the Language Classroom (Joachim Appel). Part 2: Developing Language Teachers' Knowledge Base, continues with these chapters: (4) Creating Language-Assessment Literacy: A Model for Teacher Education (Armin Berger); (5) Grammar Teaching: Theory, Practice, and English Teacher Education (Penny Ur); (6) Cognitive + Communicative Grammar in Teacher Education (David Newby); and (7) Towards a Stronger Intervention: The Role of Literature in Teacher Education (Susanne Reichl). Part 3: Assisting Language Teachers' Knowledge Construction presents: (8) Supporting the Transfer of Innovation into Foreign-Language Classrooms: Applied Projects in In-Service Teacher Education (Sandra Hutterli and Michael C. Prusse); (9) Developing Student Teachers' 'Pedagogical Content Knowledge' in English for Specific Purposes: The 'Vienna ESP Approach' (Julia Huttner and Ute Smit); and (10) The EPOSTL (European Portfolio for Student Teachers of Languages): A Tool to Promote Reflection and Learning in Pre-Service Teacher Education (Barbara Mehlmauer-Larcher). Part 4: Addressing Established Paradigms, provides: (11) NESTs Versus Non-NESTs: Rethinking English-Language Teacher Identities (Irena Vodopija Krstanovic); and (12) Multilingualism Pedagogy: Building Bridges between Languages (Eva Vetter).

AB  - High school graduation is a critical milestone for students as it has implications for future opportunity and success on both individual and societal levels. In Puerto Rico recent changes in how high school graduation rates are calculated have drawn closer attention to the issue of high school graduation and thus a growing interest in understanding the relationship between Puerto Rico's high school characteristics and graduation rates. This report presents findings from a correlational study of high school characteristics and high school graduation in Puerto Rico. Using data from the Puerto Rico Department of Education and publicly available data about the cohort of grade 10 students who entered Puerto Rico high schools during the 2010/11 school year, the study analyzed the correlation between graduation rates and two types of variables. The two types of variables are school-level student composition variables and school characteristic variables. School-level student composition variables refer to characteristics that are not amenable to intervention by educators (for example, the percentage of students who are male), and school characteristic variables refer to characteristics that can be changed or, in other words, that are amenable to intervention (for example, the student-teacher ratio). The study then estimated the conditional association between these characteristics and on-time graduation (within three years) using regression analyses to control for other factors. The key findings associated with school characteristics--those amenable to intervention--are: (1) Puerto Rico high schools with a higher percentage of students who were proficient in Spanish language arts had higher graduation rates overall and for all students subgroups examined (male students, female students, students living in poverty, and students in special education). These relationships were also found after other school characteristics were controlled for; (2) High schools with higher percentages of students who were proficient in math had higher graduation rates for all students and for all student subgroups except female students. However, the relationships were not apparent after other school characteristics were controlled for; (3) High schools with lower student-teacher ratios had higher rates of graduation overall and for all subgroups. After other school characteristics were controlled for, the relationships were still found for male students, students living in poverty, and students in special education but not for all students or for female students; and (4) Contrary to the expectation that having more qualified teachers in a school would result in higher graduation rates, this study found that high schools with lower percentages of highly qualified teachers--teachers who attain full state (regular) certification in the subject taught--had higher graduation rates for all students and for all subgroups except male students. After other school characteristics were controlled for, schools with fewer highly qualified teachers still had higher graduation rates overall and for male students, students living in poverty, and students in special education. These findings provide a starting point for Puerto Rico stakeholders interested in data-driven decision-making to address the low rates of graduation in their high schools and communities. Two strategies that might be helpful in raising graduation rates are: (1) Implementing interventions to increase the percentage of students who score at the proficient level in assessments of Spanish language arts; and (2) Lowering the student-teacher ratio for students living in poverty and students in special education. The findings of this study may also be useful for educators and researchers interested in understanding on-time high school graduation rates in U.S. territories, such as Puerto Rico, where research has been limited and information on graduation trends remains scarce. A section on Data and Methodology is appended.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare the effect of a repeated reading and question generation intervention entitled Re-read-Adapt and Answer-Comprehend (RAAC) with a modified RAAC intervention without the repeated reading component. The sample included 30 students in Grades 3 through 5. The students received services in reading within a three-tiered response to intervention framework or in special education. Students were randomly assigned to the nonrepetitive condition or the control repeated reading condition and participated in 50 intervention sessions over a 4-month period. Regardless of condition, all students made gains in oral reading fluency on independent passages. The modified RAAC program without passage repetition appeared to be as effective if not more so at increasing reading fluency when compared to the RAAC program with passage repetition.

AB  - Reviews the book, Recognizing and Helping the Neglected Child: Evidence-Based Practice for Assessment and Intervention by Brigid Daniel, Julie Taylor, Jane Scott, David Derbyshire, and Deanne Neilson (2011). This book focus on understanding neglect and recognizing the signs, in parents and in children, that it is happening. These are as important to primary health and community safety teams, schools and other community services as they are to the commissioners who fund early intervention work, and to social work managers and practitioners who lead on 'targeted' service provision. There is much of value in this book for all professionals who encounter families where neglect may be occurring far more numerous than those identified as possibly in need of a formal protection plan. Overall this well-presented, highly readable and wise book should be at the top of the ‘must read in the next 3 months' list even for the busiest of social workers and managers who provide social work services for vulnerable children and parents. It is not one where a summary will do the trick, it is already a distillation of a great deal of background knowledge about vulnerable parents and children, how best to provide them with appropriate services, and about approaches and methods that are most likely to be helpful to the wide range of individuals who might be included under the term 'neglectful families'.

AB  - This Critical Commentary reviews progress in research into planning and reviewing for children in care in England and Wales since the publication of two major studies in the late 1990s (roughly coinciding with the New Labour period). It briefly considers the changing context of law, regulation and guidance and the aims and objectives of the care planning and review system. It then reviews the limited research literature available, in relation to a series of key topics. Consideration is also given to guides for children and practitioners on the subject. The Commentary concludes by suggesting that this is an area in which research has failed to keep pace with changes in policy and practice, and recommends a more systematic approach.

AB  - Program monitoring is an important and necessary assessment practice within the field of early childhood deaf education. Effective program monitoring requires a focus on both the consistent implementation of intervention strategies (fidelity) and the assessment of children's ongoing progress in response to interventions (progress monitoring). Teachers of the deaf and hard of hearing (TODs) who provide early intervention services need to conduct regular program monitoring to evaluate the merit of their efforts. However, progress monitoring is a practice often overlooked by practitioners within the field of early intervention. It is recommended that TODs monitor children's progress regularly, but evidence of such practices by TODs is as yet unavailable. In this article, we describe how TODs can use both progress monitoring and fidelity checks to achieve the goal of effective program monitoring for young children who are deaf and hard of hearing.

AB  - Opportunities for intergroup contact are particularly important for prospective teachers because they bear responsibility for an ethnically diverse student population. Using data from a sample of 330 students inscribed in Austrian university colleges of teacher education, we investigated the long-term effects of international student exchange on prospective teachers' motivation to avoid prejudiced behavior (MAPB). Both sojourning and domestic students' friendships with visiting international students (VIS) were evaluated as potential instances of naturally occurring intergroup contact that can affect students' MAPB. Sojourning students had an increased MAPB even nine months after returning to their home country. No effect was found for domestic students' friendships with VIS. Possibly, the quality of these friendships was insufficient to result in long-term prejudice reduction. Implications of these results are discussed, and the need to advance interventions that are appropriate to improve domestic students' contact with VIS is ascertained.

AB  - This article discusses family work with young people, parents and carers affected by child sexual exploitation (CSE). It seeks to address a key gap in child protection responses to CSE, namely family support which addresses the needs both of young people and of parents and carers. The paper presents learning from the evaluation of an early-intervention project with young people at risk of or affected by CSE and their families (D'Arcy et al., 2015). It links this empirical evidence to existing research and recent debates in the social work literature about what constitutes effective practice with families and young people. While acknowledging the need for CSE specialist services, it argues that separation between mainstream social work and CSE prevention work with families and young people is not always helpful. The research presented, based on interviews, roundtable discussions and a literature review, highlights the ways of working needed in this field. By connecting family support, work with young people and CSE prevention, we seek to contribute to a broader agenda for social work. This agenda calls for a twenty-first-century reconfiguration of social work using holistic family support practices that work with families' strengths and apply a participatory approach, providing services which emphasise `relationships' and `support'.

AB  - The Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) has been a successful and popular initial teacher education (ITE) programme since the 1950s, with the masters level PGCE being successfully embedded within universities in England since 2007 and having high levels of student satisfaction. Recent White Papers, policy and reviews have undermined the academic award in ITE, however, favouring school-led initial teacher training and the minimum, essential professional award. Located within the Secondary ITE phase in two English universities, this article presents the value of studying education and the academic award at pre-service level via key stakeholder perceptions from interviews with teacher-educators and student-teachers within a case study. Findings highlight improvements to student-teachers' knowledge and practice; enjoyment in working at a higher academic level; improvements to the ITE programme overall, including student-teacher support and student-teachers' articulation of knowledge and practice; and enhanced opportunities for employability, career advancement and gaining a Master's degree.

In Phase I, focus groups were conducted in two school districts with school staff and/or parents of children with HFASDs. The focus groups examined needs, resources, and barriers related to CSBIs, followed by adaptation of an empirically supported nonschool psychosocial intervention for HFASDs into a CSBI manual. In Phase II, two 4-week component trials examined the feasibility of the five treatment components when administered by school staff. Focus-group meetings were also held during Phase II to revise the CSBI manual as needed. Feasibility was assessed according to the level of treatment fidelity during implementation and teacher- and parent-reported acceptability and satisfaction. Feasibility was supported in high levels of treatment fidelity and teacher- and)

AB  - This article describes a data-informed intervention to close the gap between student and teacher perceptions of school rules and improve student behavior. The student and teacher agreement realignment strategy was pilot tested over 36 weeks with 10 middle school students receiving services for special education in the eligibility category of emotional disturbance. Students and teachers used similar assessment tools to record student compliance with five classroom behavior norms or rules. Student and teacher reports of student behavior were compared in weekly student-led conferences. Data were used by students, teachers, and the school social worker to evaluate students' progress, identify goals, and develop individualized interventions for improving behavior. In the current study, single-subject data on the 10 students were analyzed for clinical and visual significance and statistical significance using the proportion-frequency procedure and the two standard deviations statistical test. Significant improvement in student behavior was revealed. Furthermore, nine out of 10 students demonstrated a significant reduction in teacher-generated office disciplinary referrals.

Focusing on the evidence-based teaching skill of offering behavior-specific praise (BSP), the researchers worked with three elementary-level general educators in a tiered model of training generally known as response to intervention (RtI). Although RtI commonly provides targeted instructional support to students, this study used the RtI framework to provide professional development instruction to teachers. The researchers also tracked the behavior of three students identified by the teachers as having behavioral difficulties, who became the focus of each teacher's BSP. Results showed increases in rates of BSP following the Tier 2 and Tier 3 interventions (video self-monitoring and peer coaching), but not following the Tier 1 intervention (school-wide in-service training). Averages for all three students' on-task behavior increased with increased teacher BSP. (Contains 3 tables and 1 figure.)

AB  - Social support has been a topic of research for nearly 50 years, and its applications to prevention and intervention have grown significantly, including programs advancing child protection. This article summarizes the central conclusions of the 1994 review of research on social support and the prevention of child maltreatment prepared for the U.S. Advisory Board on Child Abuse and Neglect, and surveys advances in the field since its publication. Among the lessons learned twenty years ago are (a) the diversity of the social support needs of at-risk families and their association with child endangerment, (b) the need to supplement the emotionally affirmative aspects of social support with efforts to socialize parenting practices and monitor child well-being, (c) the desirability of integrating formal and informal sources of social support for recipients, and (d) the importance of considering the complex recipient reactions to receiving support from others. The lessons we are now learning derive from research exploring the potential of online communication to enhance social support, the neurobiology of stress and its buffering through social support, and the lessons of evaluation research that are identifying the effective ingredients of social support interventions.

AB  - Smoking is a common risk factor for many diseases. We conducted genome-wide association meta-analyses for the number of cigarettes smoked per day (CPD) in smokers (n = 31,266) and smoking initiation (n = 46,481) using samples from the ENGAGE Consortium. In a second stage, we tested selected SNPs with in silico replication in the Tobacco and Genetics (TAG) and Glaxo Smith Kline (Ox-GSK) consortia cohorts (n = 45,691 smokers) and assessed some of those in a third sample of European ancestry (n = 9,040). Variants in three genomic regions associated with CPD (P <5 x 10(-8)), including previously identified SNPs at 15q25 represented by rs1051730[A] (effect size = 0.80 CPD, P = 2.4 x 10(-69)), and SNPs at 19q13 and 8p11, represented by rs4105144[C] (effect size = 0.39 CPD, P = 2.2 x 10(-12)) and rs6474412-T (effect size = 0.29 CPD, P = 1.4 x 10(-8)), respectively. Among the genes at the two newly associated loci are genes encoding nicotine-metabolizing enzymes (CYP2A6 and CYP2B6) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits (CHRNB3 and CHRNA6), all of which have been highlighted in previous studies of smoking and nicotine dependence. Nominal associations with lung cancer were observed at both 8p11 (rs6474412[T], odds ratio (OR) = 1.09, P = 0.04) and 19q13 (rs4105144[C], OR = 1.12, P = 0.0006).

AB  - The concept of �video game addiction� has gradually replaced the depiction of violence in video games as a key issue of concern among parents and professionals. The concept refers to situations where (predominantly) young (predominantly) men neglect other activities in their everyday lives in order to play video games. As follows from the term �addiction� the public common sense as well as a considerable part of research draw heavy parallels to alcohol abuse or psychological disorders applying either a neurophysiological or a clinical psychological approach to the issue (e.g. Gentile 2009). Typical to these approaches is the idea that the game is a direct cause to the problems and that possible pathological patterns can be derived directly from specific gameplay patterns irrespectively of context. In parallel to this widely held belief, however, a substream of studies has taken a more sociological and contextual approach focusing on the social context of the gamers in question (e.g. Linderoth & Bennerstedt 2007). This panel will continue in a similar vein. The aim is not to deny that a phenomenon such as problem gaming may exist, but rather to question whether the term addiction as imported from neurophysiology or clinical psychology does sufficiently describe it. Accordingly, the aim is to redefine the concept theoretically and empirically and to question simple causal relationship such as the direct link between gameplay patterns and addiction. The panel will introduce everyday life, family and youth as alternative perspectives on problem gaming and the individual presentations in the panel will take a range of perspectives on this issue: Rune Kristian Lundedal Nielsen will initiate the panel with a critical discussion of existing measures of video game addiction. Nielsen will track the historical roots of the diagnostic criteria of video game addiction from Fisher's (1994) DSM-IV-JV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV-Juvenile Arcade Video Game) to the American Psychiatric Association's (2013) Internet Gaming Disorder. The abstract components of the concept of video game addiction are traced over time and related to the individual items of current measures. Through a review and comparison the validity of current measures are questioned as the individual criteria are discussed in terms of how they are translated into specific questions that are instantiated in current measures such as Gentile (2009), Lemmens, Valkenburg and Peter (2009), and Pontes, Kira�ly, Demetrovics, & Griffiths (2014). The analysis defines three critical steps of translation and asks what, if anything, has been lost in the process. Following up on this, Anne Mette Thorhauge and Andreas Gregersen will present findings from a questionnaire survey using an alternative type of measure, that is, self- reports on media habits and the general wellbeing of players and non-players. Our dataset combines survey responses from a stratified random sample of Danish 10-18 year olds (n= 1560) with socio-demographic background variables. This dataset and the resulting analyses of game playing behaviour are, to our knowledge, the first of their kind. The presentation will discuss whether and to what degree respondents with specific gameplay patterns differ from the general population with regard to their well-being: Among the findings presented will be a significant association between family conflict and particular types of games which will lead up to the two following presentations. Jessica Enevolds presentation takes a family and parental mediation perspective on problem gaming. The lack of young Swedish gamers� perspective on everyday playing practices has to some extent been remedied by Linderoth and Bennerstedt (2007) and Linderoth and Olsson (2010), but a parental perspective is still largely missing in the research. Between every active, and at times problematically active, gamer in Sweden, stand a number of, often worried and concerned, parents. This presentation inventories some of the fundamental problems parents of game/screen �addicted� children grapple with. It focuses on families in which children�s gaming is so problematic that parents have sought professional help, and illustrates how these parents find themselves in a predicament: their child�s excessive gaming dominates their everyday life, in terms of their trying to manage their child�s absence from school, loss of off-line friends and disturbed sleeping patterns. But their aims to reduce their children�s� IT use also conflict with governmental and educational policies and aims to increase students� and citizens� digital media use. Finally, Faltin Karlsen will question whether game design can be said to have any importance at all. MMORPG is the game genre that has received most attention from psychological research on problem gaming (Kuss and Griffiths 2011). One reason for this is that players of online games on average spend considerable more time on playing than players of other genres (Williams et al. 2008). The reward schedules that are characteristic of this genre are often employed to explain excessive use. Karlsen argues that the social aspects of MMORPGs may offer a better explanation as to why players play excessively. While the never-ending nature of this genre in large explains the long- term dedication of players, the social life within the game explains why especially time- demanding gaming practices, like raiding, have gained popularity. The focus on structure, and the general aim to develop universal criteria for �online game addiction� are also at odds with the fact that gaming practices are in a constant flux.

AB  - This summary describes the Head Start CARES research project, which evaluated three classroom-based approaches to enhancing children's social-emotional development: (1) The Incredible Years Teacher Training Program; (2) Preschool PATHS (Promoting Alternative Thinking Strategies); and (3) Tools of the Mind--Play. The three social-emotional approaches tested in Head Start CARES were called "enhancements" because they complemented and enriched classroom practices that already existed. The effects, or "impacts," of the enhancements were rigorously evaluated by randomly assigning approximately 100 Head Start centers to one of the three enhancements (the program group) or to a control group that continued with "business as usual." On average, coaches and trainers rated implementation across the year for each enhancement at or above a satisfactory threshold for quality implementation. Compared with the control classrooms, each enhancement also improved the specific teacher practice it was meant to affect: The Incredible Years improved teachers' classroom management; PATHS bolstered teachers' social-emotional instruction; and Tools of the Mind--Play increased the degree to which teachers structured peer interactions and play. Two of the three enhancements also showed consistent positive impacts on a range of children's social-emotional outcomes in preschool, although not always as predicted.

AB  - Evaluated the effectiveness of three service delivery models for 177 K–3rd graders. Differences were investigated between: (a) a collaborative approach, (b) a classroom-based intervention model with the speech-language pathologist (SLP) and classroom teachers working independently, and (c) a traditional pull-out model for children in kindergarten through third grade who qualified for speech or language services. The same curricular vocabulary targets and materials were used in all conditions. This study also examined the vocabulary skills of regular education children who participated in the collaborative approach, the independent classroom-based model, or received instruction from only classroom teachers, without the SLP's involvement. Results indicated the collaborative model was more effective for teaching curricular vocabulary to students who qualified for speech or language services than a classroom-based model or a traditional pull-out model. The findings for students who were not enrolled in speech or language services indicated the collaborative and classroom-based models increased vocabulary skills to a significantly greater degree than receiving only regular instruction from the classroom teacher.

AB  - Former literature reviews suggested that if (student) teachers learn together in their professional development activities, professional development is enhanced. In the present literature review, we explored a variety of peer teacher professional development activities, conceptually divided into coaching, collaborating, and assessing activities. Specifically, we examined which learning outcomes could be achieved through participating in such activities. By means of a meta-study approach, we additionally reviewed methods, data collection, and theories used in the included studies. Findings showed outcomes were achieved in terms of teacher knowledge, teacher skills, and student learning. At the same time, many studies had methodological weaknesses: many self-report and self-constructed instruments hardly based on theory were applied. Based on the findings, we urge for more rigorous studies that can move the field forward.

AB  - Estimates indicate that nearly 2 million children in the U.S. experience parental incarceration each year. Parental incarceration can negatively influence youth development and mental health, which highlights the need to identify protective mechanisms. The purpose of this study is to quantify the prevalence of parental incarceration in a sample of alternative school students, explore the relationship between teacher support (a component of school connectedness) and sadness/hopelessness for students reporting parental incarceration, and test whether this relationship might vary by gender or by race/ethnicity. The results indicate that students attending alternative high schools suffer disproportionately from both parental incarceration and sadness. Of the 515 students who took the survey, 48.7% reported experiencing parental incarceration. Of those, 43.2% reported feeling so sad or hopeless almost every day for at least two weeks in the past year that they stopped doing usual activities. The results indicate gender differences between teacher support and sadness/hopelessness. We suggest areas for future research and provide examples of school-based interventions and policy solutions.

AB  - To help improve social and academic outcomes for all students, school psychologists must be ready to accurately identify, assess, and support students with emotional disturbance. This essential resource gives them the clear information, practical guidance, and up-to-date research they need. Preservice and in-service school psychologists will prepare to: Differentiate social maladjustment from emotional disturbance (includes clear coverage of the exclusionary clause); Determine eligibility for the 'emotional disturbance' identification; Help ensure meaningful individualized educational programs (IEPs) for students; Understand the response to intervention (RTI) model as it relates to identification of behavioral and emotional issues; Meet the legal requirements for assessment procedures; Help teachers develop classroom supports that address the needs of students with emotional disturbance. Brief vignettes and excerpts from federal- and state-level court findings help illuminate the educational definition of emotional disturbance, and practical tables and charts aid with the assessment process and determining eligibility. Ideal for use as a supplemental textbook or a key reference for in-service school psychologists, this book clarifies what constitutes emotional disturbance in educational settings—and how to assess and intervene effectively so students learn and thrive.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the social, emotional, and behavioral impact of a nine-week blended learning social skills intervention for high school students identified as having, or at-risk for, Emotional and Behavioral Disorders. Exploring how social skills interventions improve students' social, emotional, and behavioral deficits can aid in the development of a curriculum that combines social and academic skills in new and innovative ways. This quantitative study utilized a pretest-posttest method. High school students identified as having, or at risk for, Emotional and Behavioral Disorders and their special educators were invited to complete the researcher-designed social skills intervention with a corresponding Social Emotional Assets and Resilience Scales (SEARS) pre- and post-test. There were no statistically significant differences between the pre- and post-test scores for the students or the special educator. The SEARS' social-emotional domains (self-regulation, empathy, responsibility, and social competence) were all found to be statistically significant predictors of the students' total composite score. Similarly, gender was found to be a robust, significant predictor of the student's total composite score. Implications of the study include strategies for developing and delivering social skills interventions at the high school level.

AB  - In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with kindergarten and first-grade general education teachers to determine their perceptions of student behavior. This study describes the teachers' perspectives of and approaches to behavior management and intervention strategies (e.g., use of praise, rewards, implementation of classroom management, and knowledge about PBIS and RTI). A unique contribution of this study is the in-depth data that provide specific descriptions of the teachers' perceptions. Findings indicated that the teachers in this study tended to concentrate more on individual student behavior when describing behavior management strategies than on group or schoolwide behavior. In addition, the teachers were unfamiliar with RTI and PBIS despite training occurring in the system on these initiatives during the study. Lastly, the teachers perceived themselves as strong influences on student behavior development and described the use of positive strategies. Meeting teachers' t)

AB  - The effects of teachers' group incentives on student achievement are examined by reviewing theoretical arguments and empirical studies published between 1990 and 2011. Studies from developing countries reported positive effects of group incentives on student test scores. However, experimental studies from developed countries reported insignificant effects. Some of the evidence appears to show a positive association between small group size of teachers and the effectiveness of group incentives. Still, it is uncertain whether the key to successful group incentives in teaching emanates from the incentive size, teacher group size, teacher intrinsic motivation, or type of incentive (rank type vs. non-rank type). Furthermore, most studies show that individual teacher incentives have positive effects unlike studies on group incentives. However, there is a lack of comparative studies of group incentives and individual incentives. We conclude that current empirical evidence has unclear policy implications and recommend additional experimental research.

AB  - This 23rd annual report to Congress on the implementation of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act 1997 (IDEA) discusses the progress of students with disabilities. It includes a number of modules reporting on the results of the National Assessment. Section 1 includes five modules that present statereported data on high school gradation rates for students with disabilities, information about the participation and performance of students with disabilities in state assessments, challenges to providing secondary education and strategies, outcomes for students with problem behaviors, and data from the National Early Intervention Longitudinal Study. Section 2 contains information on the characteristics of students receiving services under IDEA. The five modules in Section 3 examine some of the programs and services available within schools for children with disabilities and include preliminary results from the National Assessment Program. Educational environments, family involvement, personnel needs, early intervention services, and state and local implementation are discussed. The final section contains three modules describing state improvement activities, the planning process used to develop the Part D National Activities Program, and the National Assessment Program. Extensive appendices provide data tables on child count, placement, personnel, graduation rates, discipline, population and enrollment, and early intervention. (Sections contain references.) (CR)

AB  - This report discusses preliminary results from a project designed to develop and test a practical approach to the identification of, and intervention with, students who have, or are at risk, for emotional and behavioral disorders. The study includes data from 28 elementary students with behavioral problems that concerned the classroom teachers. In a training program in functional assessment and intervention called "Individualized Positive Support" (IPS), teachers learned basic functional assessment methods and developed hypotheses and competing behavioral analyses. They also learned how to use the information from the functional assessment to develop and use positive, individualized interventions. The report focuses on the change in discipline referral rates for eight students who had discipline referrals and for whom functional assessment led to individualized, positive results. Seven of the eight students decreased their referral rates after their teachers participated in IPS. One student, who had not been referred for discipline problems before the IPS training, was sent to the principal's office after the IPS training. Of the seven who decreased their referral rates, six had zero referrals during the follow-up period of two to six months. Specific outcomes for each of these students is described.

AB  - The Twilight School at Danbury High School in Connecticut helps students who are in danger of failing their freshman year to get back on track. In its first year, the program offered special credit-bearing after-school courses in biology and English to students who failed those classes in their first semester. The smaller class sizes and informal atmosphere engaged the students and enabled the DHS educators who taught these courses to experiment with new-to-them instructional techniques, such as blended learning, some of which were later rolled out schoolwide. Of the 75 students who completed the course, 64 earned credits that helped them advance to their sophomore year.

AB  - Reviews the book, Creating Positive Systems of Child and Family Welfare: Congruence with the Everyday Lives of Children and Parents edited by Gary Cameron et al. (2013). The book provides an opportunity for parents in the child welfare system to describe and assess their own lives and to reflect on their experiences in the child welfare system. It focuses on the critical, though often analytically neglected, interaction between clients and caseworkers. The book listens to and presents the voices of both parents and caseworkers to make the child welfare system 'more welcoming and helpful for both families and service providers'. The book concludes with useful recommendations including less paper work, fewer cases brought to court, local and team decision-making, service agreements with clients, and more quality daycare and other services.

AB  - Four hundred twenty-four families who resided in inner-city neighborhoods and had a child entering 1st grade were randomly assigned to a control condition or to a family-focused preventive intervention combined with academic tutoring. SAFEChildren, which was developed from a developmental-ecological perspective, emphasizes developmental tasks and community factors in understanding risk and prevention. Tracking of linear-growth trends through 6 months after intervention indicated an overall eftect of increased academic performance and better parental involvement in school. High-risk families had additional benefits for parental monitoring, child-problem behaviors, and children's social competence. High-risk youth showed improvement in problem behaviors and social competence. Results support a family-focused intervention that addresses risk in low-income communities as managing abnormal challenges. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

Observations were conducted in all classrooms pre- and post-intervention. The treatment group received the intervention: a workshop focused on strategies to engage students more deeply in learning activities and in-class instructional coaching support. Analysis of pre- and post-intervention data showed improvements in student engagement in the treatment teachers classes. Post-observations showed that treatment teachers used a greater variety of instructional methods, student groupings, student activities, and student-centered instructional methods than in pre-observations.

AB  - A child's diagnosis with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can be an extremely stressful time for families. Researchers suggest that the period immediately following ASD diagnosis is a key time for professionals to guide families by providing appropriate information about support options. This article describes a family support program, developed by Autism Spectrum Australia (Aspect). The Early Intervention Readiness Program (EIRP) is delivered during the challenging post-diagnosis period. During program involvement, families are provided with information and management strategies related to ASD-associated behaviors, and support options are identified. The EIRP aims to strengthen family confidence and facilitate a smooth transition into appropriate early intervention services. Preliminary program evaluation outcomes indicate that following program involvement, participants perceive a significant increase in their confidence in their understanding of ASD and capacity to independently make decisions about related supports. Participant post-program evaluations also verify the EIRP to be a useful post-ASD diagnosis support.

AB  - Almost 300,000 children in the United States from birth to 3 years of age are affected by a developmental disability. Disabilities have a lasting effect on a child's development and, in turn, may have a psychosocial impact on the child's family. In addition, the limitations of a child with a disability are often related to family members' stress, depression, and feelings of helplessness. Accordingly, not only do children with disabilities have special needs, but also families have unique needs as well. This review article describes the value of a family-centered approach to early intervention services for infants and toddlers and their families. Authors also describe barriers to the implementation of family-centered care and the role that social workers may play in addressing these barriers.

AB  - Preservice teachers face formidable tasks of planning and management as they enter the classroom for the first time as professionals. They also bring with them mental imprints of what teaching and learning are like, images gained not from their professional preparation programs, but from their years as students. Once in the role of teacher, those views may be reinforced by the circumstances of their apprenticeship. This qualitative study reports five themes in the preservice teaching experience of 10 preservice teachers which may reinforce traditional views of schooling and discourage understanding and addressing unique learning needs of academically diverse learners such as gifted, remedial and special education learners.

AB  - The Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Trauma in Schools (CBITS) was developed for use by school-based mental health professionals for any student with symptoms of distress following exposure to trauma. The Supporting Students Exposed to Trauma (SSET) was adapted from CBITS for use by any school personnel with the time and interest to work with students affected by trauma. The purpose of this toolkit is to assist school-based mental health professionals, school personnel, and child welfare social workers in adapting these interventions for use with youth aged 10-15 who are in foster care. The authors note that delivering a school-based mental health program to youth in foster care has many challenges, including collaboration between the child welfare and education systems, confidentiality and information sharing policies regarding youth in foster care, and identification of these youth. The toolkit was designed to help understand these challenges and provide strategies for addressing them. The toolkit has three parts: a background section, an overview of CBITS and SSET, and a step-by-step guide to implementing and adapting CBITS/SSET for youth in foster care.

AB  - A two-year randomised controlled trial of peer tutoring in mathematics using the Duolog Math technique was operated in 80 schools. The aim was to achieve adequate implementation quality with modest pre-intervention training for teachers, who received brief didactic training and no process feedback (but they were to train pupils using modelling, practice and feedback). Implementation integrity was observed in Year 1 in 29 randomly selected schools; in Year 2 in 30 randomly selected schools. In both years some observed variables of class-wide context and individual technique were high; however, some were lower. There were deficits in: teachers introducing the problem, suggesting ways to concretise the problem and holding plenary sessions. Crucially, there was very little summarising or generalising. Thus, implementation was partial in both years, but better in Year 2. The implications for future intensity of training are explored. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The quality of the professional development of education and welfare professionals working with children and young people (for example, pre-school teachers or ‘pedagogues’, school teachers, teaching assistants, social workers, psychologists, police officers etc.) is of key importance to policy makers and practitioners in these fields. The general wellbeing of a country’s citizens and the provision of better opportunities in terms of educational and social welfare outcomes (for example, participation in higher education and reduction of anti-social behaviour) have been linked to the quality of teaching and, by implication, the quality of continuing professional development (CPD). Conversely, a potential barrier to achieving these education and welfare aspirations is the variable quality of the professional training delivered to the educational and/or welfare practitioners, which could mean that the education and training of these groups of professionals may, sometimes, be less than optimal. In order to inform education and welfare professions – policy makers and practitioners - about the nature and effectiveness of a diversity of approaches to continuing professional develop-ment, a systematic review of the international literature will be undertaken. Professional development of these groups of professionals could include delivery strategies such as: focused supervision; feedback; team work or other kinds of training/ CPD approaches that are specifically focused on core teaching skills such as language and literacy professional development. The review will systematically search for, locate, quality appraise and synthesise all the availa-ble effectiveness studies which evaluate relevant interventions using rigorous designs. By ‘rigorous designs’ we refer to those research designs that can establish a causal link between continuing professional development and outcomes for professionals themselves, children and young people. Therefore, we will include: systematic review (SR) and meta-analytic designs, ‘true’ experiments (randomised controlled trials or RCTs), quasi-experiments (with baseline equivalence as demonstrated by pre-tests in the outcomes of interest but excluding studies using an instrumental variable approach), including studies using regression discontinuity design. We will search substantively for studies in the fields of education, social welfare and crime and justice.

Unhealthy dietary patterns, high blood pressure and obesity are major risk factors for NCDs such as cancers, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. There exists enormous potential to promote health and prevent diseases through targeting unhealthy life style, and it is crucial to develop a qualified public health nutrition workforce in the Nordic countries in order to reduce the NCD burden. Professionals with broad capacity within the field of public health nutrition are necessary to identify and respond to the current health challenges. However, public health nutrition has not been recognized as a profession in the Nordic countries. Public health nutrition (PHN) is an evolving profession within nutrition science that focuses on solving nutritional problems affecting population groups rather than those of individuals. Central elements of the profession are to assess the impact of various aspects of the food systems on the nutritional status, health and health inequalities of population groups, and to develop, recommend and implement evidence-based measures to improve dietary intake and nutritional status of population groups. These measures may be environmental, educational, social, economic, structural, political and/or legislative. The knowledge, skills, competencies and cultural heritage of the broader community should form a basis for all analyses and actions. The competencies required to be an effective PHN practitioner has been described by several scholars as well as by the World Public Health Nutrition Association. However, there is considerable diversity of workforce capacity in different countries. Most countries in the world have under-developed workforces to address PHN issues, including the Nordic countries. The Nordic network on Education in Public Health Nutrition (NEPHN) was established in 2014 with support from the Nordic Council of Ministers. The aim of the network is to further develop PHN education to train highly qualified experts who can handle nutrition related challenges in the Nordic region and globally. The network facilitates exchange of lecturers, students, innovative educational resources and teaching methods and supports the consolidation of PHN as a recognized/accredited profession throughout the Nordic region. The network has done a mapping exercise of public health nutrition education offered in the Nordic region, and will develop a common curriculum in PHN and common online courses (MOOC). Academic institutions from each of the Nordic countries are represented in the network. The network is open for all Nordic academic institutions offering public health nutrition education or courses.

AB  - Teaching Practice is a core component of pre-service or initial teacher education programmes worldwide. The requirements set by the South African Committee on Higher Education effected changes to the coordination and supervision of Teaching Practice. The purpose of this conceptual study was to review and gain insight into the use of various information and communication technologies (ICTs) for Teaching Practice supervision. The main problem relates to the challenge of supervising huge numbers of student teachers registered in open and distance learning (ODL) institution. The research questions are based on opportunities and limitations of selected technologies and what implications need to be considered for implementation. Data were collected primarily from a literature review of international exemplars. The findings support the view that the use of appropriate technologies provides an opportunity for teacher education to challenge underlying assumptions and re-examine Teaching Practice supervision systems and practices. The main implications are that investment in infrastructure and training are important for the adoption of technology enhanced supervision.

AB  - Pasifika learners comprise a significant number of students in the New Zealand education system. In terms of educational performance, Pasifika learners generally have lower success rates and academic achievements than other student groups at both secondary and tertiary levels. The aim of this paper was to review current governance, investigate student support and evaluate outcomes at a New Zealand tertiary institution. Data collection occurred in three phases. The first stage of the research saw 37 student questionnaires completed between May and June 2014, phase two consisted of semi-structured interviews with graduate students between September and October 2015. Phase three in March 2016 entailed the analysis of learner achievement records. The results of the research illustrated that Pasifika students' experience was improved through a variety of learning support systems being available to them. Participants identified that the most valuable student support systems were study skills support and study buddies. Pasifika students also recognised that having a supportive environment that respected Pasifika cultural values and building trust in relationships with staff enhanced their learning experience. In conclusion, a variety of appropriate support systems and a culturally sensitive environment are needed to enrich Pasifika students' tertiary learning experience and achieving positive graduate outcomes. The insights provided by this paper will help develop student support systems that improve graduate outcomes of Pasifika learners, forming a template that can be implemented at tertiary institutions in New Zealand.

AB  - Concurrent to the hasty development within the medical, technological and organizational areas of healthcare, new initiatives are continuously implemented to improve quality of delivered care. To evaluate the effect of these initiatives, the application of performance measurement has become common practice for modern healthcare organizations. During the last decade, vast amounts of quality indicators, accreditation audits, satisfaction surveys etc. have become an integrated part of healthcare professionals' daily work. Most of these measurement structures are well documented and well executed; collectively, however, they pose a significant drawback. The vast selection of self-contained initiatives limits the overview for decision makers and imposes an escalating administrative burden on operational staff members. Contrary to the initial objective, the expanding informational burden limits the overview and transparency for healthcare decision makers; as a result, well-documented initiatives fail to become integrated support in operational decision-making processes. This research work has thus striven to design a holistic Management-By-Objectives framework that can enable managers and operational personnel to assess performance in relation to the organizational expectations. The work concludes that by integrating all meaningful indicators into a �Performance Account�, an overview is established without losing the strength of detailed measures. The design of the Performance Account signifies that managers are able to incorporate those indicators they find useful in their department, and thus secure sufficient informational support for the department's decision-making processes. The Performance Account thereby eases the identification of areas suited for corrective actions, and provides the decision maker with a reliable informational foundation. The account has merits in a hectic environment, where the administrative burden consumes important time from the clinical work. The dissertation is composed of five scientific articles, together with a synopsis describing the most vital contributions and conclusions. Two articles have been presented at international scientific conferences, and three articles have been submitted to scientific journals. The papers present the development of the research study and successively describe the proposals. The synopsis describes in detail the scientific approach that has guided the study.

AB  - This article highlights the importance of developing trainee teachers' knowledge and understanding with respect to the Nature of Science (NoS), as this has long been considered an area of concern. The breadth of understanding of NoS can influence a teacher's ability to engage with enquiry and can determine their ability to teach effectively. However, prior research studies of pre-service teachers' views about NoS clearly indicated that teachers did not typically possess coherent and informed views of the ways science works, and, in addition, different cultures and nationalities hold quite diverse and distinct perceptions and understanding about NoS. With this in mind, the development of trainee NoS knowledge and understanding in pre-service training was embarked upon at the Cass School of Education and Communities, University of East London (UEL). This article describes how tutors focused on challenging areas of the science teacher training curriculum and provided a way to measure the impact of planned interventions to improve understanding of the Nature of Science.

AB  - This article aims to present examples of trainer talk that scaffold trainee teachers' understanding of teaching in a post-observation feedback session. Previous research into scaffolding in a teacher training context describes scaffolding at a technique or strategy level, without describing how, in linguistic terms, the trainer can support and guide the construction of teaching knowledge. Data from this research into talk with trainees in post-observation feedback sessions suggest that there are various levels of trainer scaffolding which may vary from moment to moment in the interaction between trainer and trainee. The article concludes that it is necessary to be aware of specific talk which can scaffold at these levels, and the author offers a possible framework for scaffolding talk.

AB  - Recognising excellence in education as a national priority, the Australian Government established the Review to Achieve Educational Excellence in Australian Schools (the Review) in July 2017. Supported by an independent panel of experts drawn from different states, school systems and sector, the Review Panel examined ways that Australia could improve student outcomes, return to being one of the top education systems in the world, and ensure that school systems and schools truly prepare Australia's young people for an ever-changing world. The Review has focused on identifying reforms that build on existing improvement efforts. Its recommendations and findings reflect contributions from stakeholders and experts through consultations and nearly 300 submissions. These stakeholders included teachers, principals, professional associations, teacher unions, parents and carers, school systems, state and territory governments, researchers, universities, community organisations and business and industry. The key recommendations for reform are: (1) Deliver at least one year's growth in learning for every student every year; (2) Equip every student to be a creative, connected and engaged learner in a rapidly changing world; and (3) Cultivate an adaptive, innovative and continuously improving education system. Five chapters address: (1) Laying the foundations for learning; (2) Equipping every student to grow and succeed in a changing world; (3) Creating, supporting and valuing a profession of expert educators; (4) Empowering and supporting school leaders; and (5) Raising and achieving ambitions through innovation and continuous improvement.

AB  - This final report summarizes the objectives, activities and outcomes of a federally-funded project that was designed to add an interdisciplinary specialization in multiple disabilities for infants and toddlers to an existing Early Intervention Master of Education/Early Childhood Education Certificate Program at the University of Pittsburgh. Seven modules focusing on conditions and needs of infants/toddlers with multiple disabilities were developed and delivered as one-credit courses. The modules include: (1) vision impairments; (2) hearing impairments; (3) autism; (4) medically fragile conditions; (5) oral-motor/feeding; (6) communication; and (7) positioning, handling and mobility. The grant supported a total of 24 students, 17% of whom were from underrepresented groups. Of the 19 students who finished their graduate work, 14 went on to work with students with disabilities in either early intervention or school-aged programs, and 4 went on to work with typical students in high-risk programs for preschoolers. The report includes an appendix entitled: "Conceptual Bases for the Infant/Toddler Multiple Disabilities Specialization Modules." (SG)

The project supported students of Haitian background to participate in a master's degree program aimed at preparing highly skilled teachers of young children with disabilities, many of whom may come from homes where English is not the only language. While a portion of the coursework focused on infants and toddlers ages birth through 2, the major focus was to prepare personnel to work with children with disabilities ages 3 through 5. This interdisciplinary program consisted of specialized courses in early childhood special education (ECSE), specialized courses in teaching English to speakers of other languages (TESOL), and supervised practicums in schools and centers serving young children with disabilities (birth to five) and their families. Evaluation results describing the strengths and weaknesses of the program and recommendations for improvement are included. (SG)

The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of a TBFA teacher-training package in the context of two Head Start centers implementing programwide positive behavior support (PWPBS). Four Head Start teachers were trained in TBFA procedures as part of ongoing technical assistance on individualized behavior supports. Following training and performance feedback, all teachers were able to implement TBFA with 100% fidelity during simulation probes. With minimal additional coaching, teachers implemented TBFA sessions with a child in their classroom with 100% fidelity. Implications for future research and for the use of TBFA in early childhood settings are presented.

AB  - The current project evaluated the use of behavior management techniques utilized in Parent- Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) in head start classrooms. The sample included seven Head Start classrooms; four classrooms receiving treatment and three classrooms receiving no treatment. Evaluation of the progress included observation of teacher and student behavior and teacher report of class manageability and number of time-outs. Results indicated that child behavior improved throughout the study for both groups. Both groups of teachers also gave fewer timeouts, criticized the children less often, and rated their classes as more manageable from pre- to post-treatment. Teachers receiving training gave more labeled praise following treatment. These findings provide initial support for improving teacher behavior modification skills through the use of PCIT skills modified for Head Start classrooms. (Contains 1 table.)

AB  - Scope and method of study: This study investigated training outcomes when paraprofessionals were trained to implement discrete trial communication therapy in schools, supplemental to existing speech-language services the child receives at school. The aim of this study was to address how many hours of training are necessary for paraprofessionals to achieve mastery criterion with discrete trial training procedures. Additionally, it was determined whether paraprofessionals could implement DTT procedures with accuracy and integrity to produce positive growth outcomes in the functional communication skills of nonverbal or low language ability children with Autism. A subsequent aim of this study attempted to establish both classroom teachers' and paraprofessionals' perceptions about utilizing DTT procedures in the classroom. Findings and conclusions: This study demonstrated that paraprofessionals could be trained within a reasonable amount of time (maximum of 3 hours 46 minutes) to implement discrete trial training procedures. When the paraprofessionals implemented the intervention at the desired accuracy criterion of 85%, all five student participants obtained positive growth slopes in their functional communication skills that were being addressed, although the extent of growth outcomes varied for each student. The paraprofessional and teacher participants provided acceptability ratings of the overall discrete trial procedures indicating their willingness to implement this intervention in the future with other students, targeting various behaviors. This study has contributed to the current literature in that it demonstrates paraprofessionals can be trained to implement discrete trial procedures in a naturalistic setting.

AB  - In this review, the authors include 23 studies where researchers experimentally evaluated training for teachers of students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Authors summarized qualitative information on study and participant characteristics. Next, variables related to teacher practice and student learning targets were categorized based on Odom, Collet-Klingenberg, Rogers, and Hatton's list of evidence-based practices (EBPs) for individuals with ASD. Training components were also categorized based on instructional format (i.e., self-instruction, individual, group). Finally, application of standards (What Works Clearinghouse [WWC]) facilitated the evaluation of each study's rigor. Findings suggest that research has most frequently focused on individually training teachers in the use of behavioral interventions to improve students' communication. From the evaluation of design quality, only 2 of the 23 studies met WWC quality indicators for single-case or group-design standards. A discussion of the findings, limitations to the review, and recommendations for practitioners and future research on teacher training conclude the study results.

AB  - Although the number of students with behavior difficulties has increased, it has not been matched by a comparable increase in developing educator competencies to meet their needs. Educators must be given the necessary training, supported by solid research in best practices and quality schools. Individualized student plans involving family members must be established.

AB  - This book provides a "roadmap" for designing and implementing school psychological services for all students in a school. School psychologists will find guidelines for conducting a mental health needs assessment of the entire student body; analyzing patterns and trends to identify risk factors and common needs; and using the needs assessment to plan and implement mental health service programs that respond to identified needs. After chapter (1) Why Population-Based Services Are Essential for School Mental Health, and How to Make Them Happen in Your School (Beth Doll and Jack A. Cummings), the book is divided into three parts. Part I, Population-Based Assessment, contains the following chapters: (2) Behavioral and Social Epidemiology: Population-Based Problem Identification and Monitoring (Rick Jay Short and William Strein); and (3) Assessing School Risk and Protective Factors (Jean A. Baker). Part II, Population-Based Intervention, contains the following chapters: (4) Partnering With Families to Enhance Students' Mental Health (Sandra L. Christenson, Elizabeth M. Whitehouse, and Gretchen R. VanGetson); (5) Schoolwide Approaches to Behavior Problems (George G. Bear); (6) Response to Intervention: A School-Wide Approach for Promoting Academic Wellness for All Students (Rebecca S. Martinez and Leah M. Nellis); (7) Social and Emotional Learning: A School-Wide Approach to Intervention for Socialization, Friendship Problems, and More (Kenneth W. Merrell, Barbara A. Gueldner, and Oanh K. Tran); (8) Schoolwide Approaches to Intervention for School Aggression and Bullying (Susan M. Swearer, Dorothy L. Espelage, Kelly Brey Love, and Whitney Kingsbury); and (9) Schoolwide Approaches to Prevention of and Intervention for Depression and Suicidal Behaviors (James J. Mazza and William M. Reynolds). Part III, Policy and Evaluation, contains the following chapters: (10) Evaluating Quality and Effectiveness of Population-Based Services (Bonnie K. Nastasi and John H.

AB  - A major goal of most teacher education programs is the development of teachers who are sensitive supporters of all students, embrace diversity, and plan and implement inclusive and culturally responsive instruction. Student populations, even within teacher education programs, are not always endowed with the desired attitudes and wisdom that allow them to embrace such diversity; thus they need guidance from the teacher education faculty. It is also clear, with growing numbers of K-12 students from varying countries and cultures, that the ethnicity and cultural backgrounds of the teacher population is not in itself representative of the diversity in schools. It is with great interest that educators, parents, and politicians seek ways to transform the status quo in education, leading to greater academic achievement, more proactive attitudes of acceptance, social justice, and equitable opportunities for all students. In this article, the authors explore concepts of transformation and share the results of an attitude-changing experience of a group of teacher candidates. Concepts relevant to transformative learning include functions of self-inspection, facing dilemmas that produce lasting impressions, recognizing voids and holes in personal attitudes and understandings, often called landscapes, and reflecting on behaviors and practices. The teacher candidates described in this article were engaged primarily with multicultural literature--this involved readings, discussion, and reflection. After reading assigned picture books, young adult novels, and then dramatic, often highly charged adult literature from countries and cultures not previously known by the readers, these teacher candidates shared their reflections and their insights about the changes that they experienced. Analyses of these experiences and reflections are the basis for the conclusions in this article. (Contains 1 table.)

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can result in a range of social, emotional, neurological, cognitive, and behavioral outcomes. If these outcomes are significant, family members and the individual who has sustained the TBI may struggle with accepting the effects of these deficits. They may grieve over disrupted family relationships, roles, and routines which can become a factor within the school setting. School psychologists are in a unique position to provide appropriate, short-term, school-based, TBI-related psychological grief counseling and support services designed to assist affected children in adjusting and succeeding in the school setting post-TBI. This paper will discuss evidenced-based strategies adapted from allied disciplines (e.g., education, medicine) that can enhance school psychologists' ability to effectively address grief associated with TBI. Specifically, interventions designed to address the unique factors associated with ambiguous loss will be discussed.

AB  - Expressing sexuality is part of the human experience, yet sexual health is often ignored in regard to persons with disabilities. Individuals with disabilities are at risk of sexual abuse and exploitation, unwanted pregnancies, and sexually transmitted diseases. Additionally, many adolescents with disabilities lack the knowledge needed to develop a healthy sexual identity, therefore, increasing their vulnerability (Baladerian, et al., 2013; Boehning, 2006; Preston, 2013; SEICUS, 2012, 2014). Resources have been developed to improve the sexual health of individuals with disabilities; however, those who need this education may not have access to the resources. The purpose of this literature review is to examine sexual health education for individuals with disabilities; it focuses on risks to people with disabilities, current barriers to education, and available resources.

AB  - Child welfare case management systems were designed, in part, to standardize participatory practices for both young people and their parents. This paper reports the findings of a qualitative study of Australian service users' experiences of participation when using the case management systems, Looking After Children and Supporting Children and Responding to Families. Findings indicate that the majority of service users reported positive experiences of participating in the use of these systems. However, participatory relations were often slow to develop and frequently involved conflict. Some service users used their power to control the flow and accuracy of information, or resisted workers in other ways. Some children and young people were excluded from the opportunity to participate because the systems did not have a ‘text-based’ format to ‘ensure’ that this process occurred. These findings indicate that case management systems did not result in relationships which consistently inform)

AB  - Research carried out in recent decades has identified risk factors and relevant processes in the dynamics of child abuse. Such research has highlighted the importance of assisting families, with a view to intervening in dysfunctional parent-child relations and promoting positive parenting, especially for younger children. The present paper focuses on the family context as a target of intervention, especially in the area of early detection and prevention. The authors consider good parenting practices and support for families in child-rearing as protective factors. The 'Specialized Services for Families and Children' programme is presented as an illustration of intervention. Two evidence-based programmes are also presented as illustrations of prevention strategies: 'Apoyo Personal y Familiar' (APF, Personal and Family Support) and 'Programa de Apoyo Psicológico Materno-infantil' (PAPMI ©; Parent-Child Psychological Support Program). The main goals of these programmes are to provide support for parents in their child-rearing and to promote children's well-being. This paper highlights the importance of primary prevention and family intervention, which are particularly relevant in times of economic crisis, when factors that negatively affect family life and the situation of children may increase the risk to the children's welfare.

AB  - PACE Center for Girls is a unique program that provides academic and social services to girls ages 11 to 18. Girls eligible for PACE exhibit multiple health, safety, and delinquency risk factors, such as poor academic performance, exposure to abuse or violence, truancy, risky sexual behavior, and substance abuse. PACE seeks to help them onto a better path and reduce the likelihood of negative outcomes, such as involvement with the juvenile justice system. PACE operates 19 nonresidential, year-round program centers across the state of Florida. Girls attend PACE daily during normal school hours and receive academic and extensive social services in a gender-responsive environment--that is, one tailored to the needs of girls. Most girls plan to attend PACE for approximately one year; during this time, they receive academic instruction and advising, a life skills curriculum, assessment and care planning, individual and group counseling, and service learning and work readiness opportunities. Parental engagement and transition and follow-up services are also key components of the PACE program. When girls leave PACE, they often return to other schools in their communities to complete their secondary education. This executive summary describes the PACE Center for Girls, PACE's evaluation, and key findings from MDRC's ongoing evaluation of 14 PACE centers. [For the full report, see ED574048.]

This report presents implementation research findings from MDRC's ongoing evaluation of 14 PACE centers. Key findings include: (1) The PACE program model, defined through both general program principles and a detailed manual, was implemented consistently across multiple locations; (2) PACE incorporated gender-responsive programming into all services through a focus on safety and relationships, an emphasis on recognizing and building on girls' individual strengths, and an awareness of the effects of trauma; (3) Girls who attend PACE tend to be low-income, and they often struggle with school and have a range of other health, safety, and delinquency risk factors; and (4) PACE differed from the traditional school environment by offering smaller classes, access to frequent individual academic advising and counseling, life skills programming, and connections to other services in the community, such as transportation or health care. Three appendices include: (1) Supplementary Tables on Sample Member Characteristics and Risk Factors; (2) CLASS-Secondary Observations; and (3) Data Collection and Analysis.

AB  - This paper explores the attitudes of teachers, as adult learners, towards learning to do animation. A part of popular culture which second-language students enjoy, until recently, animation has been technically too demanding for non-specialists to learn. Adult learners can experience e-learning as transformative, but also as a barrier. Thus, teacher reception is crucial in exploring the feasibility of animation as an instructional tool in language teaching. In all, 44 Hong Kong and mainland Chinese teachers were taught animation over ten weeks. Subsequently, three surveys elicited both quantitative and qualitative data. Appraisal analysis indicated teachers positively realised animation as valuable, worthwhile and satisfactory, but also difficult and time-consuming, and entailed high levels of communication. Quantitative data indicated their view that animation would be well-received by both colleagues and secondary language learners, as an instructional tool. (Contains 8 tables and 2 figures.)

AB  - Background: Inadequate parenting is an important public health problem with possible severe and long-term consequences related to child development. We have solid theoretical and political arguments in favor of efforts enhancing the quality of the early family environment in the population at large. However, little is known about effect of universal approaches to parenting support during the transition to parenthood. This protocol describes an experimental evaluation of group based parenting support, the Family Startup Program (FSP), currently implemented large scale in Denmark. Methods/design: Participants will be approximately 2500 pregnant women and partners. Inclusion criteria are parental age above 18 and the mother expecting first child. Families are recruited when attending routine pregnancy scans provided as a part of the publicly available prenatal care program at Aarhus University Hospital, Skejby. Families are randomized within four geographically defined strata to one of two conditions a) participation in FSP or b) Treatment As Usual (TAU). FSP aims to prepare new families for their roles as parents and enhance parental access to informal sources of support, i.e. social network and community resources. The program consists of twelve group sessions, with nine families in each group, continuing from pregnancy until the child is 15 months old. TAU is the publicly available pre- and postnatal care available to families in both conditions. Analyses will employ survey data, administrative data from health visitors, and administrative register based data from Statistics Denmark. All data sources will be linked via the unique Danish Civil Registration Register (CPR) identifier. Data will be obtained at four time points, during pregnancy, when the child is nine months, 18 months and seven years. The primary study outcome is measured by the Parenting Sense of Competence scale (PSOC) J Clin Child Psychol 18: 167-75, 1989. Other outcomes include parenting and couple relationship quality, utility of primary sector service and child physical health, socio-emotional and cognitive development. Discussion: The protocol describes an ambitious experimental evaluation of a universal group-based parenting support program; an evaluation that has not yet been made either in Denmark or internationally.

AB  - A learning module that focuses on problems of at-risk rural students with disabilities was developed for preservice special education teachers at the undergraduate and graduate levels. The module focuses on (1) definitions of "at risk" on the federal and state level; (2) the characteristics associated with at-risk rural special education students, emphasizing child abuse and neglect, depression, suicide attempts, and school dropout; (3) problems associated with teaching these students, including sparse population, lack of transportation, and inadequate social services; (4) federal, state, and local agencies that provide assistance for these students and their families; (5) methods that develop positive parent-professional partnerships, including recognition of parents' strengths and needs and the establishment of communication lines between school and home; (6) academic intervention strategies such as direct instruction, cooperative learning, and peer tutoring; and (7) interdisciplinary intervention approaches utilizing the team efforts of professionals, parents, and rural community members. Over the past 3 years, 781 undergraduate and graduate students have participated in the at-risk module. Graduate students received a more extensive module than undergraduate students. Evaluation responses indicated that participants would use the content and materials, that more time should be provided for module presentation, and that more information concerning at-risk students is desired.

AB  - This article presents a review on barriers and facilitators to the implementation of lay health worker programs to improve access to maternal and child health. This is a Cochrane systematic review containing a thematic analysis of 53 qualitative studies of lay health worker (LHW) programs. An LHW was defined as a lay person trained to deliver health-care services but is not a health professional. Participants (stakeholders) from included studies were LHWs, programs recipients, health professionals working with the LHWs, programs staff, supervisors, community leaders and policy makers.

AB  - Pedagogical content knowledge forms the core of teachers' professional knowledge; it refers to knowledge about making subject matter accessible to students. Thus, the formation of pedagogical content knowledge constitutes a crucial issue for educational research and practice. We investigated the contributions of content knowledge and pedagogical knowledge to the formation of pedagogical content knowledge about fractions and fractional arithmetic in 6th grade mathematics in a between-participants study with 100 German preservice teachers. The three experimental and two control groups received 7 hr of intervention spread out over two days. We assessed participants' pedagogical content knowledge before intervention, between the two days, after intervention, as well as at 6-week follow-up. The control groups exclusively received instruction on either pedagogical knowledge or pedagogical content knowledge; each of the experimental groups embodied a specific hypothesis about the formation of pedagogical content knowledge. Providing support for a mechanism of amalgamation, a combination of instruction on content knowledge and pedagogical knowledge produced small but statistically significant growth in pedagogical content knowledge. Similarly, instruction on content knowledge exclusively was sufficient to cause small but statistically significant growth in pedagogical content knowledge. Prior instruction on content knowledge did not facilitate learning from instruction on pedagogical content knowledge. Nevertheless, direct instruction on pedagogical content knowledge caused medium and statistically significant growth in pedagogical content knowledge. Educational Impact and Implications Statement We conducted a brief experimental study-interventions lasted 7 hr-with German preservice elementary school teachers to investigate the relevance of content knowledge and pedagogical knowledge for the formation of pedagogical content knowledge about teaching fractions. A combination of instruction on content knowledge and pedagogical knowledge, as well as exclusive instruction on content knowledge, produced small gains in pedagogical content knowledge. In contrast, despite preservice teachers' limited content knowledge, direct instruction on pedagogical content knowledge produced medium gains in pedagogical content knowledge. For elementary mathematics, the results suggest that teacher education programs that deliver early and explicit instruction on pedagogical content knowledge are more efficient in fostering pedagogical content knowledge than programs that provide instruction of content knowledge and pedagogical knowledge consecutively or that exclusively provide instruction on content knowledge.

AB  - Indigenous Australians experience significant social risk, vulnerability and disadvantage. Nowhere is this more starkly demonstrated than in the levels of contact that Indigenous Australians have with the criminal justice system, particularly the police. Utilizing a linked dataset of extant criminal justice, human and health service administrative data in New South Wales (NSW) Australia, this paper explores patterns of police contact and custody for a cohort of Indigenous males with complex needs. Four significant factors are identified that alone or in combination appear to impact on the frequency with which these men experience police contact and custody, including young age at first police contact, experiencing out of home care as a child, alcohol misuse, and limited locational mobility. Whilst it might be expected that the presence of mental ill-health and/or cognitive disability would be a key predictor of the frequency and intensity of police contact and custody, the findings suggest rather that the presence of multiple disadvantages beginning in the early years and compounding throughout individuals' lives, in which mental illness may or may not be a factor, is more significant than the presence of any one diagnosis in precipitating police contact and custody for this group.

AB  - Background/Purpose: The complement system is one of the key players in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Collectin liver 1 (CL-L1) and collectin kidney 1 (CL-K1) are recently discovered complement pattern recognition molecules. They form hetero-complexes termed CL-LK that collaborate with associated serine proteases to activate the lectin pathway of complement. The objective of this pilot study was to explore the involvement of CL-LK in a cross-sectional cohort of SLE patients by measuring plasma concentrations and analyze for associations between the plasma concentrations and characteristic SLE manifestations. Methods: Prospectively, blood samples (citrated plasma), ACR classification criteria and SLE disease activity index score (SLEDAI) were collected from 58 SLE patients. Concentrations in plasma of CL-L1 and CL-K1 were determined in the SLE patients and in age and gender matched healthy controls using time resolved immuno-flourometric assays developed in house. Results: Both the CL-L1 and CL-K1 concentrations were lower in SLE patients than healthy controls (p

AB  - The use of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) is well documented in the mental health, medical, and education literature. There is minimal research on the use of mindfulness with social workers. As demonstrated in other professional and helping fields, mindfulness may enhance clinical skills, reduce burnout, and increase job satisfaction among social workers. In the health care field mindfulness appears integral to patient and family relationships and personal resilience. The evolving and expanding role of hospital social workers may lead to increased work stress and greater demands from both the medical system and patients and families. Research with medical providers, such as physicians and nurses, suggests mindfulness may help in reducing stress, enhancing relationships, and fostering the self-reflection required to provide patient-centered care. We systematically reviewed the existing literature to begin understanding both mindfulness qualities and practices and the effectiveness of MBIs among social workers as well as the relationship of mindfulness to patient-centered care.

AB  - Children whose parents are involved in the criminal justice system (CJS) are at increased risk of developing social, emotional, and behavioural difficulties and are more likely than their peers to become involved in the CJS themselves. Parenting behaviour and parent-child relationships have the potential to affect children’s outcomes with positive parenting practices having the potential to moderate some of the negative outcomes associated with parental involvement in the CJS. However, many parents in the CJS may lack appropriate role models to support the development of positive parenting beliefs and practices. Parenting programs offer an opportunity for parents to enhance their parenting knowledge and behaviours and improve relationships with children. Quantitative and qualitative evidence pertaining to the implementation and effectiveness of parenting programs delivered in the CJS was included. Five databases were searched and a total of 1145 articles were identified of which 29 met the review inclusion criteria. Overall, programs were found to significantly improve parenting attitudes; however, evidence of wider effects is limited. Additionally, the findings indicate that parenting programs can be meaningful for parents. Despite this, a number of challenges for implementation were found including the transient nature of the prison population and a lack of parent-child contact. Based on these findings, recommendations for the future development and delivery of programs are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study documents the process of implementation of an adolescent reading intervention. Using data from observations of teachers (n = 17) during the 2013-14 school year, I conducted a nuanced descriptive analysis of fidelity of implementation (FoI). I also analyzed weekly logs completed by literacy coaches (n = 3) to examine variation in quantity and intensity of coaching. I then compared variation in coaching with variation in FoI, and finally compared FoI to outcomes for students (n = 287). FoI at observation 1 was found to predict coaching time, and FoI across both observations predicted student outcomes, emphasizing the critical role of implementation in intervention research.

AB  - The call for effective instructional and classroom management is frequent within the professional literature. However, type, amount, and sequence of strategies sufficient to impact rates of problem behavior are often missing or listed with limited guidance on differentiation based on student pattern of problem behavior. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of universal teacher practices on general education students exhibiting problem behaviors, and the impact of such practices on specific students given the function of problem behavior. Specifically, this study was interested in exploring the extent to which universal teacher practices, when applied for all students in the classroom, impacted student behavior in general education settings. Additionally, this study was interested in examining the additive effect of combining both targeted classroom supports in the form of universal teacher practices and functional behavioral assessment -based interventions through a multiple-baseline design. Results indicated that when universal teacher practices are applied, rates of problem behaviors decrease based on the function of behavior. Implications for practice and research are discussed.

AB  - Vocabulary is a consistent predictor of reading achievement for deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) children. DHH children tend to have a smaller vocabulary knowledge base than their hearing peers and require direct instruction in this area. There are no evidence-based vocabulary instruction strategies for this population. One reason for the lack of an evidence-base is the lack of replication studies. Interactive storybook reading (ISR), storybook reading enhanced through scripted questions and feedback, may be an effective method for teaching vocabulary to DHH children. Up till now, researchers have not conducted replication studies. This study replicates and extends a previous ISR intervention study. We implemented a multiprobe across behaviors single-case experimental design (SCED) and found a functional relation between ISR and expressive picture vocabulary knowledge for all participants. This finding provides additional evidence to support ISR as an effective vocabulary instruction strategy for young DHH children.

AB  - Purpose: Interactive storybook reading (ISR) improves the picture labeling vocabulary of children who are deaf and hard of hearing (DHH). Vocabulary knowledge consistently predicts the later reading achievement of children who are DHH. In this study, ISR was modified to include teaching word meanings along with the vocabulary picture label. Method: A multiple probe across behaviors single-case experimental design was implemented to determine the effects of ISR with word meaning instruction on picture labeling and word meaning knowledge of 6 preschoolers who are DHH and use spoken English. The student and teacher participants engaged in ISR for 15-20 min a day, 4 days a week for 3 weeks. Results: A functional relation was established between ISR and the increase in the preschoolers' word labeling and meaning knowledge. The preschoolers' word knowledge was generalized and was maintained over time. Conclusions: ISR may be an effective vocabulary labeling and word meaning instructional strategy for young children who are DHH and use spoken English. Teachers and related service providers who work with this population may want to implement ISR with word meaning in 1-to-1 or small groups to individualize the target vocabulary and maximize the benefit. Future researchers should replicate this to expand its generalizability to other subpopulations of children who are DHH. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Globally, social workers protect, among others, children who are in need of care and protection. Child protection social workers protect children by means of statutory intervention. Concomitant professional risks threaten child protection social workers' well-being and competence, resulting in sub-standard services, attrition and calls for child protection social worker resilience. Promoting child protection social worker resilience requires a deep understanding of child protection social worker risk and resilience. Given the scarcity of studies focused on child protection social worker risk and resilience around the globe, we aimed to ascertain how well child protection social worker risk and resilience are understood. We thus undertook a systematic meta-synthesis of fourteen qualitative studies on child protection social worker risk and resilience. This meta-synthesis demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of child protection social worker risk in minority-world countries, but not in majority-world countries. It also demonstrates an inadequate understanding of child protection social worker resilience worldwide.

AB  - Globally the well-being of child protection social workers (CPSWs) is placed at risk by the taxing nature of their profession. In response, there have been international calls for the prioritization of CPSWs' resilience. Despite the call to enhance the resilience of CPSWs, to date, only five research studies have explored resilience processes in CPSWs. In this article, we present findings that describe resilience-enhancing practices in the lives of 15 South African CPSWs who were considered resilient. They were recruited by means of snowball sampling and engaged in in-depth interviews. Findings reveal that the overall well-being and functioning of these 15 South African CPSWs are endangered by several occupational risk factors including work pressure, inadequate professional support, financial strain, challenges unique to CPSW such as removal of children and exposure to aggressive clients, and emotional exhaustion. Their resilience was informed by four differently weighted but interrelated resilience practices: practice- and purpose-informing creeds, support systems, constructive transactions, and accentuating the positive. These practices are potentially useful to contribute to the body of knowledge on CPSWs' resilience as well as to the development of resilience-enhancing guidelines and subsequent intervention programmes with the purpose of protecting CPSWs globally and contributing to efficient service delivery. However, given the dynamic nature of resilience, continued explorations of CPSW resilience processes in different cultural contexts are needed.

AB  - This study implements a networked peer assessment system based on the use of a Vee heuristic. Using this system, students submit their homework (relating to designing science activities) via the underlying network facility. They then assess each other’s homework by offering suggestions—again, through the network. Students then modify their original designs based on the suggestions that they receive. This procedure is repeated for two or three consecutive rounds. In this process, each student functions as an author, a reviewer, and an adapter. This learning model allows students to further develop their critical thinking skills. Preliminary peer assessment results revealed that the networked peer-assessment model and Vee heuristic facilitated pre-service science teachers to continuously progress when designing science activities.

AB  - Background: Educational scholars emphasize that in order to gain a better understanding of the complexity of teaching, greater attention needs to be paid to teachers' views and perceptions of the challenges and barriers of teaching.Purpose: The purpose of this study was to describe preschool teachers' views and perceptions of the main challenges of teaching physical education. The major question addressed was: what are the main challenges that preschool teachers face in teaching physical education, and based on their experiences what suggestions do the preschool teachers make in reference to early childhood physical education?Data collection and analysis: Four experienced early childhood educators from Cyprus volunteered to participate in this study. Data were collected through formal interviews and were analyzed inductively via individual-case and cross-case analysis.Findings: The findings suggest that the four early childhood teachers believed that the main aim of physical education, in the early years, is to provide children with opportunities to develop their psychomotor, cognitive, and social skills. Although the participants consider physical education to be an important subject in the school curriculum, they admitted that it has been undermined to a great extent and is viewed as a marginal subject. Findings from the study suggest that the four early childhood educators faced common barriers, deficiencies, and constraints, relative to the teaching resources. Finally, the participants called for meaningful professional development programs. Implications of these findings for educators are discussed.

AB  - Examines the need for the development of a core interdisciplinary framework that will influence the education and training of those involved in work with children and young people. The aim was to outline and explore common issues, knowledge areas and skill requirements that are demanded of those working with children and young people across differing occupational boundaries and contexts in the fields of health, social case and education. The framework has been developed by a group of people drawn from academic disciplines and employment within these fields. The prompt was the recent changes that have occurred on practice settings and education and training arenas. (Original abstract - amended)

AB  - Childhood obesity rates continue to increase and there is a need for innovative obesity prevention programs. Our objectives were to (1) create a community partnership, and (2) test an obesity prevention intervention that involved curriculum delivered in the classroom with 1:1 coaching delivered by nursing students on health parameters among 4th and 5th grade school children. Our primary hypothesis was that the intervention would result in significant increases in physical activity levels. 99 children from two schools participated in the program. Classrooms were assigned as intervention or control. All classrooms received standardized content on health habits by the public health nurse and children assigned to the intervention classrooms also received 1:1 coaching by nursing students, with fewer total visits at School A. Baseline and end-of-year data were collected for health parameters and physical activity. For School A, there were no significant differences between intervention and control children between baseline and end-of-year for all health outcomes. Due to a limited control group at School B, control and intervention groups at both schools were consolidated for analysis. BMI and BMI percentile increased at School A, but daily minutes of TV and servings of fruit juice decreased. At School B, there were decreases in BMI percentile and servings of soda/punch, plus increases in servings of fruits/vegetables and daily steps (baseline mean ± SEM = 10,494 ± 419 daily steps; end-of-year = 15,466 ± 585 daily steps). A multi-partner, community approach to obesity intervention shows potential for improving health in elementary school children. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The purpose of this quantitative, quasi-experimental study was to determine whether implementing a self-contained, no movement program, consisting of two specialized classrooms, within a special act school district that services at-risk students, increased the perceived level of safety among the instructional staff. The measurement tool was a Likert survey, disseminated prior to and after the 2012-13 school years, which asked participants to answer questions about their perceived level of safety throughout the building and the school day. The self-contained program was implemented during the 2012-13 school years. The overall mean score during the pre-test was 3.0063 (N = 23). The post-test had a mean score of 4.0505 (N = 58). The post-test respondents had a significantly higher perception of safety than did the pre-test respondents (t = -4.514, df =26.880, p = .000). As a result of this intervention, the study suggests that the perceived level of safety increased due to the implementation of the self-contained program.

AB  - Response to intervention (RtI) has created a need to shift from the excluded special education model to a more inclusive model creating a need for increased communication and collaboration when students are exposed to instruction in multiple settings. The basic qualitative research design was used to explore the types and level of communication and collaboration that exists among educators who work with at-risk students through the RtI model in a single South Carolina school district. The study included six teachers and six interventionists, who participated in focus group discussions, classroom observations, and individual personal interviews, and four administrators who participated in individual interviews. The findings of this study indicated, for the most part, that educators held positive attitudes in their role within the organization and his or her ability to communicate and collaborate to effectively provide sound instruction for struggling learners. All participants were aware that the need for collaboration and the need to share information were everyone's responsibility and a necessary part of supporting each student. The findings suggest that administrators felt structures were in place for communication and collaboration to exist among educators, however no suggestion of a common planning time within the daily schedule nor examples from teachers or interventionists in true collaborative roles were evident. Moreover, interventionists were best able to describe examples of true collaborative efforts they had initiated with teachers to coordinate skills or concepts they were teaching in their classrooms. The findings show, the interventionists hope for a change in the current policy in most schools, which excludes the interventionists from data team meetings and RtI meetings where next steps in the child's education plan are formulated and decided.

AB  - Sunshine Circles is a teacher-led group process using social-relationship principles from Theraplay®. This study, conducted across 6 preschool sites in the midwestern United States, was the first to examine empirical outcomes against a control group for this program. Students in these teacher-led, play-based groups improved significantly compared with controls in social-emotional skills, behavioral regulation, problem-solving, and fine motor control. Specific improvements occurred in domains of managing feelings, cooperation, accepting limits, peer interactions and friendships, and solving social problems. Furthermore, structured teacher observation measurements yielded data indicating improvement in teacher classroom performance. Interviews with teachers confirmed that the intervention subjectively increased classroom cohesion, improved teacher–student relationships, and improved overall classroom behavior. These findings have implications for both classroom best practice and teacher education. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Asmus's model of achievement motivation in music established a framework for the study of motivation in music education. Student perceptions of self were included in the model as a dynamic factor in student motivation to accomplish music learning tasks. Research has revealed further teacher influence on student motivation and perceptions of self since Asmus's article. This article reviews literature on positive secondary instrumental music teacher influence on student motivation and perceptions of self. Research is organized around four practical areas of teacher influence: (a) word choice, (b) performance experiences, (c) intrinsic motivation, and (d) environments. Strategies for positive influence in these areas are then offered.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The profession of medicine has long been characterised by virtues such as authorisation, specialisation, autonomy, self-regulation and adherence to an ethical code of practice, and its complexity has granted it the privilege of self-regulation. Studies have shown continuing professional development (CPD) for general practitioners (GPs) to be most effective when it is set up within a multi-method design. This paper reports a research-based evaluation of a 2-year educational CPD project for 21 GPs. METHODS: The project focused on the issue of 'children in need' and was delivered through group supervision, teaching days, an e-portfolio, literature, newsletters and a desk checklist. A mixed-methods evaluation design was used. RESULTS: The GPs demonstrated an overall preference for supervision as an authentic method for self-directed professional development because it facilitated the creation of a common platform for relevant and useful knowledge in the context of general practice. Other methods were perceived as less valuable for GPs' CPD. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that general practitioners need to establish a common platform of shared experiences before engaging in multi-professional CPD. Participation in the supervision allowed the three groups of GPs to develop their professional skills, but left them with a desire for more training in establishing cooperative practices with their partners in care. The professional challenges discussed during the supervision sessions were important elements of the national GP Curriculum, but not all elements of professionalism were covered.

AB  - Assessment in higher education and teacher education in particular continues to be a prominent feature of the student experience. For teacher education students there is an immediate and future concern as they both experience assessment and go on to become assessors of learning within their profession. In the state of Queensland, Australia, assessment in teacher education has taken on renewed importance with pre-registration testing of new graduates. Assessment is a phenomenon that influences nearly all aspects of students' experience of university--their learning, relationships with staff and peers, and their emotions. This paper reports on data from the author's reflective journal where insights were derived from conversations about assessment during student interactions. Extracts from this reflective writing enabled extrapolation of key issues of student perceptions, learning, relationships and emotions. What students say and do in relation to assessment offers lecturers powerful insights into the central role it plays in their experience of university. Students are active in shaping their assessment experience but are clearly also shaped by it. Lecturers play important roles in sustaining and challenging assessment practices that influence students in complex ways.

AB  - Longitudinal costly evaluations will always be important in order to understand the factors that impact on child, family and community well-being over the long and medium term. However, in a policy era that accords major importance to the achievement of outcomes, e.g. payment by results, 'outcome theology' can pose threats to service access and professional morale in family support. It is essential therefore, to ascertain the short-term outcomes of services in order to capture the trajectory of progress by families under stress. This paper critiques the concept of 'the outcome'. It traces the development of this trend in policy and describes an alternative but complementary approach, which is based on capturing interim outcomes in family support services.

AB  - The purpose of this survey study was to determine the following: (a) What strategies do Turkish special education teachers use to address problem behaviors in their classroom? (b) What are teachers' views with regard to the effectiveness and acceptability of these strategies? (c) Is there a relationship between the use of strategies and teachers' perceived effectiveness and acceptability? and (d) Are differences among teacher ratings of strategy use, effectiveness, and acceptability associated with teacher characteristics (e. g., area of specialization, years of experience)? Results revealed that Turkish teachers' views of acceptability and effectiveness of strategies varied; however, in general, their ratings of positive strategies were higher than their ratings of reductive strategies. Results are discussed in the context of current literature, and directions for further research are suggested.

AB  - This study utilised a structured analogue method to evaluate factors which impact preschool teachers' preference for language interventions. These factors included type of treatment approach (naturalistic versus therapeutic), person delivering the intervention (classroom teacher versus speech and language pathologist), and severity of language delay (mild versus severe). Survey participants included 29 preschool special education teachers, five of whom volunteered to complete follow-up interviews. Results demonstrate that teachers prefer naturalistic over therapeutic approaches overall. When stratified by severity of the language delay, teachers rated the three intervention approaches differently. Implications of these findings for research and practice are discussed.

AB  - Aims To test the effectiveness of the Healthy School and Drugs (HSD) programme on tobacco and alcohol use in Dutch secondary special education (SE) schools, and whether this depends upon subtypes of SE schools and the level of implementation. Design In a quasi-experimental design with baseline and post-treatment follow-up, 363 students were allocated arbitrarily or depending on teacher motivation to either intervention condition ( n = 205) or usual curriculum ( n = 158). Setting Thirteen secondary SE schools spread throughout the Netherlands. Participants Participants were recruited during the autumn of 2013 from three school subtypes: SE for adolescents with intellectual/physical disabilities (SEI; n = 13), behavioural/emotional difficulties (SEB; n = 136) and learning disabilities/developmental disorders (SEL; n = 214). Measurements Self-reported life-time smoking prevalence and life-time drinking frequency as outcomes, and school subtype (SEL/SEB) and implementation fidelity (high/)

AB  - This article utilizes four knowledge sources to characterize a current gap in policy and practice related to serving families in early intervention (birth to 5) programs. It argues that the field of early intervention has focused primarily on implementing family-centered practices by focusing on how families and professionals should interact. The field has not sufficiently addressed what supports and services should be offered to families to enhance the likelihood of positive outcomes for families themselves and for their children with disabilities. The paper concludes with recommendations for enhancing policy, research, and professional development related to family services and supports.

AB  - All teachers (N = 32) at one middle school participated in a university-led intervention to improve student engagement. Teachers discussed four principles of motivation and related instructional strategies. Teachers enacted instructional strategies in their classrooms. We observed six randomly selected teachers and their students over 3 years. Analyses of the dynamic patterns of teacher-student interaction (using an application of state space grids) revealed two distinct patterns. The upward group (n = 3) showed an increase of teacher motivational support and student engagement. The stable group (n = 3) demonstrated low levels of both teacher motivational support and student engagement. Qualitative analyses of instructional differences between the two groups help explain student engagement. Implications include conceptualizing student engagement as interpersonal classroom activity and measuring change as developmental and dynamic phenomena.

AB  - Researchers have studied the preparation of elementary teachers to teach mathematics to students from diverse racial, ethnic, and linguistic backgrounds by focusing either on teachers' learning about children's mathematical thinking (CMT) or, less frequently, about children's cultural funds of knowledge (CFoK) related to mathematics. Despite this important work, elementary teachers continue to be underprepared to teach mathematics effectively in diverse communities. We suggest that one way to address this persistent challenge is to integrate these two lines of work. This review focuses on research related to how prospective teachers (PSTs) learn to connect to CMT and CFoK in mathematics instruction. We use the review to describe elements of a robust theoretical framework of PST learning about CMT and CFoK, and synthesize how the studies reviewed contribute to these different elements.

AB  - Promoting family learning around science represents an important opportunity to reinforce science learning during out-of-school time. Evidence suggests that parent-child discourse around science can promote inferential thinking by children and help solidify their understanding of science concepts. While teacher professional development that promotes the type of discourse that encourages student inquiry is trending, interventions that assist parents in developing the same types of learning talk skills are scarce. In this descriptive study, family discourse was observed at a series of events at community centers that promote science learning, such as the zoo and the library. These events were part of a large-scale professional development program designed to transform teaching and learning around PK-3 science. Families were scored on their interaction, discourse, and use of "talk moves" using the Discourse, Interaction, and Inquiry in Family Science rubric. The results demonstrate that the events promoted family discourse and interaction in a manner dependent on the activity context. Implications for teachers and design of family science learning activities are discussed.

AB  - Two Heads Are Better than One: The Factors Influencing the Understanding and Practice of Classroom-Library Collaboration proposed to identify the factors involved in educating future K-8 classroom teachers about collaboration for instruction with school library media specialists (SLMSs). This longitudinal study monitored the growth of teacher education students' understandings of collaboration through their preservice education, student teaching, and first year of classroom teaching. The participants were enrolled in a teacher preparation program facilitated by the researcher, a former SLMS. The goal of this mixed-methods case study was to suggest critical components of preservice education, student teaching, and first-year teaching experiences that influence novice classroom teachers' classroom-library collaborations. This article provides an overview of the study, a review of relevant literature, and the data collected, including findings from four surveys as well as other data sources. This study shows that interventions during preservice education were important influencers. However, the findings clearly indicate that the educators serving in K-8 school library positions and the supports, or lack thereof, for classroom-library collaboration during student teaching and first-year classroom teaching were the most influential factors in determining whether or not these beginning educators collaborated with SLMSs for instruction.

To this end, teaching and learning centres should incorporate SoTL-oriented components within the framework of educational development programs to prepare our future faculty. This article briefly reviews the emerging literature on graduate student engagement with SoTL and highlights two possible approaches for incorporating SoTL into educational development programs for graduate students.

AB  - Teaching objectives in special education are different from those in the ordinary classroom. Educational programmes for special needs students are focused on individual learning, achievement and progress. Thus, the instruction in special education classrooms and resource rooms in inclusive schools has to be specific, directed and individualised. The present study aimed to investigate the use of teaching methods, strategies and best practices in resource rooms of inclusive schools and to discuss their appropriateness and quality in relation to literature review. The study was a qualitative one, using triangulation of data collection, semi-structured interviews and observation. The participants were 30, experienced, special education teachers and 120 special education future-teachers. The study took into account the qualitative research ethical recommendations. The research revealed that the self-reported data show that the participants had great interest in their students' learning outcomes and they used effective teaching methods, techniques and strategies, but this was not confirmed by the data of observation. The present study would affect the educational policies regarding the critical issue of teacher evaluation and the differences between general and special teaching effectiveness.

AB  - The main objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of mediation with a puppet on teachers' mediated learning experience (MLE) strategies. The sample was composed of 18 teachers and 145 kindergarten children, selected from special education (n = 68) and regular (n = 77) kindergartens. About half of each group was assigned to a puppet and half to a no-puppet group. Each teacher was assigned to a small group of 3-5 children and asked to teach them a story for 15 min in a puppet and 15 min in no-puppet conditions in a counterbalanced order. The teaching lessons were videotaped and analyzed by the Observation of Mediation Interaction scale. The findings revealed that teachers in the puppet condition used significantly and uniquely higher levels of mediation in all MLE strategies than in the no puppet condition. A significant Mediation Modality X MLE Strategy interaction indicates that the differences between the two conditions were highest in strategies of Intentionality and Reciprocity and Meaning and lower in strategies of Transcendence, Feelings of Competence and Self-Regulation. Use of a puppet was effective similarly for children in special education as for children in regular group. When mediators accessed the puppet (i.e., in puppet condition) their level of mediation for Meaning was significantly higher than when the puppet was not accessed. When mediators did not access the puppet their level of mediation for Intentionality and Reciprocity, Feelings of Competence, and Self-Regulation was higher than when the puppet was accessed. The findings were discussed in relation to MLE theory and educational implications are provided.

AB  - Aim/Purpose: The goal of this paper is to examine digital applications used in Swedish schools and whether they fulfill their potential as support for learners. This is done by examining the kinds of feedback they provide and discussing if this feedback supports learning or not. Background: The paper targets one aspect regarding which educational apps can be of high value for learners and teachers, namely the feedback they provide. The paper also addresses the need for supportive feedback and reviews 242 apps with respect to what types of feedback they provide. Methodology: A sample of apps used in primary school was collected via email to schools in Sweden. The author evaluated each app with respect to what kind of feedback it provided. The article concerns both positive and negative feedback, with a focus on negative. The following types of feedback were evaluated; verification feedback, corrective feedback, elaborated feedback, encouraging feedback and result feedback. Contribution: This paper contributes to knowledge regarding how most apps only contain verification feedback (telling the student whether their answer was correct or not). In order to help a student while learning, verification feedback is not enough. Rather, previous research has shown that explanatory feedback is more beneficial for learning. Findings: Seventy-seven percent of all apps contained verification feedback, and only 12 % provided the student with some type of explanation as to why their answer was incorrect. Looking at previous research, this is not desirable if one wants the app to support learning and not only act as a testing device. Fifty-five percent of all apps also contained some type of encouragement, but none of this encouragement addressed the task or the effort the learners put into the task - something that would be preferable from a learning perspective. Recommendations for Practitioners: There is much to be gained for developers of educational software if they would make more use of the feedback in educational apps. As for now, the feedback is primarily suited for testing and not for learning. For users of apps (teachers, parents, and children) this paper shows that feedback can be and is an important factor to evaluate before deciding if the app is "worth" spending time on. Recommendation for Researchers: The research describes different types of feedback and their (dis)advantages. Impact on Society: The paper stresses that most feedback represented in apps today corresponds to a behavioristic approach comparable to instrumental conditioning by means of reinforcement. In essence, most apps miss the opportunity of treating the learner as an active and constructive being who would benefit from more nuanced feedback. Future Research: Previous research has shown that elaborated feedback is more beneficial for learning, but more research needs to be done here, the amount of elaborated feedback will most likely affect varying student groups and varying tasks in different ways. And more importantly, how can we make the students pay attention to and act upon the feedback provided to them.

AB  - This mixed methods study described preservice teachers' conceptions of tides and explored the efficacy of integrating online data into inquiry-based instruction. Data sources included a multiple-choice assessment and in-depth interviews. A total of 79 participants in secondary, middle, and early childhood teacher education programs completed the multiple-choice assessment of their baseline knowledge of tides-related concepts. A sub-group of 29 participants also was interviewed to explore their understanding of tides in more detail before instruction. Eighteen of those 29 teachers participated in the instruction, were interviewed again after the instruction, and completed the multiple-choice assessment as a posttest. The interview data sets were analyzed via a constant comparative method in order to produce profiles of each participant's pre- and post-instruction conceptual understandings of tides. Additional quantitative analysis consisted of a paired-sample t-test, which investigated the changes in scores before and after the instructional intervention. Before instruction, all participants held alternative or alternative fragments as their conceptual understandings of tides. After completing the inquiry-based instruction that integrated online tidal data, participants were more likely to hold a scientific conceptual understanding. After instruction, some preservice teachers continued to hold on to the conception that the rotation of the moon around the Earth during one 24-hour period causes the tides to move with the moon. The quantitative results, however, indicated that pre- to post-instruction gains were significant. The findings of this study provide evidence that integrating Web-based archived data into inquiry-based instruction can be used to effectively promote conceptual change among preservice teachers.

AB  - Introduction: Training for dental practitioners in implant dentistry ranges from 1- or 2-day short Continuing Professional Development (CPD) courses to certificate/diploma programmes run by universities. In general, the teaching of implant dentistry in Europe lacks structure and standardisation. This paper aims to: (i) identify the current trends in CPD in implant dentistry in Europe; (ii) identify potential and limitations with regards to the design and implementation of CPD activities in implant dentistry; (iii) provide recommendations on the future structure and development of CPD activities in implant dentistry. Methods: A search of the literature was undertaken in PubMed for manuscripts published in English after 2000 reporting on CPD in dentistry and in implant dentistry in particular. In addition, an electronic survey was conducted, investigating the attitudes towards CPD among a wide group of stakeholders in implant dentistry education. Conclusions: There is a wide diversity of educational pathways towards achieving competences in implant dentistry through CPD. At present, there is a need for improving the CPD structures in implant dentistry, strengthening the quality assurance and encouraging standardisation and transparency of the learning outcomes. Development of a structured CPD system with clearly defined educational objectives mapped against specific levels of competence is recommended.

The study group is comprised of 300 books for children appealing to between age 6-9. Books were chosen on the basis of elementary school teachers' opinions and the instructors' opinion as for the field of the expert about children's literature, best sale books in most well-known bookstores to compile a list. The method of current study is the descriptive model in a qualitative strand. The data was analyzed with document analysis, and it supported with quotes from books. Besides, frequencies and percentages were used for the analysis of data. To actualize document analysis in a common and objective framework, researchers developed a "Book Evaluation Form" as a book checklist for the curriculum. "Observation" and "Communication" are most common skills, "The love of Nature" and "Helping Each Other" are most common values, "Nature and Environment" unit and its objectives are mostly observed in the books regarding social studies curriculum. When it comes to rarely seen skill, value and units-objectives, using information technologies, awareness of national and cultural values, personal care, time management for skills; esthetic, patriotism, being scientific for values; "Nature and Environment" for grade 1st and grade 2nd's units and their objectives, "Healthy Life" for grade 3rd were seldom observed in the target children's books related to social studies (K1-K3).

AB  - Teacher educators play an important role in preparing student teachers to integrate technology into their classrooms. This article presents an overview of research literature on teacher educators' competences in preparing their students to teach with technology. A literature search yielded 26 relevant research articles. Four domains of competence were identified: technology competences, competences for pedagogical and educational technology use, beliefs about teaching and learning and competences in professional learning. The literature focuses on teacher educators' competences in using technology for teaching. Research on the competences that teacher educators need and have as second-order teachers is lacking. Recommendations for future research are discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background:Job-related burnout and distress are adverse stress responses which affect individuals in their occupational environment. This study aimed at investigating the effect of a rational-emotive stress management program on job burnout and dysfunctional distress among special education teachers in Nigeria.Methods:A pretest-posttest randomized control group design was used. The participants in the study were 54 special education teachers. Data were collected using self-report questionnaires. Participants were allocated to either the treatment group (n=28 {[}59.1%]) or the waitlist control group (n=26 {[}48.1%]), respectively. A rational-emotive stress management manual was used to deliver the intervention. We statistically analyzed the data collected at three-time points with repeated-measures analysis of variance.Results:At baseline, the job-related burnout symptoms and distress scores of participants were high. However, an intention-to-treat analysis showed that the rational-emotive stress management intervention program was efficacious in reducing the levels of job-related burnout symptoms and dysfunctional distress among participants assigned to the treatment group, compared to a waitlisted group at post-treatment and follow-up meetings.Conclusion:Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of a rational-emotive stress management intervention in reducing the level of job-related burnout and distress in a sample of special education teachers in Nigeria. Occupational health counsellors and other clinicians with sufficient knowledge of rational-emotive behavior therapy framework are urged to employ this approach in assisting other employees in managing job burnout symptoms, and distress.

AB  - The first years of children's lives are the most important for establishing a foundation for later learning. Young children with special needs require careful attention by trained individuals to ensure a path of development that, as closely as possible, parallels that of nondisabled children. This is achieved by providing for the child's physical and biological needs and by providing an environment rich in opportunities to learn. While legal and ethical precedents have spawned an increase in the number of programs available, only the commitment of knowledgeable and skilled professionals can assure that a high level of quality accompanies the increase in services. The ability of the teacher to apply a broad base of knowledge, to communicate well with families and other professionals, to utilize available resources effectively, and to monitor progress, maximizes the ultimate benefits of programs for children. Early intervention offers opportunities to prevent or reduce deficits in children and stress in their families. However, the effectiveness of early intervention efforts depends to a great extent on the competence of the early childhood special educator.

AB  - The purposes of this study were to examine initial content knowledge about properties of air by three cohorts of undergraduate and master's students studying elementary education and to determine forms of reasoning used to explain air phenomena and the effect of an intervention on content knowledge. Subjects were assessed using a 14-question test on air phenomena before and after a lab consisting of 17 hands-on activities and six discrepant event demonstrations. The activities and demonstrations included the following concepts: air occupies space, air exerts pressure, Boyle's Law and Bernoulli's Principle. Analysis of lab journals indicated that student reasoning was focused on "what" was happening rather than "why" it was happening. A 3 "group" x 2 "time (pretest/posttest)" ANOVA with repeated measures indicated that the groups did not differ, initial understanding of the air concepts was low, and all groups improved significantly on the posttest. Instructions for activities and demonstrations are included. (Contains 3 tables.)

AB  - Violence directed against K-12 teachers is a serious problem that demands the immediate attention of researchers, providers of teacher pre-service and in-service training, school administrators, community leaders, and policymakers. Surprisingly, little research has been conducted on this growing problem despite the broad impact teacher victimization can have on schooling, recruitment, and retention of highly effective teachers and on student academic and behavioral outcomes. Psychologists should play a leadership role in mitigating school violence, including violence directed toward teachers. There is a need for psychologists to conduct research accurately assessing the types and scope of violence that teachers experience; to comprehensively evaluate the individual, classroom, school, community, institutional, and cultural contextual factors that might predict and/or explain types of teacher violence; and to examine the effectiveness and sustainability of classroom, school, and district-wide prevention and intervention strategies that target teacher violence in school systems. Collectively, the work of psychologists in this area could have a substantial impact on schooling, teacher experience and retention, and overall student performance.

AB  - Cyberbullying is a pervasive problem that puts students at risk of successful academic outcomes and the ability to feel safe in school. As most students with disabilities are served in inclusive classrooms, there is a growing concern that students with special needs are at an increased risk of online bullying harassment. Enhancing responsible bystander behavior can be an effective factor in combating cyberbullying. This qualitative case study examined bystander perceptions of cyberbullying of 11 students with and without disabilities and 9 general and special educators from 14 different schools located on the Eastern seaboard. Specifically, a case study analysis including interviews, artifacts, and member checks was completed using a grounded theory and constant comparative method of analysis. Four key themes related to cyberbullying were identified: (a) conditions facilitate cyberbullying among students with and without disabilities in inclusive settings, (b) awareness of cyberbullying influences perceptions, (c) key factors influence bystander perceptions and reactions, and (d) adolescent bystanders react as active interveners, passive witnesses, and bystander bullies, while teachers are proactive or reactive. Implications for research, policy, schools, and teachers are discussed. Limitations and suggestions for future research are also presented.

AB  - Students with emotional and behavioral disorders (EBD) often exhibit moderate to severe broad academic deficits in multiple areas as compared to their normative peers (Lane, 2004); they engage in aggressive acts and receive less positive attention by peers and adults. As a result, they are more likely to drop out of school, stay unemployed, engage in delinquent behavior, and have unsuccessful interpersonal relationships. Without appropriate educational services and social interventions, children with EBD are at significant risk for school failure and mental health and adjustment problems. However, it is difficult to overlook the fact that a substantial proportion of students with EBD are still deprived of services, partially due to professional uncertainty about what works in a specific context and how to implement what works in that context, or simply due to lack of resources. Professionals in the field of EBD need to pause and reflect on the right things for students with EBD. The focus of this article is to share apprehension, uncertainty, and concerns related to the definition of EBD and ethical issues involved in educational practice, teacher education, and research. The purpose is not to diminish or undermine the professional work that already exists, but to raise awareness that despite accumulating knowledge, professionals have compromised in making sound decisions for students with EBD.

AB  - Drawing on an evaluation experience of a teacher education preparation project in a rural area of South Africa, this paper attempts to explore the possibility of using Communities of Practice (CoP) in teacher preparation. The paper concludes that the concept of CoP is powerful in providing spaces for self-reflection to pre-service teachers and challenging the dominant urban-based teacher education discourses in relation to rural schools. However, the CoP is also problematic, especially with regard to the issues of social differences among the members of the CoP and the sustainability of the broader influence of a CoP on marginalised rural communities.

AB  - This qualitative phenomenological study explored the perceptions and experiences of the middle school students who participated in learning center support as elementary students in independent schools. There were 16 participants from three sites included in the study: six students, seven parents, and three learning specialists. The research questions guiding this study included: (1) What are the perspectives of students on the impact of the learning center experience in regard to reading development? (2) How does the child's discernment of how he or she is perceived academically by his or her reading teacher contribute to/hinder the process of learning to read? (3) How does a child's sensitivity to being identified as needing extra support in learning to read affect/support the experience? (4) What do students, parents, and teachers think about learning centers? (5) How do children perceive reading teacher effectiveness and successful reading instruction? (6) How does a child's perception of a model of reading intervention inform the planning of teachers, interventionists, and reading specialists? (7) What do students think about the activities they participate during learning center time? Literature reviewed for the study included the existence of the reading problem in the United States, models of reading intervention, strategies shown to accelerate reading growth, teacher knowledge, and student perspectives. Data was collected in the form of interviews and observations, and was reviewed in consideration of narrative inquiry, typological analysis, and polyvocal analysis. All participant responses were considered across cases with specific attention given to the guiding research questions. The six students interviewed believed that their participation in the learning center helped them in some way. Some of them were able to verbalize what was helpful, while others provided few details. Nonetheless, the student participants offered specific recommendations on how to improve the learning center structure. Parent interviews shored up varying perspectives and recommendations for ways that the structure of the learning center should remain the same and also how it should change. Finally, learning specialists shared their views and experiences and added a richer understanding to the study in general. Three major themes emerged from the data. First, that students and parents attach a stigma to resource support. Second, that students and parents feel like they had to give something up because of their participation in the learning center. And third, methodological issues on the structure of the interviews were raised. Findings and current research were connected, and considerations for future research were made.

AB  - Recruiting and educating international students is a growing characteristic of the landscape of American higher education. "Open Doors 2006" indicated that 564,766 international students were enrolled in American higher education institutions in 2005-06 and that international students currently represent 3.9% of the total enrollment. Undoubtedly, international students benefit from studying in the United States. On the other hand, international students' presence on American campuses, in the era of internationalization and globalization, also benefits American students, increasing their cultural sensitivity and skills in working with people from different backgrounds. This article presents a case study that attempts to increase the international teaching assistant (ITA) training knowledge base by investigating how a training program offered by a northwest research university (Mountain University) prepared ITAs. It is hoped that this study will provide insights into the preparation of ITAs, as well as illuminate the need for a greater understanding of the experience of international students on American college and university campuses.

AB  - Instructional supervision is a highly complex endeavor as supervisors work to enhance teacher, teacher candidate, and school effectiveness. The process of learning to supervise well can be daunting and difficult. Recent research on teaching has focused on enhancing teachers' ability to notice or observe aspects of teaching and student learning. The ability to assist teacher candidates to "notice" and observe is equally important when supervising them. This qualitative case study builds upon the research on teaching and on supervision. It illustrates that "noticing" is one of a constellation of pedagogical skills supervisors use to support the learning of others. In addition, the authors identify six other pedagogical skills including ignoring, marking, intervening, pointing, unpacking, and processing. Further defining these skills is useful for understanding the intricacies of clinical pedagogy in instructional supervision. The results of this study suggest that supervision in clinically rich contexts is a pedagogical or teaching function which extends beyond traditional conceptions of observation and feedback.

AB  - Summary: In this article we explore a continuum of interventions that offer at-risk children and youth experience in outdoor wilderness environments. Though these experiences are thought to enhance the well-being of participants, the mechanisms by which programming in natural environments promotes health have been poorly understood. In this article we discuss different types of outdoor programmes in which social workers and allied professionals participate, linking programme goals and outcomes to research on mitigating risk and promoting resilience in at-risk populations. Findings: Findings are based on qualitative data gathered as part of regular programme evaluations and a separate study of 14 participants' reactions to programming. Results show favourable outcomes in terms of relationship building and a sense of spirituality and purpose, though there was little increased awareness of environmental issues. Follow-up and support after programming helped to reinforce changes made during the outdoor experience. Applications: These case studies, combined with a review of the literature, provide the basis for a theoretically sound approach to understanding the health-enhancing mechanisms that operate through outdoor experience-based education and treatment. Similarities between the gains made in well-being and resilience are highlighted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Young people with complex needs (YPCNs) use multiple services that are often poorly coordinated despite the best efforts of social workers to act as case managers. Based on two case studies from research with 116 youth who are multiple service users in Atlantic Canada, six principles for the design of services are suggested reflecting both this study’s findings and the broader literature on YPCNs. Services that are (i) multi-level, (ii) coordinated, (iii) continuous over time, (iv) negotiated with users, (v) provided along a continuum from least to most intrusive and (vi) shown to be effective are more likely to meet the long-term needs of youth facing the cumulative disadvantages of family, community, school and individual challenges.

AB  - This second edition of the classic "Universal Design in Higher Education" is a comprehensive, up-to-the-minute guide for creating fully accessible college and university programs. The second edition has been thoroughly revised and expanded, and it addresses major recent changes in universities and colleges, the law, and technology. As larger numbers of people with disabilities attend postsecondary educational institutions, there have been comparable greater efforts to make the full array of classes, services, and programs accessible to all students. This revised edition provides both a full survey of those measures and practical guidance for schools as they work to turn the goal of universal accessibility into a reality. As such, it makes an indispensable contribution to the growing body of literature on special education and universal design. This book will be of particular value to university and college administrators, and to special education researchers, teachers, and activists. Contents of the book begin with the Foreword (by Michael K. Young), a Preface, and twenty-four chapters with respective authors divided over five parts. Part 1: Introduction, contains: Chapter 1: Universal Design in Higher Education (Sheryl E. Burgstahler). Part 2: Universal Design of Instruction in higher Education, continues with: Chapter 2: Universal Design of Instruction: From Principles to Practice (Sheryl E.

AB  - Teachers' judgements on effective reading interventions could influence the implementation of those interventions. To date, the primary focus of treatment acceptability research has been examining the treatment acceptability of behavioral interventions; however, a limited number of studies have investigated the treatment acceptability of reading interventions. Additionally, no validated measures have been developed to assess the treatment acceptability of reading interventions. Therefore, the first purpose of this study was to develop a new instrument called the Reading Intervention Rating Profile (RIRP) which was specifically designed to assess the acceptability of reading intervention procedures. Also, the second major purpose was to examine teacher factors (i.e., teaching experience, level of education, and certification type) that influence the acceptability ratings of reading interventions, as measured by the RIRP. Participants who were 59 special education teachers and 78 general education teachers completed the 15-item RIRP along with demographic questions. Results suggested that the RIRP has sufficient internal consistency and reliability to be of use in assessments of the acceptability of reading interventions. Regarding the second objective of the study, results for both groups of teachers indicated that teachers' acceptability ratings of reading interventions differ based on their years of teaching experience and their certification type. However, no significant difference was found for the acceptability ratings for both groups of teachers on the RIRP based on their level of education. Finally, the limitations of the study, the implications of the research findings, and the recommendations for future research were discussed.

AB  - This paper is about the millennial generation. Much has been written about the generation: their character; beliefs; motivations; values; and future potentialities. This literature has gained momentum as marketers, employers, and educators seek to understand the generation as they come of age and enter into positions of social responsibility. The purpose of this paper is to examine the claims made about the Millennials, determine who are making these claims and why, and discuss the utility of such claims for teacher educators. This paper argues that teacher educators should be cautious about accepting and adopting popular discourses about the generation as a basis for the designing and developing millennial appropriate educational practices and pedagogy.

AB  - For students with autism spectrum disorders, problems with flexibility and goal-directed behavior can be a major obstacle to success in school and in life. But flexibility and goal-setting can be taught just like any other skill--and this how-to manual equips professionals with simple, real-world ways to help students with ASD develop this critical aspect of executive function. A classroom-based intervention approach for high-functioning students ages 8-11, this innovative guide gives special educators and other service providers ready-to-use lessons that promote cognitive and behavioral flexibility in everyday situations, from compromising with peers to handling schedule changes. Developed by a multidisciplinary team of researchers and front-line professionals, the 27 lessons in "Unstuck and On Target!": (1) are tested and proven; (2) reflect the learning style of students with ASD; (3) target specific skills every student needs; (4) free up teacher time; (5) fit easily into any curriculum; (6) make learning fun; and (7) ensure generalization.

AB  - Metropolitan State College of Denver is an urban college in Denver, Colorado, serving 200-240 student teachers per semester, with teacher licensure programs in Early Childhood, Elementary K-6, Special Education, Secondary English, Mathematics, Science, Social Studies, Modern Languages, K-12 Art, Music, and Physical Education. Approximately 97 percent of the student teachers completed the licensure standards at the required proficiency level to be recommended for licensure in the state. However, based on the data gathered by a group of education elementary professors, 82 of preservice teachers who met all the requirements for student teaching withdrew before starting, due to personal reasons. Fortunately, preservice teachers who were unsuccessful in their initial student teaching placement were offered the opportunity to develop and complete an intervention plan to focus on the remediation of the problem areas that contributed to non-success in student teaching. This article describes the importance of helping preservice teachers achieve success in student teaching.

AB  - In recent years, the trend in school psychology service delivery has shifted toward a problem solving focus; that is, an approach to developing interventions and ensuring student outcomes rather than determining failure or deviance (Deno, 1995; Reschly & Ysseldyke, 1995). This direction is reflected in major National Association of School Psychologists (NASP) publications, such as the previous edition of Best Practices (Thomas & Grimes, 1995) and Blueprint II (Ysseldyke et al, 1997) as well as other major professional publications (e.g., Rathvon, 1999; Reschly, Tilly, & Grimes, 2000; Shinn, Stoner, & Walker, in press). With this shift in practice comes the challenge and responsibility for school psychologists to ensure they are designing, implementing, and evaluating quality interventions. This chapter will assist practitioners by presenting critical quality indicators of interventions. Space limitations preclude a comprehensive treatment of each intervention component. Many of the quality indicators could and do have complete chapters or books written on them elsewhere. Hence, this chapter will provide a brief discussion of each component, along with references to more complete sources of each indicator. In addition, innovation configurations will be presented for school psychology practitioners to monitor their implementation of each component that will allow them to assess their own progress in designing, implementing, and evaluating quality interventions.

AB  - Behavior problems among preschool children are common. They are important targets for intervention because early externalizing problems and self-regulation issues tend to persist without appropriate attention, and can affect later mental health and school achievement outcomes. However, few preschool curricula addressing social and emotional development exist, and evidence for effects are mixed. In this study, the Second Step Pre/Kindergarten Social and Emotional Learning curriculum was adapted and tested in a small cluster randomized pilot study of community preschool classrooms to determine if it could improve outcomes in: (1) individual children’s teacher-rated behavior problems and prosocial skills; (2) classroom climate (classroom interactions and two measures of disruptive behavior); and (3) teacher interaction skills. Year 1 outcomes were modest and were accounted for by baseline differences. In Year 2, classroom climate, measured by independent observers, differed significantly in intervention classrooms, largely because of declines in control classrooms, and there was some evidence for better teacher interaction skills in intervention classrooms. The pattern of effects suggests important impacts on classroom quality worth investigating in a larger study. Both fidelity and implementation rates, as well as positive teacher responses to the curriculum, indicate potential for widespread adoption.

AB  - The close connection between the quality of provision for young children and professionalisation of the field has long been supported by international research. That the two are inseparable aspects of one picture is beginning to become accepted at European policy level, as evident in recent high level EU policy documents. This article explores the reciprocal relationship between quality and professionalisation, drawing on the findings of the study on "competence requirements in early childhood education and care" (CoRe), jointly conducted by the University of East London and the University of Gent, and funded by the European Commission. Based on a review of literature in several European languages and data from a 15-country survey and seven in-depth case studies, CoRe has identified systemic conditions for a professionalisation of the entire early childhood system, beyond the formal qualification levels of individual practitioners. The article argues for a critical and systemic reconceptualisation of professional practice in a "competent system". (Contains 2 tables and 2 notes.)

AB  - Teachers may not be trained on how to prevent or address school violence and/or may lack the skills necessary to provide adequate intervention strategies. The purpose of this study was to explore urban K-6 teachers' perceptions of school violence at one metropolitan school. The conceptual framework for this study was supported by Bronfenbrenner's nested ecological development theory, which characterizes violence as an interaction among several subsystems, such as factors internal and external to the school. The research questions were related to urban K-6 teachers' perceptions and knowledge of school violence and obstacles that prevent them from addressing school violence. The focus of this qualitative case study was 6 teachers' perspectives on school violence including prevention and intervention methods. Audiotaped semistructured interviews were transcribed and analyzed by comparing and contrasting emergent themes, with similar themes being combined as a method of data reduction. The main findings highlighted the significance of understanding teachers' perceptions that the school, community, and family play in addressing school violence. Key results indicated that the teachers lacked training to cope with school violence and felt that professional development opportunities should be a priority at the school and district levels to support teachers in the classroom. One conclusion is that this study may lead to a blueprint for safer schools to end acts of violence. Based on the findings, it is recommended that teachers be trained to learn coping skills to address school violence. Social change implications include providing professional development opportunities for teachers, parents, community members, and local educational agencies on school violence.

The basic terms defined are reflective practice, the mediator role played by the social worker in relation to the beneficiary, and the idea of reinforcement. Emphasises the importance of co-ordinating the education of future experts with everyday needs. Field instruction is therefore becoming ever more demanding and the field instructor's role more complex. Such changes require that the professional community recognises the importance of field instruction, establishes a system of specialisation of practitioners for performing this role, and introduces certain forms of support and stimulation for field instructors.

AB  - Critical thinking in Health Sciences is among the transversal competences in the Nursing Degree. The critical card is a tool of individual learning, designed to develop critical thinking, and set in the process of environmental health learning. Every student must perform the activity to obtain the highest qualification in Community Health Nursing subject. The aim of this project was to evaluate this learning tool using the students' perceptions after its performance. The evaluation was based on the answers to a questionnaire obtained from the third course students of Nursing Degree at the University of Zaragoza. The questionnaire was made up of 14 Likert-type questions, grouped in four dimensions. The student participation rate was higher than 50%. The analysis of the questionnaire obtained 67,8% positive answers. The variability between dimensions ranged between 49% of positive answers for application in other subjects and 87% of positive answers for the improvements applicable to the instrument. The students coincided in indicating that the critical card is a useful learning tool and could be applicable in other subjects. However, the weight it is given in the global evaluation of the subject is considered to be too low, considering the time used to complete the activity.

AB  - We explored how a progress monitoring and instructional management system can be used to help educators differentiate instruction and meet the wide-ranging learning needs of their increasingly diverse classrooms. We compared classrooms in 24 states that used a curriculum-based progress monitoring and instructional management system, Accelerated Math, to same school control classrooms that did not use it. Among the major findings were the following: (1) At every grade level there were large differences in grade equivalent score and percentile gains for students in the experimental and control classrooms; (2) Gains were experienced across the achievement spectrum. An analysis of low-, middle-, and high-achieving students showed consistent rates of gain for each math objective mastered; (3) Intervention integrity had a significant effect on student achievement; (4) Teachers using the progress monitoring and instructional management system spent more time providing individual versus group instruction and felt better able to meet the individual needs of their students; and (5) Significantly more students who were in classrooms where teachers used the progress monitoring and instructional management system reported that they like math, help each other with math, and like math better this year than last year. Addition of a progress monitoring and instructional management system to ongoing mathematics instruction improves mathematics outcomes for students. The effects of the program clearly are a function of intervention integrity; when progress monitoring and instructional management practices are implemented with high fidelity or integrity, the mathematics performance of all students is significantly enhanced. Implications for practice are discussed.

AB  - Promising and encouraging results have been recently reported on the use of briefer interventions for adolescent drug abusers. Because middle- and high-school-based drug abuse intervention programs have grown in popularity over the past several decades, the use of brief interventions (BIs) in school settings merits consideration. Methods: We review several clinical and school contextual issues pertaining to the scientific efficacy, feasibility, and application of BIs for students who are abusing drugs. Results: Several advantages for employing BIs in a school setting are identified, including the relatively high base rate of students with mild-to-moderate drug involvement and the likelihood that school counselors can readily learn BI techniques. Caveats of implementing BIs include practical, systemic, and clinical barriers. Conclusions: Despite concerns, schools are a viable setting in which to screen youth for drug abuse problems and to conduct a BI. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR], Copyrigh)

AB  - This study used interviews and classroom observation to follow up a survey of 78 Head Start staff from five programs in the mid-Atlantic region. The purpose of the study was to collect additional details about administrator and staff needs in regard to addressing children's challenging behavior in order to design a PBS in-service intervention. Interviews were conducted with 45 adults from the same preschool sample, and direct observation occurred in 10 classrooms. Similar to prior survey results, it was found that interview respondents (a) listed externalizing behaviors as the predominant challenging behavior, (b) identified prevention and replacement methods for addressing problem behavior, and (c) indicated that families of children with challenging behavior were given opportunities to be involved in intervention planning and implementation. However, interview and observation results further exposed the use of reactive practices and revealed five primary barriers to addressing children's challenging behavior. Finally, interview respondents reported that all programs had defined procedures they followed when children exhibited challenging behavior that in most programs was based on a traditional, child-focused, mental health approach rather than on a comprehensive systems approach like positive behavior support.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to use video feedback in the training of pre-service clinical educators. Thirty athletic training teacher participants were randomly placed in one of three equal groups where they were provided with the following interventions: a) teaching seminar and opportunity to observe video of teaching; b) teaching seminar; and c) control group. These groups were videotaped for eight consecutive weeks while teaching clinical skills. The researchers analyzed the feedback provided by the teachers using a modified version of the Fishman's Augmented Feedback Instrument. Allowing teachers the opportunity to view their videotapes with guided feedback showed that the teachers provided more total feedback to their students in a clinical setting. The two groups, seminar and control, provided similar amounts of feedback to their students. Unlike previous studies, it was noted that males provided more total feedback than females. Traditional teacher development may not be the ideal method to train clinical educators. The study's results demonstrate that a focused workshop on effective teaching skills cannot be used as a stand-alone intervention to improve the frequency of feedback provided by clinical educators. However, further research in this area is needed to assist in improving the training of pre-service clinical educators.

AB  - Recent public policy and research aimed at addressing student-achievement accountability in education may make it prudent for teacher-education programs to explicitly address data literacy as a valid outcome for their graduates. This article examines the changes in perceptions of comfort toward data-literacy behaviors before and after an instructional intervention called a Data Chat for students in a teacher-preparation program. The results suggest that the intervention increased student perceptions of comfort in performing those data-literacy behaviors required for successful data use as a classroom teacher. We contend that data literacy is the new literacy for the next generation of teacher-education graduates.

AB  - Harry, a fifth-grade student attending a public middle school that serves students from fifth to eighth grade, was described by the math and special education teachers as monotone, not caring about school or friends, and generally off task. Ms. Hart, the special education teacher, considered Harry's lack of attention, doodling, playing with his calculator, and putting his head on the desk to be of large concern and wanted immediate help for him. To address Harry's behavior, a functional assessment-based intervention (FABI) was designed, implemented, and evaluated using the systematic approach developed by Umbreit, Ferro, Liaupsin, and Lane (2007). The goal was to increase his academic engaged time (AET). This article describes the steps taken in designing and implementing the FABI for Harry: (1) conducting a functional assessment; (2) analyzing data collected via the Function Matrix to determine the maintaining function of the target behavior; and (3) using the Function-Based Intervention Decision Model to determine an appropriate intervention method. With this information, the authors developed an intervention that included antecedent adjustments, adjustments to reinforcement contingencies, and extinction components. They implemented the intervention during his inclusive math class. Overall, the full process occurred within a relatively brief, 6-week period, concluding in the final week of the academic year.

AB  - The present pilot study investigated the impact of video hero modelling (VHM) on the daily living skills of an elementary-aged student with autism spectrum disorder. The VHM, in which a character much admired by the student exhibited a correct response, was shown to the participant immediately before the situation where he needed to exhibit the target behaviours. Results of a multiple-probe design across three behaviours showed that each of the three target behaviours improved only when the VHM was introduced. In addition, the participant and his teachers demonstrated positive attitudes toward the use of VHM. However, the teachers hesitated to develop the VHM by themselves due to the perceived complexity of the development process and time constraints.

AB  - This paper describes how the development of critical reflection in student teachers has been made an explicit part of a teacher education programme. Using a rubric presented by Ward and McCotter, (2004) and supported by an online discussion forum, the rubric was used in a meta-analysis activity where students identified the quality of critical reflection in their lesson evaluations. The evidence suggests that the activity can result in a qualitative improvement in the nature of critical reflection. The intervention also appeared to generate a growing acknowledgement by students that writing lesson evaluations, is a valuable process which can enhance their practice. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - Special educators frequently provide consultation for parents and general education teachers who are struggling to manage student behavior. One intervention often discussed is the use of rewards to increase student motivation. While research has shown that well-designed incentive systems can provide an effective intervention, poorly designed systems are often ineffective, and can be counter-productive. Unfortunately, the special educator is often placed in the position of having to critique and try to improve poorly designed incentive systems. The author uses a mnemonic formed from the letters in the word "incentive" to propose a quick, research-based method for evaluating incentive systems. The mnemonic provides a useful tool to use when consulting with parents and general educators. Referring to the mnemonic can help when critiquing existing systems, and sharing the mnemonic can help others learn how to create more effective incentive systems in the future. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - Advocacy begins with an assumption that if a number of community members are suffering, then there must be something wrong, not with the individual members, but with the community as a whole; therefore, the community must be changed to help alleviate that suffering. Advocacy creates a platform for change by allowing individuals to begin the process of improvement through finding their voice and believing their voice can produce change. Advocacy is essential for parents to address the imbalance of power and control when their child has a disability and the community and schools see their child, not as different, but as deficient. Traditional formats for advocacy have included multiple public discourses. One of the most powerful forms of public discourse for producing change can be achieved through performing arts. This medium transforms feelings, thoughts, and images into aesthetic persuasion that allows participants and audience members to experience a phenomenon in a new way and to ask questions that might not have been asked. Performing stories has been a means of connecting audiences to lived experiences in the language of ordinary people since the beginning of mankind. Readers' theatre is "a form of group story-telling in which two of more readers present a piece of literature by reading aloud from hand-held scripts." The strength of a readers' theatre performance "lies in the transformation of each participant as she or he engages in conversation, reflection, and action in community with others." Because the "action" of the story takes place, not on a stage, but in the minds of the audience as enhanced by the vocal and facial expressions of the readers, the staging can be as simple as stools and ladders in a cafeteria, library, or classroom or as elaborate as a stage supplemented by lighting and levels. This article presents a play, "This Exit, No Return," wherein each parent expresses individually their initial reactions to discovering that their child will grow up differently. They voice their fears, hopes, and dreams as they describe for an audience the frustrations and riches of their lives. The piece is intended to be used by groups to bring awareness to the general public and to teachers and other school personnel of the perception that children with disabilities are unique and whole individuals. While this may seem an unusual medium for advocating for children with disabilities, it has been proven to be very effective. This play has been read in many classes for special education and general education teachers.

AB  - This paper describes the process and procedures that three Rowan graduate students of school psychology, in collaboration with two faculty members, utilize to plan and deliver school psychology services. Overall, the cases show how school psychologists can influence the academic achievement of not only an individual child but also a whole class, as well as a whole system. Two cases illustrate the benefits of collaborative consultation while another describes the need to look at systematic variables (e.g., curriculum) and their impact on individual learners. The idea that psychologists need to act as consultants to schools as systems has gained much momentum within the past 10 years. The NASP position statement on advocacy for appropriate educational services for all children and the subsequent publications, "Alternative Educational Delivery Systems: Enhancing Instructional Options for All Students" and "Best Practices in School Psychology III," provide the philosophical and theoretical bases for an expanded role for school psychologists. New roles require that school psychologists provide expertise as appropriate to the various school-based services and programs. Changes in roles and behavior call for new ways of communicating information, planning, and decision making. As a consultant, the school psychologist is a resource within the natural learning environment, using curriculum-based educational and instructional methodologies to collaboratively identify problems and devise solutions. These cases indicate this approach is beneficial because it provides help at the pre-referral stage, thus possibly preventing identifying children as disabled; it provides services for more students; and it makes full use of the professional capabilities of the educators involved, producing a multiplicative rather than an additive effect.

AB  - As the need to train more teachers to work in inclusive classrooms increases, college instructors should identify and implement course assessments measuring their effectiveness in training practices. Skills in managing the challenging behaviors of students with disabilities, such as autism and emotional disturbances are important for teachers worldwide. The purpose of this paper is to explore the use of a course assessment to develop Functional Behavior Assessment (FBA) and Behavior Intervention Plan (BIP). The course assessment used in this study was developed, revised, and then implemented to evaluate participants' knowledge to identify, assess and develop plans to improve challenging behaviors of students with behavior disabilities. The course assessment was used in training teachers who currently hold general education certification in obtaining special education training. All participants were new teachers, previously certified in childhood education, and seeking additional certification in special education. Results show there were significant differences across the years of implementation of the study. The paper includes recommendations for other institutions of higher education to utilize similar course assessments into their teacher training programs. (Contains 3 tables.)

Implementation checklists provide step-by-step instruction to users and, when paired with peer coaching opportunities, can provide a valuable support to parents, general education teachers, and caregivers. A detailed case scenario illustrates how itinerant specialists can use implementation checklists in an inclusive early childhood setting. In this article, the authors describe the development and use of implementation checklists that break down intervention strategies into discrete, sequential steps that are easy for adults to follow and use in the itinerant specialist's absence.

If information is not in context, rote memorization occurs with the less meaningful information, and information is not easily retrieved or successfully stored in long term memory. The purpose of this study was to determine if using a teaching simulation to teach social stratification can improve the students' knowledge of culture and knowledge of effective instructional practices using 21 incoming freshman students. This study used a mixed methods approach with journal entries and inventories. The results indicated the pre-service teachers felt the simulation allowed them to apply the classroom content within a direct learning experience.

AB  - Victims of bullying need assistance in developing better strategies for effectively responding to bullies. Utilizing a new intervention strategy, problem-based learning (PBL), school counselors can incorporate problem-solving and literature-based lessons. This strategy provides the possibility of increasing awareness and knowledge of bullying, achieving teacher/parent involvement, and teaching assertiveness skills. A single-subject design was utilized to determine the effectiveness of PBL with five victims of bullying behavior. Results and implications for school counselors are discussed. (Contains 1 graph.)

AB  - This article discusses how process indicators can complement outcomes as part of a comprehensive explanatory evaluation framework, using the example of skills-based behavioural interventions to prevent sexually transmitted infections and promote sexual health among young people in schools. A systematic review was conducted, yielding 12 eligible outcome evaluations, 9 of which included a process evaluation. There were few statistically significant effects in terms of changes in sexual behaviour outcomes, but statistically significant effects were more common for knowledge and self-efficacy. Synthesis of the findings of the process evaluations identified a range of factors that might explain outcomes, and these were organized into two overarching categories: the implementation of interventions, and student engagement and intervention acceptability. Factors which supported implementation and engagement and acceptability included good quality teacher training, involvement and motivation of key school stakeholders and relevance and appeal to young people. Factors which had a negative impact included teachers' failure to comprehend the theoretical basis for behaviour change, school logistical problems and omission of topics that young people considered important. It is recommended that process indicators such as these be assessed in future evaluations of school-based sexual health behavioural interventions, as part of a logic model.

AB  - More than 20 percent of children (ages 2-17) in the United States have witnessed and/or been victims of multiple forms of violence. Children from birth through age 5 are more likely to experience maltreatment and neglect than other age groups. Violence and trauma (including neglect), whether in the home or the community, have lasting effects on children's school readiness and ability to form relationships, yet services are not widely available for preschoolers affected by these stressors. An early education program can offer respite and support, bolster children's emotional resources, and respond to trauma so that children are ready to learn. Located in a San Francisco neighborhood with one of the highest rates of children witnessing violent crime in the city, the Visitacion Valley Therapeutic Nursery, which the authors created with colleagues and community members, was designed to meet the needs of some of the city's most troubled children. However, the principles and techniques followed are integral to all high-quality inclusive early care and education programs. Like other relationship-based interventions, the focus on child-teacher relationships and children's emotional health supported children's growth in all domains. The therapeutic classroom was a 10-year collaboration between two agencies: (1) a community early education program; and (2) the Children's Council of San Francisco, a resource and referral agency that provides mental health consultations. Set in the midst of a large multisite early education program in a community-based family service center, the therapeutic classroom was staffed by early education and mental health professionals. After 10 years the therapeutic classroom closed due to public funding cuts. However, the classroom had met its mission, responding successfully to traumatized and overwhelmed children and preparing them for school. The authors believe that the lessons they learned over the years can help and inspire others.

AB  - ABSTRACT BACKGROUND School-based social-emotional and character development ( SECD) programs can influence not only SECD but also academic-related outcomes. This study evaluated the impact of one SECD program, Positive Action ( PA), on educational outcomes among low-income, urban youth. METHODS The longitudinal study used a matched-pair, cluster-randomized controlled design. Student-reported disaffection with learning and academic grades, and teacher ratings of academic ability and motivation were assessed for a cohort followed from grades 3 to 8. Aggregate school records were used to assess standardized test performance (for entire school, cohort, and demographic subgroups) and absenteeism (entire school). Multilevel growth-curve analyses tested program effects. RESULTS PA significantly improved growth in academic motivation and mitigated disaffection with learning. There was a positive impact of PA on absenteeism and marginally significant impact on math performance of all students.)

AB  - This single subject design study (ABAB) investigated the effects of using iPads[R] in a classwide academic intervention to increase independent task completion and basic math skills of seven students diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) enrolled in a special education school for students with moderate to severe disabilities. An additional purpose of the study was to identify the advantages of and challenges to using iPads[R] for classroom instruction. Traditional basic math instruction was used for the baseline phase, while a basic math skill app on an iPad[R] was used for the intervention phase. Math probes were completed and the results recorded for four to five sessions for each of the four weeks of the study. Data on level of teacher prompting and presence of noncompliant behaviors were collected during every phase. Descriptive and visual analysis techniques were used to analyze the data. Findings expand current knowledge of the use of instructional technology with students with ASD and single subject design to document the effect of evidence-based practices in special education. Results were mixed for math skill development but indicated an increase in independent task completion as demonstrated by a decrease in noncompliant behaviors and teacher prompt levels. Findings suggest iPads[R] can be an effective instructional tool to enhance learning and independence. Contributions, limitations, and future research are presented.

AB  - Motivation is often a major concern for educators in all subject areas. Educational benefits associated with increased levels of student motivation have been well-documented within educational research. Improving student motivation can be affected by the educational environment (motivational climate), developed by the teacher. This study examined the development of preservice teachers' (n=13) utilization of TARGET (a motivational intervention) in a physical education practicum setting. Data was collected through two methods, (a) scenario responses were conducted using a pretest/posttest design and (b) self reflection and field notes were collected during the practicum. Data revealed that a semester methods course focusing on the TARGET components allows PTs to develop Task, Grouping and Recognition components of a motivational climate within their teaching, while components associated with Authority and Time were less developed by PTs. Results of this study add to the previous research on teacher preparation that suggest effective preparation of PTs should allow for increased time to develop skills and utilize lesson reflections as a means for developing individualized teaching skills.

AB  - This study used ethnographic methods to understand factors influencing the implementation of an educational intervention combining short math content videos with teacher trainings and mentorship in high-poverty primary schools in Nicaragua with implications for rural school reform. Educators in rural schools in Latin American face serious obstacles to improve classroom instruction and pedagogy, including lack of resources and overcrowding. Research suggests an over-reliance on input-output models in which inputs (e.g. teacher salaries, textbooks, technology, computer labs, numbers of classrooms, etc.) are expected to produce particular outputs (student retention, lowering drop-out rates, increasing graduation rates, etc.); however, studies show that regardless of the resources, much depends on effective use of resources for successful teaching and learning (O'Sullivan, 2006; L. S. Shulman, 1987). While input/output models provide insights into an educational systems economic efficiency, they do not offer insight into what actually transpires inside of a classroom (O'Sullivan, 2006). Much depends on effective training and use of these very resources. Though systemic issues in the Nicaraguan educational system produced numerous obstacles for the eleven participating 3rd and 6th grade teachers, the educational intervention model supported teachers' ability to be innovative and grow their practice in four ways: a) increased pedagogical knowledge; b) opportunities to collaborate and support one another as a community of teachers; c) flexibility in adaptation of the intervention model to their specific classroom context; and d) use of videos as supportive resources for content knowledge.

AB  - This final report describes the activities and outcomes of a project designed to prepare early interventionists and preschool teachers to serve children with vision and hearing impairments. The purpose of the project was to build upon existing early childhood special education and sensory impairment programs across two universities, the University of Utah and Utah State University. Competencies for each course were developed and/or modified based on State Standards for Hearing Impaired and Vision Impaired (birth to 5) by faculty and parent project advisors. A new course designed to address the role of the specialists in early childhood special education and sensory impairments was developed. Distance delivery sites were established for students located in rural regions. Thirty-two students were recruited and admitted to the program, and 24 completed the program by the end of the grant period. Five will complete their program in Spring 2002. Seven of the completing students were located in rural and remote areas. All became state licensed and endorsed in hearing or vision impairments (birth to 5). Qualifying for this endorsement required that students must have previously held or obtained a license in early childhood special education. Students were supported by grant funded stipends while they completed both their preservice preparation and their early childhood special education program. All but two of the graduates were employed. Budget information, and summaries of student information, course evaluations, employer evaluations of graduates, and parent satisfaction with graduates are included. (SG)

AB  - This multiyear scale-up effectiveness study of Open Court Reading (OCR) involved approximately 4,500 students and more than 1,000 teachers per year in Grades K-5 from 49 elementary schools in seven districts across the country. Using a school-level cluster randomized trial design, we assessed the implementation and effectiveness of Open Court Reading over two years. Implementation study results demonstrated adequate to high levels of fidelity across the treatment schools. Intent-to-treat analyses revealed no statistically significant main effects on students' reading performance in Year 1 and a small negative effect (d = -0.09) in Year 2. There were positive impacts for particular subgroups, including kindergarten (d = 0.12) and Hispanic (d = 0.10) students in the first year. However, there were negative impacts for first grade (d = -0.13), females (d = -0.11), students who were not eligible for free or reduced-price lunch (d = -0.19), and non-English language learners (d = -0.10) in the second year of the study. Thus, relative to the "business-as-usual" reading curricula, no positive overall impacts of OCR and mixed impacts for student subgroups were found.

AB  - In this critical review of literature, we summarize the major theoretical frameworks that have been used to study teacher mobility. In total we identified 40 teacher mobility studies that met our inclusion criteria. We conclude that relatively few theoretical frameworks have been used to study teacher mobility and those that have been used are lacking in several key areas. Specifically, none of the current teacher mobility theories are able to adequately account for the many teacher- and school-level factors that likely influence teachers' professional decisions. Finally, we suggest a theoretical framework from the organizational psychology literature that can address the shortcomings of theories identified in this review.

AB  - In Finland, a three-tiered support model was introduced in 2007, emphasising early intervention and preventative multiprofessional student welfare. Nationally representative principal data were used in analysing how the availability of student welfare personnel and the regularity of multiprofessional team meetings influence principals’ experiences about the functioning of multiprofessional collaboration in learning-related issues in different parts of Finland. The regularity of the student welfare team meetings increased principals’ satisfaction in multiprofessional collaboration especially in geographical areas with a limited availability of services. Reaching the goals of early intervention was explained by the reactivity of the multiprofessional team. It was concluded that principals’ expectations are influenced by the availability of services. The qualitative aspects of the work receive a greater emphasis first when the basic structures are at a satisfactory level.

AB  - This article reports on research that investigated the images of social workers engaged in child welfare work as portrayed in movies, a major medium of popular culture. Findings from an analysis of 27 movies spanning from 1938 to 1999 are presented with particular attention to themes about how children are depicted as recipients of child welfare services and how child welfare worker activities and interventions are portrayed. Ways that the results of the research can guide intervention efforts that more accurately and more completely portray the activities, values, and knowledge base of the profession of social work are suggested.

AB  - The primary purpose of this study was to ascertain the impact of an intense cultural classroom experience combined with a cross-cultural service-learning intervention experience on the cultural attitudes of teacher candidates. The research focused specifically on the study of the Lakota culture both currently and in the historical context and then quantitatively measured and qualitatively described the cultural intervention and immersion of 13 teacher candidates; each intensely studied Lakota culture in classrooms and community-service learning agencies on a Lakota Indian Reservation. The research revealed a significant impact on the cultural attitudes of teacher candidates. The findings indicated that an intense cultural classroom study combined with a holistic cross-cultural community-service learning intervention and classroom field experience can help develop cultural attitudes in teacher candidates. The quantitative data indicated a significant difference from Phase 1 to Phase 2 and from Phase 1 to Phase 3 and an increase, although not significant, from Phase 2 to Phase 3. Qualitative findings indicated that participants looked deeply at themselves to understand differing worldviews, internalized the experience, and believed that it would impact their future teaching. Recommendations include designing similar learning opportunities and providing appropriate support while challenging teacher candidates to develop the cultural attitudes necessary to advocate for all learners in their future classrooms.

AB  - The article discusses the importance among professionals to determine disguised compliance in the children's carer. The author notes that disguised compliance is a behaviour involving parental responsibility that fails to admit their lack of commitment and becoming clever in diverting away attention. The author suggests that social workers must be sceptical on excuses and explanations of these carers to ensure the safety of the children and avoid maltreatment.

AB  - Gestures are a natural form of communication between preverbal children and parents which support children's social and language development; however, low-income parents gesture less frequently, disadvantaging their children. In addition to pointing and waving, children are capable of learning many symbolic gestures, known as ``infant signs,{''} if modeled by adults. The practice of signing with infants is increasingly popular in middle-income populations around the world, but has not been examined as an intervention to promote positive qualities of the parent-child relationship. This study tested whether an infant sign intervention (ISI) encouraging low-income parents to use symbolic gestures could enhance the parent-child relationship. A final sample of twenty-nine toddlers and their families were followed for 7 months after assignment to the ISI or a control group. Children and mothers in ISI group families used more symbolic gestures than those in control families. Mothers' in the ISI group were more attuned to changes in children's affect and more responsive to children's distress cues. Mothers in the intervention group also viewed their children more positively, reducing parenting-related stress. This study provides evidence that a simple infant sign intervention is an effective tool to promote bidirectional communication and positive interactions for preverbal children and their parents.

AB  - Schools play a vital role in inculcation of values and development of values. It has become, of late, the central concern of teacher education. Teacher education programmes are the effective modes of transmission of values having a direct impact on the school education. A College of Teacher Education was established at Badrachalam exclusively for tribal population in the State of Telangana under Integral Tribal Development Authority (ITDA). In this institution only tribes of different communities are given the opportunity of pursuing B.Ed. Programme. Tribal habitat, culture and living styles are different because they live in deep forest in hamlets away from the mainstream of the society and their value system needs attention for their emancipation in social development. In this article, the value system and value preferences of tribal future teachers of the B. Ed. Programme are discussed to provide guidelines for curricular interventions for quality tribal teacher education.

AB  - Background Social relationships can serve as important risk or protective factors for child development in general, and academic adjustment in particular. Aims This study investigated the role of teacher-child interactions in academic adjustment among preschool boys at risk of externalizing behaviour, using a randomized controlled trial study with Playing-2-gether (P2G), a 12-week indicated two-component intervention aimed at improving the affective quality of the teacher-child relationship and teacher behaviour management. Sample In a sample of 175 preschool boys showing signs of externalizing behaviour ( M age = 4 years, 9 months, SD age = 7 months) and their teachers, we investigated P2G effects on academic engagement as well as on language achievement. Methods Academic engagement was rated by teachers at three occasions within one school year (T1 = pretest, T3 = post-test, and T2 = in-between intervention components). Language achievement was assessed by researchers at pre- and post-test, using a standardized test. Results Cross-lagged path analyses revealed a direct intervention effect of P2G on academic engagement at Time 2. In addition, a significant indirect intervention effect was found on academic engagement at Time 3 through academic engagement at Time 2. Finally, academic engagement at Time 2 was found to predict language achievement at post-test. A marginally significant indirect intervention effect was found on language achievement at Time 3, through academic engagement at Time 2. Conclusions This intervention study suggests that teacher-child interactions predict academic engagement over time, which in turn improves language achievement among preschool boys at risk of externalizing behaviour.

AB  - School is an ideal setting to promote and increase physical activity (PA) in children. However, implementation of school-based PA programmes seems difficult, in particular due to schools' focus on academic performance and a lack of involvement of school staff in program development. The potential cognitive and academic benefits of PA might increase chances of successful implementation. Therefore, the aim of this qualitative study was: (1) to explore the perceptions of teachers and principals with regard to implementation of additional PA aimed at improving cognitive and academic performance, and (2) to identify characteristics of PA programmes that according to them are feasible in daily school practice. Twenty-six face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted with primary school teachers (grades 5 and 6) and principals in The Netherlands, and analysed using inductive content analysis. Teachers and principals expressed their willingness to implement additional PA if it benefits learning. Time constraints appeared to be a major barrier, and strongly influenced participants' perceptions of feasible PA programmes. Teachers and principals emphasised that additional PA needs to be short, executed in the classroom, and provided in ``ready-to-use{''} materials, i.e., that require no or little preparation time (e.g., a movie clip). Future research is needed to strengthen the evidence on the effects of PA for academic purposes, and should examine the forms of PA that are both effective as well as feasible in the school setting.

AB  - Inclusive education has brought new challenges for teachers, including the search for a suitable place in the classroom for children with externalizing problems. In the current study, we examined whether a careful rearrangement of the classroom seats could promote social acceptance and more prosocial behaviors for children with externalizing problems, and limit the potential negative consequences for classmates sitting next to them. The sample of this randomized controlled trial consisted of 64 classrooms with 221 fourth- to sixth-grade children selected by their teachers because of elevated levels of externalizing behavior. Results showed that over time children with externalizing behavior were better liked by their seatmates and showed fewer externalizing problems according to the teacher. This was particularly the case when students sat next to a well-liked and prosocial buddy, or when they were initially disliked. Classmates who sat next to a child with externalizing problems did not become more aggressive or less prosocial over time. Yet their social status did decrease slightly over time as a result of the rearrangement. We discuss implications and future directions for research on classroom seating arrangements to support children with externalizing problems.

AB  - Background: The police are considered frontline professionals in managing individuals experiencing mental health crises. This study examines the extent to which these individuals are disconnected from mental health services, and whether the police response has an influence on re-establishing contact.Methods: Police records were searched for calls regarding individuals with acute mental health needs and police handling of these calls. Mental healthcare contact data were retrieved from a Psychiatric Case Register. Results: The police were called upon for mental health crisis situations 492 times within the study year, involving 336 individuals (i.e. 1.7 per 1000 inhabitants per year). Half of these individuals (N=162) were disengaged from mental health services, lacking regular care contact in the year prior to the crisis (apart from contact for crisis intervention). In the month following the crisis, 21% of those who were previously disengaged from services had regular care contact, and this was more frequent (49%) if the police had contacted the mental health services during the crisis. The influence of police referral to the services was still present the following year. However, for the majority (58%) of disengaged individuals police did not contact the mental health services at the time of crisis. Conclusions: The police deal with a substantial number of individuals experiencing a mental health crisis, half of whom are out of contact with mental health services, and police play an important role in linking these individuals to services. Training police officers to recognise and handle mental health crises, and implementing practical models of cooperation between the police and mental health services in dealing with such crises may further improve police referral of individuals disengaged from mental health services.

AB  - The effects on child engagement of adult use of systematic, naturalistic instructional strategies within an embedded instruction context were examined. Following baseline observations of two children with disabilities and same-age classmates without disabilities, three different instructional strategies were implemented with each child with a disability and one child without disabilities using an alternating treatments design. Results indicated that levels of engagement for the three target children during baseline (embedded instruction only) were low. Engagement was higher (and approximated levels of same-class peers without disabilities) for two of three systematic instructional conditions designed to increase the probability of responding by ensuring complete learning trials. Described are implications related to the need to use systematic, naturalistic instructional strategies in embedded instruction contexts and the potential use of engagement as an indicator of response opportunities.

AB  - Few physical educators engage in formal assessment of student learning outcomes. Recent trends in high-stakes teacher evaluation make formal assessment of learning progress/outcomes by physical educators a teaching function, central to a "well-rounded education" through recent federal legislation. This project targeted the following research questions: (a) Can physical educators increase their use of formal-formative assessment of student learning outcomes as a consequence of a professional development intervention that includes on-site coaching support? and (b) Can physical educators reliably collect formal-formative assessment data on student learning? Seven (4 females, 3 males; experience range: 4-15 years) licensed secondary school physical education teachers volunteered as participants. The intervention included professional development (PD) workshops, ongoing on-site coaching support, and prompting. A multiple baseline design (MBD) across subjects determined the efficacy of the intervention on teachers' use of formal-formative assessment practices. Postcheck follow-up observations were made during the following school year. Data were collected via the validated Systematic Observation of Formal Assessment of Students by Teachers (SOFAST). The reliability of teachers' use of formal assessment was established with a second trained observer simultaneously collecting identical data on the same aspects of student performance as the teacher. Data were plotted graphically across sessions and assessed with standard visual analysis criteria, which demonstrated the functional relationship between the intervention and teachers' use of formal-formative assessment of student outcomes. Standard interobserver agreement calculations determined the reliability of the teachers' assessments of students' MVPA levels versus outside observers' via the total interval method. All seven teachers increased their use of formal assessment of student performance and shifted focus of the assessment toward subject-matter performance. Their formal assessment observations were found to be reliable. Experienced secondary school physical education teachers can successfully and reliably employ formal-formative assessment of student performance outcomes.

AB  - Research into the effects of interventions on teacher efficacy is scarce. In this study, the long-term effects of an intensive data-based decision making intervention on teacher efficacy of mainly grade 4 teachers were investigated by means of a delayed treatment control group design (62 teachers). The findings showed significant strong intervention effects on teachers' efficacy for instructional strategies, and student engagement in both treatment groups. No significant effects were found for teacher efficacy regarding classroom management. Improved teacher efficacy in the first treatment group persisted throughout the second school year. Suggestions for future research are presented. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Data-based decision making (DBDM) is an important element of educational policy in many countries, as it is assumed that student achievement will improve if teachers worked in a data-based way. However, studies that evaluate rigorously the effects of DBDM on student achievement are scarce. In this study, the effects of an intensive DBDM-intervention for Grade 4 teachers on students' mathematical achievement were investigated in a randomized controlled trial. Multilevel analyses showed that although no main effect on students' mathematical achievements was found, students who received "extended instruction" benefited significantly from the intervention. Based on the results, recommendations for the design of new DBDM-interventions and for their evaluation are presented.

AB  - Dynamic Assessment (DA) has received a considerable amount of attention in the educational sciences and beyond. DA combines instruction or feedback with assessment or testing within a single activity. DA has great potential for classroom practices, but has not been implemented in many classrooms yet. In this article, we argue that teacher educators play an important role in implementing DA in classrooms. We describe a specific instrument that can be used for dynamically assessing children's vocabulary development in primary school classrooms. We give examples and present some preliminary results of the implementation of this DA instrument based on experiences in primary education schools in the Netherlands. Furthermore, we use the notion of a trialogical learning process to highlight that the collaboration and interaction between teachers and teacher educators are mediated through tools (i.e., DA instruments and materials) that are further developed and may in the end lead to changes in teaching and assessment practices.

AB  - Academic learning has always been a serious issue for students with emotional and behavioural disorders (EBD) and their teachers. However, teaching academic skills could be an important protective and curative factor for the problem behaviour of these students. The current review was conducted to study the effect of interventions developed to teach academic skills, on the behaviour of students with EBD. Thirty studies were included in this analysis, which was undertaken between 2000 and 2012. The studies which varied considerably in terms of design and implementation did not present a conclusive answer, indicating that systematic research on the effect of teaching academic skills on the behaviour of students with EBD is still in its infancy. However, the combination of findings in this review provides some support for the conceptual premise that teachers, confronted with problem behaviour, would do well to reconsider their curriculum instead of focusing only on the behaviour of these students. More systematic research is necessary to verify if teaching academic skills could be a key approach to reducing both behavioural problems as well as increasing the academic progress of students with EBD.

AB  - Teaching mathematics to diverse learners can be a challenge. The extensive and specialized knowledge that special education teachers need to possess to be considered high-quality teachers is often lacking in preservice and inservice education, yet is mandated by current teacher reforms and rigorous measures of accountability. To provide direction for supporting teacher growth in these areas, this article highlights four knowledge bases that special education teachers should develop and expand upon as a way to improve their instruction for diverse learners in mathematics. Numerous resources and materials are provided to support the development of teacher expertise in content, characteristics of diverse learners, technology, and pedagogy.

AB  - In this pilot study, we examine the suitability of materials for a vocabulary intervention designed to influence the amount of complex syntax teachers use in at-risk preschool classrooms. Six Head Start classrooms were assigned to one of two vocabulary interventions: a condition using cognitive verbs, which are biased toward complex syntax (e.g. pretend), or a control condition using action verbs, which are biased towards simple sentences (e.g. identify). Consistent with our hypotheses, teachers in the cognitive verb condition used higher rates of complex syntax than those in the action verb condition while our materials were in use. Teacher acceptability and use data indicate that verb characteristics affect frequency of use and perceived benefit of intervention materials. Implications for the development of interventions targeting complex syntax use in at-risk children are discussed, including factors likely to support fidelity of implementation in the classroom.

AB  - This literature review summarises the growing body of literature discussing teacher identities of university teachers. The aim was to understand what strengthens or constrains the development of a teacher identity. A qualitative synthesis of 59 studies was carried out. The review showed that several factors contribute to the development of teacher identity. While contact with students and staff development programmes were experienced as strengthening teacher identity, the wider context of higher education was experienced as having a constraining effect. Furthermore, the impact of the direct work environment was experienced as either strengthening or constraining, depending on whether or not teaching is valued in the department. Five psychological processes were found to be involved in the development of a teacher identity: a sense of appreciation, a sense of connectedness, a sense of competence, a sense of commitment, and imagining a future career trajectory. The findings suggest that developing a teacher identity in the higher education context is not a smooth process. In order to empower university teachers, it is important to reward teaching excellence and build community. Staff development activities can play a role in helping teachers to develop strategies for gaining confidence and taking active control of their work situation, both individually and collectively. The authors argue that more attention should be paid to the implicit messages that departments convey to their teaching faculty.

AB  - Computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) environments facilitate collaboration between students. There is a growing interest in studying the role of the teacher during CSCL. This study aims to contribute to the conceptualization of teacher interventions during CSCL. A teacher and his class worked in a CSCL environment for 8 lessons. Focus and means of teacher interventions were analyzed across these 8 time points. The results show that the teacher's behavior varied greatly between lessons and also between groups, which contradicts research that has aggregated teacher behavior to types or teaching styles. Findings consistent across time points include the predominance of the teacher's focus on students' cognitive rather than social activities, and a higher number of interventions in groups where student activity was higher. Suggestions are made for future research, which include studying the effectiveness of supporting tools for teachers. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A population-based, randomized universal classroom intervention trial for the prevention of disruptive behavior (i.e., attention-deficit/hyperactivity problems, oppositional defiant problems, and conduct problems) is described. Impact on developmental trajectories in young elementary schoolchildren was studied. Three trajectories were identified in children with high, intermediate, or low levels of problems on all 3 disruptive behaviors at baseline. The intervention had a positive impact on the development of all disruptive behavior problems in children with intermediate levels of these problems at baseline. Effect sizes of mean difference at outcome were medium or small. In children with the highest levels of disruptive behavior at baseline, a positive impact of the intervention was found for conduct problems.

AB  - Teachers who engage primary school students in informal statistical inference (ISI) must themselves have good content knowledge of ISI (ISI-CK). However, little is known about how college education for pre-service teachers can contribute to the development of their ISI-CK. To address this shortcoming, we used a case study to investigate ISI-CK development in a class of 21 pre-service primary school teachers who participated in a short intervention (180 min). Based on qualitative and quantitative analyses of the pretest, posttest and intervention data, the results suggest that most participants acknowledged it is possible to make uncertain inferences. An assignment to search the media for inferential claims seemed to create awareness regarding inference and the need to distinguish between a sample and a population. A simulation involving random sampling and varied sample size probably increased the participants’ knowledge of sampling variability and random sampling. No development was seen in the participants’ knowledge about sufficient sample sizes. The statistical investigation conducted by the participants during a model lesson may have strengthened their awareness of ISI, but it also revealed that many participants continued to favour distributed sampling over random sampling. Further research on belief formation with regard to data as evidence, sampling methods and the expression of uncertainty in the context of ISI is needed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - There is a growing concern that adults who supervise children’s play may restrict opportunities for children to engage in risky activities. Risk-benefit assessment is commonly advocated as a way of allowing children to take managed risks within settings. However ‘risk-benefit’ adopts a limited strategy of convincing professionals of the developmental benefits of risk, disregarding other factors which may also influence professionals when making risk assessments in their settings. This paper proposes an alternative approach to supporting practitioners in allowing risk by exploring the complexity of these influencing factors. A narrative literature review identifies five inter-related factors which affect professionals’ attitudes to risk. The relationships between these factors are discussed and presented as a model which illustrates the complexity faced by practitioners when carrying out risk assessments. The authors argue that children’s opportunities to benefit from risk in play may increase if these influencing factors could be explored within professional development.

AB  - Background: Violence in families affects children. Exposure to violence is seen as child abuse. Figures show that about one third of children exposed to violence become victim or perpetrator in their adult life: known as intergenerational transmission. Violence also affects sexual and reproductive health. To prevent problems in adult life, children need help and support. However, while trying to protect their parents, children often do not seek help, or perceive the threshold as too high. Since almost all children of the current generation have access to the internet, an online intervention will make help better available for this target group. In 2011, an internet-based self-support method for children, adolescents and young adults exposed to family violence was developed in the Netherlands: ``Feel the ViBe{''}. The intervention was developed in close collaboration with the target group. This article describes the protocol of the RCT to study the effectiveness of this intervention. Methods/design: This study is a randomized controlled trial using the method of minimization to randomize the participants in two parallel groups with a 1:1 allocation ratio, being an intervention group, having access to ``Feel the ViBe{''} and usual care (UC), and a control group, having access to minimally enhanced usual care (mEUC) followed by access to the intervention after twelve weeks. Outcomes are measured with questionnaires on PTSD symptoms, mental health and sexual and reproductive health. Routine Outcome Measurement (ROM) will be used to measure a direct effect of participating in the intervention. Data from a web evaluation questionnaire (WEQ), user statistics and qualitative analysis of online data will be used to support the findings. To compare results Cohen's d effect sizes will be used. Discussion: A RCT and process evaluation will test effectiveness and provide information of how the effects can be explained, how the intervention meets the expectation of participants and which possible barriers and facilitators for implementation exist. A qualitative analysis of the data will add information to interpret the quantitative data. This makes ``Feel the ViBe{''} unique in its field.

AB  - There are major inter-individual differences in the school achievements of students aged 8-12. The determinants of these differences are not known. This paper investigates two possible factors: the self-regulation of the student and the educational levels obtained by their parents. The study first investigates whether children with high and low academic achievement differ in their self-regulation. It then evaluates whether there are differences in the self-regulation of children with high and moderate-to-low level of parental education (LPE). The focus was on the self-regulation of students as judged by their teacher. Teacher evaluations were assessed using an observer questionnaire: the Amsterdam Executive Functioning Inventory. Results showed that students with low school achievement had substantially lower teacher-perceived self-regulation than children with high school achievement. Furthermore, teacher-perceived self-regulation was lower for children with moderate-to-low LPE than for children with high LPE. The findings suggest that interventions on the domain of self-regulation skills should be developed and used, particularly in students at risk of poor school achievement.

AB  - The present study was aimed at investigating the effects of a video feedback coaching intervention for upper-grade primary school teachers on students' cognitive gains in scientific knowledge. This teaching intervention was designed with the use of inquiry-based learning principles for teachers, such as the empirical cycle and the posing of thought-provoking questions. The intervention was put into practice in 10 upper-grade classrooms. The trajectory comprised four lessons, complemented with two premeasures and two postmeasures. The control condition consisted of 11 upper-grade teachers and their students. The success of the intervention was tested using an established standardized achievement test and situated measures. In this way, by means of premeasure and postmeasure questionnaires and video data, an assessment could be made of the change in students' scientific knowledge before, during, and after the intervention. In this study, we primarily focused on the dynamics of students' real-time expressions of scientific knowledge in the classroom. Important indicators of the effect of the intervention were found. Through focusing on the number of explanations and predictions, a significant increase could be seen in the proportion of students' utterances displaying scientific understanding in the intervention condition. In addition, students in the intervention condition more often reasoned on higher complexity levels than students in the control condition. No effect was found for students' scientific knowledge as measured with a standardized achievement test. Implications for future studies are stressed, as well as the importance of enriching the evaluation of intervention studies by focusing on dynamics in the classroom.

AB  - Background: Reintegration into school is a decisive time for children who have been absent from school due to health problems, such as survivors of brain tumours and other types of acquired brain injury or cancer in childhood. Parents, school staff and healthcare providers are important stakeholders during this phase of transition. Objective: To study the perspectives of parents, school personnel and healthcare providers on communication and collaboration following the child’s return to school, to gain insight into their experiences, and to develop recommendations for each stakeholder. Method: We reviewed the literature on school reintegration in accordance with the configurative approach for research synthesis. Search and selection processes ended in 22 articles published between January 2000 and September 2015, consisting of quantitative, qualitative or mixed methods research. Data analysis resulted in themes with emphasis on communication and collaboration. Results: Knowledge about the child’s condition, education and support are the main topics of consultation between parents, school personnel and healthcare providers. Based on their experiences, practices of communication and collaboration are variable and mostly inadequate. They report clear and complementary needs and expectations on how to effectively work together. Especially the need for a school liaison as connection between family, education and healthcare is commonly discussed. Conclusion: The often suboptimal communication and collaboration between parents, school personnel and healthcare providers needs more coordination and consistency, starting from the child’s return to school. In addition, all stakeholders should be aware of related factors that facilitate or hinder the child’s reintegration process. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This longitudinal study examines the teacher-perceived effect of a school-based intervention (i.e. Playing-2-gether) targeting teacher-child interactions to reduce externalising problem behaviour (EPB) amongst preschoolers. Boys with the highest score for EPB in the classroom and their teacher participated in the study. Teacher-child dyads (N=175) from 46 schools were randomly assigned to an intervention or a control (i.e. education as usual) condition. Teacher-rated questionnaires were collected before, during and after the implementation of the intervention. The results of latent growth modelling indicated that intervention boys, compared with control boys, showed a larger decrease in EPB.

AB  - The school-based Playing-2-gether is a 12-week intervention with two components aimed at decreasing child externalizing behavior through improving teacher-child interactions. The first component is rooted in attachment theory and aimed at enhancing teacher-child relationship quality, and the second is based on learning theory and aimed at improving teachers' behavior management. In this three-wave randomized study, effects of Playing-2-gether on the teacher-child relationship quality and on teacher-rated child behavioral adjustment were investigated. To this aim, 175 dyads consisting of male preschoolers with relatively high levels of externalizing problem behavior and their teachers were randomly assigned to Playing-2-gether (n=89) or an education-as-usual control condition (n=86). Teacher-rated questionnaires were collected at pre-test, after the first intervention component, and at post-test. At post-test, the intervention group showed a larger decrease in teacher-child conflict, child conduct problems, and child hyperactivity/inattention. Supplementary analyses showed that all positive effects were already visible after the first intervention component and that teacher-child conflict, child conduct problems and hyperactivity/inattention did not further reduce during the second component. In addition, an increase in closeness was found following the first component, but subsequently disappeared at post-test.

AB  - Executive functions (EFs), important cognitive processes that enable goal-directed behavior, develop due to maturation and environmental stimulation. The current study systematically reviews and synthesizes evidence on the association between teacher-student interactions and EFs. The search resulted in 28 studies, from which 23 studies provided sufficient data to be included in the calculations. Overall effect sizes indicate that teacher-child interactions are related to general executive functioning, working memory, and inhibition but not cognitive flexibility. Relationships were stronger for studies including children at the beginning of elementary school, studies with higher socioeconomic status participants and more boys, and studies measuring teacher-child interactions at the dyadic level. This study shows that qualitative teacher-child interactions are important for performance in EFs in children. This suggests that teachers can promote the cognitive processes that are essential in children's learning by changing their behavior to create an emotionally positive, structured, and cognitively stimulating classroom environment.

AB  - Working memory is important for a variety of life domains,. including for children's school functioning. As such, it is crucial to understand its development, antecedents and consequences. The current study investigates the development of different working memory components (phonological loop, visuospatial sketchpad, central executive), the influence of different aspects of the teacher-student relationship (closeness, conflict, dependency) and its predictive value for academic achievement (reading, spelling, mathematics) across the transition from kindergarten to first grade. The sample consisted of 107 kindergarten children. Working memory tasks were administered at the end of kindergarten and first grade. Teachers reported on teacher-student relationship quality in the middle of first grade. Standardized tests were used to assess academic achievement at the end of first grade. Results indicate moderate to large increases in the phonological loop and visuospatial sketchpad and large gains in the central executive. Dependency of the student towards the teacher significantly predicted visuospatial sketchpad performance at the end of first grade. Reading was significantly predicted by the visuospatial sketchpad and phonological loop in kindergarten, while for spelling the visuospatial sketchpad was important. Finally, mathematics was predicted by performance on the phonological loop and the visuospatial sketchpad. The current study indicates the importance of the affective quality of the teacher-student relationship for working memory performance, which in turn is important for academic achievement. It is therefore critical to attend to the early detection and prevention or intervention of working memory problems in the classroom in order to prevent future academic problems. Additionally, maintaining a positive relationship with students and encouraging their independent exploration may be important when preventing such problems, complementary to cognitive or other types of training and intervention.

AB  - This paper presents a systematic review on teacher collaboration. In total, 82 studies were selected based on predefined selection criteria and reviewed by means of a narrative review method to thematically gather information across the studies. The first aim of this review was to provide an overview of the terminological framework to describe teacher collaboration used in previous research. Collaboration was perceived here as a continuum ranging from mere aggregates of individuals to strong team collaboration. This continuum was conceptualised as the degree of team entitativity. Second, the review investigated the focus and depth of collaboration. These appeared to be important issues and provide different opportunities for (collaborative) learning. Third, although realising teacher collaboration proves to be challenging, this review listed benefits for students, teachers, and the school. Fourth and fifth, various facilitating and hindering factors were explored that may serve as valuable points of action to realise effective collaboration. The latter has vital importance for the future as it is needed to build schools into learning organisations, to anticipate the growing importance of collaboration in society and to use education as a role model for students to properly prepare them for the future.

AB  - Complex issues such as bullying have brought to light the importance of expanding school prevention efforts to include interventions focused on multiple levels of practice. Utilizing data gathered from middle-school teachers across the state of Michigan, this study examines how both individual and organizational characteristics influence teacher interventions in bullying situations. The study found that teachers' beliefs about the perceived seriousness of the bullying situation, teachers' level of sympathy/empathy toward the students being bullied, and teachers' ages consistently contributed to their reported likelihood of interventions in bullying situations. Surprisingly, the majority of organizational-level characteristics were not significant predictors of teachers' reported likelihood of intervention. The findings align with many of the seminal theories of bystander intervention and suggest that school professionals should focus on programs and policies that educate teachers on both the serious consequences of bullying and on factors that promote empathy toward bullied students.

AB  - Today it is not uncommon to see disabled people attend universities. These include in particular mobility impaired people and blind people, but they are not the only ones, as other impairments can for example be hidden under the �normality� of other students, teachers and administrative staff at universities. As a university teacher it became obvious to me that there were no blind students at the School of Informatics at Universidad Nacional UNA in Costa Rica. This is surprising as this school has some of the university�s most attractive programmes. I learned that most of the blind people who were enrolled in UNA attended education careers programmes or philosophy. So I asked myself: Why are blind people not interested in studying informatics? Then I learned about a blind student who was interested in enrolling in the system engineering career programme a few years ago, but she quit from her initiative to do so. It was at that moment that I shifted my focus from trying to understand why blind students were not interested in informatics and started to question whether the School of Informatics was prepared to receive blind students. As I was a teacher in this school I could start by asking myself this question. I had no idea whether blind students could study computer sciences, how I could interact with them, and what they would expect and require from me. I asked other teachers in the school, but they were equally unable to answer my questions, and this led me to conclude that the answer to the first question was no: we were not prepared to receive blind students. This is what this thesis is about: how the School of Informatics can prepare itself to receive blind students. There are multiple objectives for approaching this question. It was fundamental for me to learn about blindness from the point of view of social construction, from the formal perspectives of people, researchers and advocates who deal with blindness. I wanted to learn about the tools they use, how the educational environment acts and reacts to blind students and, most importantly, how blind students cope with tertiary education. A literature review on blindness, a representative tool for blind people, Wenger�s social theory of learning as a theoretical framework and my empirical study of first-hand experiences; these elements support each other in my work to define a solid framework for understanding the phenomenon of blindness in higher educational environments. The empirical study was inspired by ethnography, grasping three blind students� experiences in tertiary education in order to illustrate their perceptions of the surrounding world and clarify the situations they have to face every day as well as their relation to the educational environments. They also provide rich feedback about the role these educational environments and other supporting institutions play in their studies and their future incorporation in the work force. On the basis of this framework we can identify the continuities and discontinuities in educational environments in the inclusion process. The research has showed the significance of their participation in the educational context for their learning processes and professional futures. The research proposes a repertoire to define: ??A general and pragmatic categorisation of blindness: blind people who rely on Braille to read and write, and partially sighted people who can read printed material with the use of magnifiers or other supportive tools. ??The social construction of blindness, drawing on four different models: the charity model, the medical model, the rights-based model and the economic model. ??A classification of different perspectives according the contributions of people who working towards inclusion. The four perspectives are: the medical perspective, the adaptive perspective, the integrative perspective and the inclusive perspective. ??A classification to determine the progress of institutional inclusion processes, defined by three levels: the entry level, the level of getting into inclusion level and the desired level of inclusion. Under these classifications it was determined that the educational environments related to the fieldwork were at the entry level, and the initiatives in those contexts were related to the adaptive perspective. Furthermore, it was established that some parts of the educational environments needing to concentrate on ensuring better conditions for blind students. To generate sustainable solutions, knowledge of blindness in the educational context must be improved, and I would argue that it is mandatory to include research in this process. With this knowledge, then, it is needs to design for inclusion, designing for the majority of students� necessities, not for particular populations. This design should eventually generate a single practice, as different practices converge, each defined by the variety of student practices. As a strategy universities should incorporate inclusion topics in the curricula to teach their students about their responsibility to establish inclusion in their future work. This strategy is discussed as an efficient tool for improving the understanding of blindness and for easing the negotiability of practices between different populations. Therefore, this strategy contributes to the inclusion of blind students in these educational environments. Specialised offices in each university will benefit the incorporation of policies, knowledge and understanding in the educational context to ease the inclusion process. Also, these offices should be the natural facilitators introducing the strategies to achieve the desired level of inclusion. As part of the fieldwork a workshop series was used to gather information, but it is also presented as an introductory tool for initiating inclusion processes. The discussion of tools was divided into two: a discussion from the point of view of the tools offered in the market and a discussion from the point of view of tools required for studying computer sciences. Some of these tools are available, but can only be implemented if teachers and students receive training in using them, others are already in use by students, and still others are waiting to be developed. Identity issues require special attention. A conclusion is that it is fundamental for blind students to have a strong blind identity to negotiate their practices and that these practices are not subjugated to the dominion of the dominant practice. Finally, this thesis will contain more questions than answers, but the questions are the detonators that improve a process that probably started a long time ago, but needs to be reoriented to be more effective and efficient in ensuring equal opportunities for blind and sighted students, particularly in connection with system engineering or other computer science-related career programmes.

AB  - Background: The development of intelligent, thinking performers as a central theme in physical education curriculum documents worldwide has highlighted the need for an evolution of teaching styles from the dominant reproductive approach. This has prompted an Australian university to change the content and delivery of a games unit within their physical education teacher education (PETE) course and adopt a productive student-centred approach that is compatible with current curriculum directives. The significance of prospective physical educators' biographies on their receptiveness to this pedagogical innovation was studied. Purpose: To investigate whether past school and sporting experiences are powerful influences on Australian PETE recruits' initial perspectives about effective physical education teaching practice and their receptiveness to an alternative pedagogical approach. Participants and setting: A total of 49 first year pre-service PETE students volunteered to take part in the study and were grouped according to their highest level of representation in games, either school/club, regional, or state/national. Students experienced the constraints-led approach during an eight-week games unit informed by nonlinear pedagogy and underpinned by motor learning theory. Data collection and Analysis: Prior to the commencement of the unit, participants completed a mixed response questionnaire aimed at gathering data about their physical education and sporting background. The data were summarised using descriptive statistics. Before and after taking part in the games unit, participants also completed a questionnaire, responding with their opinion of the importance of each sub-component of the traditional, reproductive style for an effective games teaching session. This resulted in a "traditional reproductive games teaching" belief score. For each sub-component, participants were invited to respond in more detail to justify their opinions. A one-way between-groups analysis of variance, Tukey's HSD Post Hoc Test and a two-tailed, paired-samples t-test were used to analyse the quantitative data. Content analysis was used to analyse the qualitative data. Findings: The traditional, reproductive approach was the most frequently reported teaching approach used by the physical education teachers and sports coaches of participants in all groups. Prior to the commencement of the alternative games unit, participants in each representative level group held very strong beliefs in this reproductive approach, responding that an effective games teaching session should consist of a visual demonstration of the "ideal" performance model, repetitive practice of the model using isolated drills with corrective feedback by the teacher, before the playing of the actual game. After experiencing the alternative games unit, there were statistically significant differences in the traditional reproductive games teaching belief mean scores for each group. This combined with participants' qualitative responses indicated receptiveness to the alternative pedagogy. Conclusions: The results of this present study show that, contrary to the mixed success found in previous research undertaken in North America, in Australia, we found strong evidence to show that it is possible for PETE educators to change beliefs in order to overcome the constraint of acculturation. Participation in the alternative games unit provided PETE students with the knowledge, understanding and belief in an alternative approach to teaching games compatible with curriculum documents.

AB  - Primary health care workers (HCWs) in low-and middle-income settings (LMIC) often work in challenging conditions in remote, rural areas, in isolation from the rest of the health system and particularly specialist care. Much attention has been given to implementation of interventions to support quality and performance improvement for workers in such settings. However, little is known about the design of such initiatives and which approaches predominate, let alone those that are most effective. We aimed for a broad understanding of what distinguishes different approaches to primary HCW support and performance improvement and to clarify the existing evidence as well as gaps in evidence in order to inform decision-making and design of programs intended to support and improve the performance of health workers in these settings. We systematically searched the literature for articles addressing this topic, and undertook a comparative review to document the principal approaches to performance and quality improvement for primary HCWs in LMIC settings. We identified 40 eligible papers reporting on interventions that we categorized into five different approaches: (1) supervision and supportive supervision; (2) mentoring; (3) tools and aids; (4) quality improvement methods, and (5) coaching. The variety of study designs and quality/performance indicators precluded a formal quantitative data synthesis. The most extensive literature was on supervision, but there was little clarity on what defines the most effective approach to the supervision activities themselves, let alone the design and implementation of supervision programs. The mentoring literature was limited, and largely focused on clinical skills building and educational strategies. Further research on how best to incorporate mentorship into pre-service clinical training, while maintaining its function within the routine health system, is needed. There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about coaching in this setting, however a review of the corporate and the business school literature is warranted to identify transferrable approaches. A substantial literature exists on tools, but significant variation in approaches makes comparison challenging. We found examples of effective individual projects and designs in specific settings, but there was a lack of comparative research on tools across approaches or across settings, and no systematic analysis within specific approaches to provide evidence with clear generalizability. Future research should prioritize comparative intervention trials to establish clear global standards for performance and quality improvement initiatives. Such standards will be critical to creating and sustaining a well-functioning health workforce and for global initiatives such as universal health coverage.

AB  - The goal of the study was to investigate the outcomes of an intervention programme regarding social interaction of four pupils with intellectual disabilities with their typically developing peers. The programme aimed at enhancing social inclusion of pupils with intellectual disabilities and consisted in (1) the implementation of structured activities designed to promote emotion regulation and appropriate expression, self-confidence and cooperation, and (2) participation of the target pupils in social activities in the neighbourhood, with the active involvement of school staff members. Data were collected by means of observations, teachers' reflective journals and semi-structured interviews with the school staff members and the pupils themselves. Findings revealed significant increases in target pupils' social interactions with their peers inside and outside the school setting, as well as positive changes in general education pupils' attitudes, both during and upon the completion of the programme. Factors which contributed to the above-mentioned changes are discussed in relation to the implications of the study.

AB  - Tested the effects of classroom instruction on improvement in the proportional, probabilistic and correlational reasoning skills of 103 18–42 yr old undergraduate education majors. After receiving specifically planned instruction, students in the experimental group showed improvement in all 3 areas of reasoning. Also, students with science and/or math in their backgrounds performed significantly better in all 3 areas of reasoning on both pre- and post-tests than did students with no science or math background. This study is seen as among the first to show that background knowledge obtained from college level science and math courses correlates with better reasoning skills. Data from this study also demonstrated that interventions focusing on probability and proportionality improved the correlational reasoning skills of students. These results indicate that deficiencies in reasoning abilities in the areas of proportionality, probability, and correlational reasoning can be successfully addressed even with limited classroom intervention.

AB  - This study examined the efficacy of using different types of mobile media apps to increase the receptive and expressive vocabulary development of 3-, 4-, and 5-year-old preschool children living in economically disadvantaged communities. Children and teachers in four Head Start classrooms participated in the quasi-experimental study, which included an 8-week intervention in which the children interacted with one of two types of apps: one classroom used four scaffolding-like vocabulary apps for an average of 1.8 h per day (n = 16) and one classroom used four open-ended vocabulary apps for an average of 1.3 h per day (n = 15). Two classrooms served as comparison groups (n = 18; n = 14) which used apps that were chosen by the Head Start program with no specific instructional method for approximately 1 h per day. Children's vocabulary was assessed pre- and post-intervention using the PPVT-4, the EVT-2, and iPad Receptive and Expressive Vocabulary Assessments. Using a repeated measures analysis of variance with split plot analysis, children who used scaffolding-like vocabulary apps performed statistically significantly higher on the PPVT-4 than children who used open-ended vocabulary apps. There were no significant differences between groups on the EVT-2. The study contributed to the literature on teacher instruction of utilizing scaffolding-like apps to increase preschool vocabulary knowledge.

AB  - Researchers have endorsed teacher collaboration within a professional learning community (PLC) that is focused on student learning. Despite these research-based endorsements, several Algebra 1 teachers in a southeastern high school implemented components of a PLC with little or no results in student achievement. The purpose of this study was to explore the implementation and structure of an Algebra 1 collaborative community with a focus on enhancing student achievement and learning. Components of a PLC were used as a conceptual framework in this study. Guiding questions were directed toward examining the structure and outcomes of teacher collaboration on student learning. A case study design was used in which data were collected from interviews of 9 Algebra 1 teachers and 2 observations of the collaborative PLC group. Data were organized through coding in order to interpret patterns and themes based on the components of the conceptual framework. According to the study findings, teachers in the Algebra 1 PLC shared ideas, teaching strategies, and their commitment to student learning. However, the teachers did not focus on collaboration as it relates to common formative assessment, analysis of student data, and research-based intervention strategies. Due to these mixed priorities, a professional development project was created, consisting of PLC activities on the development of formative assessment, data analysis, and intervention. The project may provide positive social change for schools focused on increasing student academic achievement in mathematics by establishing effective PLCs that help teachers to facilitate improving student learning in the local setting.

AB  - Objective: The Positivity and Rules program (PR program), a low-level behavioral teacher program targeting symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), has shown positive effects on teacher-rated ADHD symptoms and social functioning. This study aimed to assess whether program effects could be confirmed by instruments assessing classroom behavior other than teacher-ratings, given teachers' involvement with the training. Methods: Participants were 114 primary school children (age D 6-13) displaying ADHD symptoms in the classroom, who were randomly assigned to the treatment (n D 58) or control group (n D 65). ADHD symptoms were measured using classroom observations and actigraphy, and peer acceptance was measured using peer ratings. Intention-totreat multilevel analyses were conducted to assess program effects. Results: No beneficial program effects were found for any of the measures. Conclusion: The earlier beneficial program effects on both ADHD symptoms and social functioning reported by teachers, may be explained by a change in the perception of teachers rather than changes in the child's behavior. Other methodological explanations are also discussed, such as differences between instruments in the sensitivity to program-related changes. The current study underlines the importance of using different measures of classroom behavior to study program effects.

AB  - Objective: This study assessed which moderators influenced the effectiveness of a low-intensive behavioral teacher program for children with symptoms of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Methods: Primary school children (N = 114) with ADHD symptoms in the classroom were randomly assigned to the intervention program (n = 58; 91% male) or control group (n = 56; 77% male). Multilevel regression analyses assessed differential treatment gains of the intervention program in terms of ADHD symptoms and social skills. Moderators included demographic characteristics (gender, age, parental educational level), severity and comorbidity of problem behavior (ADHD symptoms, conduct and internalizing problems), social functioning, and classroom variables (teaching experience, class size). Results: Results revealed larger program effects for older children and children from highly educated families and smaller beneficial effects for children with comorbid conduct or anxiety problems. Conclusion: The intervention program seems more beneficial for highly educated families and children without comorbid problem behavior, but more intensive treatments appear necessary for children facing additional challenges.

AB  - This article describes an intervention process undertaken in a training program for preschool and first grade teachers from public schools in Cali, Colombia. The objective of this process is to provide a space for teachers to reflect on pedagogical practices which allow them to generate educational processes that foster children’s understanding of mathematical knowledge in the classroom. A set of support strategies was presented for helping teachers in the design, analysis and implementation of learning environments as meaningful educational spaces. Furthermore, participants engaged in an analysis of their own intervention modalities to identify which modalities facilitate the development of mathematical abilities in children. In order to ascertain the transformations in the teachers’ learning environments, the mathematical competences and cognitive processes underlying the activities proposed in the classroom, as well as teacher intervention modalities and the types of student participation in classroom activities were examined both before and after the intervention process. Transformations in the teachers’ conceptions about the children’s abilities and their own practices in teaching mathematics in the classroom were evidenced.

AB  - 'Students’ engagement in school' is regarded in the literature as a current and valued construct despite the lack of empirical studies on its relationship with specific family variables. The present research aimed to survey studies on the correlation between students’ engagement in school and family contexts, specifically in terms of the following variables: perceived parental support, socioeconomic and sociocultural levels, perceived rights, and parental educational styles. In order to describe the state of the art of student’s 'engagement in school' and 'family variables', a narrative review was conducted. The studies reviewed highlight the role of family as a context with significance in student’s engagement in school. However, further research is needed to deepen the knowledge of this topic considering potential mediator variables, either personal or school variables. It was also found the need for a psychosocial intervention aimed at providing support for the students coming from adverse family contexts who exhibit low level of engagement associated with poor academic achievement and a higher probability of dropping out.

The comprehensive intervention addressed nutrition, physical activity, and behavior in the context of a social marketing–based communications campaign to promote healthy energy balance. One element was a classroom-based program called FLASH (Fun Learning Activities for Student Health). Five FLASH modules were delivered, one per semester. Process evaluation data were collected from teachers at 21 schools and study staff at seven national sites via survey, interview, and in-class observation. Data from the first four modules were evaluated and showed that FLASH was delivered with high fidelity. Sessions that required peer interaction were rated as the most effective in engaging students and promoting knowledge.

AB  - Digital media have increased the accessibility of psychological therapies for the general population, but not for people with intellectual disability (ID), despite their greater mental health needs. This study explores and compares the views of service users and clinicians on how computers can be integrated in psychological therapies for people with ID who are traditionally under-represented in mainstream services. We conducted in-depth unstructured interviews with three clinicians who had experience of working with people with ID and with three adults with ID who have experienced computerised training in cognitive behaviour therapy skills. The interviews explored the a) potential functions and benefits, b) anticipated challenges and barriers, and c) required design features of computers in therapy for people with ID. We used inductive coding to identify independent themes in the responses of clinicians and service users, and then compared the emerging themes between the two sets of participants to arrive at common themes. Six common themes emerged from service user and clinician responses: confidentiality of personal information and online applications, barriers in the communication with the therapist, value of therapist and personal contact, access to computer technologies, engagement potential of computer programmes and home practice. Three further themes were specific to clinician responses: patient suitability for computerised approaches, clinician distrust of computerised interventions, and involving a third party. Computer technologies open up possibilities for psychological therapy with people with ID by helping them overcome in-session communication difficulties and practise skills at home. On-screen pictures, interactive games, symbols, sign language and touch-screen are key design features to help engagement. The main challenges are clinician-reported difficulties in their own capacity and capability to access and use computers and in fitting computers into their own defined roles.

AB  - As a community-based sanction, juvenile probation exemplifies the potential of both communities and families to make significant contributions in promoting positive changes among offending youth. Yet, surprisingly little research has explored the nature of these relationships and its association with offending. This study (1) examined the associations between youth-officer relationships, youth perceptions of parental support and knowledge, and probation non-compliance and (2) explored the role of parental support and knowledge as moderators of the association between youth-officer relationships and probation non-compliance among 110 youth supervised on probation (23 % females; 60 % African American). The findings showed that tough or punitive youth-officer relationships were associated with greater counts of technical violations, but fewer counts of delinquent offenses. Parental support was associated with fewer counts of delinquent offenses and parental knowledge was associated with fewer counts of both delinquent offenses and technical violations. These findings provide evidence to the important role of both parents and probation officers and underscore the potential benefits of parent-officer collaboration in facilitating successful interventions among offending youth.

AB  - Given the rise in students identified as having autistic-like characteristics that are impeding their ability to receive educational benefit without support, evidenced based interventions are a vital part of educational services. Children presenting with social and communication deficits require appropriate interventions in order to make progress at the same rate as peers without deficits. Each day teachers are faced with the challenge of providing instruction to their students and assisting them to make sufficient growth in all areas so that they are adequately prepared for the next year of instruction. With the rise in children identified with Autism Spectrum Disorder, teachers are encountering students at varying levels of social competence and social communication which directly impact their ability to respond to overall classroom instruction. The purpose of this project is to develop an instructional resource that will provide teachers with the understanding of evidence-based interventions for students with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Interviews were conducted with special education preschool teachers, autism specialists, program specialists, along with experts in the field of autism spectrum disorders. Utilizing information from the interviews and a review of current literature of evidence-based interventions, a training presentation was developed. The purpose of the training was to introduce specific visual evidence-based interventions as a resource for teachers to increase their student's social interactions and social communication skills within the educational setting.

AB  - The ability to read aloud fluently is a reflection of one's ability to automatically decode words and comprehend text at the same time (Samuels, 2006), a task which may be difficult for many intermediate elementary students with learning disabilities (LD) (Ferrara, 2005). Previous research shows that audio-assisted repeated readings and goal-setting with feedback are effective methods of improving oral reading fluency (ORF) (Chard, Vaughn, & Tyler, 2002; Morgan & Sideridis, 2006; Therrien, 2004) but implementing these interventions may be time-consuming for teachers and tedious for students. The purpose of this research was to determine the impact of including repeated reading interventions within a problem-solving framework of services for individual intermediate students with LD. Specifically, this study investigated whether a videotaped delivery method of a repeated reading intervention improved ORF at the same rate as a one-on-one delivery method for four fifth-grade students with LD. Using an ABCBC alternating-phases design, the single-subject study began with a short baseline followed by two treatment phases. Phase B utilized one-on-one repeated reading interventions delivered by an experienced teacher. Phase C utilized a pre-recorded videotaped version of the same teacher following the same procedures. Both quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed to determine the preferred learning method for each participant. The results of this research reinforced the use of repeated reading interventions for individual intermediate elementary students with LD. All four participants met or exceeded the goal of 25% improvement in reading rates. Results also suggest value in devoting time to the preparation of prerecorded videotaped ORF interventions in order to meet the needs of some struggling learners. Consideration of individual learner characteristics was discussed, as well as consideration of time constraints faced by both general and special educators.

AB  - It has long been accepted that conferences are a useful mode of continuous professional development (CPD) (Russell 2010). Midwives welcome the chance to learn about recent practice developments, and the opportunity to network with each other in a face to face environment. However, barriers such as geographical isolation, time and financial constraints restrict midwives' ability to attend conferences (McIntosh 2007; Patterson and Davis 2007). At the same time, the effectiveness of conferences for CPD has been questioned (Guskey 2000). In these days of financial retrenchment, CPD has to be innovative and creative, offering ongoing support and learning in communities of practice that meet individual learning needs. The Virtual International Day of the Midwife (VIDM) is one such innovation. It is an annual 24 hour international synchronous online conference that celebrates the International Day of the Midwife on 5th May, and is freely open to all. Using the VIDM as a case study, this article discusses how online conferences may support and provide CPD for midwives.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Interventions for curing most diseases and save lives of pregnant and delivering women exist, yet the power of health systems to deliver them to those in most need is not sufficient. The aims of this study were to design a participatory antenatal care (ANC) strengthening intervention and assess the implementation process and effectiveness on quality of ANC in Jimma, Ethiopia. METHODS: The intervention comprised trainings, supervisions, equipment, development of health education material, and adaption of guidelines. It was implemented at public facilities and control sites were included in the evaluation. Improved content of care (physical examinations, laboratory testing, tetanus toxoid (TT)-immunization, health education, conduct of health professionals, and waiting time) were defined as proximal project outcomes and increased quality of care (better identification of health problems and increased overall user satisfaction with ANC) were distal project outcomes. The process of implementation was documented in monthly supervision reports. Household surveys, before (2008) and after (2010) intervention, were conducted amongst all women who had given birth within the previous 12 months. The effect of the intervention was assessed by comparing the change in quality of care from before to after the intervention period at intervention sites, relative to control sites, using logistic mixed effect regression. RESULTS: The continued attention to the ANC provision during implementation stimulated increased priority of ANC among health care providers. The organizational structure of the facilities and lack of continuity in care provision turned out to be a major challenge for implementation. There was a positive effect of the intervention on health education on danger signs during pregnancy (OR: 3.9, 95% CI: 2.6;5.7), laboratory testing (OR for blood tests other than HIV 2.9, 95% CI: 1.9;4.5), health problem identification (OR 1.8, 95% CI: 1.1;3.1), and satisfaction with the service (OR: 0.4, 95% CI: 0.2;0.9). There was no effect of intervention on conduct of health professionals. The effect of intervention on various outcomes was significantly modified by maternal education. CONCLUSION: The quality of care can be improved in some important aspects with limited resources. Moreover, the study provides strategic perspectives on how to facilitate improved quality of ANC.

AB  - Purpose � The purpose of this paper is to analyse the implementation of risk management as a tool for internal audit activities, focusing on unexpected effects or uncertainties generated during its application. Design/methodology/approach � Public and confidential documents as well as semi-structured interviews are analysed through the lens of actor-network theory to identify the effects of risk management devices in a Finnish municipality. Findings � The authors found that risk management, rather than reducing uncertainty, itself created unexpected uncertainties that would otherwise not have emerged. These include uncertainties relating to legal aspects of risk management solutions, in particular the issue concerning which types of document are considered legally valid; uncertainties relating to the definition and operationalisation of risk management; and uncertainties relating to the resources available for expanding risk management. More generally, such uncertainties relate to the professional identities and responsibilities of operational managers as defined by the framing devices. Originality/value � The paper offers three contributions to the extant literature: first, it shows how risk management itself produces uncertainties. Secondly, it shows how internal auditors can assume a central role in the risk management system. Thirdly, it develops Callon's framing/overflowing framework with the notion that multiple frames are linked and create unexpected dynamics, and applies it to the study on the effects of risk management tools in an internal audit context. It shows how, despite recurring attempts to refine risk management, further uncertainties are continuously produced, thus providing an empirical illustration of how reframing and overflowing intertwine in a continual process.

AB  - Objective: To assess the impact of a nutrition education program for teachers in the nutritional status, food knowledge and food consumption of their pre basic and basic students, and in the controls. Materials and methods: A nutrition education intervention was conducted in pre basic and basic teachers in a school year, with a pre-post evaluation of their students, compared with a control group. Subjects were 817 students (389 men and 428 women) from pre kindergarten to the second grade. The 465 students of the intervened group were distributed in two schools (Liceo 1 = 283; Liceo 2 = 182) and 352 in the control school. The nutrition intervention consisted in 9 interactive workshops for teachers with the utilization of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). The pre post evaluation consisted in a nutritional status assessment, and a food and nutrition survey with questions related with food knowledge and food consumption, at the beginning and at the end of the school year. Results: There were no significant differences in nutritional status between the beginning and the end of the intervention. In one of the experimental schools (Liceo 2) there was a significant decrease in obesity, in women and in the age-group 7-9 years. In the experimental group there was a significant improvement in food knowledge and a decrease in non-healthy food consumption. In the control group, consumption of non-healthy food was stable, with a decrease in fruits and vegetables consumption. Conclusions: As it was demonstrated in similar studies, a short interactive nutrition education intervention with utilization of ICT in pre basic and basic teachers can produce positive changes in nutritional status of their students, improving food knowledge and healthy food consumption and decreasing non-healthy food consumption, compared with the control group. However, a strategy to incorporate parents in school nutrition education programs is still a pending issue.

AB  - Background. It is recognized that teaching in a preschool context is physically demanding. Despite this, the consequences of physical demands on psychophysical health (including work ability) are significantly understudied among kindergarten teachers. Objectives. The aim of the present study is to examine (a) the association between physical demands and work ability and (b) whether psychosocial job resources buffer the negative impact of physical demands among kindergarten teachers. Method. A total of 426 kindergarten teachers employed in the municipal educational services of a city in northwest Italy filled out a self-reported questionnaire. Results. High association was found between physical demand and work ability. Moderated hierarchical regressions showed that decision authority, skill discretion, reward and meaning of work buffer the hampering effect of physical demands and work ability. No buffering effects were observed for support from superiors and colleagues. Conclusion. The present study has relevant, practical implications, highlighting the importance of investing in interventions encompassing a holistic perspective (e.g., psychosocial and ergonomic) in order to effectively combat the hampering effect of physical demands on work ability.

AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate what kinds of assessment practices classroom teachers and special educational needs (SEN) teachers use in assessing first grade students' pre-reading skills (letter knowledge and phonological skills). Further, we investigated to what extent teachers were able to identify difficulties in pre-reading skills of the children with the lowest achievement scores. The accuracy of teacher ratings of students' pre-reading skills was studied by comparing teacher ratings to actual test scores. The data from two Finnish longitudinal studies were used: JLD sample (class teachers, n = 91; SEN teachers, n = 51; 200 students) and First Steps sample (class teachers, n = 136; SEN teachers, n = 34; 598 students). Results showed first, that most classroom teachers used qualitative assessment and SEN teachers also relied on tests. Secondly, although teacher ratings correlated with the test scores, closer investigation of sensitivity and specificity of the teacher ratings revealed that a number of children in need of extra support for their early reading development according to test scores remained unidentified. Moreover, there were some students identified by the teacher to have difficulties despite test scores not confirming that. The findings underline the importance for developing more specific and reliable assessment tools for teachers to use for pedagogical purposes, and respectively, the need to pay more attention to early identification of reading difficulties in teacher training program curricula.

AB  - A traumatic event can occur at any point in an adolescent’s life. Yet, research suggests that the negative impact of a traumatic event on adolescent’s well-being can be minimized with timely and effective intervention. Careful review of the trauma literature identifies the significance of both community and faith-based intervention in positive post-traumatic recovery. A link has been identified between the use of Christian strategies and a decreased risk of post-traumatic symptoms. However, the literature examined suggests that adolescents may avoid the use of Christian strategies during their recovery because of the effects that their developmental milestones have on their perception of the Christian faith. Based on this research, spiritual based strategies are discussed in an effort to effectively respond to the spiritual and psychological needs of adolescents in faith-based schools in the occasion of a traumatic event.

AB  - Computers, during its entry into the academic domain, were forecasted to revolutionize the entire educational system across the globe. At present, similar expectations have been encircling the social media technologies. Many researchers claim that social media, when introduced in higher education environments, tend to enhance the students' learning experience by facilitating heightened levels of instructor-student interactions, peer learner support and learners' collaboration. Though social media is claimed to take the higher education learning to the next level, it is crucial to identify the readiness and proficiency of the instructors who play the main role in efficiently implementing these technologies in their classrooms. Especially, instructors belonging to the institutions present in developing nations are less likely to have proper access to some of the basic facilities (such as power supply or internet connectivity) required for social media integration. Hence, the present study aims at identifying the feasibility of introducing social media aids to the higher education classrooms present in Tamil Nadu--one among the eight Indian states having the highest number of colleges in the Nation.

AB  - Professional development on inquiry-based learning (IBL) generally draws heavily on the principle of providing instruction in line with what teachers are expected to do in their classroom. So far, however, relatively little is known about how this impacts teachers' educational beliefs, even though these beliefs ultimately determine their classroom behavior. The present study therefore investigates how immersion in inquiry-based learning affects student teachers' beliefs about knowledge goals, in addition to their self-efficacy for inquiry. In total, 302 student history teachers participated in a 4-h long inquiry activity designed within the WISE learning environment, and completed a pre- and posttest right before and after the intervention. Multilevel analyses suggest that the intervention had a significant positive effect on the value that student teachers attributed to procedural knowledge goals, or learning how historical knowledge is constructed, and on student teachers' self-efficacy for conducting inquiries. Despite these general positive results, however, the results also show that the impact of the intervention differed significantly across students. In particular, it appears that immersion in IBL had little effect on a subgroup of 25 student-teachers, who held largely content-oriented beliefs. Based on these findings, the present study discusses a number of implications for professional development on IBL.

AB  - In this article, the author focuses on diversity and working with families in the early childhood field. She has chosen to look to the potential for improvements in the future. It is impossible to predict the future, but there are strategies that can help ensure that practices in early intervention and early childhood special education (EI/ECSE) continue to improve. Evaluation followed by action often results in positive change. Therefore, the author is proposing five questions that can be used to evaluate, reflect, and take actions to improve educators' practices as the future so relentlessly becomes the present. She stresses that evaluating current services, reflecting on those findings, and making the changes to improve programs and practices require time, energy, and commitment; but it is always worth it.

AB  - Abstract: Objectives: Adolescents who have a history of being detained report rates of STI that are 8 to 10 times higher than peers without such histories. Over the last decade, an increasing number of studies have identified multiple factors that are associated with STI risk behaviors and acquisition among detained youth. However to date, no reviews of this literature have been conducted, which is the aim of this paper. Method: We conducted a review of the published literature to identify correlates of risky and STIs among detained youth. PsycINFO, PubMed, MEDLINE and Googlescholar were searched for English-language publications from 1999 to present. These dates represent the time period when the majority of research was conducted among this population. Results: This paper utilizes an ecological model to review risk and protective factors related to STIs among this population. Findings indicated that individual factors (i.e., age, gender, substance use, and mental health); micro fact)

AB  - The family-focused mental health intervention, `Let's Talk About Children,' has positively influenced the lives of families affected by parental mental illness. This paper outlines the use of this brief, strengths-based intervention for parents with gambling and other co-occurring issues from the gamblers' support services sector. Over a six-month period, a training manual and accompanying resources were adapted for the gamblers' support services sector and a targeted training session developed. Nine problem gambling counsellors from three Victorian gambling support services trialled the Let's Talk About Children intervention over a four-month period. Qualitative data were gathered through focus groups, interviews, and practice enquiry groups to determine the impact of the Let's Talk About Children model for gambling support services. The results are presented as `practice wisdoms and recommendations' reporting on the impact of the trial and to provide some guidance to support others in the implementation of a specific family-focused intervention. This paper reports on the first exploratory trial of Let's Talk About Children for the gambler's support services sector in Australia.

AB  - There has been limited research on the development of in-service teachers' self-efficacy beliefs across multiple school years. The current longitudinal study investigated (a) how teachers' self-efficacy beliefs change over time and (b) how teacher and classroom characteristics relate to these changes in a sample of 341 US American preschool teachers involved in a professional development intervention. Latent growth curve models indicated that teachers' self-efficacy beliefs increased, particularly for those receiving a coaching intervention. Teacher ratings of children's behavior problems had a negative effect on self-efficacy beliefs. Together, findings highlight the need for support of changing self-efficacy beliefs among in-service teachers. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A critical friend is a friend who offers critique on practice. Critical Friendship Circles (CFCs) are groups of critical friends who meet for feedback using a protocol. A study with 95 participants at an American university in Egypt has revealed challenges specific to the culture of most 'Teaching English as a Foreign Language' student-teachers. A longitudinal grounded theory study used reflective essays, surveys, focus groups and transcripts of CFC meetings as data that revealed four theoretical categories. Cultural intolerance to open negativity, fear and/or rejection of giving or receiving cool feedback, uncertainty about and neglect of the use of protocols and appropriate language, but also usefulness in terms of personal and professional growth were revealed. Professionals teaching English to speakers of other languages who are not familiar with western orientations to critique and feedback often reject CFCs from ignorance and fear.

Escape was identified as the primary function of the behavior in all three students, and access to tangible items was identified in one of the students as a secondary function. Teacher-monitoring and self-monitoring interventions were implemented within a multiple baseline design across three students to increase compliance. Results demonstrated that the intervention was effective and that all three students increased compliance during teacher-monitoring and self-monitoring conditions. These results are discussed in terms of recent research on function-based self-monitoring interventions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study documented the lived experiences of professionals with significant background working with child refugees, in an attempt to understand how practitioners view the information, resources, and other supports required to assure child refugees’ successful physical, cognitive, social, and emotional development. An extensive review of the published research on child refugees in the United States described specific international treaties, federal statutes, and state codes, addressed developmental disruptions as refugee children experience them, and explored the school experience of specific refugee cultural groups, yet revealed few reports of practitioners’ perspectives. Accordingly, this investigation sought the views of ten school and community professionals who engage with child refugees in a medium-sized, suburban school district to determine 1) What advice would they offer to those who will serve refugee children in public schools? 2) How useful do they find background information on legal mandates and the refugee child’s experience prior to resettlement, and when is this information most beneficial? 3) How do they experience a child refugee’s developmental disruptions, and how do they prioritize work on these disruptions? A one hour semi-structured interview addressed knowledge, skills, and practices that professionals found to be successful when working with a refugee population, along with barriers that they encountered. A three-part, twenty-six item follow-up survey asked participants to provide background information on their experiences, rate their knowledge of federal and state legal mandates and refugee cultural experiences (e.g., home country context, refugee camp conditions), and identify any developmental disruptions a refugee child presented in their setting. Participants reported successes and barriers that were largely role specific. Several themes, however, arose across all interviews. These themes included: 1) addressing students’ language needs, 2) engaging community resources, 3) addressing school needs related to cultural context education, 4) building relational trust, 5) identifying and addressing bullying, and 6) collaborating in pursuit of common professional goals. In addition, interviewees identified motivation and transformation as personal experiences in their work with child refugees. Findings lead to three implications, including development of comprehensive and specific state policy, recommendations for professional standards of practice, and revision to pre-service teacher and school leader curricula.

AB  - Teachers must be proficient at using data to evaluate the effects of instructional strategies and interventions, and must be able to make, describe, justify, and validate their data-based instructional decisions to parents, students, and educational colleagues. An important related skill is the ability to accurately read and interpret progress-monitoring graphs. This study examined preservice special education teachers' graph reading and interpretation skills at two points in time. Participants used a think-aloud procedure to interpret a curriculum-based measurement (CBM) progress monitoring graph, and results were compared to those of CBM experts. Overall, preservice teachers tended to say fewer words than graph experts did. Furthermore, their descriptions of CBM graphs were less sequentially coherent, specific, and reflective. Little change was observed at time 2. Implications for improving teacher preparation in this skill area are discussed.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the use of brief experimental analysis (BEA) to identify early reading interventions for students in the primary grades and to compare teachers' judgments about their students' early reading intervention needs to BEA results. In addition, the research was conducted to explore how teachers make decisions regarding early reading intervention selection and evaluation. Three teachers and three elementary students (two kindergarten and one second grade) participated in the study. A BEA using a multielement design with mini-reversals was used to test the effects of four different interventions. Each teacher selected an intervention that she judged to be the most promising for her student. An extended analysis using an alternating treatments design compared the relative effects of the BEA-identified intervention and the teacher-identified intervention across time. The teachers were interviewed before and after selecting and implementing the interventions. The extended analysis results showed that the BEA-identified intervention was more effective than the teacher-identified intervention for all participants. Initial and final interview findings revealed that the teachers reported using data to make intervention decisions, but with limited specificity and in some cases, misjudgments. The results are discussed in regard to limitations and future research.

AB  - Developing competence in scientific thinking represents an important learning goal in teacher education. The current study investigates how such competence can be systematically promoted. The experimental intervention study developed an integrated learning unit based on learning from instructional errors, which systematically combined the principles of problem-oriented and instruction-oriented learning by narratively implementing previously prepared examples in an authentic pedagogical context. It used school-related problems to promote scientific explanations. The type of instructional error implemented in the learning environment (own errors vs. advocatory errors) and the number of contexts (multiple vs. uniform contexts) were varied experimentally. In this 2 x 2 factorial design, 179 students were randomly assigned to the experimental conditions (type of errors, context). The participants worked in the learning environment during four consecutive seminar sessions. Results show that scientific explanations were operationalized by the recall of conceptual knowledge concerning such explanations as well as the application of scientific knowledge to analyze and generate explanations for school situations. Learning with advocatory errors proved to be more effective in facilitating conceptual knowledge and the knowledge needed to analyze explanations. However, the knowledge needed to generate explanations was fostered more effectively by learning with own errors.

AB  - The present study investigates how scientific thinking can be fostered in teacher students using cooperative error-based learning. Thus, a learning unit was developed which integrates elements of problem-based and instruction-oriented learning into an error-based learning approach. In an experimental intervention study, three different forms of transactive discourses were stimulated while working on the learning unit in dyads: quick consensus building, integration-oriented and conflict-oriented consensus building. In a 1 x 3-factorial experimental design with repeated measurements, these forms of transactivity were varied using three different collaboration scripts. 98 students were randomly assigned to three experimental conditions. The students worked on the learning environment in dyads on four consecutive sessions. Conceptual knowledge as well as knowledge needed to analyze and to generate scientific explanations were assessed. Regarding conceptual knowledge, quick consensus-building was most effective. In knowledge needed to analyze no differences between groups were found. With regard to knowledge needed to generate scientific explanations, conflict-oriented consensus building was most effective. Based on these findings conclusions to optimize the error-based approach were drawn.

AB  - A qualitative evaluation was carried out of a learning initiative between different mental health professional groups, the Collaborative Learning Initiative (CLI). These qualitative results are after the first year of a two year evaluation of the CLI in which social work, clinical psychology and nursing students together with post-registration medics undertook a sequence of joint learning in relation to mental health theory and practice. In total, 81 post-course evaluations were qualitatively analysed using a process of thematic analysis. Each academic involved with the CLI thematically analysed the post-course evaluations from their discipline. Following the generation of key themes each set of evaluations was separately analysed by an academic from a different professional discipline associated with the initiative. The evaluation of this initiative demonstrates that the model of interdisciplinary teaching whereby service user and carers facilitating small group working is an effective model for delivering interprofessional mental health education. The paper highlights the convergent and divergent themes between the different groups involved in the initiative. Most of the social work, medics, nursing and all clinical psychology participants evaluated the programme positively, however some of the themes were not positive and these are also discussed within the paper. The uniqueness and value of this initiative lies in both having service users and carers involved in the design, delivery, evaluation and dissemination of the CLI and also in the strength of having four professional disciplines involved. Limitations of the study are highlighted.

AB  - Mentally ill parents are often sceptical about professional help for their children although these children face an increased risk to develop a mental disease themselves. To get a better understanding of needs and help-seeking behaviour in those families a systematic literature review was conducted. Four databases (FIS, PsycINFO, PSYNDEX, PubPsych) were scanned for international and national research literature. Out of 18,057 articles 56 were included which report quantitative or qualitative studies taking the children's and parents' perspectives into account. A thematic synthesis was done to categorize the needs. Results concerning the help-seeking behaviour and the influence of demographic variables were extracted and summarized. Our results were limited by the aspect that no evaluation of study quality had been made and influences on the categorizing process by the authors' subjective perceptions are likely. There were a lot of hints regarding the needs of the families, but little report was found about help-seeking behaviour and demographic variables. The ``health literacy{''} concept was discussed as a basis for further research in this area.

AB  - Teacher professionalization in relation to retention strategies Bjarne Wahlgren, professor, director National Centre of Competence Development, University of Aarhus, Denmark The research project �New roles for the teacher� was initiated due to a concern about the increasing number of dropouts within Danish VET. The main research questions are: Is it possible to train teachers to be able to focus on the students� completion of the program and not only on the subject matter? Do teachers change their attitudes and actual performance in the classroom after training programs? And do new pedagogical strategies have any impact on retention? The project started in 2010 and includes annual interventions and measurements of the output of these inventions. The intervention includes various teacher training programs e.g. about training in cooperative learning, classroom management, conflict management, and training in analyses of the students� preconditions and experiences. The data collecting methods are comprehensive and include five data sets: � A teacher survey (more than 500 informants) about the teachers� perception of their own socio-pedagogical competencies and activities � A student survey (more than 5000 informants) about the study environment � Periodic interviews with the school leaders, the teachers and the students � Written logs by school leaders and teachers. � Registration of the students� absence, drop-out and grades. Interviews and written logs show that the teachers transform their learning outcome to action. In spite of that the impact on the study environment is modest. The rate of the student absence as well as the dropout rate has declined, however in a complicated way. The effect seems to differ among institutions with different cultures.

AB  - This article reports findings from a research project titled New roles for the teacher - Increased completion through social responsibility. This research, designed as an intervention project, has an overall aim of reducing absence and drop-out rates in the Danish vocational and general adult educational system by developing and improving the teachers� competences. This has been pursued in the research project through engaging teachers in training aimed at improving their socio-pedagogical competences. The effect of this training has been measured by electronic questionnaires filled in by the teachers, interviews with the teachers, and by the teachers� written logbooks. The preliminary conclusion is that it is the general attitude in the teacher groups towards the importance of improving retention that is of significance for the documented effects on the drop-out rates.

AB  - This study examined teachers' and students' initial conceptions of computer-based models-Flash and NetLogo models-and documented how teachers and students reconciled notions of multiple representations featuring macroscopic, submicroscopic and symbolic representations prior to actual intervention in eight high school chemistry classrooms. Individual in-depth interviews were conducted with 32 students and 6 teachers. Findings revealed an interplay of complex factors that functioned as opportunities and obstacles in the implementation of technologies in science classrooms. Students revealed preferences for the Flash models as opposed to the open-ended NetLogo models. Altogether, due to lack of content and modeling background knowledge, students experienced difficulties articulating coherent and blended understandings of multiple representations. Concurrently, while the aesthetic and interactive features of the models were of great value, they did not sustain students' initial curiosity and opportunities to improve understandings about chemistry phenomena. Most teachers recognized direct alignment of the Flash model with their existing curriculum; however, the benefits were relegated to existing procedural and passive classroom practices. The findings have implications for pedagogical approaches that address the implementation of computer-based models, function of models, models as multiple representations and the role of background knowledge and cognitive load, and the role of teacher vision and classroom practices.

AB  - Parent-mediated interventions for young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are highly under-utilized in community settings. A challenge to the dissemination of these programs is that provider training protocols must teach both the intervention techniques, and the parent coaching strategies. The current study assesses the feasibility an innovative multimodal training protocol to teach community-based intervention providers Project ImPACT (Improving Parents as Communication Teachers). A total of 30 providers (90% female; 76% Caucasian, 13.3% Multiracial/Other, 3.3% Hispanic/Latino, and 3.3% Asian/Pacific Islander) participated in Phase 1, and 15 of these participants (80% female; 60% Caucasian, 33.3% multiracial, and 6.6% Hispanic/Latino) participated in Phase 2. In Phase 1, providers completed questionnaires and videotaped interactions before and after a web-based tutorial and interactive workshop focused on intervention techniques. In Phase 2, providers completed questionnaires and videotaped interactions before and after a second interactive workshop focused on parent coaching. Results from Phase 1 indicate that the addition of the workshop resulted in higher ratings of training satisfaction (p<.01), training adequacy (p<.01), and self-efficacy (p<.01) of the intervention techniques. Results from Phase 2 indicate the addition of the second workshop resulted in greater training adequacy of the parent coaching strategies, p<.01. These results suggest that use of this training protocol is a feasible way to increase access to high quality training in evidence-based intervention for providers working with children with ASD in the community; however, larger scale community-based trials of the training protocol are an important next step.

AB  - This article examines the benefits of in-home family therapy with severely distressed families through the analysis of four cases that demonstrate the creative use of this intervention with families whose children were placed in a full-time day care facility. Although the efficacy of home intervention with distressed families has been documented, the case illustrations here analyze the process more fully--the how and the why it works. The first three cases explicate the contribution of home intervention to the engagement of social worker and client. Each case highlights how home intervention enhances the therapeutic alliance by promoting change from a different starting point--the client (home as a secure base for change), the worker (viewing the client from a different perspective), and the client-worker interaction (power sharing in setting boundaries). The fourth case (in vivo narrative reconstruction) serves as a striking example of how the home--as a multisystemic, intergenerational container of the family's past, present, and future--can be enlisted as a partner in reconstructing silenced chapters of the family narrative.

AB  - A virtual coaching intervention utilizing Skype and Bluetooth (Bug-in-the-Ear) technology provided immediate corrective feedback to non-traditional teacher candidates during a semester-long internship experience. Participants completed their student teaching internship as a requirement of a teacher preparation program at a mid-size Southeastern university. The virtual coaching model allowed candidates in rural, remote and local, urban contexts to receive immediate guidance and feedback. This randomized field study reports participants' observations and concerns about the virtual coaching model and examines effects on instructional behaviors of pre-service teacher candidates compared to face-to-face internship observations with delayed feedback. Specifically, the intervention included on-demand corrective feedback utilizing Skype VoIP and Bug-in-the-Ear (BIE) Bluetooth technology. Participants cited benefits and challenges of the model to their own practice, to the observer, and to their students and universally felt the BIE virtual coaching was a positive experience for them. The researchers' findings suggest that the innovation was not disruptive and enabled participants to redirect their instructional practices and behaviors immediately.

AB  - This paper assesses a range of family support policy & practice interventions with particular reference to models of assessment, methods of support, and measures of effectiveness. The conclusion is that there is a renaissance in indirect, voluntary family support in which a range of activities are being undertaken on the basis of limited empirical evidence of long term effectiveness. This support focuses on children's behavioral and emotional needs and emerging mental health problems as well as prevention of harm. In the context of rising demand for preventative services this offers an opportunity for professional social work theory & practice skills to be harnessed to complement this activity rather than accept further retrenchment in this traditional sphere of social work expertise.

AB  - The increasing incidence and upward trends detected in child and adolescent mental health problems over the past 25 years, nationally and internationally, have caused concern among children and young people, parents or carers, professionals and politicians. In the UK, recent governments have focused attention on this problem, commissioned research and begun to implement measures to provide a response to the growing numbers of troubled children and young people. This article details the development of a multidisciplinary initiative designed to stimulate innovative ideas in the field of early intervention and relieve demand on the specialist child and adolescent mental health services. External evaluation of the service took place over a two-year period using an inclusive qualitative model. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This article presents a commentary on the perceptions of parents and children on family support intervention for child behavioral problems. The promotion of child welfare suggests that family support is making a revival within social work policy. Yet, a closer inspection reveals a wide gap between rhetoric and practice. The recent "Framework for the Assessment of Children in Need" states the importance of families and their networks, yet frustrates social workers who practice with eligibility criteria that constrain family support work. The concept of family support has broad definitional parameters. Thus, a shortage of reliable empirical data about social work activity is expected. However, available evidence suggest that the context of child and adolescent mental health is community-oriented. In the paper by Suzanne Window, Maxine Richards, and Panos Vostanis, their findings validate other research that argues that universal family support services cannot meet the needs of many children and families with complex and deep-rooted difficulties.

AB  - The Social Worker's Guide to Child and Adolescent Mental Health provides a comprehensive guide to working with children and young people who are experiencing mental health problems and equips the reader with the knowledge and skills to provide the best service to these vulnerable young people. The book covers: (a) the role social work can play in child and adolescent mental health, and key ideas relating to mental health and young people; (b) how social work skills and knowledge can be applied to working with children and adolescents with mental health problems and how skills can be developed, as well as guidance on assessment, intervention and multi-disciplinary working; and, (c) the wider social contexts of legislative and policy frameworks, and the importance of considering cultural, spiritual and religious identity. Also included are case examples, reflective activities and practical exercises to underpin theory and knowledge. This book will be essential reading for all pre- and post-qualifying social work practitioners involved with children, adolescents and families, in particular those working in mental health settings, as well as approved mental health professionals.

AB  - This article is focused on the initial development and trial testing of a brief teacher rating tool that can be used for universal screening and tracking of instructionally relevant forms of student social behavior over time. A 12-item scale is described in which teachers make judgments about student performance on a skills-based rather than a frequency-based rating dimension. We believe teachers are expert judges of student skill levels in social behaviors and academic enablers that are of critical importance to school success (i.e., enhanced social-behavioral adjustment and academic performance) as opposed to frequency- or rate-based estimates that are less essential to a teacher's instruction and management of the classroom. The Elementary Social Behavior Assessment (ESBA) asks teachers to judge each student's performance regarding evaluative criteria based on their teaching and management of the classroom. Case-study illustrations of the universal screening and tracking functions of the ESBA are provided.

AB  - Sixteen general and special education teachers were randomly assigned to one of four teams that were to make manifestation determinations using two different "hidden profiles" case studies based on students with an emotional behavioral disability. One case study was constructed to support a decision of the behavior not being a manifestation of the disability and the other case study was constructed to support a conclusion that the behavior of concern was a manifestation of the disability. To fully understand the student and behavior of concern, team members were required to actively share and discuss all of the relevant information they possessed. Both the teams working with profiles supporting the manifestation of the disability reached that conclusion; however, the two teams working with profiles that supported a non-manifestation of disability conclusion reached different conclusions, one declaring the behavior to be a non-manifestation and the other declaring it to be a manifestation of the disability. Overall, participants found the manifestation determination process to be an effective way to discuss student behavior, but special and general educators approached the determination process differently. Discussion of the manifestation determination review (MDR) process is presented along with implications for practice, limitations, and future research.

AB  - According to federal mandates, if a student's behavior impedes their learning or the learning of others, the individualized education program team is required to address this with a functional behavioral assessment (FBA). The intent of the FBA is to determine the function, or reason, of the impeding behavior for the development of a behavioral intervention plan (BIP). The BIP process is a team-based approach that includes goals and interventions that result in positive behavior change. Procedural fidelity, or compliance with the plan, is of utmost importance to success of this process. Unfortunately, such integrity is often lacking, particularly when teachers carry the responsibility of implementing BIPs in the classroom. Therefore, capacity building within the school team is imperative to increase implementation fidelity of BIPs. This article provides practitioners with the tools to organize the monitoring and implementation of BIPs in classroom settings.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of workshops and coaching on paraprofessional implementation of function-based interventions. The results of indirect and direct functional behavior assessment guided the development of intervention strategies for three students with autism and intellectual disability. Following intervention, students' appropriate behavior increased and challenging behavior decreased. In general, paraprofessionals implemented strategies with high levels of fidelity and judged both the coaching and workshop training procedures and student intervention strategies as socially valid. Implications for practice, limitations, and suggestions for future research are discussed.

AB  - With an increasing amount of overweight children, especially among racial and ethnic minorities, effective population-level interventions are urgently needed (Wang et al., 2006). The purpose of this study was to provide insight into nutritional and physical activity intervention programs at a Connecticut public school in an urban setting. Interviews were conducted with school leaders, sixth grade teachers, physical education teachers; the school nurse, the cafeteria manager, and students' parents or guardians. Responses were analyzed to explore perspectives on the school's health programs and their association with students' attendance, class participation, socialization and communication skills, attitude toward school and motivation, and health issues and risk behaviors. Family involvement was investigated to determine if it influenced program effectiveness. Information was gathered to determine leadership roles and strategies for sustaining the school's programs. Data were analyzed thematically and the results suggested that school-based health intervention programs may or may not influence student behaviors.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to use the Joint Action Studies in Didactics (JASD) to understand how teachers' and students' interactions co-construct knowledge during Cooperative Learning (CL). The basis of CL is that students learn with and from each other through a structured interdependent relationship. A case study approach was used to examine how a group of three year-5 students and their teacher from an ethnically diverse primary school in New Zealand co-constructed knowledge within a 3-month CL intervention in physical education. The JASD protocol included collecting data on the teacher's intention, practical epistemology and student interactions as they engaged in CL task structures. Data analysis included a search for patterns in the evolution of the didactic contract of content learned as students interacted in the co-construction of knowledge. Findings revealed that the CL tasks provided a pedagogical structure where student interactions were generally aligned with the didactic intent of the tasks. The teaching techniques of the student coach served to make the development of content more dynamic, with an increased frequency of breaches in the didactic contract. This dynamic may facilitate student learning during productive group problem-solving tasks. When the intended content was more specifically defined, the topogenetic technique of teacher intervention within tasks was critical to re-align students' interpretation of the knowledge at stake in the CL tasks.

AB  - The shift towards a risk-management form of child protection practice threatens to outlaw the notion that therapeutic interventions can succeed in these contexts. Yet experienced practitioners know that the crisis of statutory intervention in itself can create a therapeutic space for positive change. In this article, an example of an integrative intervention is described that combines Solution Focused Therapy with an understanding of authority as empowerment and the social worker's broader responsibility to attend to environmental deficits. The piece concludes with the client's own analysis of "what helps" and the practitioner's review. Client names and identifying details have been changed.

AB  - This article details a collaboration between the fyw program and the library at the University of Nevada, Reno. The departments share a goal of helping students develop better research-writing skills; however, institutional and disciplinary boundaries presented well-known challenges. To surmount these challenges, the cross-disciplinary team settled on the Burkean Parlor as a boundary object, which is a shared metaphor that scaffolds effective work among diverse communities. Once the metaphor was mobilized, the team realized it could also scaffold work across the boundaries between expert and novice writers and between facts and arguments in research writing. Accordingly, the team designed a curricular intervention around the Burkean Parlor metaphor and taught it collaboratively to a group of 900 second-semester first-year students while a roughly equally sized group served as a control. Students submitted pre- and post-surveys of their attitudes toward library research, and their final research papers were collected and rated on several criteria relating to rhetorical purpose and source use. The team found that the intervention group's research papers presented significantly better articulations of rhetorical purpose, and students reported increased confidence in their abilities to access and use library sources in research writing.

AB  - Current curriculum initiatives ill mathematics call for the development of classroom communities that take communication about mathematics as a central focus. Ill these proposals, mathematical discourse involving explanation, argumentation, and defense of mathematical ideas becomes a defining feature of a quality classroom experience. Ill this article, the authors provide a comprehensive and critical review of what it is that mathematics teachers actually do to deal with classroom discourse. Synthesizing the literature around a number of key themes, the authors critically assess the kinds of human infrastructure that promote mathematical discourse ill the classroom and that allow students to achieve desirable outcomes. From the findings, they conclude with implications for teachers.

AB  - In general, team-building programs address goal setting, interpersonal relations, role clarification, or problem-solving approaches and offer the chance for participants to discuss and work on subjects outside the normal routine. Additionally, with these training programs it is possible to develop individual and team-related skills, for example, cohesion or communication. A number of studies have already shown the effects of human resource development training. This article discusses the influence of a team-building intervention on the team climate of preschool teachers (N = 39). Moreover, the aim of this study is to answer the question of whether participants benefit more from interventions with ample interaction. Our findings showed no significant difference between interventions with ample interaction and those with less interaction.

AB  - Ethics education exists in most professions internationally, yet is less prevalent in teacher education. This article reports on research exploring how ethics education is provided in university courses of initial teacher education (ITE) in England that was conducted as the second phase of an international survey study which considered the prevalence of ethics education in teacher education in five countries. Participants from the initial survey, all involved in the delivery of ITE programmes in English universities, were interviewed for this second phase of the research. Our key findings are that ethics is not offered as a stand-alone course in any institution, but is embedded in various ways within the curriculum. Ethics education is diffused among different areas of the curriculum and the activities used to develop ethical understanding are diverse. Barriers to providing ethical education include student resistance, lack of time, the complex nature of the provision and external demands.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the evaluation methods of resident teaching courses and to estimate the effectiveness of these teaching courses. DESIGN. We searched the literature from 1975 to May 2003 using the PubMed MESH terms internship and residency and teaching; 1,436 articles were identified and 77 contained information regarding teaching courses. Fourteen articles contained information regarding outcomes of resident teaching courses and were selected for intensive review. MAIN RESULTS: Five uncontrolled pre-post studies used resident self-reported teaching skills/behaviors as outcome measures; all reported some improvement in self-reported skills. Three uncontrolled pre-post studies examined live or videotaped resident teaching encounters and all revealed improvement in some teaching skills. One uncontrolled trial and three nonrandomized controlled trials used learner evaluations of resident teaching behaviors as outcomes and all revealed an improvement in ratings of residents after course participation. Four randomized controlled trials of resident teaching curricula are included in this review. One study did not show any quantitative benefit of a resident teaching course on performance on an objective structured teaching evaluation. Two studies assessing resident teaching evaluations before and after course participation showed conflicting results. One study noted improvements in resident teaching skills assessed through videotape analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Resident teaching courses improve resident self-assessed teaching behaviors and teaching confidence. Teaching courses are linked to improved student evaluations. Further studies must be completed to elucidate the best format, length, timing, and content of resident teaching courses and to determine whether they have an effect on learner performance.

AB  - Drawing on literature since 1997, this review explores the effects of teacher induction on beginning teachers' conceptions and practice of teaching, and it identifies three approaches to understanding such effects, as found in the literature. The first approach addresses the assumed effects of teacher induction components on beginning teachers' teaching using theoretical assumptions as a base. The second approach analyzes the effects through teachers' self-reports. The third explores the effects of using multiple data sources. Although teacher induction affects beginning teachers' ideas about teaching, few studies capture its effects on teaching practice and student achievement. Thus, this review suggests directions for future research.

AB  - SUMMARY Teacher belief has been considered crucial for teachers� classroom behaviors, their learning and development as well as students� outcomes. This PhD study has provided a better understanding of the factors and forces shaping teacher belief and how this changes during their course of teaching in a new context and in their early years of the teaching careers of CFL teachers in the Danish context. It has been shown that the multifaceted beliefs that CFL teachers hold are based on their personal experience, shaped by context, and mediated by their classroom practices. The educational culture in which the teacher has been educated affects how they interpret students, teaching and their teacher role. The study of CFL teachers teaching in intercultural contexts makes a connection between context, cultural issues, individual experience, teacher belief and teaching concerns, and it helps to better understand how different cultural, personal and contextual issues influence teacher belief and teaching practices. Encountering new cultures in a new country and adjusting to a new teaching context, CFL teachers taught and learned and in the process many of them developed and changed their beliefs. They gradually moved away from sticking to their previous experience and beliefs, and learned to better fit their beliefs to different teaching contexts and types of students. Their beliefs became context-oriented as they were better able to draw elements from both subject-matter oriented and learner-oriented beliefs and different teaching methods and resources depending on the situational context. However, teachers� belief change is a non-linear process of learning to teach and developing towards professionalism, involving struggles and uncertainties. This study has provided insights for teachers teaching in an intercultural context in relation to the factors shaping teacher belief and how belief is changed to better suit the context. It also gives inspiration for the design of effective teacher preparation, development and training programs for CFL teachers in global contexts by addressing their prior experience, beliefs and cultural background as a starting point.

AB  - The degree to which evidence-based program outcomes are affected by modifications is a significant concern in the implementation of interventions. The ongoing national implementation of an evidence-based HIV prevention program targeting grade 6 students in The Bahamas {[}Focus on Youth in The Caribbean (FOYC)] offers an opportunity to explore factors associated with teachers' modification of FOYC lessons and to examine the impact of types and degrees of modifications on student outcomes. Data were collected in 2012 from 155 teachers and 3646 students in 77 government elementary schools. Results indicate that teachers taught 16 of 30 core activities, 24.5 of 46 total activities and 4.7 of 8 sessions. Over one-half of the teachers made modifications to FOYC core activities; one-fourth of the teachers modified 25 % or more core activities that they taught (heavily modified FOYC). Omitting core activities was the most common content modification, followed by lengthening FOYC lessons with reading, writing assignments or role-play games, and shortening core activities or adding educational videos. Mixed-effects modeling revealed that omitting core activities had negative impacts on all four student outcomes. Shortening core activities and adding videos into lessons had negative impacts on HIV/AIDS knowledge and/or intention to use condom protection. Heavy modifications (> 1/4 core activities) were associated with diminished program effectiveness. Heavy modifications and omitting or shortening core activities were negatively related to teachers' level of implementation. We conclude that poorer student outcomes were associated with heavy modifications.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the effectiveness of a holistic school-based nutrition programme using the health-promoting school (HPS) approach, on teachers' knowledge, attitudes and behaviour in relation to nutrition in rural China. Design/methodology/approach - A cluster-randomised intervention trial design was employed. Two middle schools were randomly selected and assigned to either the intervention school using the HPS framework (HPS School), or to the Control School, in Miyun County, Beijing. From each school 20 teachers were randomly selected to complete the survey. Nutrition-related knowledge, attitudes and behaviour were measured at pre- and post-intervention surveys with the same instrument. The nutrition intervention last for six months. Findings - The holistic school-based nutrition programme using the HPS framework had no statistical impact on improving teacher's knowledge, attitudes and behaviour in relation to nutrition (p > 0.05). Practical implications - Future holistic school-based nutrition programmes targeting adolescents should also design and implement longer and more intensive interventions for teachers focusing on how to equip them with the awareness and ability to disseminate their knowledge, positive attitudes and role model behaviours to students, rather than on how to teach them basic knowledge and skills. Originality/value - Although teachers play a critical role in the HPS framework, there is very limited published research investigating the change in teachers' nutrition-related knowledge, attitudes and behaviour as a result of a nutrition promotion programme.

AB  - Previous research has suggested that moral disengagement is strongly associated with bullying and bystander behavior. The current study evaluated the effectiveness of a 5-week classroom-wide bullying intervention, "The Bullying Literature Project-Moral Disengagement Version (BLP-MD)", on moral disengagement and bullying among elementary school students. A quasiexperimental design was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the "BLP-MD". A sample of 84 third grade students (M[subscript age] = 7.93 years, 53.6% female) from four classrooms and their teachers participated in this study. The results revealed significant time by treatment interactions for decreasing both victimization and moral disengagement in treatment classrooms compared to waitlist control classrooms. The program also resulted in improved perception of peer friendships and was rated as having high social validity for both students and their teachers. How to incorporate the "BLP-MD" into the general language arts curriculum to decrease moral disengagement and bullying, and promote positive bystanding is discussed.

AB  - Few questionnaires have been developed to screen for potentially poor implementers of school-based interventions. This study combines teacher characteristics, perceptions, and teaching/training experiences to develop a short screening tool that can identify potential low-performing or high-performing teachers pre-implementation. Data were gathered from 208 teachers and 4,411 students who participated in the national implementation of an evidence-based HIV intervention in The Bahamas. Sensitivity and specificity were evaluated for the detection of low-performing and high-performing teachers. The validity of the screening tool was assessed using receiver operating characteristics analysis. The School Pre-implementation Screening Tool consists of seven predictive factors: duration as teacher, working site, attendance at training workshops, training in interactive teaching, perceived importance of the intervention, comfort in teaching the curriculum, and program priority. The sensitivity and specificity were 74% and 57% in identifying low-performing teachers and 81% and 65% with high-performing teachers. The screening tool demonstrated an acceptable/good validity (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was 0.68 for low-performing teachers and 0.78 for high-performing teachers). Our brief screening tool can facilitate teacher training and recruitment of engaged teachers in implementation of school-based interventions.

AB  - Background: To successfully develop and implement school-based sexual health interventions for adolescent girls, such as screening for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Trichomonas vaginalis, it is important to understand parents' and teachers' attitudes towards sexual health education and acceptability of sexually transmitted infection (STI) screening interventions. Methods: In this qualitative study, we approached parents and teachers from three high schools to participate in in-depth interviews (IDIs) and focus-group discussions (FGDs). Parents and teachers were asked about their general knowledge of STIs and sexual health education. In addition, they were asked whether they would support utilizing outreach to schools to facilitate provision of sexual health education and screening for STIs in adolescent girls. Data were audio-recorded, transcribed, and translated into English. An initial coding matrix was developed and refined throughout the coding process. Transcripts were coded by two researchers and analyzed using the content analysis approach. Results: We conducted 10 IDIs (5 parents and 5 teachers) and 4 FGDs (2 with parents, 2 with teachers, total of 26 participants). Most parents reported few or no discussions regarding STIs with their adolescent girls. Parents were more comfortable discussing consequences of sexual activity including loss of virginity and the potential for pregnancy. Parents tended to place responsibility for sexual health education with teachers. The teachers, in turn, provided basic sexual and reproductive health education including puberty, abstinence, and overview of STIs. Both parents and teachers found the idea of screening for STIs in adolescent girls to be acceptable, and were comfortable with research staff contacting girls through informational meetings at schools. Parents felt that adolescents' STI screening results should be shared with their parents. Conclusion: In this African setting, parents and teachers provide limited sexual health education, with a focus on negative consequences including loss of virginity, pregnancy, and risk for STIs. Nonetheless, both parents and teachers were supportive of STI screening for adolescent girls, beginning with school-based informational meetings for the girls. Research and programs that aim to provide STI screening in this setting must offer treatment and address the issue of whether results will be disclosed to parents.

AB  - Self and peer-assessment are becoming central aspects of student-centred assessment processes in higher education. Despite increasing evidence that both forms of assessment are helpful for developing key capabilities in students, such as taking more responsibility for their own learning, developing a better understanding of the subject matter, assessment criteria and their own values and judgements, and developing critical reflection skills, both forms of assessment are still not the norm at universities. This paper provides the findings of a two-year study of formative self and peer-assessment at an Australian University. The study supports other research showing that students tend to regard formative self and peer-assessment as beneficial for gaining more insights about the assessment process and for improving their own work. We argue that self and peer-assessment requires careful design and implementation for it to be an effective tool for formative assessment processes; and that the development of students' capacities for giving feedback, and the continuous and timely involvement of the teacher, are central aspects for successful self and peer-assessment. The move to self and peer-assessment is not simple for teachers and students but is worthwhile and necessary for twenty-first century higher education. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - We examined social studies teachers' use of text and supports for reading text during their instruction as well as how their practices related to students' content acquisition. A total of 37 social studies teachers and their students (n = 572) participated and recorded their instruction during 3 instructional units. We documented the amount of time teachers engaged in text reading and text reading support. We assessed students on social studies content knowledge. We noted text reading activities in about 10% of the class instruction. The total numbers of minutes spent in text reading and providing support in reading comprehension strategies were significantly related to student content acquisition. Examination of differences in this relationship by student pretest demonstrated that increases in text reading during instruction were associated with increased scores on content acquisition for lower level students. There were no significant associations between text reading practices and content acquisition for higher performing students.

AB  - A two-stage study exploring how undergraduate and postgraduate education of occupational therapists could be enhanced to improve services for people with sight loss looked at the training needs of occupational therapists by examining awareness of sight loss and surveyed all Higher Education Institutes (HEIs) offering a BSc (honours) degree in occupational therapy. The study concluded that the profile of sight loss and interventions to improve occupational performance has been, and remains, generally low in occupational therapy education, that there was strong evidence that qualified occupational therapists and HEIs would welcome the development of further educational opportunities in this area, and that additional resources may be required for this.

AB  - The flipped classroom (FC) andragogy purports an improvement of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in students. This literature review explores fourteen research studies and discusses outcome measures reported on the effectiveness of using this teaching modality. Students described the learning activities during the classroom meeting times as valuable and indicated the interaction and engagement were beneficial to their learning. Many students opined an increased comprehension of the subject matter. Overall, the FC required more work on the part of the students and the faculty, and the majority of students preferred the traditional classroom (TC) passive method of learning over the FC active learning andragogy as a result of the substantial time commitment required for preparation necessitated by the FC. Five of the fourteen studies evaluated student learning outcome measures; four studies showed an improvement in the FC environment compared to the TC and one reported the FC was at least as effective as the TC. Further studies with quantifiable outcome measures are required to determine the effectiveness of a FC on critical thinking and problem-solving skills of nursing students.

AB  - Reviews the book, 'Handbook of pediatric psychology in school settings,' edited by R.T. Brown. The editor argues that health care reform expands the role of psychologist to health care provider with delivery of services transitioning from medical settings to schools. He also stresses that improved disease outcomes are resulting in more and more clients of pediatric psychologists returning to school. He views these shifts as representing a 'new,' 'exciting,' and 'great' field of psychology that encourages pediatric psychologists to integrate their practice into the school setting while also allowing school psychologists to expand their traditional role to provide a wider array of psychological services. In summary, the book represents an extraordinary compilation of topics relating to pediatric health and the need for comprehensive school-based interventions that emphasize family-school healthcare partnerships. This text would be extremely useful for advanced doctoral seminars in both pediatric and school psychology as well as programs training psychologists in the new and emerging discipline of Pediatric School Psychology. Certainly, pediatric psychologists committed to improving their services will benefit from knowledge of disease, disability, special education, consultation, and collaboration in school settings.

Middle-school students (4,734, 72% Latino) responded to questionnaires related to these analyses. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model was fit separately to six substance use outcomes. The results suggested that intervention students who saw four or five videos engaged in less substance use in the past month than did students who saw fewer videos. Having seen the PSAs one or more times did not predict the reported change in substance use. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - What might family support services look like in the reconfigured children and family services after the Children Act? This is the question this article attempts to explore by drawing on evidence from the National Evaluation of the Children's Fund in England. The article describes common features in two case-study sites that might indicate the direction in which some school-based family support work is going. In particular, the article explores the concepts of 'supportive signposting' and 'professional friends'. By examining the characteristics of real family support services, the article attempts to gain insight into the way 'need', 'prevention' and 'support' are defined in the constrained context of practice. By looking at the way local initiatives attempt to give meaning to these concepts in practice may also provide insights into the emergent integrated approach to children's services.

AB  - The research presented in this study focuses on Educational Cultural Negotiators (ECNs). The participants were teachers, administrators, and graduate students in an after-school program in the Midwest and a community-based school/university partnership in the Western U.S. We posit that the roles of the ECNs function as advocacy leaders to invoke racial affirmation, and academic intervention on behalf of African-American and Latina/o students at these school sites. Relying on critical race theory as the methodological analysis of the findings, this study seeks to identify the role of the ECNs as advocates for students in these settings to promote their academic and personal growth and success. This work illustrates how these particular educational leaders provide academic direction and challenge racial neglect and color-blindness within the public school system.

AB  - The last several years have seen a dramatic increase in interest surrounding the role of clinical experiences in enhancing the learning of teacher candidates. Further, pressure has intensified to demonstrate the impact of teacher candidates on P-12 learners. With these goals in mind, a model alternative school/university partnership was created, based on Korthagen's "Realistic Teacher Education" framework. This article is an evaluation of the impact of this intervention on student outcomes from the program's first three years. A convergence of evidence reveals significant improvements in grade point average and credits earned; furthermore, significant improvements in total disciplinary incidents emerged in some of the analyses. These results suggest that this teacher education intervention has promise for documenting impact on P-12 learners. This outcome is significant for accreditation purposes, for bolstering the image of teacher education programs within the broader community, and for establishing a common research agenda.

AB  - As part of a pilot project, four elementary schools were randomly assigned to receive one of four interventions: (a) a schoolwide intervention that incorporated universal and targeted treatment, (b) a targeted-school intervention delivered to individual students in regular and special education classrooms, (c) a targeted-home intervention delivered in home and regular classroom settings, and (d) a control condition that did not receive a designated intervention. Results showed that the behavior of disruptive children in all schools improved during the course of the year, with some evidence that interventions provided complementary effects. These findings support the continued use of behavioral interventions in elementary schools and argue for interventions that combine different methods of delivering interventions.

Examined were intervention programs common to both the New Orleans Public School District and the rural Nacogdoches Independent School District, such as a zero tolerance policy, crime stoppers, accelerated learning centers, the use of police officer liaisons, and social work and counseling services. Results show that schools having ties to families, human service agencies, community police, faith-based organizations, and the community at large are more likely to develop safe schools.

AB  - Research Findings: In order to identify the active ingredients in an effective professional development intervention focused on enhancing preschool vocabulary instruction, this study examines the frequency with which teachers and children discussed theme-related vocabulary words during shared book reading. Head Start teachers received 1 year of training focused upon early vocabulary development. Children's vocabulary skills were assessed in the fall and spring of the school year. In spring, teachers read a storybook to their classroom, and teachers' and children's remarks about theme-related vocabulary during the reading-including contextualized and decontextualized statements as well as verbatim repetitions of one another's statements-were coded. Practice or Policy: Results of multilevel models showed that more frequent references to thematic vocabulary by teachers were linked to stronger child vocabulary development. Although children's vocabulary references were not uniquely predictive of vocabulary learning, teachers' repetition of children's remarks contributed to children's vocabulary gains.

AB  - Five key points in this chapter: (1) The management of child abuse depends on a nationally coordinated and procedurally administered system of child protection. (2) Child protection policy is focused on better prevention and effective early intervention. (3) Child protection systems vary widely between countries and are influenced by their different social, cultural and legal values. All systems recognize the importance of agencies and professionals working together to achieve key outcomes for child health, safety and development. (4) Social workers need to recognize the potential impact of chronic adversity on parental morale and to respond constructively to the concerns of parents and children where abuse is alleged or proven. (5) Social workers need to took for ways of reaching an agreed plan for the child involving the child and her/his parents and all relevant agencies before the child is harmed or compulsory measures becomes necessary.

AB  - The clinical education setting plays an important part in teaching students about the real world of clinical practice. Traditionally the educational relationship between student and clinical educator has been considered one-way, with students being the ones that benefit. This review focuses on the areas of clinician practice and behaviour that students are reported to influence through clinical placements and as such, determine the overall impact students can have on supervising clinicians. Electronic searches were conducted across MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO and CINAHL in July 2016. Retrieved articles were filtered to find those which presented data relating to students in the clinical setting. Data was extracted and analysed independently by two authors through thematic analysis. Twenty-eight studies met the inclusion criteria. Results showed that practitioners enjoy the act of teaching. Clinical student presence encourages clinicians to solidify their knowledge base, stimulates learning and causes them to re-evaluate their practice. Practitioner skills were further developed as a results of students. Clinical educator workload and time spent at work increased when a student was present with time management being the predominant challenge practitioners faced. Studies demonstrated that clinicians feel they benefit by students periodically becoming the teacher. Student placements in clinical practice cause an increase in practitioner workload and lengthen their work day. These perceived limitations are outweighed by the many benefits described by supervising clinicians. Providing clinical education can enrich both the practice, and the practitioner, and the aforementioned advantages should be highlighted when offering or considering the expansion of clinical placements.

AB  - Since the "Kangan Report" (1974), literacy and numeracy (L&N) issues have become an integral component of policy development in Australia's vocational education and training (VET) sector. Debate in the literature is based on competing discourses: functional-economic and social practice. These discourses and globalization of the economy have had a significant impact on shaping L&N policy, resulting in a proliferation of policy initiatives. L&N have moved from being marginalized to being a mainstream component of policy. Through initiatives such as competition in VET, user choice, and training packages, the training reform agenda has led to new roles for VET teachers. Impact of low levels of L&N on VET participation is largely unmeasured and based on anecdotal evidence. A lack of measures or measurement systems limits the ability to quantify it. Numerous approaches effectively support the L&N component of learner activities, but perhaps the most critical is early identification of skill levels. Professional development and teacher education programs have a role in developing L&N support mechanisms and need to focus on recognition of needs, cross-cultural training, technology use, and enhancement of research skills. An effective balance between a focus on the L&N specialist and the VET content specialist is required in the overall approach. Future research directions include workplace insights, policy examination, and participation conceptualization and measurement. (Contains 170 references.) (YLB)

AB  - Objective: This study assessed the impact of Partnerships for Active Children in Elementary Schools (PACES) on children's moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) during physical education (PE) and teachers' incorporation of physical activity promotion strategies after one academic semester (i.e. 4 months) of the intervention. Design: Single group pre-post pilot study. Setting: Three elementary schools in one southeastern metropolitan city in the USA. Methods: Using principles of community-based participatory-research, researchers worked with teachers to identify contextually appropriate physical activity promotion strategies aligned with prevailing recommendations, principles and theories. Outcome measures included accelerometer-derived percent of time children (N = 150) engaged in MVPA. The System for Observing Fitness Instruction Time+ assessed changes in teachers' incorporation of physical activity promotion strategies. Multi-level mixed-effects linear regression estimated differences over time. Results: MVPA increased for girls (22.7%-26.6%) and boys (33.2%-39.0%). Small-sided games (1.0%-9.0%) and teachers' verbal promotion of physical activity (6.4%-13.5%) increased while student's off-task behaviour (6.0%-2.0%) decreased. Lines (20.2%-8.4%) and elimination games (21.6%-13.3%) decreased, but these changes were not statistically significant. Conclusion: PACES shows promise for increasing the percent of time children spend in MVPA during PE but requires further evaluation.

AB  - This study examined the initial effects of a participatory-based, competency-/skill-building professional development workshop for physical education (PE) teachers on the use of physical activity (PA) promotion practices (e.g., eliminating lines, small-sided games) and students' moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). A total of 823 students (52.8% boys) wore accelerometers at baseline (fall 2015) and outcome (spring 2016) on PE and non-PE days. The System for Observing Fitness Instruction Time+ measured changes in PA promotion practices. Teachers (n = 9) attended a 90-minute workshop prior to outcome data collection. Mixed-model linear regressions estimated changes in teacher practices and students' MVPA. Three of the nine targeted PA promotion practices changed in the desired direction (i.e., p < 0.05; increased motor content and lessons taught outdoors, reduced activities with lines), with three more teacher practices trending in the desired direction (i.e., reduced management time and activities with elimination, increased small-sided games). During PE, boys and girls increased MVPA by 2.0 (95% confidence interval [1.1, 3.0]), and 1.3 (95% confidence interval [0.5-2.0]) minutes, respectively. However, there were no statistically significant changes in boys' or girls' MVPA during the school day. Greater implementation of promotion practices by the PE teachers was associated with boys', but not girls', MVPA during PE. Girls in high- and low-implementing teachers' lessons experienced increases in MVPA, suggesting that even small changes in PA promotion practices can increase girls' MVPA during PE. Overall, the workshops were effective at increasing teachers' PA promotion and students' MVPA in PE. Other school-based strategies that complement and extend efforts targeting PE are recommended to increase children's total daily PA.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to engender a space where a variety of critical feminist(s) lenses are interwoven to problematize current discursive practices in linguistic diversity training and to (re)imagine "nueavas posibilidades" for linguistic diversity research/training for pre-kindergarten teachers. Transnational feminists' projects have the potential to illuminate and connect larger global issues with, and that pertain to, local and specific radical projects by incorporating critical reflexive methodological tools. In this article we propose to a) discuss language as a monocultural construction that limits conceptions of language and learning for younger human beings; b) examine the discursive practices of teachers of students who are English as second/third language learners; c) discuss the discourse of sharing codes of power; and finally d) scrutinize interventionist assumptions of educational research.

AB  - The article draws together some preliminary observations that suggest social work is being re-cast in the form of an actuarial programme of low-level functional tasks. The overall effect of this may turn out to be a de-skilling of the social work task. Actuarialism attempts to predict where and who in society poses the greatest risk, such that they are targeted in advance and acted against. A distinctive re-territorialisation of social work is at work involving professional claims and contests of jurisdiction over new tasks, problems, treatments, interventions and academic research. This entails strategies seeking to provide legitimation by formal knowledge and is rooted in particular values about what counts as relevant in social work. It is projected that new forms of technical expertise such as actuarial science come to play a dominant role in defining social work, especially within the neo-liberal political context. In establishing a foundation for this argument, various 'technolo)

AB  - There are long-standing concerns in many developed countries about high workforce turnover within social work and the associated negative impact on service users and agencies. While much research has focused on establishing the antecedents to turnover and retention, less attention has been given to establishing the effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce undesirable turnover. A systematic review of research in social work, teaching and nursing identified and appraised the evidence. Of the 699 unique references identified, fifteen studies were included in this review (all but one from the USA); the lack of consistency in definitions and outcome measurement precluded meta-analysis, but twelve studies were deemed to be of sufficient quality for narrative synthesis. In general, interventions addressing organisational and administrative factors (rather than individual employee factors) produced stronger effects, reinforcing current policies in England and previous research into t)

AB  - Abstract We examined pre-service teachers' professional vision of classroom management (PVCM) before and after their first teaching practicum. Using a standardised, video-based test to measure PVCM, we compared two online- and video-based self-reflection and feedback approaches (IGs) with a conventional coaching and internship supervision (CG). Members of the first IG received video-based peer feedback, whereas members of the second IG received additional expert feedback. Results of the pre–post-test showed that, although, video-based peer feedback can help to promote PVCM, the peer and expert feedback group outperformed the only peer feedback group and had a significantly higher increase than the CG in the total test of PVCM and in the facets of monitoring and managing momentum. Highlights • IG members enhanced their PVCM more than CG members. • Video-based peer feedback can promote PVCM predominantly when combined with expert feedback. • The PV of managing momentum benefits the most from additional expert feedback. • Overall, our results underline the importance of expert feedback to foster PVCM.

AB  - Movement.integration (MI), which involves infusing physical activity (PA) into regular classroom time in schools, is widely recommended to help children meet the national guideline of 60 min of PA each day. Understanding the perspective of elementary classroom teachers (ECTs) toward MI is critical to program planning for interventions/professional development. This study examined the MI perceptions of ECTs in order to inform the design and implementation of a school-based pilot program that focused in part on increasing children's PA through MI. Twelve ECTs (Grades 1-3) from four schools were selected to participate based on their responses to a survey about their use of MI. Based on the idea that MI programming should be designed with particular attention to teachers who integrate relatively few movement opportunities in their classrooms, the intent was to select the teacher who reported integrating movement the least at her/his respective grade level at each school. However, not all of these teachers agreed to participate in the study. The final sample included two groups of ECTs, including eight lowest integrating teachers and four additional teachers. Each ECT participated in an interview during the semester before the pilot program was implemented. Through qualitative analysis of the interview transcripts, four themes emerged: (a) challenges and barriers (e.g., lack of time), (b) current and ideal resources (e.g., school support), (c) current implementation processes (e.g., scheduling MI into daily routines), and (e) teachers' ideas and tips for MI (e.g., stick with it and learn as you go). The themes were supported by data from both groups of teachers. This study's findings can inform future efforts to increase movement opportunities for children during regular classroom time.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine implementation processes in elementary classrooms during a 2-year (Fall 2014 to Spring 2016) pilot intervention program, Partnerships for Active Children in Elementary Schools (PACES). The authors examined the effect of PACES on the extent of movement integration (MI) and changes in teachers' perceptions regarding MI. The sample included classroom teachers (N = 12) in Fall 2014 and Spring 2015, but the number of participants dropped to eight in Fall 2015 and Spring 2016. PACES consisted of three partnership approaches (a virtual community of practice, community-based participatory research, and university service learning) intended to increase the extent of MI in the intervention classrooms. Interviews indicated that the intervention had both strengths and limitations. Building interpersonal support for teachers is important to their use of MI. A different measurement schedule may be required to more thoroughly capture MI instances.

AB  - The effectiveness of a parenting program with 394 Head Start mothers was examined. Nine Head Start centers were randomly assigned to either an experimental condition in which parents, teachers, and family service workers participated in the intervention or a control condition in which the regular Head Start program was offered. Mothers in the intervention group were observed at home to have significantly fewer critical remarks and commands, to use less harsh discipline, and to be more positive and competent in their parenting when compared with control mothers. Teachers reported that intervention mothers were more involved in their children's education and that their children were more socially competent. Intervention children were observed to exhibit significantly fewer conduct problems, less noncompliance, less negative affect, and more positive affect than control children. One year later most of the improvements were maintained. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Early intervention efforts designed to assist parents, teachers, and child therapists to promote children's optimal social and emotional competencies and reduce behavior problems can help lay a positive foundation and put children on a trajectory for future success. The Incredible Years (IY): Parents, Teachers, and Children Training Series is a set of three separate but interlocking evidence-based programs designed to prevent and treat conduct problems and promote social and emotional competence in young children. The first program is for parents, the second for teachers, and the third is for children with conduct or social problems or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. In this chapter, we focus primarily on describing the child-directed play interaction and coaching sections of each of the three IY programs, describing their rationale, theories, and practical uses and how we adjust our approaches to meet the particular developmental needs of each child and family.

AB  - Among all substantiated reports from Child Protective Services for all types of child maltreatment, 17.8% were for physical abuse and 7.6% for emotional abuse. An estimated 1,770 fatalities resulted from all forms of child maltreatment in 2009 nationally, most of which occurred among children aged 3 years or younger (80.8%). Among child fatalities from maltreatment, 23.2% were attributed exclusively to physical abuse, whereas virtually no deaths were exclusively attributed to emotional or psychological abuse. The majority of fatalities were attributed to multiple maltreatment types or child neglect. According to Zimrin,' abused children who grew up to be healthy, nonabusing adults knew an adult during their childhood who treated them with kindness, respect, empathy, and encouragement. School-based professionals are listed in Zimrin's research as one of the major supports in these children's lives. Importantly, this type of support does not require extra time, just sincerity and confidence in the student. Keep in mind that small successes are important for all students, but especially for those students who have been abused. Many abused students are afraid to hope or do not know what success looks like, so they sabotage their own efforts out of fear or frustration or they refuse to try in order to avoid failure. While this can be very challenging for educators, considering the factors that play into the student's behavior and academic performance and providing the school-based supports suggested in this chapter can not only help mitigate the negative effects of abuse but also make the student feel empowered to achieve and succeed.

AB  - This paper reports on a qualitative research synthesis that explored the intersections between art and social work. The scholarship notes a rise in interest in integrating creative arts practices in social work classrooms from assignment design to classroom activities. Also highlighted are the potential contributions of these artsinformed practices to teaching about topics related to oppression. The synthesis presented in this paper explored this potential through an interpretivist analysis of articles on the intersection of art and social work. Findings highlight the contribution of this approach to enhancing student engagement and critical reflexivity; creating a sense of collectivity and solidarity in the classroom; as well as transforming the role of the educator. Findings suggest the need for further research to explore the potential contributions of arts-informed approaches in social work education beyond a single classroom.

AB  - Small-group discussions in which teachers and students interact with text are common in language arts classrooms. As documented in the extant literature, teacher discourse moves affect how the discussion unfolds and the resulting quality of the talk. What is not present in the literature is a unified lexicon or taxonomy for defining and classifying the various kinds of discourse moves teachers routinely enact during small-group discussions to promote comprehension. As such, the purpose of the present review is (a) to synthesize research on teacher discourse moves across the various discussion approaches that aim to promote high-level comprehension and (b) to forward an integrated taxonomy of teacher discourse moves. The taxonomy was developed and iteratively refined through card-sorting activities and used as a coding rubric for classroom discussions. This integrated taxonomy is a noteworthy advancement for practitioners to facilitate their classroom discussions and for researchers studying the effects of small-group discussions.

AB  - Examined the effect of providing functonal analysis information on intervention ratings. Ratings of 55 teachers of students with developmental disabilities for both the acceptability and effectiveness of a range of interventions were analyzed. In addition, analysis was also performed on the impact on these ratings of providing 3 levels of functional information about the targeted problem behavior: (1) structural (descriptive) information, (2) information describing an escape function (negative reinforcement), and (3) information describing an attention function (positive reinforcement). Sample demographics are provided, along with scores on an evaluation of knowledge of behavioral principles and causes of problem behavior. Results show that teachers differentially rated brief interruption and differential reinforcement according to the functional information provided. Severity of the problem behavior did not influence ratings. Implications are discussed in terms of teacher training and support for interventions including functional assessment strategies.

AB  - Experts have heralded domain-specific play-based curricula coupled with regular coaching and training as our "strongest hope" for improving instructional quality in large-scale public preschool programs. Yet, details from different evaluations of the strongest hope model are not systematically compiled, making it difficult to identify specific features across studies that distinguish the most successful implementation efforts. We performed a cross-study review across five diverse large-scale evaluations (n = 6,500 children and n = 750 teachers across 19 localities and multiple auspice types) to identify common features that have characterized successful implementations of this model to date. We identified six features in our exploratory review that may help to flesh out the strongest hope model for localities considering it--a significant focus on specific instructional content, inclusion of highly detailed scripts, incorporation of teacher voice, time for planning, use of real-time data, and early childhood training for administrators. These six features provide more specific guidance for practitioners and help meet calls in preschool and K-12 for more synthesis of implementation lessons from large-scale research trials.

AB  - Describes a feasibility study of the Tea and Families Education and Support (TAFES) intervention used in a group of 86 newly resettled refugees (aged 17-66 yrs) from Kosova in Chicago. The subjects (Ss) gave informed consent to participate in an investigation of the TAFES intervention. All Ss received family home visits, and most participated in the TAFES multi-family groups. The instruments were administered to adult participants before and 3 mo after the intervention. The TAFES program had contact with 61 Kosovar refugee families, of which 42 families (69%) engaged in TAFES groups, including families with educated and working members. Characteristics associated with engaging in TAFES groups included lower monthly family income and higher age of the first child. The uncontrolled postintervention assessments demonstrated increases in social support and psychiatric service use associated with engagement in the TAFES group. Participants also showed time changes in scale scores assessing trauma mental health knowledge, trauma mental health attitudes, and family hardiness. This study provides preliminary evidence that multi-family support and education groups are a feasible and possibly beneficial intervention for newly resettled refugees and indicates the need for further studies.

AB  - Reviews the book, 7 Steps for Success: High School to College Transition Strategies for Students with Disabilities by Elizabeth C. Hamblet (2011). Elizabeth Hamblet, a former high school special education teacher and current learning disabilities specialist at Columbia University, seeks to empower students and their families to manage the challenges unique to college students with disabilities. She describes how procedures, laws, and accommodations that aid students with disabilities throughout their primary and secondary educational years differ considerably from those that apply to postsecondary education. Three broad areas of interest for these students are addressed: pertinent laws and regulations; qualities of successful students; and resources and capacities of colleges to serve the needs of disabled students.

AB  - The authors evaluated the efficacy of RECAP, a psychosocial intervention developed to treat concurrent internalizing and externalizing problem in children. Participants included 93 4th-grade children assigned to the treatment group or a no-treatment control group. The school-based program, which lasts the 9-month academic year, provides individual, group, classroom, teacher, and parent training in the RECAP skills-development curriculum, which was derived from empirically supported treatment programs for nonconcurrent internalizing and externalizing problems. Outcome assessments included parent-, teacher-, self-, and peer reports. A mixed hierarchical linear models analysis indicated that, overall, treatment children's rate of improvement in both internalizing and externalizing problems was significantly greater than that for control participants.

AB  - In 2000, as a response to rising social expectations in forest areas, a French region (the Limousin), in partnership with the State, initiated an innovative regional framework for establishing sustainable forest management. This initially involved the launch of two forestry programmes on a regional basis - the creation of a forestry charter for the Périgord-Limousin Regional Nature Park, and a programme of planned forestry management sponsored by the Limousin Regional Centre for Forest Property (CRPF). The broader aim of the regional framework was to establish a beacon of sustainable forestry management, which could be transferred elsewhere in France. The purpose of this article is to provide an evaluation of the utility of this regional sustainable development framework and, in particularly, the continuous assessment approach that was used as a key policy instrument for supporting collective learning amongst participants. The argument underpinning this aim is two-fold: first, to demonstrate the benefits of continuous assessment in helping to establish a sustainable development policy; and, second, to highlight the importance of a regional perspective in embedding an effective sustainable development policy.

AB  - This cross-sectional quantitative study expands the knowledge on the level of involvement of social work academics (SWAs) in social policy formulation processes, and the factors associated with this. SWAs are an interesting case for exploring the academia-policy nexus because they are affiliated with a profession in which the discourse regards social policy as a target of intervention. The study took place in Israel, where social work is strongly embedded in academia and enjoys relatively high professional status. The study drew upon a sample, which consisted of 57 per cent of all SWAs in Israel, and employed questionnaires developed specifically for the study. The findings show that the highest levels of involvement were in activities characterized by more active, public sphere routes of influence within the policy arena that were undertaken in conjunction with traditional social work partners. Social work scholars engaged in these activities more during the initial stages of the policy process. These forms of policy involvement reflect the dual impact of academia and the social work profession upon SWAs. Associated with level of involvement were individual factors, which included academic rank, perception of the social role of academia, perceived individual policy role, and perceived policy competencies. By contrast, factors linked to institutional support for policy engagement were not found to be associated with policy involvement.

AB  - Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) is a time-limited treatment described in a manual and tested in numerous clinical trials, with and without medication. Four recent clinical trials are reviewed in situations where medication as a first-line treatment for depression was not feasible (pregnancy, post partum, adolescence and in a developing country). The results show the efficacy of 12-16 wk of IPT compared to treatment as usual or no treatment in reducing depressive symptoms. The therapists providing the treatment included psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers as well as non-mental-health workers. We do not know if these patients might have done even better with medication, but each study showed a significant remission of symptoms of patients in IPT compared to controls. The use of efficacious, time-limited psychotherapy, which can be administered by non-medical personnel can be economical. An obstacle to providing evidence-based psychotherapies is the paucity of practitioners trained in them. Until the gap between training in psychotherapy and the research evidence in psychotherapy is bridged in training programmes, it will be difficult to provide patients with these treatments.

The contributors to this volume convincingly demonstrate that the art and technique of working productively with children and young people in the care system is not only achievable, but essential. The contributors attempt to restore the centrality and value of social work practice. This dense and rich volume will be useful reading to both students and experienced social work practitioners. It has a contemporary edge. Some chapters were underdeveloped, and a wider evidence base might have been sought by others. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - AIM: To define the clinical competencies currently required by on-call consultant paediatricians in Sweden and to describe how these competencies can be acquired by using an outcome-based continuing professional development (CPD) programme. METHODS: The overall aims and objectives of the programme were formulated to meet the current responsibilities of an on-call consultant. It was delineated during a precourse needs assessment of 26 consultants, before being implemented with 16 participants, using a variety of learning, assessment and evaluation methods. RESULTS: The precourse needs assessment identified 217 clinical situations and 17 themes, and 139 subthemes were developed. During the programme evaluation, carried out using a reflective questionnaire, participants stated that they had improved their understanding of the role of, and demands on, the on-call consultant. They had also felt more confident on-call, had built a network of colleagues and updated their knowledge in relevant fields. CONCLUSION: We defined and implemented a competency-based CPD programme to meet the changing demands faced by on-call consultant paediatricians. The aims and objectives of the programme were formulated according to a needs assessment among consultant paediatricians active in on-call services. Evaluation of the programme indicates that participants moved in the direction of the overall objectives.

AB  - Reviews the book, Teacher Education and Black Communities: Implications for Access, Equity, and Achievement edited by Yolanda Sealey-Ruiz, Chance W. Lewis, and Ivory A. Toldson (2014). The book explores the preparation of teachers in a manner that weaves adroitly theory and practice. The book focuses on three central questions: How do we prepare all teachers to teach Black Students? How do we encourage and prepare Black students to become teachers? How do teachers' race and racial identities contribute to access, equity and achievement for Black students? Most significantly, the book reflects on the education of Black students, as well as how Black teachers' own identities and experiences influence practice. Subsequently, the volume also explicitly seeks to draw in a larger audience of researchers and practitioners concerned about the intersection between teacher education and Black communities. Therefore, the editors and their contributors intentionally push the reader to action, making clear the macro- and micro-level dimensions of teacher preparation and schooling for Black children.

The study used a sample of 11,222 adolescents who completed the School Success Profile for school assessment purposes. Findings: Latent class analysis identified four patterns of vicarious and anticipated strain among adolescents. The patterns varied by sample members' gender-race combinations. The latent class solution was replicated with two subsamples and validated by testing its association with behavior problems. Application: Evidence-based practices are suggested for students experiencing different combinations of strain, and specific applications for social work practice are presented.

AB  - In recent decades, K-12 school discipline policies and practices have garnered increasing attention among researchers, policymakers, and educators. Disproportionalities in school discipline raise serious questions about educational equity. This study provides a comprehensive review of the extant literature on the contributors to racial, gender, and income disparities in disciplinary outcomes, and the effectiveness of emerging alternatives to exclusionary disciplinary approaches. Our findings indicate that the causes of the disparities are numerous and multifaceted. Although low-income and minority students experience suspensions and expulsions at higher rates than their peers, these differences cannot be solely attributed to socioeconomic status or increased misbehavior. Instead, school and classroom occurrences that result from the policies, practices, and perspectives of teachers and principals appear to play an important role in explaining the disparities. There are conceptual and open empirical questions on whether and how some of the various alternatives are working to counter the discipline disparities.

AB  - Abstract In recent decades, school discipline policies and practices in K-12 education resulting in school exclusion have garnered substantial attention and represent an important challenge with significant policy and equity implications. Given the central role that school exclusion plays in discipline policies and practices, it is important to critically assess the pathways, rates, and harms associated with school exclusion. This study provides a systematic review of the interdisciplinary literature on the relationship between school exclusion and students' short- and long-term educational and life outcomes. Although there are a handful of possible pathways, the most frequent pathway though which school discipline results in school exclusion are suspensions. The results of this systematic review indicate that school exclusion is not an efficacious response to student misbehavior given the short and long term correlates with negative student educational and life outcomes. There are several plausible mechanisms through which school exclusion may affect student outcomes but there is little empirical evidence on these mechanisms. Highlights • Suspensions are the most frequent pathway through which school discipline results in school exclusion. • Students receive exclusionary discipline for low- (e.g., tardiness) and high- (e.g., fighting) level offenses. • African Americans experience the highest rates of school exclusion and males are excluded at higher rates than females. • There is little evidence on the mechanisms through which exclusion may affect student outcomes or school exclusion effects. • School exclusion is not an effective response to misbehavior given the correlates to negative educational and life outcomes [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study examined the effects of a collaborative/integrative service delivery model compared with a traditional pull-out model on the cognitive, language, and social development of children having special needs ages 2 through 5 years. Pretest and posttest developmental data were compared for 69 preschool children with special needs receiving one of two treatment approaches: a collaborative/integrative model of in-class related service provision, and a traditional pull-out mode of providing related services. Gains in cognitive, expressive and receptive language, and social development were examined. Analysis of data after one school year indicated that the children participating in the collaborative/integrative model made significantly greater overall gains in general, and in cognitive development in particular, than did the children in the pull-out model. Teacher ratings of consultation and participant interviews are discussed. The findings support this integrative attempt at comprehensive intervention for preschool children based on collaborative and transdisciplinary models as a viable alternative for the provision of therapeutic and educational services and look to be a best practice for early intervention.

AB  - In the current review, we examined teacher leadership research completed since York-Barr and Duke published the seminal review on teacher leadership in 2004. The review was undertaken to examine how teacher leadership is defined, how teacher leaders are prepared, their impact, and those factors that facilitate or inhibit teacher leaders' work. Beyond this, the review considered theories informing teacher leadership, teacher leadership within disciplinary contexts, and the roles of teacher leaders in social justice and equity issues. The most salient findings were (a) teacher leadership, although rarely defined, focused on roles beyond the classroom, supporting the professional learning of peers, influencing policy/decision making, and ultimately targeting student learning; (b) the research is not always theoretically grounded; (c) principals, school structures, and norms are important in empowering or marginalizing teacher leaders; and (d) very little teacher leadership research examines issues of social justice and equity.

AB  - Research Findings: Preschool behavior problems are of increasing concern to early childhood educators. Preventive interventions are being developed, but implementation in underresourced child care programs is challenging. This study describes the implementation of an adapted Second Step curriculum to increase children's social skills and decrease behavior problems in preschool classrooms. Teacher training/coaching, organizational supports, and procedures for sustainability are described. Measures included baseline classroom characteristics, lesson completion and fidelity, and teacher satisfaction. Teachers completed 88% of the lessons across 2 years. Follow-up monitoring in Year 3, once all training was terminated, found that 95% of lessons were delivered with higher fidelity than in the first 2 years. Teachers were satisfied with the training, felt that the curriculum improved children's social skills, and stated that they would continue to use the curriculum. Lesson completion and fidelity were associated with various teacher characteristics, training attendance, classroom characteristics, teacher and child turnover, and the percentage of children with developmental delays in the classroom. Practice or Policy: The results support the implementation strategy and suggest that paying attention to teacher morale, general skill development, and a period of ongoing support for training is important and will lead to sustainable and high implementation rates.

AB  - Educational institutions have been identified as ideal locations to implement health promotion strategies that aim to prevent and treat youth obesity. However, the tertiary training of future health promoters currently lacks health and nutrition instruction. This study sought to investigate attitudes towards youth obesity and perceptions of the roles of schools and educators in strategies to treat and prevent youth obesity. Participants (n = 155) were tertiary students who enrolled in a general-level health and nutrition elective that housed an intervention to increase awareness of obesity. Baseline and post-intervention responses to the Perceptions of Youth Obesity and Health Education questionnaire were collected and compared spanning the 12 weeks. Agreement that health is linked to being of normal weight and that general educators should have a major role in school strategies did not waver over the course of the intervention. The belief that schools are ideal places for obesity prevention strategies was higher at baseline than post-intervention. It was desired that obesity awareness would increase but perceived importance of involvement of school staff in youth obesity strategies did not increase. Further research is required to investigate the influence of attitudes and perceptions held by future health promoters towards their roles in prevention and treatment strategies on professional practice.

AB  - This article investigates the continuing professional development (CPD) culture of teachers, and asks how it is influenced by properties of the school system. It reports the results of a questionnaire study with 418 secondary teachers from Sweden and Germany. The results show highly significant differences between Swedish and German teachers’ practice of and beliefs in teachers’ CPD. This implies a relevant effect of properties of the school system on the teachers’ CPD. The differences are explained by varying perceptions of sources of knowledge for CPD, the influence of different school governance instruments, and different historically developed role definitions of teachers in both countries.

AB  - This article aims to investigate teachers’ perception of sources of knowledge in their continuing professional development (CPD). It investigates whether the perceived importance of a source can be related to its trustworthiness. Knowledge sources comprise institutions and colleagues, who produce knowledge for teachers’ development. The issues are examined by analysis of questionnaire studies on teachers’ CPD with a sample size of 711 teachers in Germany and Sweden. The results show that a knowledge source’s trustworthiness is a relevant and significant predictor for its importance in teachers’ CPD. However, the national context in which teachers work also has a considerable influence.

AB  - This thesis investigates teachers’ perceptions of continuing professional development (CPD) in Germany and Sweden with a questionnaire study comprising a total of 711 mainly lower secondary teachers. Three conceptual terms are elaborated and explained. Teachers act in a CPD marketplace that is constituted by several sources of knowledge which offer opportunities for teachers’ development. How teachers act in the marketplace is a key part of their CPD culture. The study reveals similarities in the two cases regarding the importance of colleagues as well as informal development activities, but there are also significant differences. One the one hand, German teachers can be described as more active in their CPD than their Swedish colleagues in relation to particular aspects of their profession such as assessment, and more suspicious of knowledge from elsewhere, on the other. In order to understand the differences, I argue for an extended focus on the impact of the national context, in terms of socially and historically significant structures and traditions of the teaching profession. The thesis focuses on a crucial aspect with a particular explanatory value for differing CPD tendencies in various national contexts: Autonomy from a governance perspective. This phenomenon, which does indeed change across time and space, is investigated from a socio-historical perspective in both contexts, building on Margaret Archer’s analytic dualism of structure and agency, and a dual pronged model of teacher autonomy. The latter distinguishes institutional autonomy, regarding legal or status issues, from service autonomy related to the practical issues in schools and classrooms. Since these dimensions can be either extended or restricted, different categories evolve which enable us to understand the differences between the two cases. Finally, by using the findings on the German and Swedish teaching profession, a theoretical framework is presented that relates the certain forms of teacher autonomy in particular national contexts to likely CPD cultures that teachers share.

AB  - This chapter presents a research study on trust in sources of knowledge for teachers’ continuing professional development (CPD), comparing two national contexts, Germany and Sweden. From the vantage point of the project’s findings, considerations are made about trust in institutions, which for example offer CPD for teachers, and trust as a property in school systems. Examining trust relationships beyond the individual school community requires an understanding of the effect of nation-specific particularities on the emergence of trust. This chapter proposes to focus on the trustworthiness of institutions from the teachers’ perspective. It is argued that trustworthiness can be partly measured through the same categories that are demonstrated to be productive for examining relational trust, as proposed by Bryk and Schneider (Trust in schools. A core ressource for improvement, New York, Russell Sage Foundation, 2004), including perceived competence, understanding and respect of others. It is furthermore argued that trust and trustworthiness in school systems should be investigated by comparative case study designs that depict trust as an aspect of complex interrelated systems in different contexts. In addition, in order to understand trust as property of systems, data are required that capture the collective voice of the teaching profession. With respect to the proposed case study, the findings of the questionnaire study must then be interpreted in both a case and a socio-historically sensitive manner, in order to give meaning to similarities and differences of trust between the countries investigated. Finally, also drawing on Bryk and Schneider (Trust in schools. A core ressource for improvement, New York, Russell Sage Foundation, 2004), this chapter suggests different categories of trust that can contribute to a conceptualisation of diverse context-specific trust patterns. These are illustrated by examples taken from the German and Swedish cases.

AB  - Building on existing research on Self-Regulated Strategy Development (SRSD), the current study investigated the collateral effects of social skills prompts on the writing outcomes and problem behavior of students with emotional and behavioral disorders (EBD). Generalization measures involved the use of video prompts to explore their impact (if any) on the overall writing outcomes, and if there was an inclination towards either (i.e., written prompts vs. video prompts). Three upper elementary students receiving special education services in separate behavior support classrooms were taught opinion writing using the SRSD instructional framework. The number of genre elements in participants' written products was measured using a genre elements rubric. Other outcome measures included the quantity of written products and the frequency of occurrence of problem behaviors during 20-min observational sessions. Additionally, pre- and post-intervention social validity data were collected to gain teacher and student perspectives regarding the intervention. Overall results suggested a functional relation between SRSD instruction and the number of genre elements and quantity of students' opinion writing. Specifically, all participants increased their genre elements score by 68% while writing an average of six sentences and 84 words more per essay response after receiving SRSD instruction with social skills prompts. Results for behavior were promising. Implications for practice and suggestions for future research are discussed.

Suggests that the way professional roles are perceived and enacted offers limited scope in addressing these challenges. Introduces the concept of expanding roles to include collaborative reflective inquiry within communities of practice as one way to reform professional practices. Suggests that reflection within communities of practice not only extends understanding, insight and command of work situations, but also holds the potential to advance the field as a whole.

AB  - The teaching of reading is a core priority across the education sector. In an attempt to better prepare our next generation of professional teachers of reading, academic staff at an Australian university implemented coursework changes that were designed to enhance the phonological awareness and orthographic knowledge of first-year preservice teacher education students. All students were asked to complete written surveys measuring phonological awareness and orthographic knowledge during class-time at the start and end of their first semester of study. During the semester, students were expected to complete two online modules on phonological awareness and orthographic conventions and pass an online quiz (worth 10% of their grade) as part of their course on the Teaching of Reading and Writing. Education students' performance in phonological awareness and orthographic knowledge improved significantly over the course of the semester. However, a significant percentage of students failed to achieve mastery level in phoneme-level awareness. Implications and future directions for current higher education practices are presented.

AB  - The present study explored teachers' perspectives on one specific type of acceleration, namely, grade skipping. In addition, we investigated the extent to which teachers' beliefs about students' academic, motivational, and social development after grade skipping may explain teachers' acceptance of this accelerative strategy. Moreover, we examined whether teachers' acceptance is linked to their decisions about using this intervention. Using data from the PARS project, which included 316 teachers from 18 secondary schools in the German federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia, we assessed teachers' acceptance, beliefs, and perceived knowledge about grade skipping using 4-point rating scales. Teachers also reported whether they had advised a student to skip a grade. Multilevel regression analyses indicated that teachers' beliefs about students' social, motivational, and academic development largely explained their acceptance. Teachers who showed a higher level of acceptance and perceived knowledge were more likely to have recommended grade skipping before. Educational implications are discussed.

The developmental time period from birth through age 5 years is one of significant growth and maturity, particularly in the neurological development of the child. An injury to the brain can compromise the neurological integrity of the brain and can disrupt subsequent development and associated functions. A TBI may significantly impact how the child learns core academic skills, interacts with peers, expresses wishes, wants, and emotions, and may shape his or her role in the family. In addition to reviewing this important emergent area, this article addresses the available literature on the epidemiology of TBI in the preschool years, causes and neuropathological mechanisms, functional outcomes, and selected factors that affect outcomes. The review concludes with a listing of implications for the early childhood special educator. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Intervention Description 1 The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (NBPTS) establishes standards for accomplished teachers and awards profes-sional certification to teachers who can demonstrate that their teach-ing practices meet those standards. Educators and experts in child development and related fields established the organization, and these experts work to develop and refine the standards for accom-plished teaching based on the knowledge and skills that effective teachers demonstrate. The standards reflect five core propositions: (1) effective teachers are committed to students and their learning, (2) effective teachers know the subjects they teach and how to teach those subjects to students, (3) effective teachers manage and moni-tor student learning, (4) effective teachers think systematically about their practice and learn from experience, and (5) effective teachers are members of learning communities. Those seeking certification from the NBPTS must complete a computer-based assessment and three portfolio entries. The certification process can take 1 to 5 years. 2 Research 3 The What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) identified five studies of NBPTS certification that both fall within the scope of the Teacher Training, Evaluation, and Compensation topic area and meet WWC group design standards. No studies meet WWC group design standards without reservations, and five studies meet WWC group design standards with reservations. Together, these studies included more than 1,316,146 elementary and middle school students in grades 3 to 8 in four states. 4

AB  - Background/Context: Since the 1970s, researchers have attempted to link observational measures of instructional process to student achievement (and occasionally to other outcomes of schooling). This paper reviews extensively both historical and contemporary research to identify what is known about effective teaching. Purpose/Objective: Good, after reviewing what is known about effective teaching, attempts to apply this to current descriptions of effective teaching and its application value for practice. Good notes that much of the "new" research on effective teaching has simply replicated what has been known since the 1980s. Although this is not unimportant (since it shows that older findings still pertain to contemporary classrooms), it is unfortunate that research has not moved beyond the relationship between general teacher behavior (those that cut across subject areas) and student achievement (as measured by standardized tests). How this information can be applied and the difficulty in using this information is examined in the paper. Research Design: The paper is a historical analysis and reviews research on teaching from the 1960s to today. Conclusion: This paper has stressed that our data base on effective teaching is limited--still it has some implications for practice. Even though the knowledge base is limited, there is no clear knowledge that teachers-in-training learn and have the opportunity to practice and use. It would seem that teacher education programs would want to assure that their graduates, in addition to possessing appropriate knowledge, would also have clear conceptual understanding and skills related to active teaching, proactive management, communication of appropriate expectations for learning, and the ability to plan and enact instruction that balances procedural and conceptual knowledge. Future research on the use of this knowledge base and its effects in teacher education programs would be informative. If done correctly, research on teaching can improve instruction. However, the research must be applied carefully if it is to have useful effects. And, as noted often in this paper, research must consider outcomes of schooling other than achievement such as creativity, adaptability, and problem finding.

We surveyed middle school teachers one year after their participation in a randomized trial where they were introduced to SCMW curriculum, to identify factors related to their continued use of the materials in ways congruent with the developers' intent. Fifty-two percent of teachers surveyed sustained their use of the SCMW curriculum. Factors related to sustained use included student SES, pre-intervention student mathematics ability, teachers' perceived coherence and perceived utility of the intervention, and the active nature of the SCMW professional development.

However, two children with co-morbid diagnoses and complex personal circumstances showed less consistent improvements. In order to explain their unique trajectories, not readily derived from quantitative studies, an exploratory case study approach was used to examine contextual influences on patterns of progress. Multiple data sources included coded video footage from the Get REAL programme, school reports on conduct, and parents and classroom teacher reports using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. While results provide support for the efficacy of the Get REAL programme for the two children, they also highlight the value of co-ordinated strategies and collaborative individualised approaches in more complex cases. This paper outlines the Get REAL intervention and a range of other school and support agency strategies impacting progress. (Contains 2 tables and 9 figures.)

AB  - Debate about the definition of a "child" occurs in multi-disciplinary contexts, most recently located in the new sociology of childhood where social constructionism is the dominant discourse. Given that the child's voice has become an increasingly valued component of research, this paper reports on one aspect of a study which explored how 7-11-year-olds (N = 56) defined and understood the concept of "a child". Data were categorised into four types: physical, behavioural, lifestyle and criteria-referenced descriptors. Dominant theoretical elements such as agency, social construction, relational understanding and notions of themselves as beings were evident in the children's responses. However, the importance of the biological and developmental bases of childhood and their sense of becoming adults were stronger than is sometimes acknowledged in the literature. The implications for education of these two digressions from contemporary theoretical discourse are considered in light of the Cambridge Primary Review which calls for a reshaping of primary education and initial teacher training in England to include childhood as a central concept.

AB  - In this topical issue of "The Journal of Special Education," leading scholars in special education reviewed the literature and investigated whether special education is, indeed, special by examining to what degree (a) effective techniques have been developed for students with disabilities, (b) these effective techniques are applied and implemented with fidelity, and (c) utilization of these techniques is unique to special education. In this article, the authors analyze findings from this special issue regarding what is special--effective, implemented, and unique--about special education. The authors found that effective, empirically supported practices have been developed for students with disabilities, that these techniques are used predominantly in special education, and that these effective practices are not implemented regularly or with fidelity. Recommendations to enhance the implementation of effective, research-based practices are offered.

AB  - Although students with emotional or behavioral disorders have historically experienced poor school outcomes compared to other students with and without disabilities, a number of effective practices are available that can make special education for students with emotional or behavioral disorders special. Within the three broad intervention areas of inappropriate behavior, academic learning problems, and interpersonal relationships, we provide a brief overview of a number of empirically validated practices. We argue that teaching students with emotional or behavioral disorders demands unique interventions that are beyond that typically available or necessary in general education. We conclude that special education "is" special for students with emotional or behavioral disorders and that it can be even more special with greater efforts at implementing research-based practices early, with integrity, and sustaining these interventions over the course of students' school careers.

AB  - Controversy has surrounded the annual National Assessment Program-Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN) since its introduction in 2008. This initiative was designed to provide nationally consistent information on student progress in basic skills in years 3, 5, and 7, replacing the various state-based tests that preceded it. A great deal of criticism has been generated, particularly by teacher organisations and education faculties, and published prominently in the media. Parents have been understandably concerned when they hear their children's teachers calling for the end to NAPLAN. This paper takes the position that, despite its current shortcomings, a national assessment program is an essential pre-requisite to the progress of education in Australia.

AB  - Introduction: Anxiety and depression in adolescence is prevalent but often unrecognised and untreated. This can lead to serious disorders in later life. This study explored how teachers recognise anxiety and depression in secondary school students and act on their concerns. Method: Twenty teachers from four secondary colleges in regional Victoria, Australia were interviewed regarding their experiences. In-depth interviews were analysed using descriptive thematic analysis in order to understand how teachers respond to this issue. Results: Teachers' recognition of mental health problems in students and the threshold for reporting their concerns was subjective and not based on any formal knowledge of how to identify anxiety or depression risk factors in students. Years of teaching experience was not associated with increased knowledge of mental health problems in students. Time pressures and lack of resources in student wellbeing teams were barriers to teachers reporting their concerns about students. Conclusion: Education bodies and teaching universities responsible for training teachers and providing ongoing professional learning need to ensure that mental health training is part of every teacher's core skill set, so that teachers can confidently promote mental wellbeing, identify emerging mental health problems, know how to facilitate access to more specialist intervention where required and contribute effectively to follow-up support.

AB  - Past research has shown that students with disabilities (SWD) at the postsecondary level who use accommodations demonstrate greater academic achievement and higher graduation rates. Only limited research has been conducted to identify the barriers they face in using accommodations, and that research has not sampled a population specifically identified as having faced such barriers. Through interviews with SWD identified as having faced barriers to using accommodations, this study identified six themes; four were considered complex, as they contained subthemes. The four were a desire for self-sufficiency, a desire to avoid negative social reactions, insufficient knowledge, and the quality and usefulness of disability student services and accommodations. The two straightforward themes were negative experiences with professors and fear of future ramifications. It is hoped that these findings help disability student services providers and SWD make better and more informed decisions regarding the use of effective accommodations.

Classroom observations, questionnaires and in-depth interviews with teachers were used to explore teachers’ practices and attitudes. Research was also conducted into the nature of the Khmer language. These preparations informed the design of the programme implemented in 127 rural schools. The success of the intervention was evaluated through classroom observations and a survey of teachers. Pupils’ reading was assessed in a sample of the intervention schools and compared with a sample of pupils in schools without the intervention. Results showed that most teachers in Cambodia use a one-strategy approach to teaching reading but that reading competence remains poor. In comparison, the assessment of pupils following the training of teachers in a multiple-strategy approach sh)

AB  - This working paper provides background for the U.S. Department of Education's first report to the nation on teacher quality, informing the ongoing work on state policy contexts for the improvement of teaching undertaken by the Center for the Study of Teacher Policy. The main goal is to illustrate the range of state-initiated actions aimed at improving the quality of teaching. Section 1 addresses state attention to educational reform and quality of teaching (recent focus on teaching quality, critical roles of states, and how states can promote teaching quality). Section 2 discusses how states are promoting visions of good teaching and learning (student standards and assessments, standards for teaching practice, and independent professional standards boards). Section 3 examines how states are attracting, rewarding, and retaining capable people in teaching (teacher recruitment needs, recruiting teachers and facilitating their mobility, ensuring teacher qualifications, using salaries to attract and retain teachers, and removing unqualified teachers). Section 4 discusses how states are improving the initial preparation and induction of teachers (standards and accountability, alternative certification, and beginning teacher induction programs). Section 5 looks at how states are motivating and supporting teachers' ongoing professional learning (differences in the quality of opportunities for professional learning, state guidance and resources for professional development, and developing or mandating specific targets for professional development). Section 6 discusses how states are enhancing the school workplace environment. (Contains 47 endnotes.) (SM)

AB  - Over the past several decades, federal and state governments, school districts and education leaders have invested significant resources to develop assessments and data systems to track student performance. Yet little attention has been paid to the importance of building the capacity of teachers in assessment so that they are prepared to use data on student learning to inform and improve instruction. As part of our "National Review of Teacher Preparation Programs", the National Council on Teacher Quality (NCTQ) is examining the extent to which teacher preparation programs train teachers to understand assessment data and use that data to make informed instructional adjustments. Our preliminary findings are cause for concern: At best, teacher preparation programs in this preliminary sample are providing limited training to candidates in the field of assessment and data use. As a result, schools end up employing teachers who lack the training necessary to make use of information increasingly at hand. (Contains 4 footnotes.)

This success is attributed to three factors which are teacher effectiveness and educational intervention. Teacher training programs accept only undergraduates from the top 10 percent of their classes. In America, the author argues, novice teachers are paid too little and there is a lack of learning communities for teachers.

AB  - The idea behind guided pathways is straightforward. College students are more likely to complete a degree in a timely fashion if they choose a program and develop an academic plan early on, have a clear road map of the courses they need to take to complete a credential, and receive guidance and support to help them stay on plan. However, most community colleges, rather than offering structured pathways to a degree, operate on a self-service or "cafeteria" model, allowing students to choose from an abundance of disconnected courses, programs, and support services. Students often have difficulty navigating these choices and end up making poor decisions about what program to enter, what courses to take, and when to seek help. Many drop out of college altogether. Many community college reform efforts have sought to improve rates of student completion by scaling up discrete interventions focused on only one element of the college experience. The guided pathways model, in contrast, entails a systemic redesign of the student experience from initial connection to college through to completion, with changes to program structure, new student intake, instruction, and support services. This research overview--part one in Community College Research Center's (CCRC's) guided pathways practitioner packet--describes the reform model and summarizes evidence supporting its design principles.

AB  - In the last two decades, a myriad of political and social factors have converged and had a dramatic impact on Early Childhood Education (EC) and Early Childhood Special Education (ECSE). There have been sweeping changes in policy and shifts in society that have resulted in greater numbers of programs serving young children of all abilities and their families. Great strides in research related to early childhood development and early intervention have provided a growing knowledge of how children learn. The combination of these factors has created a call for increasingly higher quality services for young children. Professionals in both EC and ECSE have been responding to the demands and taken steps to prepare more and better-qualified teachers for children enrolled in early childhood programs. The most immediate avenue for effecting change in the profession is through the programs that prepare our teachers for the classrooms and the child care centers. This article reviews the research and the rationale regarding the implementation of integrated EC/ECSE programs. (Contains 1 table.)

AB  - The effect of intervention activities on the chemistry content knowledge of 92 preservice chemistry teachers (PSCT) was examined via a pre and post true/false with confidence level test focusing on ionisation energy values and the use of a common alternative conception (AC). Data were collected from three cohorts of PSCT each engaged in a one year full-time university-based teacher education programme. Comparison of pre-and post-test responses and discrimination differences between responses for each PSCT were used to identify the use of the AC and hence the efficacy of the intervention activities. Interviews with 14 of these PSCT allowed triangulation of the data. Findings suggest that the activities allow 71% of PSCT to identify this AC as non-scientific or become more confident in doing so. Interview data indicate that this rejection of this AC is sustained for 9 of the 11 PSCT whose test data indicated improvement. These data have implications for teacher education such that 2 hour intervention sessions can offer the opportunity for PSCT to develop their subject matter knowledge. As the accurate application of electrostatic concepts to electrons has wider application to bonding, these interventions offer PSCT more accurate chemical subject knowledge resources to draw on in their teaching.

AB  - The intentional injury of one's own body, otherwise known as self-injury, is a relatively common phenomenon among adolescents today. Although many students self-injure, physical educators should not consider self-injury a normal developmental experience that does not warrant attention. Rather, physical educators are encouraged to recognize self-injury as a sign of emotional distress and use their role within the school to connect students with appropriate mental-health support services. This article presents a brief overview of self-injury, including demographics, types and functions. In addition, it provides information on how to identify and have conversations with students about self-injury, and make appropriate referrals to the school counselor. It should be clear that the physical educator is not expected to counsel students, but rather, identify the symptoms and take the appropriate steps when self-injury is suspected.

AB  - Kinder Training provides an opportunity for teachers to talk about challenging behaviors and their cognitive and relational reactions to them and to learn new ways of relating with students that foster a healthy bond and support a climate for learning. Kinder Training is an effective teacher consultation model based on developmentally appropriate strategies for making positive connections between teachers and students. It is grounded in universally held principles that support the importance of play for healthy child development and Adlerian psychology. Combining play principles and language with Adlerian concepts and techniques provides a consistently effective approach for teachers to use when relating to their students and managing their classrooms. Play is critical to the healthy development of all children. It is through play that a child can truly communicate. Kinder Training is a method of consultation that empowers educators to connect with students in a manner that encourages personal development and academic achievement. Kinder Training helps educators develop new ideas about how to conceptualize students and learn and use communication skills that can enhance the student-teacher relationship.

AB  - This study focuses on teacher and student co-learning with assistive technologies (such as text-to-speech readers) in a specialized program for students with learning disabilities. Canadian students in Grades 4-5 who were reading well below grade level were selected for this intensive intervention. Study participants include both teachers and students. Research includes qualitative data collected from teacher observations and interviews, as well as a detailed analysis of the student participants’ reading and comprehension scores on tests. The researcher and teachers engaged in systematic (weekly) review and analysis of their perceptions of student progress based on both the reading and comprehension data and observations, and then made mid-course corrections in the technology approaches used in the reading intervention program. Results indicate that this assistive technology intervention, guided by teacher-researcher collaboration and reflection, yielded both student and teacher gains. This study attempts to address gaps in the literature, demonstrating that assistive technologies, introduced in a timely way and implemented with support, can provide measurable gains in reading fluency, comprehension, and engagement. This study also shows the potential gains from teacher-researcher collaboration when introducing new technologies, while illustrating some of the current complexities associated with assistive technology interventions in school settings.

AB  - Skoning (2010) stated that special and general education teachers are challenged to effectively meet the academic needs of their students. No matter how frequently class materials are read, discussed, and reviewed, some students do not understand the information or remember it when asked to recall information later. Literature has shown that there is a connection between kinesthetic movement, executive functioning and academic achievement. Brain based learning and multiple intelligence theories depict how individuals take in, retain and learn information. Theorist postulate that academic motivation combined with academic self-efficacy can improve academic achievement. (Caine & Caine, 1991; Campbell & Campbell, 1999). The researcher conducted a quasi-experimental study that aimed to investigate the effects of the Jacob's Pillow Curriculum in Motion Program (a kinesthetic/dance movement program) on the academic motivation, academic self-efficacy, and executive functioning of high school students. Furthermore, this study explored how students self-identified multiple intelligence abilities impacted the relationship between JP-CIM and the outcome variables. The participants in the study were 86 students who attended a public high school in Berkshire County Massachusetts. The intervention group consisted of 37 students and the control group consisted of 49 students. Quantitative results indicated that although there were some changes in the student scores on the outcome variables from time 1 to time 2, the two groups did not differ significantly. Results also revealed that there was no significant difference on the outcome variables of the students who had perceived high and perceived low kinesthetic intelligence. Although there were no statistically significant findings, further examination of the results revealed general trends and patterns of scores amongst the participants. Patterns of scores indicated that the JP-CIM student participant's scores on self-esteem, self-regulation, and emotional control, increased more than their counterparts. Trends also revealed that students with perceived low kinesthetic strength portrayed an overall pattern of improvement on all three of the variables compared to the students with perceived high kinesthetic strength. The results are considered in regard to the current knowledge and research of kinesthetic/dance programs and perceived multiple intelligence strengths, on student learning, as well as, their social-emotional and executive functioning skills. Limitations and future directions are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Promoting young children’s interpersonal safety knowledge, intentions confidence and skills is the goal of many child maltreatment prevention programs; however, evaluation of their effectiveness has been limited. In this study, a randomized controlled trial was conducted examining the effectiveness of the Australian protective behaviors program, Learn to be safe with Emmy and friends™ compared to a waitlist condition. In total, 611 Australian children in Grade 1 (5–7 years; 50% male) participated, with assessments at Pre-intervention, Post-intervention and a 6-month follow-up. This study also included a novel assessment of interpersonal safety skills through the Observed Protective Behaviors Test (OPBT). Analyses showed participating in Learn to be safe with Emmy and friends™ was effective post-program in improving interpersonal safety knowledge (child and parent-rated) and parent-rated interpersonal safety skills. These benefits were retained at the 6-month follow-up, with participating children also reporting increased disclosure confidence. However, Learn to be safe with Emmy and friends™ participation did not significantly impact children’s disclosure intentions, safety identification skills, or interpersonal safety skills as measured by the OPBT. Future research may seek to evaluate the effect of further parent and teacher integration into training methods and increased use of behavioral rehearsal and modelling to more effectively target specific disclosure intentions and skills.

AB  - One of the many challenges that children with learning disabilities (LD) experience, apart from academics, is severe deficits in the areas of social skills and peer relations. The learning of social skills and appropriate ways to interact with peers are crucial for school-aged children with learning disabilities. Without these skills, it can be difficult for these children to maintain meaningful relationships as well as interact with peers in the classroom. The purpose of this study was to decrease inappropriate peer interactions in a middle school student with learning disabilities using simultaneous intervention delivery of social stories and a token economy. From previous studies, the use of social stories and token economies have both been shown to decrease inappropriate behaviors and increase appropriate behavior. Based on these studies, it was hypothesized that implementation of a token economy combined with social stories would be successful at decreasing inappropriate peer interactions. The participant was a 13-year-old boy with LD enrolled in a middle school in the Pacific Northwest. The researcher used a multiple baseline across settings design and implemented the two interventions simultaneously. The researcher found that the simultaneous use of social stories and a token economy was successful in decreasing inappropriate peer interactions in a middle school student with learning disabilities.

AB  - When educators focus primarily on increasing academic achievement, they have less time to understand and meet students’ socioemotional needs. An increase in antisocial behavior, school crises, and the expectation of safe and effective learning environments has created a need for intervention models that address students’ socioemotional needs. Few empirical studies have looked at the implementation and effects of Life Space Crisis Intervention (LSCI) and no extant research has examined the effectiveness of LSCI on socioemotional development. The purpose of this quantitative cross-sectional survey study was to examine teacher perceptions of the effects of LSCI strategies on the socioemotional development of troubled students. Participants in the study included 21 special education teachers in three psychoeducational programs in the North Central region of the State of Georgia. Fifty-four critical incidence survey forms documenting the perceived effects of LSCI on student socioemotional development were collected during a ten-week period. These data, comparing teacher perceived student levels of socioemotional development in the areas of sensitivity, awareness, and self-regulation of behavior, before and after LSCI, were analyzed using an estimated one sample t-test. This two-tailed analysis yielded a statistically significant difference, indicating that student socioemotional development scores did improve after LSCI interventions. The results of this study indicate that LSCI helps students develop more adaptive ways to respond to stressful situations. Information from this study contributes to social change in that LSCI and similar programs can be an alternative to suspension, improve attendance, reduce dropout rates, and potentially increase academic achievement.

AB  - This training guide is a product of the Family-Centered Interdisciplinary Training Project in Early Intervention (Wisconsin), a project that is addressing the need for preservice training of professionals to serve infants, toddlers, and preschool children with disabilities and their families. The project is focused on students from the disciplines of nursing, physical therapy, occupational therapy, social work, early childhood education, early childhood special education, and speech/language pathology. It is structured around three key elements: first, the involvement of families in all aspects of the training program; second, a curricular focus on family and professional partnerships; and third, practical experiences designed to teach optimal interdisciplinary team functioning. The project organizes the student's learning into four primary learning environments in each of which the student spends about 2 hours a week: (1) family mentorship (each student is matched with a family of a young child with special needs); (2) community placement (each student is matched with a community service provider); (3) the interdisciplinary team (each student works with other project trainees); and (4) seminar (a weekly meeting to provide early intervention knowledge and an environment to process learning activities). The training guide provides a section on each of the four learning environments as well as a section on trainee supervision. (Contains approximately 180 references.) (DB)

AB  - This paper reports on a project aimed at providing skills and resources to support nursery staff in identifying areas of strength and need in 3- to 5-year-old children. The six participating nurseries were all in areas of high socio-economic disadvantage. Staff were trained to administer, score and interpret a wide-ranging screening inventory. Following the assessment of children at nursery entry, staff were given support in developing appropriate programmes of activities to address the weaknesses and build on the strengths identified for individual children. All the children were reassessed following a period of six months. Although time was a major issue, staff were generally positive about the screening process and recognised the worth of early identification and intervention. While 46% of 173 children screened at the start of the project had significant difficulties in some area of development, only 6.9% remained at risk on the screening measure following tailored input. Systematic screening was identified as important for alerting staff to difficulties that might otherwise go unnoticed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In Australia and internationally, universities are preparing students for the twenty-first century through building the competencies fundamental for both social sustainability and wellbeing. However, there is little evidence on how these competencies can be fostered in curricula. This article presents the findings of a mixed-methods pilot of an Aboriginal wellbeing intervention that seeks to build such attributes when integrated into an undergraduate social work curriculum. A questionnaire incorporating the validated Growth and Empowerment Measure, the Australian Unity Personal Wellbeing Index, and open-ended qualitative questions was administrated to 64 first-year social work students before and after the intervention. Significant changes on both measures suggest that the intervention is highly relevant for student wellbeing, particularly for those who rated themselves as below the median at baseline. The qualitative findings highlight the relevance of the program for promoting social competencies that enable people to problem-solve and adapt in a complex world.

AB  - A meta-analysis is presented of the academic achievement effects on students taught by teachers from alternative teacher preparation (ATP) programs, compared to students taught by teachers from traditional teacher preparation (TTP) programs. The literature has indicated mixed results on the student-level academic outcomes of ATP programs. Findings from this meta-analysis indicate an overall statistically significant, yet small, difference in ATP and TTP programs (g = 0.03; 95% CI = 0.01, 0.04, p = 0.001), with the mean achievement of students who had ATP teachers was about 0.03 standard deviations above that of students who had TTP teachers. Further, there were differences in student achievement by type of ATP program, school level, and academic subject area. These results, as well as implications for policy and practice are discussed.

AB  - Worldwide, prevalence rates of students experiencing mental health difficulties are growing, with only one in five receiving treatment. The role of teachers in collaborative efforts both to identify and to provide effective services for these students is an essential one. However, scant research has explored the mental health literacy of pre-service teachers. In the present study, 186 pre-service teachers completed a vignette-based measure (Child or Adolescent version based on each teacher’s experience) in order to assess their mental health literacy, comprised of beliefs and knowledge. Results indicate that participants expressed lower efficacy when teaching children or adolescents with externalizing as compared to internalizing behaviours but believed that a child or adolescent experiencing behaviours indicative of depression was of the greatest concern and in need of intervention. Pre-service teachers were able to correctly identify cases of anxiety and ADHD, but many attributed behaviours typical of depression to home life difficulties (Child version) or substance use/abuse (Adolescent version). Results are discussed in light of previous research in the field; recommendations for future research and practice are provided. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

Because research shows that half of adult mental disorders begin before the age of 14 and that early intervention can prevent and reduce more serious consequences later in life, it is critical to expand the role of mental health professionals with schools worldwide. Schools have the potential to affect the mental health of millions of young people, as well as those who work in schools. Research indicates that programmes promoting mental health are among the most effective of health promoting school efforts. This paper discusses the health promoting schools framework, reviews effective strategies for promoting mental health in schools, and provides examples from Zhejiang Province, China. This article also discusses the key roles that mental health professionals can play in promoting mental health through schools. As advocates, policy makers, researchers and teachers, mental health professionals can bridge the sectors of education, mental health and public health. Developing common frameworks and interdisciplinary training will create a foundation of shared understanding to achieve this goal. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Research Findings: This study explored the quality of teacher-child interactions within the context of a newly developed standardized task, Teacher-Child Structured Play Task (TC-SPT). A sample of 146 teachers and 345 children participated. Children who displayed the highest disruptive behaviors within each classroom were selected to participate. Teacher-child dyads (n = 345) participated in a play session that included free play and clean-up tasks. We adapted two coding schemes to assess the quality of both teachers' and children's interactive behaviors during these two tasks. The coding schemes exhibited internal and inter-rater reliability. Significant associations with classroom-level teacher-child interactions and children's observed classroom engagement provide support for the measure's validity. Differences in teacher and child-interactive behaviors across the two tasks (free play versus clean-up) suggest that task features may affect the quality of teacher-child interactive behaviors. Practice and Policy: Examining the interactions of different teacher-child dyads within the same standardized context will allow researchers to better understand the child and teacher factors that contribute to the quality of those interactions. Thus, use of this task in future field-based research may help to assess the impact of early interventions and professional development efforts that target improvement in the quality of teacher-child interactions.

AB  - Rural schools are often overlooked in educational research. At least one in five children in the United States attends a rural school and one-third of all public schools are located in rural areas. Research on the effects of teacher education in rural schools on teacher candidates and the rural schools themselves is almost nonexistent. This position paper is an essay in which university faculty and our cooperating teacher partners from a rural elementary school describe the strengths-based lens through which we view the rural school as an important and effective context for preparing future teachers.

AB  - This small-scale research project in England investigates the reasons why mental health training should be incorporated into the curriculum for initial teacher education (ITE). Most mental health problems begin in adolescence, but often remain undetected until adulthood. Early intervention is vital to recovery in the case of serious psychotic disorders and can reduce the long-term impairment and levels of morbidity. School teachers are ideally placed to spot early warning signs. However, UK research suggests that teachers are ill-prepared for this role, are not comfortable using psychiatric language and do not work well with non-teaching support staff in a multi-agency context. The aim of this study is to investigate whether the same is true of students training to teach by studying for a Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE). It also investigates the extent to which PGCE students come across pupils with mental health problems on teaching practice and how effective a one-day training course can be in preparing them for this role. A case-study methodological approach utilised questionnaire surveys, a focus group interview and critical incident reflections. The Kruskal-Wallis test showed significant differences in attitude between PGCE students and more experienced teachers in relation to their Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services role. The findings present strong arguments in favour of incorporating mental health training into the PGCE curriculum in England, which might also be relevant to international practice.

AB  - The mental health of Looked After Children is not routinely assessed either upon entering the care system or during their period in care. Many children only receive help when difficulties become entrenched and more intensive treatment is required. Often this occurs when placements are fragile or have broken down. The Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety (DHSSPS) 2007 Consultation Paper 'Care Matters in Northern Ireland--A Bridge to a Better Future' has recommended 'systematic assessment of the psychological and emotional needs of children on the edge and LAC'. Prior to the focus group study outlined below, Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) screening was undertaken with a sample of Looked After Children (n = 76), 37 males and 39 females, in Home first Community Trust, aged 3-17 years (standard deviation = 4.3), living with relatives or foster carers. Confirmed Neglect was recorded as the primary reason for becoming looked after in 75% (n = 57) of the children screened. SDQ screening was undertaken with 76 (78%) carers, 64 (76%) teachers and 32 (87%) children aged 11+, and the findings provided to the child's social worker for consideration at the child's statutory review. Fifty-six per cent of carers, 39% of teachers and 30% of children identified significant difficulties, with 63% of carers, 35% of teachers and 45% of children stating that the difficulties had been present for over a year. Pre-test and post-test file audits were undertaken to ascertain whether SDQ screening had informed the child's care planning process. While care plans reflected an increase in referrals for further assessment and treatment in 42%, a number assessed with significant difficulties were not referred due to uncertainty about accessing appropriate services or concerns about swamping existing services. This paper outlines the findings of three focus groups with social workers and managers following SDQ screening of a sample of Looked After Children within four generic childcare teams and a team for children with special needs in Home first Community Trust. Participants reflected on the usefulness of the SDQ in identifying mental health strengths and difficulties to inform decision-making at Looked After Children Reviews. Participants recommended that routine SDQ screening is undertaken with all Looked After Children, with early intervention provided to children identified with some mental health difficulties and prioritisation of children with significant need. The usefulness of SDQ identification of child strengths as a foundation for promoting resilience in Looked After Children was also recognised. Recommendations were also made regarding specific service provision for Looked After Children and training for field social workers, link social workers and carers.

AB  - The present article focuses on 13-year-old girls' meaning-making processes during participation in a manual-based psycho-educational course at school. Drawing on Childhood studies and ethnographic investigations of subjectivity, the author explores how the course is realized in practice. The analysis, based on video-recordings of 13 classes, shows that the girls and the teachers, through collective transformation, move the focus from individual potential problems to relational issues. The results demonstrate the weakness of using manual-based educational courses, and indicate that cognitive methods for dealing with negative thoughts could be replaced by exercises designed to deal with interaction and strengthening the individual.

AB  - Objective: Assessed the feasibility, acceptability, and sustainability of Planet Health, an interdisciplinary, integrated health education curriculum implemented in six public middle schools. Methods: Workshops on Planet Health implementation were attended by 129- teachers (language arts, math, science, and social studies) over three school years (1999-2000, 2000-2001, and 2001-2002). Questionnaires were administered post-implementation and in the fall and spring of each year. Outcomes were dose, acceptability, feasibility, and intent to continue use. Results: The average number of lessons taught per teacher per year was 1.7 to 3.1, compared to a goal of 2 to 3. Each year, teachers reported high acceptability and perceived feasibility of the intervention, and the majority indicated they intended to continue using the curriculum. Conclusions: Planet Health was feasible and acceptable in a participatory research model involving a public school-university partnership, and it was also sustainable independent of the research effort.

AB  - Parental mental illness can lead to impairment of children's health and well-being that is accompanied by deteriorated health-related quality of life. In current studies, the health-related quality of life in these children is worse compared to the general population. About one third of the families with mentally ill parents experience insufficient social support. The CHIMPs (Children of mentally ill parents) study group developed an intervention program and an accompanying manual that aims to improve the health-related quality of life of the children and their social support. The results of the evaluation show that health-related quality of life and social support after the intervention is improved in the intervention group (n = 53) compared to the waiting list control group (n = 14). These improvements are stable over a period of one year. For the first time in the German-speaking region, these results demonstrate the significance of specific interventions for children of mentally ill parents.

AB  - Laboratory medicine's practitioners across the European community include medical, scientific and pharmacy trained specialists whose contributions to health and healthcare is in the application of diagnostic tests for screening and early detection of disease, differential diagnosis, monitoring, management and treatment of patients, and their prognostic assessment. In submitting a revised common syllabus for post-graduate education and training across the 27 member states an expectation is set for harmonised, high quality, safe practice. In this regard an extended 'Core knowledge, skills and competencies' division embracing all laboratory medicine disciplines is described. For the first time the syllabus identifies the competencies required to meet clinical leadership demands for defining, directing and assuring the efficiency and effectiveness of laboratory services as well as expectations in translating knowledge and skills into ability to practice. In a 'Specialist knowledge' division, the expectations from the individual disciplines of Clinical Chemistry/Immunology, Haematology/Blood Transfusion, Microbiology/ Virology, Genetics and In Vitro Fertilisation are described. Beyond providing a common platform of knowledge, skills and competency, the syllabus supports the aims of the European Commission in providing safeguards to increasing professional mobility across European borders at a time when demand for highly qualified professionals is increasing and the labour force is declining. It continues to act as a guide for the formulation of national programmes supplemented by the needs of individual country priorities.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Despite advances in our knowledge of effective services for people who use drugs over the last decades globally, coverage remains poor in most countries, while quality is often unknown. This paper aims to discuss the historical development of successful epidemiological indicators and to present a framework for extending them with additional indicators of coverage and quality of harm reduction services, for monitoring and evaluation at international, national or subnational levels. The ultimate aim is to improve these services in order to reduce health and social problems among people who use drugs, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, crime and legal problems, overdose (death) and other morbidity and mortality. METHODS AND RESULTS: The framework was developed collaboratively using consensus methods involving nominal group meetings, review of existing quality standards, repeated email commenting rounds and qualitative analysis of opinions/experiences from a broad range of professionals/experts, including members of civil society and organisations representing people who use drugs. Twelve priority candidate indicators are proposed for opioid agonist therapy (OAT), needle and syringe programmes (NSP) and generic cross-cutting aspects of harm reduction (and potentially other drug) services. Under the specific OAT indicators, priority indicators included 'coverage', 'waiting list time', 'dosage' and 'availability in prisons'. For the specific NSP indicators, the priority indicators included 'coverage', 'number of needles/syringes distributed/collected', 'provision of other drug use paraphernalia' and 'availability in prisons'. Among the generic or cross-cutting indicators the priority indicators were 'infectious diseases counselling and care', 'take away naloxone', 'information on safe use/sex' and 'condoms'. We discuss conditions for the successful development of the suggested indicators and constraints (e.g. funding, ideology). We propose conducting a pilot study to test the feasibility and applicability of the proposed indicators before their scaling up and routine implementation, to evaluate their effectiveness in comparing service coverage and quality across countries. CONCLUSIONS: The establishment of an improved set of validated and internationally agreed upon best practice indicators for monitoring harm reduction service will provide a structural basis for public health and epidemiological studies and support evidence and human rights-based health policies, services and interventions.

AB  - Objectives: To determine whether increased postnatal support could influence maternal and child health outcomes. Design: This was a randomised controlled trial comparing maternal and child health outcomes for women offered either of the support interventions with those for control women receiving standard services only. Outcome data were collected through questionnaires distributed 12 and 18 months postrandomisation. Process data were also collected. There was also an integral economic evaluation. Setting and participants: Women living in deprived enumeration districts in selected London boroughs were eligible for the trial if they gave birth between 1 January and 30 September 1999. Results: The 731 participants were found to be well matched in terms of socio-economic characteristics and health and support variables (14% of the participants were non-English speaking). Response rates at the two follow-up points were 90% and 82%. At both points there were no differences that could not be attributed to chance on the primary outcomes of maternal depression, child injury or maternal smoking. At the first follow-up, there was reduced use of general practitioners by support health visitor (SHV) children, but increased use of NHS health visitors and social workers by mothers. At the second follow-up, both community group support (CGS) and SHV mothers had less use of midwifery services ( fewer were pregnant), and SHV mothers were less worried about their child's health and development. Uptake of the CGS intervention was low: 19%, compared with 94% for the SHV intervention. Satisfaction with the intervention among women in the SHV group was high. Based on the assumptions and conditions of the costing methods, the economic evaluation found no net economic cost or benefit of choosing either of the two interventions. Conclusions: There was no evidence of impact on the primary outcomes of either intervention. The SHV intervention was popular with women, and was associated with improvement in some of the secondary outcomes. This suggests that greater emphasis on the social support role of health visitors could improve some measures of family well-being. Possible areas for future research include a systematic review of social support and its effect on health; developing and testing other postnatal models of support that match more closely the age of the baby and the changing patterns of mothers' needs; evaluating other strategies for mobilising `non-professional' support; developing and testing more culturally specific support interventions; developing more culturally appropriate standardised measures of health outcomes; providing longer term follow-up of social support interventions; and exploring the role of social support on the delay in subsequent pregnancy.

AB  - The Foreign Language Learning (FLL) programme aimed to improve the English language attainment of Year 3 and 4 pupils through a detailed curriculum of weekly French classes with linked activity in English lessons. The programme, created by the Education Development Trust (formerly CfBT), lasted for three half-terms. French classes were 45 minutes long and the linked activity required an additional 15 to 30 minutes of English class time per week. Teachers were provided with detailed lesson plans and three days of training in delivering the curriculum. The project was a randomised controlled trial. 46 schools participated, mainly from Greater London, the South East, and the North East of England. 169 individual classes in the 46 schools were randomised to receive either FLL or business as usual. The process evaluation involved observations of the teacher training, observations of the lessons, and interviews with teachers. The trial took place between January 2014 and March 2015. The project specifically evaluated the impact of the particular FLL curriculum with its linked English literacy activity. Some children in the control group also did foreign language lessons, but without the FLL curriculum and the linked English activity. Key Conclusions included: (1) Children in FLL classes made no additional progress in English language compared to children in other classes in the trial. The 1 padlock security rating means we have very low confidence that there was no difference and that this was due to FLL and not affected by other factors; (2) Children in FLL classes who had ever been eligible for free school meals made 2 months' fewer progress compared to other ever-eligible children. However, we have very low confidence that this result was not affected by other factors; and (3) There was a lot of variation in how the intervention was implemented. Not all teachers delivered the linked English literacy activity and some schools delivered fewer weeks of FLL than prescribed because of staffing or timetabling issues. This study investigated whether teaching Year 3 and 4 primary school children for one hour a week using an 18-week curriculum of French language and linked English literacy would have an impact on their English language attainment (as measured through testing of grammar, punctuation, and vocabulary). This randomised controlled trial found no evidence of such an effect. Additionally, no effect was found for: boys, girls, children who had ever been eligible for FSM, children with English as their main language, or children with another language as their first language.The results of this evaluation differ from those of two large-scale retrospective cohort studies with matched intervention and control groups that showed an impact of foreign language learning on English language attainment in the United States (Rafferty, 1986; Taylor-Ward and LaFayette, 2010). This variation may be a result of the shorter length and reduced intensity of this intervention compared to those studied in the US (18 weeks/60 minutes per week vs. one to three years/minimum 150 minutes per week). Additionally, this evaluation tested a particular type of foreign language teaching (which was combined with some linked English literacy activities) against a control group where there was often some foreign language teaching being undertaken. This type of comparison was different from those US studies where the control group had no such foreign language teaching.

AB  - This Learner Response System (LRS) intervention involves the use of electronic handheld devices that allow teachers and pupils to provide immediate feedback during lessons. For example, pupils can respond to a question using the device and responses are immediately visible to the teacher, or they can work through problems on the device at their own pace with answers provided as they go. The aim is to improve outcomes by increasing the speed and quality of classroom feedback. A team from Edge Hill University developed the intervention and trained teachers to deliver it to pupils in Years 5 and 6 in primary schools with higher than average proportions of children ever eligible for free school meals. The devices were to be used in at least three lessons a week for between 25 and 32 weeks each year. The intervention ran from June 2014 to June 2016. One cohort of pupils used the LRS for two school years ('cohort B'), and one cohort for only one school year ('cohort A'). A cluster randomised controlled trial was used to evaluate the impact of the intervention on Year 6 maths and reading outcomes. Around 6,500 pupils in 97 schools took part. The accompanying process evaluation involved classroom observations, teacher interviews, and focus groups with pupils. The project was funded as part of the EEF Digital Technology funding round in collaboration with the Nominet Trust. Key conclusions include: (1) The project found no evidence that the LRS improved Key Stage 2 results in maths and reading for either cohort; (2) The project found no evidence that the LRS improved the average scores of boys, girls or pupils who have ever been eligible for Free School Meals; (3) Classroom teachers and children were generally positive about the LRS. Teachers welcomed the ability to quickly assess pupil responses for certain types of tasks and give instant feedback. They felt that the LRS helped to engage pupils and allowed different pupils to work at their own pace; (4) Some teachers and pupils felt that the inability of the system to let children 'show their working' was a weakness. There was also a concern that incorrectly programmed or overspecified answers meant that pupils occasionally received negative feedback when in fact their answer was wholly or partially correct. There was some criticism from pupils and teachers that the small size of the handset made it difficult to type properly; and (5) The intervention was variably implemented, with a number of teachers not meeting the weekly targets for usage. Reasons given for this included staffing issues, lack of time, and the inability to use the system to its full potential. However, even in schools with high usage, the analysis did not find evidence of an impact.

AB  - Used a cluster randomized trial with follow up 2 yrs after baseline (6 mo after intervention) to determine whether a teacher-delivered, theoretically-based sex education program for adolescents--SHARE (Sexual Health and Relationships: Safe, Happy and Responsible)--reduced unsafe sexual intercourse (SI) compared with existing sex education (control). 25 secondary schools in east Scotland participated in the study. Of 8,430 pupils (aged 13-15 yrs), 7,616 completed the baseline questionnaire and 5,854 completed the 2-yr follow-up. Main outcome measures were self-reported exposure to sexually transmitted disease, use of condoms and contraceptives at 1st and most recent SI, and unwanted pregnancies. When the comparing the control and intervention groups in an intention to treat analysis, there were no differences in sexual activity or sexual risk taking by age 16 yrs. However, Ss in the intervention group reported less regret of 1st SI with most recent partner. Ss evaluated the intervention program more positively and their knowledge of sexual health improved. Lack of behavioral effect could not be linked to differential quality of delivery of intervention. Compared with conventional sex education this specially designed intervention did not reduce sexual risk taking in adolescents. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective To determine whether a theoretically based sex education programme for adolescents (SHARE) delivered by teachers reduced unsafe sexual intercourse compared with cur-rent practice. Design Cluster randomised trial with follow up two years after baseline (six months after intervention). A process evaluation investigated the delivery of sex education and broader features of each school. Setting Twenty five secondary schools in east Scotland. Participants 8430 pupils aged 13-15 years; 7616 completed the baseline questionnaire and 5854 completed the two year follow up questionnaire. Intervention SHARE programme (intervention group) versus existing sex education (control programme). Main outcome measures Self reported exposure to sexually transmitted disease, use of condoms and contraceptives at first and most recent sexual intercourse, and unwanted pregnancies. Results When the intervention group was compared with the conventional sex education group in an intention to treat analysis there were no differences in sexual activity or sexual risk taking by the age of 16 years. However, those in the intervention group reported less regret of first sexual intercourse with most recent partner (young men 9.9% difference, 95% confidence interval -18.7 to -1.0; young women 7.7% difference, -16.6 to 1.2). Pupils evaluated the intervention programme more positively, and their knowledge of sexual health improved. Lack of behavioural effect could not be linked to differential quality of delivery of intervention. Conclusions Compared with conventional sex education this specially designed intervention did not reduce sexual risk taking in adolescents.

AB  - The simulation centre is a key setting for the acquisition of practical skills. However, pedagogical underpinnings of skills instruction in this setting are not always well founded. This study aimed to explore student and teacher experiences with an educational intervention to enhance clinical skills learning in the first semester of nursing education. The study had an exploratory design, where qualitative data were collected in focus group interviews involving 18 students and four teachers. The participants had generally positive experiences of the intervention. The findings showed that organisation, time usage, an observer role, re-training and structured reflection enhanced systematic feedback by students. We conclude that an educational intervention based on theoretically sound learning tools and pedagogical principles improved students' skills acquisition and gave the teachers a common educational platform.

AB  - Abstract: The purpose of this investigation was to examine the efficacy of a new preschool oral language and early literacy curriculum package (Teaching Early Literacy and Language [TELL]) for children with developmental speech and/or language impairment (DSLI) either as a primary (e.g., specific to speech and/or language) or secondary impairment (e.g., developmental delay that includes DSLI). Participants included 118 children (30 females, 88 males, M age=53.58 months) with DLSI and their 29 preschool teachers. The design was a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with assignment to experimental versus contrast conditions at the classroom level. Teachers in TELL classes received formal training, in-class support, and mentoring to implement the curriculum. Dependent measures for the children included scores on the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals-Preschool 2nd edition (CELF-P2), the Phonological Awareness Literacy Screening for Preschool (PALS-PreK), the Renfrew Bus Story (BU)

AB  - The purpose of this mixed methods research is to examine teachers' perspectives on the response to intervention (RTI) framework and its implementation in Michigan and Texas schools. Both states have been leaders in literacy, increasing preservice and in-service teacher certification standards and developing similar batteries for assessing literacy skills. Using the International Reading Association's RTI principles, the following question directed this inquiry: what are the perspectives of teachers in various educational, geographic, economic and cultural settings of the RTI? The research was developed through questionnaires, focus groups and semi-structured interviews. Findings revealed that teacher professional development, assessments and collaboration for instruction were highly integrated themes when developing RTI strategies as reforming practice and increasing student literacy. Michigan and Texas teachers were more confident and comfortable in measuring and identifying students with reading difficulties over their ability to prevent learning disabilities through their instruction.

AB  - The present case study evaluated web-based training with coaching and feedback delivered through videoconferencing software to increase teacher use of behavioral methods associated with increased compliance. The participant, a preschool special education teacher, increased both her knowledge of efficacious interventions for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and her treatment fidelity during the course of the case study. The student with ASD demonstrated extremely high levels of compliance at the onset of the case study and so, although improvements were noted, this gain should not be assumed to generalize to the ASD population. A wide range of considerations for future research has been offered.

AB  - This systematic review examines research published from 2009 to 2015 on inclusion of children with disabilities in physical education according to the PRISMA guidelines. We have used a stakeholder approach as a framework for organizing and discussing the results. The searches yielded 535 studies, of which 112 were included. The systematic review outlines which stakeholder perspectives received the most attention, the main themes and findings, the methodological trends that governed the research contribution, and the country of data collection. The main findings indicated that perspectives of pre- and in-service teachers and studies of attitudes still dominate the research contributions. The strengths and limitations of the research conducted to date highlight that several other perspectives need to be discussed. Especially important is seeking information from children with disabilities themselves. Other barriers and facilitators perceived by those actively involved in the inclusion process need to be sought. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Increasing numbers of young people experience disruption to their schooling owing to chronic illness. Absence from the day-to-day life of their school for prolonged or accumulative periods of time can erode their sense of belonging and create anxiety about falling behind academically. Maintaining positive connections to school can meet their desire for normalcy and realisable educational goals. Part of a project called "Link "n" Learn," funded by an Australian Research Council Linkage grant (2008-2010), this in-depth qualitative case study of 22 participants--senior secondary students and their mathematics teachers--investigated "academic continuity": students' access to and utilisation of opportunities to learn effectively so that academic progress is made despite disruption to full-time schooling. The students experienced diverse types of chronic illness, medical interventions, and patterns of absence from school. They all sought to continue their school studies. Their teachers highlighted surprise, concern and discomfort related to students studying during serious illness, and school workload issues. Ambiguities about educational responsibility for students during absence were widespread. Teachers demonstrated hesitance to initiate contact with students, but students nevertheless expressed their desire for teachers to remain involved with them. Implications for the educational support of young people with chronic illness are presented.

AB  - The home visit is central to the practice of contemporary child and family social work, yet we know comparatively little about what social workers use them for and how. Descriptions of practice and policies and procedures that overlook the emotional, physical and relational complexity of the home visit will inevitably miss something important about the social work role. More and more researchers are using observational methods to produce descriptions of home visit practices, while the Department for Education has been trialing observations as part of a national accreditation programme in England. Local authorities for many years have been engaged in observations of students and newly-qualified workers. However, none of these developments mean that observing social workers in practice and on a wider scale is straight-forward. This paper describes an attempt to introduce regular observations of social work practice in three inner London local authorities-and discusses how and why this attempt failed. By so doing, we hope to provide helpful lessons for others who may be thinking of using observations of practice more widely within their own authorities or as part of a research project.

AB  - In this paper, we report findings from the second year of a three-year research and professional development program designed to help elementary school teachers engage in dialogic teaching to support the development of students' argument literacy. We define argument literacy as the ability to comprehend and formulate arguments through speaking, listening, reading, and writing. The professional development program was focused on promoting teachers' use of a specific type of talk called `inquiry dialogue' to achieve the goal of developing students' argument literacy. We used a single-group pretest-posttest design to assess the impact of the professional development on teachers' epistemological beliefs and their enactment of inquiry dialogue in text-based discussions. Our analyses of videotaped discussions at the beginning and end of the year showed that there were substantial improvements in teachers' facilitation of inquiry dialogue and in the quality of students' argumentation during discussions. Contrary to expectations, however, there were no changes in teachers' epistemology; teachers' beliefs about knowledge and knowledge justification remained at a relativist stage throughout the course of the program, suggesting that teachers continued to view all opinions as equally valid and regard arguments and the use of reasons and evidence as idiosyncratic.

AB  - AimThis pilot study tested teacher-delivered Media Smart, a school-based eating disorder prevention program that has achieved significant benefits when delivered by health professionals. MethodTwo Grade 7 classes (N=51; M age=12.43 years) participated, with one randomly allocated to Media Smart (n=27; 67% girls) and the other to a control condition of usual lessons (n=24; 37% girls). Program feasibility was assessed by teacher self-report, whereas student self-report of shape and weight concern (primary outcome variable) and seven additional risk factors were measured at baseline, post-program and 6-month follow up. ResultsTeacher ratings of program feasibility revealed that 25 of the 29 (86.2%) program activities were taught with 96% of activities rated as either highly (19 activities) or moderately (5 activities) valuable for students. Mixed model analyses were conducted using a 2 (group: Media Smart, control)x2 (time: post-program, 6-month follow up)x2 (gender: girls, boys) design, with baseline scores as a covariate. A not-significant trend for group favouring Media Smart was observed for shape and weight concern (Cohen's d effect size {[}d]=0.32), whereas significant effects were found for feelings of ineffectiveness (d=0.52) and weight-related peer teasing (d=0.68). ConclusionsThe program was feasible for teacher delivery and showed some promising results, supporting a more substantial randomized-controlled effectiveness trial.

AB  - This article explores, through a review of a body of literature, whether it is possible to create a new understanding of what it means to be a professional in Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) in England. It reviews some competing views of the nature of professionalism and then explores the distinctive attributes and qualities required by practitioners through discussing the demands required of both care and education. The article reconceptualises professional identity in ECEC in England using three themes identified from a "ground-up" study of professionalism undertaken by Dalli in New Zealand--(a) pedagogical style, (b) specialist professional knowledge, and (c) practices and collaborative relations. The discussion is situated in the framework of government initiatives in the United Kingdom that have formulated a more "technicist" approach to professionalisation through the graduate status of the Early Years Professional.

AB  - A systematic literature review (N = 14) was performed with a focus on the influence of collaborative teacher research on the professional development of pre-service teachers (PTs). A thematic overview of reported outcomes is presented. Collaborative teacher research has proven itself to be a promising practice for improving PTs' knowledge and attitudes regarding collaboration, reflection, inquiry, and student-centred teaching. Shared inquiry in less hierarchical partnerships between pre-service and in-service teachers, and other multiple actors, advances PT's learning more than one-to-one relationships between a mentor and a PT.

AB  - The purpose of this brief article is to describe the interplay between physical and psychological factors in both typically developing as well as chronically ill children, and how pediatric psychologists may work effectively with nursing and medical practitioners to provide psychological care to these individuals and their families within a collaborative practice framework. Pediatric psychologists have an important role to play in both primary and specialty medical settings. In concert with the collaborative care team, psychologists offer a range of services to aid in the care of both healthy and medically ill children and their families. Direct intervention with children and families, coupled with consultation to care providers regarding the interplay between biological and psychological factors in the developing child, are designed to meet several important goals. The role of the pediatric psychologist is to enhance pediatric practice by insuring that those in need of psychological services are readily identified and treated and by generally reducing the impact of psychopathology on physical health outcomes through education and primary intervention.

AB  - This paper addresses the problem of how to reach an Information and Communication Technology (ICT) competent teaching faculty in Swedish compulsory school.  Continuing professional development (CPD) is often used as a mean to increase competence in general among teachers, and is used for ICT initiatives as well. However, numerous studies have shown that previous ICT initiatives have not achieved sustainable change in teaching practices to the extend desired by policymakers. This study addresses the problem by investigating how such change initiatives can affect teachers in their every-day work. Therefore, we explore challenges and experiences, as perceived by teachers, related to CPD as a mean to achieve ICT competence into their profession. 17 teachers have been interviewed. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analysed by learning theories suitable for professional practices. Teachers’ expressed needs were well aligned with CPD methods advocated in research literature, but less aligned with previous CPD initiatives. Their expressed needs were diverse, reflecting their individual competence, length of teaching experience, personal motivation and learning preferences.

AB  - This article describes how standards in early numeracy were raised within Cumbria by the application of the Mathematics Recovery Programme. It reports data showing how children's numeracy improved as a result of the programme, and describes effective elements of the in-service teacher training programme which was implemented. This work is an example of how teachers and educational psychologists can work together to develop and disseminate good practice in teaching, which is based on a sound theoretical and evidence base. Mathematics Recovery (MR) is an evolving, research-based programme which was first developed in the 1990s, in order to meet the needs of children who were not reaching age-related expectations for numeracy skills. There is an underlying model of how children acquire strategies and numerical knowledge, and an explicit set of principles of good teaching. The MR materials include short-term, intensive, individual teaching programmes, as well as group and class teaching. The paper reflects on the nature of 'best practice in assessment for learning' (DFES 2005b), which we argue is dynamic in character, in that the assessment is embedded in the teaching, with the assessor playing a mediating role, supporting the learner to construct and elaborate their own model of number. We show how Mathematics Recovery implements this approach to assessment and teaching, through the design, implementation and evaluation of programmes of short-term intervention. The paper concludes with some evidence of how the above has impacted on teachers' professional development and changed classroom practice in Cumbria.

AB  - Objective: We examine how frontline workers and supervisors delivering a research-supported intervention (RSI) to reduce child neglect negotiated system-related challenges, the pragmatics of RSI implementation, and their professional identities and relationships with clients. Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews, small group discussions, and focus groups with frontline workers and supervisors in one large county over two time periods. We used iterative coding to analyze qualitative data. Results: Frontline workers navigated several aspects of RSI implementation and sustainment: (1) contract requirements and information dissemination, (2) fidelity, (3) competing demands and crises, (4) structure versus creativity, and (5) relationships with clients. Conclusions: Workers dynamically negotiated multiple system- and provider-level (or outer- and inner-contextual) demands influencing RSI provision for clients with complex service needs. Results affirm the need to attend to the unintended consequences of implementing new contract, reimbursement, and other system or organizational processes and to address the “committed work” supporting RSI delivery.

AB  - This paper presents the views and educational experiences of two African American female scholars, from a critical race and black feminist theorist perspective, teaching in the area of social justice to predominantly white female pre-service teachers. These testimonies reveal the struggles encountered by these scholars when engaging students in a historical and contemporary examination of race, privilege, and systemic inequalities. The objectives of this paper are to expand on the literary dialogue of such resistance and attempt to bring awareness into the arenas that need the most exposure, i.e. departmental, faculty, and tenure review meetings. It is commonly written and verbalized that institutions are interested in attracting and retaining faculty of color. We argue that the ways we are supported must shift. This problem of student resistance, who they resist and why, should become open for discussion on college campuses across the nation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Continuing professional development has been identified as an important tool for advancing the competence of social workers, yet outcomes of professional development are conventionally evaluated using methods that cannot provide trustworthy information about program effectiveness. This paper suggests that innovations in social research can be applied to strengthen the evaluation of educational outcomes from continuing professional development. The benefits of designing a mixed-method evaluation of educational interventions are explored by reviewing the experience of implementing a cultural competence continuing professional development workshop series in Toronto, Canada. Review of the process demonstrates that the combination of methods results in a richer data set that can answer questions about both the process of the learning experience, and the effect that training has on professional practice.

AB  - With detailed discussion and invaluable video footage of 23 treatment interventions for speech sound disorders (SSDs) in children, this textbook and DVD set should be part of every speech-language pathologist's professional preparation. Focusing on children with functional or motor-based speech disorders from early childhood through the early elementary period, this textbook gives preservice SLPs critical analyses of a complete spectrum of evidence-based phonological and articulatory interventions. An essential core text for pre-service SLPs--and an important professional resource for practicing SLPs, early interventionists, and special educators--this book will help readers make the best intervention decisions for children with speech sound disorders.

AB  - This study tracked the effects of guided questioning on the epistemological and pedagogical content knowledge over six weeks of six undergraduate pre-service teachers in literacy education in a university-based reading tutorial. This study was guided by three research questions: (a) how do undergraduate pre-service teachers' initial ideas about literary instruction change from the beginning to the end of their tutoring experience, (b) what patterns can be seen in undergraduate pre-service teachers' epistemological and pedagogical development while tutoring in a university-based reading setting, and (c) how does intervention affect the instructional literacy practices of undergraduate pre-service teachers as they experience epistemological growth? The primary data collection tools used to collect data were interviews, observations, and collected artifacts. Shulman's (1987) model of Pedagogical Reasoning and Action was used by the researcher as a coding system to analyze the collected data. In addition to this study's findings, there were changes in the undergraduate pre-service teachers' initial ideas about literacy instruction. Pattern changes of the undergraduate pre-service teachers' epistemological and pedagogical development and the effects guided questioning had on the undergraduate pre-service teachers' literacy instructional practices were also revealed. The findings in this study suggest the need for teacher preparation programs to provide training for undergraduate pre-service teachers. As a result, novice teachers may enter the classrooms better prepared to teach reading. Recommendations to further the understanding of the development of prospective teachers' epistemology and pedagogy for teaching reading may increase student success in learning to read.

AB  - Historically, children's mental health needs have been addressed inadequately in policy, practice, and research. A sizable proportion of youths meet the lifetime criteria for selected DSM diagnoses. Several factors have been posited as influencing racial disproportionality in specific educational disability categories. Teacher perceptions, gender, race, and socioeconomic status (SES) could have a significant role in the referral process. Many schools in the nation’s urban centers are nested in communities with high rates of poverty and crime. Many African American children attend high-poverty schools. If the demographics of urban schools continue on the current trends, urban schools will have a majority of minority students, enrolling most of the African American students in large cities. It is apparent from the literature that a neighborhood’s SES, racial and ethnic composition, population turnover and loss, and family structure can affect children’s abilities to have safe and productive lives (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Peer-assisted learning (PAL) as an educational philosophy benefits both the peer-teacher and peer-learner. The changing role of paramedicine towards autonomous and professional practice demands future paramedics to be effective educators. Yet PAL is not formally integrated in undergraduate paramedic programs. We aimed to examine the effects of an educational intervention on students' PAL experiences as peer-teachers. Two one-hour workshops were provided prior to PAL teaching sessions including small group activities, individual reflections, role-plays and material notes. Peer-teachers completed the Teaching Style Survey, which uses a five-point Likert scale to measure participants' perceptions and confidence before and after PAL involvement. Thirty-eight students were involved in an average of 3.7 PAL sessions. The cohort was predominated by males (68.4%) aged <= 25 (73.7%). Following PAL, students reported feeling more confident in facilitating tutorial groups (p = 0.02). After the PAL project peer-teachers were also more likely to set high standards for their learners (p = 0.009). This PAL project yielded important information for the continual development of paramedic education. Although PAL increases students' confidence, the full role of PAL in education remains unexplored. The role of the university in this must also be clearly clarified.

AB  - Due to the diverse and ever-changing nature of the healthcare industry, teaching pedagogies such as peer-assisted learning (PAL) are being implemented to align with external competency standards. A scoping review was conducted in order to map the breadth of literature available on PAL and its impact on student performance. This review used Arksey and O'Malley's six stage scoping methodology. The databases searched included: Cinahl, Ovid Medline, Proquest and Embase as well as grey literature sites and dissertations. 22 articles were included in this review, 10 of which were mixed methods randomised controlled trials, one retrospective study, four controlled trials, two randomised cross over controlled trial, three prospective randomised controlled trials, one thesis and one comparative research design. Analysis of the included articles identified three major themes outlining student performance. Student teachers themselves showed the most significant improvement in objective outcomes. The predominant healthcare field addressed were medical students with very few studies being completed on other professions. The search indicated an overall positive response to PAL with the measurable outcome of student tutors being of most significance. Further research is required to determine the relevance for the wider healthcare community.

AB  - Background: Inquiry learning in science provides authentic and relevant contexts in which students can create knowledge to solve problems, make decisions and find solutions to issues in today's world. The use of electronic networks can facilitate this interaction, dialogue and sharing, and adds a new dimension to classroom pedagogy.Purpose: This is a report of teacher and student reflections on some of the tensions, reconciliations and feelings they experienced as they worked together to engage in inquiry learning. The study sought to find out how networked ICT use might offer new and different ways for students to engage with, explore and communicate science ideas within inquiry.Sample: This project developed case studies with 6 science teachers of year 9 and 10 students, with an average age of 13 and 14years in three New Zealand high schools. Teacher participants in the project had varying levels of understanding and experience with inquiry learning in science. Teacher knowledge and experience with ICT were equally diverse.Design and Methods: Teachers and researchers developed initially in a joint workshop a shared understanding of inquiry, and how this could be enacted. During implementation, the researchers observed the inquiry projects in the classrooms and then, together with the teachers, reviewed and analysed the data that had been collected.Results: At the beginning of the project, some of the teachers and students were tentative: inquiry based teaching supported by ICT meant initially that the teachers were hesitant in letting go some of the control they felt they had over students learning, and the students felt insecure in adopting some responsibility for their own learning. Over time a sense of trust and ease developed and this control of learning' balance moved from what was traditionally accepted, but not without modifications and reservations.Conclusions: There is no clear pathway to follow in moving towards ICT-supported science inquiry in secondary schools. The experience of the teacher, the funds of knowledge the students bring to the classroom, the level of technological availability in the school and the ability of the students are all variables which determine the nature of the experience.

AB  - BackgroundPlaygroups are a relatively unique form of family support programme that is common in Australia which has high community acceptance and significant government investment. However, limited evidence exists regarding the effectiveness of playgroups to achieve better outcomes for children and their parents. This study describes patterns of playgroup participation for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families with young children and examines the extent to which participation from birth to three years is associated with subsequent child, parent and community outcomes. MethodsThis study uses three years of longitudinal data for 622 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children who were participants in the Longitudinal Study of Indigenous Children (LSIC). Longitudinal associations between playgroup attendance when children were age 2 and 3years and outcome measures for child vocabulary, motor skills, behaviour problems, prosocial development, parent home learning engagement, resilience, advice-seeking and health service use, and community trustworthiness were examined using path analysis. ResultsRates of playgroup participation in this sample group were generally lower than for Australian children overall. Playgroup attendance when children were age 2 to 3years was associated with higher parental engagement in home learning activities when children were aged 4years which, in turn, was associated with stronger expressive vocabulary scores for children. ConclusionThe findings from this study suggest that playgroup participation can enhance the home learning environments for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. Playgroups as a parent support programme hold strong potential to reach and engage families, particularly in areas of high geographic isolation, which can realize improved outcomes for children, parents and communities.

AB  - Objective: This study investigated the practices and impact of interdisciplinary faculty at a flagship university in the American Southwest who were engaged in the process of redesigning curriculum in order to center candidates on what they need to know and do as culturally competent school leaders. Method: Participants were 31 interdisciplinary faculty involved in preparing candidates for leadership in early childhood and elementary and secondary education, in diverse contexts including high need and Native American-serving schools. The qualitative study utilized document analysis of faculty's multi-year work in developing the capacity of candidates to increase opportunities for historically marginalized students. An external evaluation was conducted with focus groups of faculty and graduate students along with a follow-up discourse analysis of student reflective journals. Results: The redesign process involved several phases culminating in recommendations and next steps for preparing candidates to redress inequitable conditions and create a more hopeful future for America's diverse students. Conclusions: Developing the capacity of culturally competent leaders requires a fundamental change in the way institutions prepare candidates for equity and social justice work. Further research is needed to demonstrate that recommended activities and interventions will improve the cultural competence of educational leaders and make opportunity equity a reality for all children.

AB  - Supported playgroups are community-based services that provide low intensity family support, through regular group sessions for parents and their young children. Led by a playgroup facilitator, the program aims to enrich children's early learning, enhance positive parenting behaviors, provide social connections for parents, and enable access to other community services. Despite high community acceptance and government investment, little is known about the extent to which such services are effective. This paper reports findings from a systematic review of research on supported playgroups and their effectiveness to improve child, parent, and community outcomes. Thirty-four studies were included, of which 28 were conducted in Australia. Programs targeted a diverse range of families who were considered socially disadvantaged. Seven studies employed experimental or quasi-experimental designs from which reliable evidence for effectiveness could be established. A high proportion of studies were qualitative and included action research, case studies, or ethnographies. A range of qualitative and quantitative measures were used to assess child, parent, and community outcomes. While findings suggested that supported playgroup programs were highly valued by parents and other stakeholders, rigorous evidence of effectiveness for achieving desired improvements in child outcomes or parenting behavior was rare and limited by low quality study designs. More explicit theories of change about how different types of supported playgroup programs can meet diverse family needs are required. Such theories of change would provide directions for specific content and delivery approaches that could address and improve different child and parent outcomes targeted to specific populations of attending families.

AB  - ABSTRACT: An altered appearance can impact the psychosocial well-being of adolescent cancer patients, yet patient reports imply a dearth of appearance-related support. Using a two-phase qualitatively driven mixed method design, 62 health professionals from a range of UK oncology care settings provided data relating to their views on the impact of appearance changes on adolescent patients (aged 12–18 years), of delivering appearance-related care, and their training needs. Integrated findings were divided into two main outcomes. The first comprises health professionals' perceptions of the psychosocial and behavioral impacts of appearance-related distress in their patients and their experiences of interventions that prevent or ameliorate appearance concern. The second illustrates personal barriers (among health professionals, adolescents, and parents) and organizational barriers that inhibit the delivery of appearance-related support, together with suggestions about how these may be overcome. The needs of patients are extensive and varied, but due to the barriers identified can be poorly addressed. Nonetheless, some practitioners are utilizing a variety of interventions supported by theory and/or evidence of their success in other clinical areas. Recommendations are made for the content, design, and coordination of interventions for adolescents and for the content of education programs to meet the training needs identified by participants.

AB  - Background: This study examined the effectiveness of an adaptation of an empirically-supported intervention delivered using mental health consultation to preschoolers who displayed elevated disruptive behaviors. Method: Ninety-six preschoolers, their teachers, and their primary caregivers participated. Children in the intervention group received individualized mental health consultation focused on providing teachers with behaviorally-based, empirically-supported strategies for decreasing disruptive behaviors within the classroom. Caregivers were invited to participate in parent training (35% attendance). Effectiveness was assessed in contrast to an assessment/attention comparison group where typical treatment was available. Results: This treatment approach was more effective than the comparison condition in decreasing child disruptive behavior, increasing the use of appropriate teacher strategies, and increasing the use of appropriate parenting practices. Conclusion: Adapting empirically-supported treatments for use in mental health consultation may be a way to bridge the gap between research and clinical practice and increase effectiveness of mental health consultation in treating disruptive disorders in young children.

Both parent and teacher training programs are reviewed, as these have been backed by substantial research evidence. In addition, multimodal treatments that include some combination of parent training, teacher training, and social skills training are also reviewed. Interventions emphasize the need for a strong adult–child relationship combined with proactive behavior management strategies to improve child behavior.

AB  - A randomized controlled trial was used to examine the impact of an attachment‐based, teacher–child, dyadic intervention (Banking Time) to improve children's externalizing behavior. Participants included 183 teachers and 470 preschool children (3–4 years of age). Classrooms were randomly assigned to Banking Time, child time, or business as usual (BAU). Sparse evidence was found for main effects on child behavior. Teachers in Banking Time demonstrated lower negativity and fewer positive interactions with children compared to BAU teachers at post assessment. The impacts of Banking Time and child time on reductions of parent‐ and teacher‐reported externalizing behavior were greater when teachers evidenced higher‐quality, classroom‐level, teacher–child interactions at baseline. An opposite moderating effect was found for children's positive engagement with teachers.

AB  - This article examines how the use of restrictive physical interventions (RPIs) for pupils within a social, emotional and mental health (SEMH) special needs primary school relate to teacher professionalism. The dialogue is written from the perspective of the headteacher of such a school. It is a personal response to the suggestion that teachers are sometimes reluctant to identify themselves as professionals, and examines the extent to which RPIs cast them as carers rather than educators. The discussion addresses the question: To what extent does the use of RPIs in a SEMH special needs school constitute an aspect of teacher professionalism, and what shape does this take? The work concludes with the suggestion that the use of RPIs transcends any debate about professionalism, and that those working in the SEMH field need to focus their attention on ensuring these acts are conducted in a manner that meets the needs of the pupils.

AB  - In 2014, Scottish Book Trust (SBT) published and distributed classroom sets of a graphic novel about the life of pioneering environmental activist John Muir to all secondary schools in Scotland, where he is still relatively unknown. This paper outlines the collaborative process SBT used in producing the graphic novel and sets out to trace the impact of this intervention through teacher and pupil surveys. The former survey reveals that not all teachers were able to make use of the classroom sets but that those who did found it useful in bringing up environmental issues in a range of disciplinary and cross-disciplinary contexts. The book served as a narrative resource for some teachers in designing lesson plans and even in designing entire courses. The pupil survey found significant mean shifts in the New Environmental Paradigm Scale for Children and the Inclusion of Nature in Self Scale in participating classes and across all classes. Building on insights from narrative therapy and narrative ethics, we argue that shifting attitudes and values requires new narratives alongside new experiences and the space in which to dialogue about the two in community. Further research into reading and environmental education is advocated.

AB  - Examined the ability of adolescents to purchase alcohol in the UK, vendors' perceptions of such alcohol sales, and a police intervention intended to reduce such sales. 31 same-gender pairs of trained adolescent males or females (aged 13 or 16 yrs) attempted to purchase alcopops, beer, cider, wine, and spirits at the 4 retail outlet types of corner shops, off-license, public houses, and supermarkets. Attempts were made before and after a police intervention consisting of warning letters, visits to vendors, and issue of police cautions. 95 vendors completed telephone surveys. Results show that previous to police intervention, purchase attempts were successful for 88.1% of 16-yr-old females, 77% of 16-yr-old males, 41.6% of 13-yr-old females and 4.1% of 13-yr-old males. Rates were generally comparable across locations, alcohol types, and outlet types. There was no evidence that the police intervention reduced sales to 16-yr-olds; possibly the intervention caused a short-term decrease in sales to 13-yr-old females. Vendors reported that they rarely encountered underage customers and that they requested identification when suspicious. Only 2 vendors believed that they were likely to suffer adverse consequences for selling alcohol to minors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Schools continue to strive for the use of evidenced-based interventions and policies to foster well-managed classrooms that promote improved student outcomes. The present study examined the effects of the Class-Wide Function-related Intervention Teams (CW-FIT), a group contingency intervention, on the on-task and disruptive behavior of elementary school students with or at risk for emotional behavior disorders (EBD). Seventeen elementary schools, 159 general education teachers, and 313 students participated in the randomized-control group design study. Fidelity of implementation was strong for intervention group teachers and was measured across groups and throughout baseline conditions. Results suggest that CW-FIT can be used to increase on-task behavior and reduce the disruptive behavior of students with or at risk for EBD. In addition, teachers in intervention classes increased praise and reduced reprimands to individual students and along with their students, reported high levels of consumer satisfaction.

AB  - The present study examined the effects of the Class-Wide Function-Related Intervention Team (CW-FIT) program, a group contingency intervention addressing the on-task and disruptive behavior of students with or at risk for emotional behavior disorders (EBD). Twenty-one elementary schools, 155 general education teachers, and 324 students participated in the multisite efficacy trial of CW-FIT over 6 months. Procedures included teaching attending skills, setting goals and awarding points for appropriate behavior, and differential reinforcement and rewards. Students not responding to the primary-level intervention received self-management or help cards as Tier 2 supports. Fidelity of intervention implementation was high across 4 years, with fidelity checks across groups and during baseline conditions. The primary outcome variables of engagement, disruptive behavior, and teacher praise and reprimands were assessed with repeated direct observation. Results confirmed that CW-FIT can be used to increase on-task behavior and reduce disruptive behavior of students with or at risk for EBD.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to demonstrate efficacy of the Class-wide Function-Related Intervention Teams (CW-FIT) program. The study was designed to replicate an initial RCT conducted by the CW-FIT developers in 1 site, with 2 additional research groups not involved in its development. The study was conducted across 3 states, in 21 culturally diverse schools, and with 83 teachers (classrooms) assigned to CW-FIT and 74 teachers (classrooms) assigned to the comparison group. The CW-FIT intervention included teaching prosocial skills and use of differential attention (teacher praise and points) for appropriate behaviors using a group contingency, class teams, goal setting, points, and rewards. Class-wide student on-task behavior improved, teacher praise and attention to appropriate behaviors increased, and reprimands decreased in the CW-FIT classes with significantly fewer changes over time for the comparison group.

AB  - Twenty 3rd- and 4th-grade teachers were interviewed about working with difficult-to-teach students (e.g, children with specific learning disabilities, mild mental handicaps, behavior disorders) in their classrooms. Using a referral case and a standardized vignette, teachers described problems, goals, interventions, data collection, and consultation practices employed across prereferral, prereferral Intervention, referral, and post-referral phases of service delivery. Most participants demonstrated only vague knowledge of classroom interventions. Few accommodations were made in general classrooms for mildly-handicapped children, particularly following the prereferral phase. Participants consulted primarily with other general educators and secondarily with special educators. Consultation with school psychologists was unusual. Discussion focuses on implications for consultation, prereferral intervention, and inclusive services. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The development of beginning teachers' practice during a school placement is a multiplicity of mediated interaction between university and school based systems. Both systems have the common aim of training effective teachers. However day-to-day internal institution matters can cause tension between the learning goals set out for the beginning teacher by the university and the schools' drive to ensure maximum student performance in 'high stake' national tests. The aim of the intervention was to set up structures which might enable beginning teachers to develop the capacity to think about and reflect explicitly on their practice, through purposive activity in an authentic classroom environment. The context of the activity was a secondary science course which aimed to encourage new teachers to empathize with secondary school pupils (aged 11-16) and understand their conceptual difficulties in learning about science within the constraints of a 'curriculum delivery' lead culture. The dialogue engaged in as part of the intervention helped beginning teachers to think critically about practice during school placements.

AB  - Because children who are deaf or hard of hearing are being identified at birth, fitted with advanced hearing technology, and enrolled in early intervention programs, families increasingly seek professionals who can provide services that support their choice of listening and spoken language. The increased demand for these services and shortages of qualified personnel has led to the development of model in-service training programs for teachers of the deaf, speech-language pathologists, and audiologists. Three of these programs--the Carolina Summer Institute in Auditory-Verbal Practice, First "YEARS," and Professional Preparation in Cochlear Implants--provide in-service training opportunities that allow participants to significantly increase their knowledge and skills to serve the needs of children who are deaf or hard of hearing and who are learning to listen and talk.

AB  - Aims: Occupational therapists (OTs) often face barriers when trying to collaborate with teachers in school-based settings. Partnering for change (P4C), a collaborative practice model designed to support children with developmental coordination disorder, could potentially support all students with special needs. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore how teachers experience OT services delivered using the P4C model to support children with a variety of special needs. Methods: P4C was implemented at one elementary school in Courtenay, British Columbia. Eleven teachers participated in two focus groups and a one-on-one interview to gather descriptive, qualitative data. Grounded theory techniques were used for data analysis. Results: Four themes (collaborating in the thick of it all, learning and taking risks, managing limited time and resources, and appreciating responsive OT support) represented teachers' experiences of P4C. Conclusions: Teachers strongly preferred collaborative OT services based on the P4C model. Students with a variety of special needs were supported within their classrooms as teachers learned new strategies from the OT and found ways to embed these strategies into their daily routines.

This book is a welcome contribution to the development of an increased understanding of the Every Child Matters government agenda in practice. Throughout this book there is reference to the position in England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland and an attempt made to cover the similarities and differences in these countries of the UK. However, it must be noted that all contributors are from Scotland and England. This book provides a useful reference section and is indexed by subject and author. Professionals within education settings could certainly use this as a resource. The various chapters cover a range of issues and could provide an interesting basis for further discussion within schools and colleges, including in teacher training.

AB  - Whilst peer observation of teaching is well established as a practice that can enhance teaching quality, the challenge to fully embed this practice in universities remains unresolved. This article analyses the perspectives of 18 university leaders (nine Australian and nine English) drawn from a range of school-based leaders to senior leaders of learning and teaching. Our study indicates that some of the challenges associated with leading such schemes can be mitigated through approaches to educational leadership that enact a respectful and collegiate ethos. This we suggest can support developmental academic engagement in peer observation for positive and lasting change. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Reviews the book, Good practice in child protection by Clare Tilbury, Jennifer Osmond, Sandy Wilson, and Julie Clark (2007). This is a book written by Australian social workers for the direct Australian child protection context. The authors aim to focus on evidence-based practice and they draw on complex and topical issues, such as mental health, workload demands, and the over-representation of Indigenous children. The text is predominantly targeted at child protection and human service students, as well as beginning practitioners working in frontline child protection. The book is a concise, very readable and practical introduction for students and practitioners. The critical model that is created in this book does combine professional knowledge, values, and skills, as claimed. The book emphasizes the need for good foundations in practice and continual review and reflection, encouraging ‘‘high quality assessment and knowledge of contemporary research’’. It is in this messaging that the book can have a significant influence on the next generation of students and new practitioners. This foundational book has covered the broad issues and could be supported with a series of books that more specifically address the complex range of issues identified, such as mental health, domestic violence, and workload in the Australian context.

AB  - Objective: This study examined the efficacy of motivational strategies for increasing engagement into evidence-based, parenting interventions delivered through schools. Method: Participants were 122 mothers of kindergarten and third grade students attending an urban school that predominantly served Mexican American families living in low-income conditions. At pretest, mothers reported sociocultural characteristics, and teachers rated children's behavior. Mothers randomly assigned to the experimental condition received a multicomponent engagement package; mothers assigned to the control condition received a brochure plus a nonengagement survey interview. All families were offered a free parenting program delivered at their child's school. Dependent variables included parenting program enrollment, initiation (i.e., attending at least 1 session), and attendance. Results: Parents in the experimental condition were more likely to initiate compared with those in the control condition if their children had high baseline concentration problems (OR = 8.98, p < .001, 95% CI [2.55, 31.57]). Parents in the experimental condition attended more sessions than did those in the control condition if their children had high baseline concentration problems (p < .01, d = .49, 95% CI [.35, 2.26]) or conduct problems (p < .01, d = .54, 95% CI [.51, 2.56]). Highly acculturated parents attended more sessions if assigned to the experimental condition than the control condition (p < .01, d = .66, 95% CI [.28, 2.57]). Conclusions: The motivational engagement package increased parenting program initiation and attendance for parents of students at-risk for behavior problems.

AB  - This report summarizes the activities of the SIFT-OUT program, a federally funded project designed to prepare teams of university faculty, family members, practitioners, and agency representatives from six states, to serve as leaders in providing early intervention training in their states. A total of 166 state-level early intervention leaders with personnel preparation responsibilities and 92 interdisciplinary team members from Idaho, New Mexico, Texas, Indiana, Ohio, and North Carolina participated directly in SIFT-OUT activities. Documented benefits of participation included: (1) statistically significant increases in faculty knowledge and skills in early intervention content and training strategies; (2) greater faculty commitment to participation in community-based inservice and technical assistance activities; (3) preservice and inservice training that is of higher quality; and (4) increased linkages among state agencies, institutions of higher education, and consumers for personnel preparation at the state level. Leaders in the six participating states have identified the SIFT-OUT project as a catalyst for positive changes that will endure, changes such as: family involvement; increased interdisciplinary preparation; establishment of standards; and increased campus-community collaboration. The report discusses the project's accomplishments, dissemination activities, challenges, evaluation results, and impact. An appendix includes preservice and inservice personnel preparation quality indicators. (Contains 37 references.) (CR)

AB  - Presents a vision for personnel preparation of a well paid, well-education early childhood intervention workforce situated in 'learning communities', whereby parents, practitioners, administrators, consultants, and university and community college faculty are mutually accountable for creating quality early environments for children. Suggests that there are not currently the resources or the policies in place to support such a vision. Argues that there are 3 areas where changes are critical in order to create 'learning communities': (1) increasing collaboration among multiple partners at multiple levels; (2) attending to diversity issues; and (3) promoting family involvement in personnel preparation.

AB  - This final report summarizes the activities of a federally funded project designed to prepare higher education faculty to serve as leaders in providing and promoting quality interprofessional preservice instruction in their states. SCRIPT enhanced and replicated a validated model that had previously been developed, implemented and evaluated in 20 states. The model used a systems change approach, designed to make a long lasting and meaningful impact on personnel preparation programs. SCRIPT prepared teams of higher education faculty, family members, practitioners and agency representatives from eight states to serve as leaders in providing early childhood (0-9) intervention training in their states. A total of 254 state-level early childhood intervention leaders and 109 interdisciplinary team members from Missouri, Oklahoma, Wisconsin, Iowa, Kentucky, Nebraska, North Carolina, and North Dakota participated directly in SCRIPT activities. Documented benefits of participation included: (1) statistically significant increases in faculty knowledge and skills in early intervention content and training strategies; (2) greater faculty commitment to participating in community-based inservice and technical assistance activities; (3) higher quality preservice and inservice training; and (4) increased linkages among state agencies, institutions of higher education, and consumers for personnel preparation at the state level. This report describes the project's training model, activities and participants, and discusses its goals and objectives, conceptual framework, dissemination activities, challenges, evaluation results, and impact. An appendix includes preservice and inservice personnel preparation quality indicators. (Contains 37 references.) (SG)

AB  - Many factors affect the extent to which new approaches to improving early childhood educational practice, such as response to intervention (RTI), become embedded and sustained into the culture and practices of service settings. These include the strength of the evidence supporting the innovation; the presence or absence of an organizational culture, climate, and resources that could support and sustain change; and the competence and confidence of staff in implementing the approach. During this current period when the field is in the early stages of exploring the meaning and application of RTI in early childhood, if is an optimal time to think systemically and strategically about work-force support and professional development (PD) to implement the new approach. A complicating factor in doing this type of planning is the slim body of research on what constitutes effective PD in early childhood and almost nonexistent literature on PD related to early childhood RTI. The purpose of this chapter is to apply what is known about effective PD in early childhood fo early childhood RTI. In the first part of this chapter, a definition of PD and a framework from the National Professional Development Center on Inclusion (NPDCI 2008) are used to characterize key components that must be addressed in designing PD on RTI in early childhood education. In the second part of this chapter, an innovative, clinical teaching approach to designing PD curricula—the CONNECT 5-Step Learning Cycle—is introduced.

AB  - There is a great deal of literature surrounding the needs of regional Australia. This integrative review of the literature focuses on the experience of nursing academics teaching on a satellite campus, many of which are located in regional Australia. Four themes were identified: (1) challenges specific to regional satellite campuses, (2) student characteristics, (3) student experiences and (4) the academics’ experiences. These themes identified not only significant benefits but also considerable challenges to the provision of higher education on regional university campuses. The experience of nursing academics and indeed their students is remarkably different from the experience of their metropolitan counterparts, and therefore the local context needs to be considered in regional education provision. Australian regional nursing academics need to be multi-skilled to address the workload and social inequity in support service provision. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]

AB  - Reviews the book 'Child Protection and Mental Health Services: Interprofessional Responses to the Needs of Mothers,' by Nicky Stanley, Bridget Penhale, Denise Riordan, Rosaline S. Barbour and Sue Holden (2003). The book describes a survey of practitioners from health and childcare, looking at their views on the needs of mothers with mental health problems and who should provide for those needs. In addition, a small group of mothers was interviewed. Starting with a useful review of the literature concerning mental health needs and mothering, and the service context in which these needs are met, this book reminds that, both mental health services and childcare services have become preoccupied with risk. At the same time, policies recommend community care and family support, with resulting tensions. The book concludes that services should be specialized but also broad enough to meet the varied needs of mothers with a wide range of difficulties. The reviewer concludes that this is a useful study, clearly written, and the book will be helpful to both health and childcare workers, especially those with a responsibility for planning services.

AB  - Despite growing knowledge of the effectiveness of various interventions for children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), it is never clear whether a particular intervention will be effective for a specific child with ASD. Careful monitoring of an individual child's progress is necessary to know whether an intervention is effective. In this review, we examined intervention research studies focused on children with ASD in Grades K-12 that involve parents, teachers, and other school staff as data collectors. We describe the strategies that have been used in the 40 identified research studies to monitor progress in the areas of behavior and social communication. The results highlight monitoring strategies that may be helpful for parents and teachers to apply, and the discussion provides related suggestions to guide future research and practice.

Treatment integrity was measured daily using permanent products. The results showed that the 4 teachers markedly increased the integrity of the delivered treatment when they were provided with performance feedback. The results suggest that academic performance improved for the group of students as integrity improved.

AB  - This meta-analysis reviews the findings of 81 studies (N = 24,474) examining the relationship between teachers' verbal or nonverbal immediacy (or both) and students' learning outcomes. The cumulative evidence indicates meaningful correlations between teachers' nonverbal immediacy and student reports of perceived learning (r =.51) and affective learning (r =.49), but only a slight correlation with students' performance on cognitive learning measures (r =. 17). Teachers' verbal immediacy was found to correlate with students' perceived learning (r=.49) and affective learning (r=.49), but again the relationship with performed cognitive learning was notably smaller (r =.06). Average effect sizes were generally smaller in experimental research designs than in survey-type research, and generally larger when verbal/nonverbal immediacy was measured as a single construct. The cumulative results of this meta-analysis confirm that teacher immediacy has a substantial relationship with certain attitudes and perceptions of students in relation to their learning, but a modest relationship with cognitive learning performance.

AB  - This article explored factors related to teacher judgments that an intervention is either acceptable or unacceptable for use in typical classroom environments. The acceptability of various interventions was assessed by having 180 preservice and student teachers read case studies involving a classroom intervention and then judging the acceptability of the intervention according to five factors--whether the intervention was considered generally acceptable, whether it posed undue risk to the child, whether it required excessive teacher time, whether it had negative effects on nontarget children, and whether it required such high levels of teacher skill that the typical teacher could not implement it. The major outcomes of the study included: (a) the determination that acceptability of a classroom intervention is not a unitary concept, rather it embodies five components; (b) the construction of a reliable instrument for assessing the acceptability of classroom interventions; and(c) the finding that various interventions differ markedly in their acceptability. Results are discussed in terms of relevance to developing interventions that are effective and yet can be utilized by regular classroom teachers.

AB  - Victimisation is a traumatic experience linked to development of Borderline personality disorder (BPD). However, there is limited research investigating the developmental journey prior to BPD diagnosis. School environments offer an opportunity for BPD prevention and early intervention. A survey with 19 Australian family carers of people with BPD asked what they noticed during the person's infancy, childhood and adolescence, and their experiences of seeking help during that time. Sensitivity was most noticeable during infancy; difficulty making friends, school refusal/truancy and being bullied were prominent concerns once the child was at school; and concerns about anger, moodiness and impulsivity were the strongest prompts to seek help during adolescence, though doctor or teacher recommendation to do so was uncommon. BPD family carers' experiences suggest that improved focus on addressing bullying and communication is needed.

AB  - The health care industry is changing rapidly, and with it will come changes to managed health care as it is now known. This article addresses a fundamental paradigm shift with far reaching implications for the effectiveness of health care, the cost-efficiency of health care systems, and the service integration of systems (Masia, Anderson, McNeil, & Hawkins, 1997). These changes are affecting previously segregated delivery systems, specifically those of health and mental health. Increased costs and proposed budget cuts are forcing segregated systems into an overall integrated delivery system. Successful therapeutic outcomes in psyche-social treatment depend on a number of variables. In this manuscript, the author outlines worker characteristics that are recommended based on various research studies and general outcomes of behavioral change. Issues discussed include the similarity of client and worker characteristics, attributes of professionals versus paraprofessionals, and many common factors of worker efficacy. In addition, many treatment components are discussed such as length of therapy, behavior acquisition procedures, enhancement of treatment technologies, and level of intervention strategies such as individual treatment versus group treatment. A detailed cost analysis of social work follows, including cost benefits and cost effectiveness. Finally, a profile of the behavioral/health social worker is given that defines what abilities an effective behavioral social worker should possess. Among these are the depth of an acceptable knowledge base, the behavioral skills necessary for an intellectual and conceptual understanding of theories of human development and learning, and the utilization of techniques necessary to bring about behavioral changes in clinical practice. From these characteristics, a basis is formed for the emerging roles for behavioral interventions in primary care that will ultimately increase the quality of mental health care while effectively controlling medical costs. It has been shown that increasingly health care costs and the effective management of health care are of primary importance and concern to federal, state, and local governments. It is necessary to develop innovative, successful, and cost effective treatments and procedures. This manuscript proposes such a procedure by first defining the problems to be addressed, by applying research and studies for support, and by presenting an innovative model for cost effective managed health care and empirically based psycho-social intervention.

AB  - Meeting the future demand for a qualified geoscience workforce will require efforts to increase recruitment, retention, and graduation of an increasingly diverse student body. Doing this successfully requires renewed attention to the needs and characteristics of underrepresented students, which include ethnic and cultural minorities, women, and students with disabilities. We synthesize the current literature on successful science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) diversity programs and programs in the geosciences specifically through the lens of educational macrosystems. Macrosystems are an element of an approach to analysis of educational systems and institutions that adopts a social-ecological model. Interacting subsystems of microsystems, mesosystems, macrosystems, and exosystems operate together to contribute to student success. STEM fields in general and geoscience in particular have benefited from recent research into microsystems, the student-centric, intrinsic aspects of success. The synthesis we present here is intended to add a new dimension to this body of literature, highlighting reports from successful STEM and geoscience-specific programs that have worked to strengthen macrosystems, which are extrinsic factors that surround students. These include peer support and faculty mentoring networks, institutional bridge programs, systemic pedagogy reforms, and purposeful work to improve campus climate, culture, and accountability for diversity. This synthesis is not comprehensive but rather aims to highlight and illustrate elements of selected successful programs. We conclude with general recommendations and observations intended to be helpful to the geosciences education community in directing future work to optimize macrosystems in support of diversifying the geosciences.

Participants included 45 first and second grade teachers who completed a 16-item social validity questionnaire during each year of the SSIS-CIP efficacy trial. Findings indicated that teachers generally perceived the SSIS-CIP as a socially valid and feasible intervention for primary grades; however, teachers' ratings regarding ease of implementation and relevance and sequence demonstrated differences across grade levels in the second year of implementation.

AB  - Despite the numerous advantages in implementing school-based interventions after a trauma or disaster, particularly interventions mediated by teachers, only a few articles have been published on this subject. This article reviews the relevant literature and offers a conceptual framework for implementing teacher-mediated mental health clinical intervention programs among school-age children. The authors propose a process that mental health professionals and teachers may need to go through and the adaptation of roles required to be placed in an educational-therapeutic position within a school reactivation program. The authors describe such a program carried out in the city of Adapizari, Turkey, after the 1999 earthquakes in which estimates of posttraumatic stress disorder decreased from 30% to 18% within 4 weeks.

AB  - Background: Child survivors of a catastrophic earthquake in Turkey were evaluated three and a half years after the event, and three years after a sub-group participated in a teacher-mediated intervention developed by the authors. The goal of this follow-up study was to determine the long-term effectiveness of the original intervention. Methods: Subjects who participated in the intervention were compared with a control group of children similar in terms of demographics, risk and exposure. All children were evaluated in terms of posttraumatic, grief and dissociative symptomatology, as well as adaptive functioning (academic performance, social behavior and general conduct). Results: The severity of posttraumatic, grief and dissociative symptoms of the two groups was comparable. Teachers blind to group assignment rated participating children significantly higher than the control group in terms of adaptive functioning. Conclusions: Early post-disaster intervention addressing children and their educational milieu provides children with significant symptomatic reduction, allowing the mobilization of adaptive coping, thereby enhancing their overall functioning as observed in school.

AB  - Objective: The psychological outcomes that the exposure to mass trauma has on children have been amply documented in the past decades. The objective of this study is to describe the effects of a universal, teacher-based preventive intervention implemented with Israeli students before the rocket attacks that occurred during Operation Cast Lead, compared with a nonintervention but exposed control group. Method: The study sample consisted of 1,488 students studying in fourth and fifth grades in a city in southern Israel who were exposed to continuous rocket attacks during Operation Cast Lead. The intervention group included about half (53.5%) of the children who studied in six schools where the teacher-led intervention was implemented 3 months before the traumatic exposure. The control group (46.5% of the sample) included six schools matched by exposure in which the preventive intervention was not implemented. Children filled out the UCLA-PTSD Reaction Index and the Stress/Mood Scale 3 months after the end of the rocket attacks. Results: The intervention group displayed significantly lower symptoms of posttrauma and stress/mood than the control group (p < .001). Control children had 57% more detected cases of postraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) than participant children. This difference was significantly more pronounced among boys (10.2% versus 4.4%) and less among girls (12.5% versusl0.1%). Conclusions: The teacherbased, resilience-focused intervention is a universal, cost-effective approach to enhance the preparedness of communities of children to mass trauma and to prevent the development of PTSD after exposure.

AB  - Reviews the book 'Children and Parents: Clinical Issues for Psychologists and Psychiatrists,' (see record [rid]2003-88242-000[/rid]) edited by R. Gupra and D. Parry-Gupta. This book sets out to support 'evidence based practice'. The editors are concerned to focus on issues of key interest to clinicians; particularly those that they judge are not usually covered by the evidence based literature. This means that they include an interesting but diverse mix of topics, including working with children with deliberate self-harm, the evidence base in relation to adoption, and the role of grandparents. Chapters focusing on very detailed accounts of evidence in relation to particular types of difficulties sit alongside those that aim to provide broad sweep overviews (e.g. in relation to genetics and behaviour).

AB  - The author argues that to truly help young students who struggle with reading and writing--including those with identified disabilities or conditions that effect building literacy--teachers should avoid the approach of focusing on a student's deficits and creating labels for him or her (dyslexic, English language learner, and so on). A rush to label a student and place that learner in a disability category puts him or her at risk for being segregated into special education programs or separate instruction. There, too often, kids receive training on literacy skills like phonics in a fragmented manner and miss out on a literacy-rich environment that grows authentic reading and language skills; students fall behind not only in literacy, but often in other subjects. Shunning labels and seeking various opportunities for instruction in each individual child's characteristics is more likely to build good readers and writers. Wolter describes five practices toward that end.

AB  - Comments on the article by R. Gersten et al (1997) on the roles and responsibilities of researchers in special education. B. Y. L. Wong suggests that Gersten et al have pinpointed variables that preclude teachers' sustenance of research-based instructional strategies. These variables fall squarely on the shoulders of intervention researchers. However, they have not attended to variables that stem from teachers themselves. Wong focuses on teacher variables that account for their lack of initiation and sustenance of research-based instructional strategies. She specifically highlights teachers' (1) overarching conceptions of teaching, (2) subject-area knowledge, and (3) sense of self-efficacy, and focuses most on teacher self-efficacy. Suggestions for promoting teacher self-efficacy are also included. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

PDSs are expected to improve student achievement in two primary ways: (1) by enriching and intensifying the learning environment through professional development of in-service teachers and strategic use of PDS human resources (e.g., mentor teachers, university faculty members, and student teachers), and (2) by improving the preservice preparation of future teachers so that they enter the classroom better prepared to maximize student learning and development. In this chapter, the authors review the existing literature with a focus on three key areas: (1) the ways in which PDS models are structured to improve student learning, yielding a rich description of PDS interventions for student achievement; (2) the impact of PDSs on student learning and achievement, with a specific focus on publications that used rigorous research designs and/or captured student achievement with multiple measures; and (3) the extent to which PDSs have a differential impact on the learning of low-income and culturally and racially diverse students.

AB  - Teacher stress and burnout have a detrimental effect on the stability of the teaching workforce. However, the possible consequences of teacher burnout on teaching quality and on student learning outcomes are less clear, especially in special education settings. We applied Maslach and Leiter's (1999) model to understand the direct effects of burnout on teaching in general and stress arising from interaction with a specific student on the individualized education program (IEP) outcomes of young children with autism spectrum disorder. We also examined indirect effects through teaching quality and student engagement. The results indicated that one of the three components of burnout--teacher personal accomplishment--was directly related to IEP outcomes, a distal effect, whereas stress was directly related to teaching quality and student engagement, which were more proximal effects. In addition, teacher stress, emotional exhaustion, and depersonalization had indirect effects on IEP outcomes through teaching quality and student engagement.

AB  - This paper describes a method of analysing teacher growth in the context of science education. It focuses on the identification of pathways in the development of secondary school teachers' pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) by the use of the interconnected model of teachers' professional growth (IMTPG). The teachers (n = 12) participated in a one-year action research project focused on their individual concerns related to teaching science. The use of the IMTPG revealed that teachers use different pathways of learning to develop different aspects of their PCK. For each PCK component, three distinct pathways could be identified, two of which clearly were associated with professional growth. When examining these two pathways in detail, it was found that (1) teachers learned about new instructional strategies and assessment methods mostly through literature reviews and discussions with peers and (2) teachers who analyzed and reflected on student learning as it happened in their classrooms developed understandings that helped them to select and apply instructional strategies to further promote student learning. Both the analytical method as well as the identification of the different developmental pathways help to better understand teacher development in the context of classroom practices.

AB  - One hundred sixty-eight elementary and middle school teachers participated in this investigation on the impact of student gender and ethnicity on teacher recommendations for interventions for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Participants read a scenario describing a student with ADHD accompanied by a student photo which depicted his/her ethnicity and gender. Participants were then asked how strongly they would recommend four common interventions. Findings suggest teachers are more likely to recommend interventions requiring less parental involvement for minority students than for Caucasian students. Elementary and special education teachers were more likely to recommend interventions with greater empirical support than were middle school and regular education teachers. Ramifications for intervention selection in schools and suggestions for future investigations are reviewed.

AB  - Sexuality education forms part of the national school curricula of most sub-Saharan African countries, yet risk-related sexual behaviour among young people continues to fuel the HIV pandemic in this part of the world. One of the arguments put forward to explain why sexuality education seems to have had little impact on sexual risk-taking is that existing curricula have neglected to take into account the complexity of the social, cultural and gender norms that influence the behaviour of school-going young people in sub-Saharan Africa. Over the past few years, the Department of Basic Education in South Africa has recognised the need to provide guidance to teachers on the content, pedagogical processes and messages that are relevant to their specific context. This paper critically reflects on findings from a literature-based study conducted to identify the cognitive and social factors influencing the behaviour of school-going young people in South Africa and the risk and protective facto)

AB  - Executive functions (EFs) develop rapidly in preschoolers and lay an important foundation for school readiness. One potential method of supporting EF development is through mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs). Whereas studies with older children and adults have supported this approach, research with young children has been more limited. In the current study, we evaluated the effectiveness, acceptability, and feasibility of "Mini-Mind," a 12-session MBI created specifically for preschoolers. We used a randomized controlled design in a sample of 27 (intervention n = 12) preschoolers (3-5 years old). The evaluation included indirect measures of EF skills completed by teachers who were blinded to the experimental condition of the students. Additionally, parents, teachers, children, and facilitators provided feedback about the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention. Findings revealed mostly nonsignificant, small-to-medium effects in favor of the intervention group on indirect measures of EF skills. Furthermore, "Mini-Mind" was rated as highly feasible and acceptable by children and stakeholders. Overall, the findings support the implementation and continued evaluation of "Mini-Mind" in more diverse settings.

AB  - The need for improved well-being of children in Britain has been highlighted in a raft of reports both nationally and internationally. In this paper, I aim to explore some of the practicalities experienced by schools that, in response, have implemented social and emotional learning (SEL) interventions as a means to improve child well-being. I make the case that the discourses of emotions inherent within such schemes, and the various supranational publications, are susceptible to exploitation and manifestation. The study employed a mixed methodological approach, utilising a combination of quantitative and qualitative strategies with primary school staff members including head teachers, teachers, teaching assistants, welfare staff, other support staff, etc. Three phases of study--questionnaires, focus groups and individual interviews--were administered as a means of creating an insight into the interpretation and use of SEL in these settings. The findings demonstrate a propensity for staff to conflate social and emotional aspects of self with more moralistic constructs of identity, revealing how SEL schemes have the potential to act as tools of cultural imperialism by marginalising and/or endorsing certain values, norms and behaviours. After maintaining that such realisations of these schemes may impede rather than improve the lived experiences of children, that are fundamental to their social and emotional well-being and mental health, I make the case for alternative approaches to SEL in schools.

AB  - Youth mental health is a global concern, with international evidence of increasing adolescent psychopathology. Researching ways to support young people's mental health and well-being is an essential responsibility of social workers. Family connectedness is a key factor for youth well-being, but there is little detail about how young people experience it. This article contributes qualitative insights into young people's experiences of family connectedness that will support social work practice with families. Interviews were conducted with thirty-one young people-aged fifteen and sixteen years-from Canberra, Australia. Young people highlighted the need to be engaged in family life, how common factors could help family members connect and their need to feel valued. The role of connections formed prior to adolescence and the way these connections changed as young people aged were also evident. Recommendations are made for social workers to support young people by building and maintaining family connectedness throughout adolescence. Thematic network maps, which capture young people's perspectives, are provided to support assessment, intervention and education on family connectedness.

AB  - Reviews the book, Educational psychologists in multi-disciplinary settings: Investigations into the work of educational psychologists in children's services authorities (2008). Set against a background of role diversification and innovation for Educational Psychologists (EPs), this book comprises three substantial chapters, each written by a research team commissioned by the Association of Educational Psychologists (AEP), with sponsorship from the Children’s Workforce Development Council (CWDC), to investigate EPs’ work within a specific multi-disciplinary setting. Each chapter follows a clear basic structure presenting a literature review, the research project methodology, results and then conclusions. EPs are generally clear and positive about their specific contribution within multi-disciplinary settings and see the potential to extend such roles in specific ways. However, each investigation identifies barriers to further role expansion such as limited service capacity; the need for evidence about where EP input is most effective; limited views of their role by others, and the EPs’ own training needs.

AB  - Attendance at overnight school camp is an integral component of the Australian educational landscape. However, some students are reluctant to attend camp, while others refuse to attend at all. School psychologists play an important part in supporting these students and their families, and teachers. While much is published about general school refusal, there is surprisingly little attention given to the specific management of school camp refusal and reluctance. This article summarises the contribution of the related theoretical areas of childhood anxiety, school refusal, and homesickness. It then outlines, through a case study example, a management approach for school psychologists, from presentation of the problem to assessment, through to informed intervention, including a suite of strategies to support the student, parents and teachers, who have duty of care during camps.

AB  - Personalized learning models can give each student differentiated learning experiences based on their needs, interests, and strengths, including students with disabilities. Personalized learning can pinpoint specific gaps in student learning, identify where a student is on his or her learning pathway, and provide the appropriate interventions to support students at just the right time. The passage of the "Every Student Succeeds Act" (ESSA) provides a historic opportunity for states to redesign K-12 education systems to support competency-based, personalized learning. Some future outcomes from ESSA include: (1) State policymakers ensuring that preservice preparation, professional development, and evaluation frameworks give educators, course designers, and administrators the supports and resources they need to understand and meet the diverse, unique needs of students with disabilities and apply best practices; (2) The usage of multiple flexible pathways for learning that create distinct, rigorous paths for students to gain the real-world skills and experiences they need to be successful after high school. These pathways encompass learning outside traditional classrooms: after-school programs, apprenticeships, community service, internships, independent study, online courses, performing arts, private instruction, and career and technical and college-level coursework; and (3) Blended and online learning tools that support these personalized pathways by offering flexible pacing, differentiated instruction, immediate interventions, and anytime, everywhere learning. Personalized, competency-based learning can close achievement gaps for students with disabilities and truly prepare them for success in college and the new economy.

AB  - The community college student population has been found to be less academically prepared than their four-year counterparts. This relatively at-risk group is argued to struggle with academic motivation in the college setting. Researchers studying student implicit theories of intelligence have found that students who struggle in academia may do so because of maladaptive beliefs about the nature of their own intelligence. Students who struggle tend to believe their intelligence is stable (i.e. have a "fixed" mindset) whereas students who see their intelligence as malleable (i.e. have a "growth" mindset) have been found to have more adaptive behaviors that are more conducive to learning. Students' goals in the academic context are important, as students with "mastery" orientations (who set goals for learning) had greater persistence and success than students with "performance" orientations (who set goals for "showing" learning or "not showing" a lack of learning). The present study was designed to assess whether an intervention targeting community college students' implicit theories of intelligence was effective in a large southeastern community college at increasing students' academic success, level of growth mindset, and level of mastery goal orientation. Results following implementation of the Go for Growth! intervention suggested that instructors found the intervention easy and worthwhile to implement and found some indications that students receiving the intervention have greater academic success in the course containing intervention, although the theory suggesting that this occurs through improving levels of growth mindset and mastery orientation was not supported. It was also noted that instructors had a significant influence on their students' grades, which might indicate that the intervention may also have impacted the perceptions of the instructors regarding student grades.

AB  - Examined a community-based program in China to prevent initiation of drug use in young males. Similar intervention and control areas were selected. Village leaders, teachers, women, and youth leaders were recruited to participate in the program. Community activities were organized and intervention activities in schools were implemented. Subsequently, 748 males (aged 15-49 yrs) in intervention areas and 559 males in control areas completed surveys concerning knowledge and attitudes toward AIDS, previous and current drug usage, and previous and current sexual behavior. Results show a 2.7-fold greater reduction in drug use initiation in the intervention area, of 1.59% vs 0.60%. Reduction was highest among males aged 15-19 yrs, single men, illiterate men, and the Jingpo minority. HIV/AIDS knowledge and attitudes and recognition of drug problems were all significantly better in the intervention area. It is concluded that community-based intervention programs to prevent drug use can be successful in rural areas of China. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective To document current clinical practices for medical regimen adherence assessment and intervention in the field of pediatric psychology. Methods 113 members of the Society of Pediatric Psychology completed an anonymous online survey that assessed use of adherence assessments and interventions in clinical practice, barriers and facilitators to their use, and preferred resources for obtaining information on adherence assessments and interventions. Results Respondents reported using a range of adherence assessment and intervention strategies, some of which are evidence-based. Barriers to implementing these clinical strategies included time constraints and lack of familiarity with available clinical tools. Respondents reported that education about effective clinical tools would facilitate their use of adherence assessments and interventions. Conclusions Future research and clinical efforts in adherence should consider developing practical tools for clinical practice, making accessible resources to promote dissemination of these tools, and increase understanding of clinician implementation of adherence assessments and interventions.

AB  - The selected study examined the long-term effects of the "Seattle Social Development Project (SSDP)," an elementary-school-based intervention designed to improve students' social skills and engagement. The study analyzed data on about 600 young adults who had been students in 15 public elementary schools serving high-crime areas in Seattle, Washington in the 1980s. Study participants were interviewed at ages 24 and 27. Three research groups were created: (1) students receiving SSDP in both early and later elementary school; (2) students receiving SSDP in later elementary school only; and (3) students not receiving SSDP services. Study authors reported that receiving SSDP in both early and late elementary school improved some mental health outcomes in young adulthood and reduced the likelihood of contracting a sexually transmitted disease. The program did not affect rates of substance use or involvement with the criminal justice system. Although the research groups were well-matched on a number of initial characteristics, including gender, race/ethnicity, and childhood poverty, What Works Clearinghouse has reservations about the reported results because the research groups may have been different from each other in ways not controlled for in the analysis.

AB  - The study reviewed in this paper examined the effect of the "Middle School Physical Activity and Nutrition" ("M-SPAN)" intervention on the physical activity level of middle school students. For this 2-year study, 24 middle schools from six districts in southern California were stratified by school district and then randomly assigned to either "M-SPAN" or a comparison condition. To assess students' physical activity levels and the content (referred to as "lesson context" in the article) of physical education (PE) classes, researchers observed students in PE classes on 11 randomly selected days for each school throughout the 2-year study period. Researchers documented the lesson content of the classes and observed a total of 1,849 lessons taught by 214 teachers (between seven and 14 teachers per school, with an average class size of 37.5 students). The study assessed the effectiveness of "M-SPAN" by examining moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), the amount of time students spent either walking or being very active, and other types of activities and PE lesson content across schools that received the "M-SPAN" training. The study found that the "M-SPAN" intervention caused a statistically significant improvement in the amount of time students spent in MVPA, and the What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) confirms this study-level finding. The WWC calculated the "M-SPAN" intervention as improving the MVPA in schools by an average of 3 minutes per lesson (approximately 0.79 school standard deviation units) across the 2-year period of the study. The research described in this report meets WWC evidence standards without reservations. Appended are: (1) Study details; (2) Outcome measures for each domain; (3) Study findings for each domain; and (4) Supplemental findings by domain. A glossary of terms is included.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of paper was to explore the attitudes of Polish psychology students towards lesbian mothers whose children undergo psychological intervention, in an imaginary situation of providing professional support to the child. The authors found 3 types of psychologist behaviour: contact omission (withdrawal from the intervention, mother's partner exclusion), apparent appreciation of mother's partner and authentic appreciation of mother's partner (with women comparable participation). The authors explored an interaction between these attitudes and the support for gay and lesbian rights, the origin of the child (from a previous heterosexual relationship or present, homosexual one) and demographic variables. Methods: 97 students of psychology were examined at the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan, using the custom survey. Results: Respondents were most likely to include mother's partner to intervention, and the least - to avoid contact. Based on cluster analysis we found three types of attitude: unconditional acceptance, conditional acceptance, dependent on whether the child was born due in heterosexual or lesbian relationship and avoidance / rejection. The attitude of participants was associated with the declared support for gay rights, there was no correlation with gender and age. Conclusions: Due to the significant level of social prejudice against gays and lesbians in Poland, the issue of homosexual parenting and social functioning of gay and lesbians' children should become an area of research and scientific debate. There is a necessity of the introduction of this issue to the curricula of higher education and the implementation of formal, systematic training on sexual diversity for the professionals supporting families.

AB  - Objectives To identify the roles and settings in which patients participate as teachers in medical education and the benefits to learners, their educational institutions, and participating patients. Design Review of publications from 1970 to October 2001 providing descriptions, evaluations, or research of programmes involving patients as teachers in medical education. Data sources 1848 references were identified from various electronic databases. Applying inclusion criteria to abstracts generated 100 articles, from which 23 were selected after independent scrutiny. Results 13 articles discussed the role of patients in teaching physical examination skills, mostly musculoskeletal examination. Patients also taught pelvic and male genitorectal examination skills. Teaching roles varied, and 19 articles referred to patients' involvement as assessors. 18 articles described patients' training, with some patients being assessed. Reports of learners' experiences were all positive, many valuing the insights and confidence gained from practising skills on patients in a teaching role. Some learners preferred being taught by trained patients rather than doctors. Patients who were consulted enjoyed their teaching role. Several articles commented on the high quality of patients' teaching. Remuneration varied from payment of expenses to an hourly rate. Motivation for recruiting patients included the desire to reduce costs and the value attributed to the consumers' perspective. Conclusion Involving patients as teachers has important educational benefits for learners. Patients offer unique qualities that can enhance the acquisition of skills and change attitudes towards patients.

AB  - The introduction of living invertebrates into the classroom was investigated. First, possible anchor points for a lesson with living invertebrates are explored by referring to the curriculum of primary/secondary schools and to out-of-school learning. The effectiveness of living animals for increasing interest, motivation, and achievement in recent research is discussed. Next, the Vivarium, an out-of-school learning facility with living invertebrates, is described. The effects of an intervention study with living invertebrates on achievement are then investigated at school (School condition) and out of school (University condition); a third group served as a control condition. The sample consisted of 1861 students (an age range of 10-12 years). Invertebrate-inspired achievement was measured as pre-, post-, and follow-up-tests. Measures of trait and state motivation were applied. The nested data structure was treated with three-level analyses. While achievement generally increased in the treatment groups as compared to the control group, there were significant differences by treatment. The University condition was more effective than the School condition. Achievement was positively related to conscientiousness/interest and negatively to tension. The study concludes that out-of-school learning offers achievement gains when compared to the same treatment implemented at school. The outlook focuses on further research questions that could be implemented with the Vivarium. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In graduate social work education, faculty advisors together with practice instructors can improve social work students' skills to link the practical aspects of ‘work responsibilities’ to the clinical underpinnings of case management. Often students are taught the direct services (case management) with a view solely focused on the practical aspects of care, and this curtails the students' opportunity to learn the clinical interventions that exist in all components of social work: to identify, understand and apply clinical dynamics to presenting problems. The authors discuss their work in addressing case management from a clinical perspective with MSW students and recommendations for its inclusion in graduate social work programs.

AB  - China is expected to have a rapid growth in specialized early intervention (EI) services for young children ages birth to 6 and their families. A major barrier in the provision of EI services in China is the shortage of well-trained EI personnel. In 2013, a Home-Based Early Intervention Program (HBEIP) was started at South China Normal University (SCNU) in Guangzhou, China to prepare future professionals to use family-centered EI practices adapted from similar programs in the United States. During the first year of implementation, HBEIP collected data from a self-efficacy survey and a needs assessment. Results from the evaluation showed that Chinese trainees perceived the family-centered approach to EI as relevant and valuable, and indicated needs for improving supervision and coaching supports in future implementation of HBEIP. The research team discussed implications for cross-cultural adaptation and implementation of personnel training practices. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study examined the effect of using an iPad for students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) on self-monitoring their behaviors in class. Four students with ASD were taught on-task behaviors by watching self-modeled video saved in the application "Choiceworks" on their iPads, and collected data on their own behaviors. A single subject research design with ABAB phases was used. Student behaviors were observed using interval recording and behavioral occurrences were compared across phases. Results showed that the participating students' on-task behaviors (e.g., facing forward, looking at teacher, i.e. eye contact, and working on the assignment) were increased when an iPad was used for their self-monitoring.

AB  - Background: By September 2016, approximately 653,865 people in China were living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) and 492,725 people were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). PLWHA frequently experience discrimination in all domains of their personal and social lives. The World Health Organization includes discrimination in its list of social determinants of health factors that have been linked to poor physical and psychological health. This paper identifies the family support enjoyed and discrimination faced by people infected with HIV and examines the effect they have on patients' quality of life (QOL) as they undergo ART in China. Methods: We conducted this observational cohort study of ART-treated patients with HIV in Guangxi Province using a questionnaire survey at baseline, 6, 12, and 24 months, starting in 2010. Descriptive analysis was used to describe the demographic characteristics (e.g., age, sex, educational level, marital status, and employment status) of participants. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were employed to examine the relationships between family support, discrimination, and QOL. Results: In the study, 90.4% (n = 281) of patients received family support at baseline, here defined as the initiation of ART, 91.8% (n = 244) received family support 6 months into ART, 95.5% (n = 220) at 12 months, and 94.3% (n = 230) at 24 months. The proportion of patients who did not feel discriminated against by their families was 87.2% (n = 274) at baseline, 90.4% (n = 229) 6 months into ART, 90.0% (n = 210) at 12 months, and 94.5% (n = 219) at 24 months. Patients' overall QOL scores were positively associated with having received family support (OR = 2.74, P = 0.040, 95% CI: 1.68-4.47), not feeling discriminated against by their families (OR = 1.3, P = 0.041, 95% CI: 1.07-1.59) or discrimination from patients themselves, including never experiencing fear of abandonment by family (OR = 2.05, P = 0.025, 95% CI: 1.49-2.82). Conclusions: Family support along with no or minimal discrimination was found to contribute to QOL among people infected with HIV. Their overall QOL tended to improve significantly as ART continued. This suggests that strategies meant to improve and strengthen family support, care for PLWHA, and promote HIV screening among high-risk populations should be explored by both policy makers and researchers.

This study extends Ram's (2015. Hostility or hospitality? A review on violence, bullying and sexual harassment in the tourism and hospitality industry. Current Issues in Tourism. doi:10.1080/13683500.2015.1064364) assertion by examining the effect of abusive supervision experiences on student employees' turnover intentions in a hospitality and tourism context in a high power distance culture, Ecuador. The results showed that abusive supervision was positively related to turnover intentions, and its effect was stronger than co-worker support, with the abusive supervision-turnover intentions relationship being fully mediated by perceived organizational support (POS). In addition, co-worker emotional support was found to attenuate the negative effects of abusive supervision on POS. All in all, the findings highlight the roles of POS in explaining the relation between abusive supervision and turnover intentions and co-worker emotional support in buffering the negative effect of abusive supervision. The important role of culture is discussed.

AB  - This paper explores the impact of gender on the employment of men in early childhood education and care (ECEC) centres through the voices of male and female early childhood teachers (ECTs) working in China. Gender imbalance in the ECEC workforce is a global phenomenon, and there has been little research about it in countries such as China. This study was based on online interviews with 16 ECTs from three major cities in China. Findings indicated that ECTs' perceptions conformed largely with traditional gender stereotypes in Chinese culture. Western expectations that men's participation in ECEC could challenge traditional gender stereotypes and promote gender diversity were not reflected in either Chinese academic literature reviewed or the participants' views captured in this research. The appreciation of masculinity in Chinese culture and implied disadvantages are considered within a global context of empowering women and girls.

AB  - The aim was to investigate and compare body image, body dissatisfaction, dieting, disordered eating, exercise and eating disorders among trainee health education/physical education (H&PE) and non-H&PE teachers. Participants were 502 trainee teachers randomly selected from class groups at three Australian universities who completed the questionnaire. H&PE males and females had significantly poorer body image and higher levels of body dissatisfaction, dieting and disordered eating behaviors than non-H&PE participants. H&PE teachers were more likely to over-exercise and have exercise disorders, but very few self-identified problems with objectively assessed excessive exercise behaviors. Lifetime prevalence of eating disorders was 12.5% in H&PE males, 0% in non-H&PE males, 7.7% in H&PE females and 6% in non-H&PE females. Few participants had received any past or current treatment. Of particular concern is the likelihood of the teachers’ inappropriate and dangerous attitudes and behaviors being intentionally or unintentionally conveyed to their school students. Those planning school health education, nutrition education and school-based obesity prevention programs should provide suitable training for the teachers involved. Screening and treatment services among teachers may also be helpful in order to detect, treat and educate young teachers about body image, dieting, disordered eating and physical activity practices.

AB  - This study examined the impact of two interventions on body image, eating disorder risk and excessive exercise among 170 (65% female) trainee health education and physical education (HE&PE) teachers of mean (standard deviation) age 21.6 (2.3) who were considered an ‘at-risk’ population for poor body image and eating disorders. In the first year of the study, the control group cohort (n = 49 females, 20 males) received the regular didactic health education curriculum; in the second year of the study, the Intervention 1 cohort (n = 31 females, 21 males) received a self-esteem and media literacy health education program and in the third year of the study, the Intervention 2 cohort (n = 30 females, 19 males) received a combined self-esteem, media literacy and dissonance program using online and computer-based activities. Intervention 2 produced the best results, with males improving significantly in self-esteem, body image and drive for muscularity. Intervention 2 females improved significantly on Eating Disorders Inventory Drive for Thinness, Eating Disorder Examination and excessive exercise. The improvements were consistent at 6-month follow-up for females. It is feasible to promote body image, reduce body dissatisfaction and reduce excessive exercise among trainee HE&PE teachers via a health education curriculum.

AB  - Class size, within or intra-class grouping, and pupil-teacher ratio have drawn a great deal of interest in terms of educational policy. Educational researchers outside of Japan have directed their attention to these issues, and their accumulated findings have been incorporated into policy implementation. However, few Japanese educational psychologists have studied these topics. The present review article contends that class size, intra-class grouping, and pupil-teacher ratio should be addressed by educational psychology, because this field deals with students' learning behavior and individual differences. In that context, the present article surveys the development of policies in Japan on the reduction of class size, summarizes trends in research examining the impact of these issues on pupils, and suggests that research findings on class size outside of Japan have a remote applicability to Japanese educational policy in terms of characteristics of classrooms in Japanese schools. The discussion also proposes educational psychology research agendas that might result in findings conducive to a discussion of policy related to appropriate class size.

AB  - Purpose: This study was performed to develop an infection prevention education program for child care teachers and to verify its effects. Methods: The study was conducted using a nonequivalent control group with a pretest-posttest design. Four private daycare centers (2 centers per city) that were alike in terms of the number of children by age, number of child care teachers, and child care environment were chosen. Participants were assigned to the experimental group (n=20) or control group (n=20). As a part of the program, visiting education (90 min) was provided in the 1st week, and smartphone application education (10 min) was provided thrice a week, in the 2nd and 3rd weeks. Results: Child care teachers' self-efficacy for infection prevention revealed a significant interaction effect between the group and time of measurement (F=21.62, p<.001). In terms of infection prevention behavior, a significant difference was observed between the experimental and control groups (z=-5.36, p<.001). Conclusion: The program implemented in this study was effective in improving the infection prevention self-efficacy and infection prevention behavior of child care teachers. Thus, this program may be effective in enhancing their infection control.

AB  - Constructing a meaningful learning network with online students can be challenging for many reasons. First, because there is literally a distance between the instructor and the student, and second, because the majority of online students rarely communicate specific details to their instructors about what aspects of the course are effective or ineffective. Without student observations or clear instructor/student communication, as distance educators, how do we know if our online classrooms are truly supporting our students' learning experiences? To address this concern and increase student engagement, Wiki based dynamic quizzes were designed and integrated into online classrooms. The following paper will discuss: history and definition of Wikis, review of literature, three case study experiences, suggestions for seamless dynamic quiz application in the online classroom and conclusion.

AB  - Recently, situated willingness to communicate (WTC) has received increasing research attention in addition to traditional quantitative studies of trait-like WTC. This article is an addition to the former but unique in two ways. First, it investigates both trait and state WTC in a classroom context and explores ways to combine the two to reach a fuller understanding of why second language (L2) learners choose (or avoid) communication at given moments. Second, it investigates the communication behavior of individuals and of the group they constitute as nested systems, with the group as context for individual performance. An interventional study was conducted in a class for English as a foreign language (EFL) with 21 students in a Japanese university. During discussion sessions in English over a semester in which Initiation--Response--Feedback (IRF) patterns were avoided to encourage students to initiate communication, qualitative data based on observations, student self-reflections, and interviews and scale-based data on trait anxiety and WTC were collected. The analyses, which focused on three selected participants, revealed how differences in the frequency of self-initiated turns emerged through the interplay of enduring characteristics, including personality and proficiency, and contextual influences such as other students' reactions and group-level talk--silence patterns.

AB  - The aim of this study is to determine the types and frequencies of violence encountered by teachers in primary and high schools in Niğde province in Turkey, and, in addition, to determine the perceptions of teachers regarding the reasons for and methods of prevention of violent actions at schools. One hundred forty-two teachers were chosen for this research out of 3,397 teachers in Niğde by rational sampling. Data was gathered through public surveys. The frequency distribution used for analysis of data was determined separately as a percentage in a chart. Teachers defined violence as 'whole verbal or physical harming behavior.' They considered family reasons to be the main reason for violence at schools and suggest that more effective student advising services and disciplinary regulations be performed as prevention.

AB  - The purposes of this study were (1) to develop a teacher training program that integrates knowledge management (KM) and blended learning and examine its effects on pre-service teachers’ professional development in creativity instruction; and (2) to explore the mechanisms underlying the success of such KM-based training. The employed KM model was the SECI, which consists of four modes of knowledge conversion: socialization, externalization, combination, and internalization. Forty-four pre-service teachers participated in this 17-week experimental instructional program. Repeated Measure Analysis of Variance and content analysis revealed that the training program designed in this study effectively improved pre-service teachers’ professional knowledge and personal teaching efficacy in their teaching of creativity. Moreover, this study showed that blended learning, guided practice, observational learning, group discussion, peer evaluation, and feedback are important mechanisms underlying this success.

AB  - This special issue of Assessment for Effective Intervention is devoted to the ongoing research in curriculum-based measurement (CBM). Curriculum-based measurement refers to a systematic set of direct, simple, and quick measures that produce data for making special education decisions. The CBM data serve as general outcome indicators that measure the 'vital signs' of student achievement. The primary purpose of CBM is to enable teachers to improve student performance. Various CBM measures have been developed that allow teachers to continuously monitor the progress of their elementary students in the basic skills areas of reading, written expression, spelling and math. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) Amendments of 1997 raised expectations for students in special education by emphasizing accountability and improved educational achievement. No longer is the law satisfied when school-based teams develop individualized education programs (IEPs) that merely provide students with disabilities access to special education. In this issue, we examine the implementation of CBM in schools as well as new research on CBM. Curriculum-based measurement represents a technology that can help to ensure we meet the increased expectations required by the law. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Given the increasing pressures of high-stakes accountability associated with state mandates and No Child Left Behind (U.S. Department of Education, 2002), linking teacher preparation within professional development schools to the goal of school improvement has become essential. This article illustrates the University of Florida's efforts to understand the ways that prospective teacher education can be linked to individual school improvement efforts. It explains how teacher educators and their school-based partners collaboratively craft their professional development school work with prospective and practicing teachers to target school improvement and teacher learning. Four models for engaging in inquiry-oriented school improvement are illustrated and the factors that underlie their design are outlined. The four models illustrate the ways that inquiry-oriented professional development school work contributes to individual school improvement efforts while cultivating in its participants an inquiry stance, a pedagogical content knowledge base, and a favorable disposition toward participating in school change.

AB  - Many countries have invested heavily in facilities and teacher training for the infusion of information technology (IT) into various school subjects. The background besetting this innovation and how far learning has improved thereby are important concerns for the education sector. They are examined here with respect to Hong Kong, which is a mixed Chinese-western society now seeking to promote independent learning in all areas of the school curriculum. Geography is chosen for study because IT makes possible numerous changes and benefits to teaching and learning the subject. Among others, IT can help in testing hypotheses and solving problems of an environmental and spatial nature. Literature reviews, however, suggest that the frequency, extent and level of use are limited. This discrepancy between expectation and reality suggests that many necessary teacher and organisational conditions for implementation are not present, including the lack of appropriate hardware and software, technic)

AB  - Background: Teaching is a key component of medical practice, but medical students receive little formal training to develop their teaching skills. A longitudinal Students as Teachers (SAT) program was created at the University of Toronto to provide medical students with opportunities to acquire an understanding of educational pedagogy and practice teaching early in their medical training. This program was 7-months in duration and consisted of monthly educational modules, practical teaching sessions, feedback, and reflective exercises. Methods: A mixed methods study design was used to evaluate initial outcomes of the SAT program by obtaining the perspectives of 18 second-year medical students. Participants filled out questionnaires at the beginning and end of the 7-month program to indicate their skill level and confidence in teaching. Differences between pre- and post-intervention scores were further explored in a group interview of 5 participants. Results: Participants expressed a high degree of satisfaction with the SAT program structure and found the educational modules and practical teaching sessions to be particularly beneficial to their learning. Over the course of the program, there were significant increases in students' confidence in teaching, and self-perceived teaching capacity and communication skills. Furthermore, participants discussed improvements in their effectiveness as learners. Conclusions: Teaching is a skill that requires ongoing practice. Our results suggest that a longitudinal program consisting of theoretical modules, practical teaching sessions, feedback, and reflective exercises for medical students may improve teaching and communication skills, and equip them with improved learning strategies. This program also provides students with insight into the experience of teaching while holding other academic and clinical responsibilities.

AB  - PURPOSE: To study the effect of free glasses combined with teacher incentives on in-school glasses wear among Chinese urban migrant children. DESIGN: Cluster-randomized controlled trial. METHODS: Children with visual acuity (VA) <= 6/12 in either eye owing to refractive error in 94 randomly chosen primary schools underwent randomization by school to receive free glasses, education on their use, and a teacher incentive (Intervention), or glasses prescriptions only (Control). Intervention group teachers received a tablet computer if >= 80% of children given glasses wore them during unannounced visits 6 weeks and 6 months (main outcome) after intervention. RESULTS: Among 4376 children, 728 (16.7%, mean age 10.9 years, 51.0% boys) met enrollment criteria and were randomly allocated, 358 (49.2%, 47 schools) to Intervention and 370 (50.8%, 47 schools) to Control. Among these, 693 children (95.2%) completed the study and underwent analysis. Spectacle wear was significantly higher at 6 months among Intervention children (Observed {[}main outcome]: 68.3% vs 23.9%, adjusted odds ratio {[}OR] = 11.5, 95% confidence interval {[}CI] 5.91-22.5, P < .001; Self-reported: 90.6% vs 32.1%, OR = 43.7, 95% CI = 21.7-88.5, P < .001). Other predictors of observed wear at 6 months included baseline spectacle wear (P < .001), uncorrected VA < 6/18 (P = .01), and parental spectacle wear (P = .02). The 6-month observed wear rate was only 41% among similar-aged children provided free glasses in our previous trial without teacher incentives. CONCLUSIONS: Free spectacles and teacher incentives maintain classroom wear in the large majority of children needing glasses over a school year. Low wear among Control children demonstrates the need for interventions. (C) 2015 by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Understanding compassion fatigue is vital to supporting the health and well-being of oncology psychosocial service providers and oncology patients. This study aims to examine when compassion fatigue is experienced and how it is dealt with by medical social workers providing psychosocial care for oncology patients. A purposeful sample of 12 medical social workers was recruited; each participant was working at a hospital and providing psychosocial care for oncology patients in Korea. Through in-depth qualitative interviews, the following themes emerged regarding oncology social workers' experiences with compassion fatigue: (1) when compassion fatigue hits me (when bonding with clients, when facing a client's death, when facing organizational hurdles, when feeling inadequate) and (2) how I deal with compassion fatigue (communicating with others, setting professional boundaries, finding ways to help myself, creating grief rituals, building professional identity). Implications and psychosocial interventions that may help reduce oncology social workers' compassion fatigue are discussed.

AB  - Teaching observation is widely promoted as a mechanism for developing teaching practice in higher education. Specifically, formative peer observation is considered by many to be a powerful tool for providing feedback to individual teachers, disseminating disciplinary good practice and fostering a local evaluative enhancement culture. Despite its widespread use, however, there are still reservations about the extent to which participation in formative teaching observation can contribute to the development of lecturers’ critical reflection and the enhancement of practice. In particular, the capacity of colleagues to evaluate and provide critical feedback that can inform a reflective approach to practice has been questioned. This paper presents a single case study of one lecturer’s experience of participating in a single teaching observation cycle, conducted with an educational expert and disciplinary peers acting as both observer and observee.

AB  - The present study aimed to evaluate the Turkish metaphor studies of the concept ``teacher{''} via a meta-synthesis approach. A total of 11 masters dissertations and 32 research articles which followed a qualitative research methodology or reported qualitative findings on metaphors of the concept ``teacher{''} and published between 2004 and 2016 were included in the meta-synthesis. The following databases were used in the selection of the dissertations and articles; Google Scholar, YOK Academic, YOK National Dissertation Centre, TUBITAK ULAKBIM, EBSCOhost-ERIC, and Web of science. Each study was evaluated based on the following matrix; importance, data collection tools, method (including participants), research design, reliability and validity, data analysis, metaphors and themes, and suggestions. Frequencies, tables and direct quotations from the studies were included in this paper. The results of the theme `importance' revealed that metaphors were considered to be important tools in representing self and professional awareness, educational productivity, professional beliefs, and classroom dynamics, all of which emphasized the worthy of using metaphors. Also, the results of the theme `methods' revealed that while most studies employed phenomenology as a research strategy, few studies utilized such methods as surveys and metaphor/discourse analysis. The results of the theme `data collection tools' showed that most studies employed open-ended questions (i.e. ``A teacher is like. Because.{''} and ``A teacher is similar to. Because.{''}) or interview protocol. Nevertheless, it was also found that a number of studies employed data collection strategies such as composition writing, interviews, and picture drawing. The results of the theme `reliability and validity' illuminated that most studies, in line with the qualitative research paradigm, provided details of their research processes, and mainly used content analysis for data analysis. It was also observed that a number of studies utilized such methods as metaphor analysis. The participants of those studies ranged from students to parents, from prospective teachers and school principals. The themes that emerged in those studies, in spite of the range of participants, did not differ remarkably from each other. Their suggestion included detailed information and implications for implementation, teachers, and future research. Overall, this meta-synthesis metaphor studies showed that most of the Turkish metaphor studies consisted of case studies. In light of the results of this meta-synthesis, how to use metaphors more effectively is discussed.

AB  - To complete this special issue on theoretical bases for antibullying efforts in schools, we focus in this article on the importance of teachers and other educators in the ecology of schools. First, we present evidence that teachers are not perceived to be effective at intervening when bullying occurs. Then, using a social motivational lens, we provide an overview of teachers' role as a socializing agent in the classroom and school with a particular emphasis on their influence on bullying behaviors among students. Then we present two theories, the theory of planned behaviors, and the transactional theory of emotions and coping. We believe these theories highlight the complexity of teacher responses and make the case that teachers need more than knowledge of bullying to be effective in their role. We discuss implications for teacher training and professional development.

AB  - Process evaluation is a component of intervention research that evaluates whether interventions are delivered and received as intended. Here, we describe the process evaluation results for the Trial of Activity for Adolescent Girls (TAAG) intervention. The intervention consisted of four synergistic components designed to provide supportive school-and community-linked environments to prevent the decline in physical activity in adolescent girls. Process evaluation results indicate that the intervention components were delivered from intervention staff to teachers with high fidelity (84-97%) to the protocol and with lower fidelity (range: 18-93%) from teachers to students. Physical activity programs for girls, a unique feature of the TAAG intervention, increased from a mean of 10 programs per school to a mean of 16 and 15 in years 1 and 2, respectively, in intervention schools, with no change in control schools. These findings suggest that a multicomponent school- and community-based physical activity intervention can be delivered with fidelity and result in a middle school environment that supports physical activity for girls.

They learn to assess their students' math and reading skills, their knowledge of social studies and science content and their ability to write. When teachers are faced with a student who is challenged by the subject matter and is struggling, teachers have a variety of assessment methods in their skill set that helps them identify the student's problem and provide instruction to address the problem. Unfortunately, the same is not true when it comes to addressing challenging behavior.

AB  - Working With Families and Community Agencies to Support Students With Special Needs addresses two of the most exciting facets of working with students with disabilities: 'life-stage' issues (early intervention and effective transition) and collaboration (working with families and professionals). Ysseldyke and Algozzine explore the larger context of students' lives outside school, and how life-stage issues and collaboration interact with and influence instruction. Including a pretest, posttest, and key vocabulary terms, this informative resource offers valuable answers to the following questions: (1) What types of transition services exist and when are they necessary? (2) What should educators know about early-childhood intervention? (3) What issues should be considered when working with families? (4) How can schools involve community agencies and businesses? (5) What options are available to students with special needs after high school? (6) What key program elements are critical to a student's success in the classroom and beyond?

AB  - This article describes the use of Teacher Impression Journals during a larger study that examined the efficacy of an intervention program designed to promote kindergarteners' positive attitudes toward peers with disabilities (i.e., the Special Friends program). The journals were designed to gather information about intervention implementation and social validity. Weekly Teacher Impression Journals were collected from 32 teachers over a 6-week period. Each week teachers responded to questions related to the implementation of two interventions: children's behaviors related to the study's primary focus (i.e., acceptance of individuals with disabilities) and comments from key stakeholders (i.e., parents, other school professionals). Teachers' responses were analyzed using content analysis. Results revealed that teachers observed play interactions as evidence of children's acceptance of peers with disabilities. Teachers also reported hearing positive comments from other stakeholders about children's acceptance as well as about the interventions. Suggestions for research and implications for practice are discussed.

AB  - A SCERTS model-based intervention with different durations (5-month vs. 10-month) was provided to 122 children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (age = 53.43 ± 9.05 months) in Hong Kong. Before and after the intervention, the children were assessed with the Chinese Psychoeducational Profile-Third Edition (CPEP-3) and the Developmental Assessment Chart (DAC). Educators and parents expressed their views toward the intervention in focus groups. Results showed that participating children improved significantly in their social communication and emotional behavior after the intervention, as measured by DAC and CPEP-3. Likewise, educators and parents had positive views toward the intervention and noted the children’s improvement. The results suggest that a SCERTS model-based intervention can improve social communication, emotional regulation, and other skills in children with ASD. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study reviewed current issues in preparing qualified teachers for increasing diverse student populations in the U.S. and in other multicultural and multiethnic countries. Based on the framework of community-based and multicultural teacher education, this literature review paper analyzed issues and problems existed in the current curriculum, content, and practicum in traditional teacher education programs in addressing cultural knowledge and competence of preparing pre-service teachers in a multicultural society. Drawing from implications from community-based teacher education, this paper proposed several suggested strategies to reform traditional teacher education programs to meet the needs from multicultural and multiracial student populations and instructional context.

AB  - Although peer assessment is widely implemented in higher education, not all students are highly engaged in it. To enhance student engagement in peer assessment, we designed and developed a web-based tool, autonomy-supportive peer assessment (ASPA), to support students' need for autonomy when they conducted peer assessment. Students' sense of autonomy, and their behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement in peer assessment were examined via interviews and surveys. We also examined students' academic performances, including their improvement from initial to revised essays and the quality of feedback they provided. Survey results indicated that the ASPA group (1) experienced a slightly higher sense of autonomy than the non-ASPA group, and (2) spent much more time on each evaluation criterion than the non-ASPA group. Interviews suggested that both the ASPA and non-ASPA groups were engaged in peer assessment. However, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in behavioral, emotional, cognitive engagement, and academic performances.

AB  - Purpose of this study is to examine trends in preservice teacher education research in Turkey in terms of topic, purpose and method through thematic content analysis and to evaluate the trends in terms of teacher education policies. To this end, 479 articles related to preservice teacher education and published in three rooted journals since 1970 were examined. According to the results, nine themes were extracted and the most widely studied topics were identified as: subject and pedagogical knowledge and attitudes of teacher candidates, evaluation of teacher education program or its components, effects of instructional methods/approaches, information and communication technologies in teacher education and teacher education institutions. Quantitative paradigm is still dominant but an increase in qualitative and mixed studies has been observed since 2000. In terms of policies, problems expressed in the studies prior to 1997 were the issues leading to the 1997 restructuring reform. From this point of view, it can be inferred that these studies might have fed the 1997 reform. On the other hand, after 1997, the studies examined the results and effects of the 1997 restructuring and the 2006 revision reforms; for this reason, it is implied that the policies might have given direction to the studies conducted in this period of time.

AB  - This paper examines the prevalence of common educational and behavioural problems among secondary school students in Hong Kong and the effectiveness of common intervention strategies for dealing with them. Approximately 3000 students, 2300 parents and 600 teachers were sampled to complete a specifically-designed questionnaire. The results showed that all three parties acknowledged that student lack of motivation and problems with curriculum were the most serious educational problems and that making noise/disturbance in class was the most serious behavioural problem in schools. They also agreed that establishing a fair discipline system and asking non-motivated students to transfer to vocational schools were effective solutions for dealing with student destructive behaviours. Students' perspectives overlapped much with those of their parents, hut seldom with those of their teachers. Creation of greater and more flexible vocational and remedial classes is recommended and more communication between teachers, students and parents is needed.

AB  - This present study imparts a literature review focusing on Augmented Reality (AR) in the field of education. The writers reviewed the published manuscripts by centering on types of manuscripts, research designs, types of participants, and the promising roles of AR in educational setting. A total number of 18 articles were thoroughly analyzed. The results showed a diverse type of manuscripts published in the journal databases including research articles, reviews, technical notes, features, and news. Types of research designs also varied such as Research and Development, Experimental, Content Analysis, Exploratory, Action Research, Descriptive Study, Survey, Mixed Method, and Design-Based Research. Types of participants embraced a diverse range of participants including university students, primary students, secondary students, teachers, and children with special needs. The most prominent role of AR was that it improved students' knowledge and understanding of the materials. Current gaps in AR-related studies in educational setting are recognized, and several recommendations for conducting upcoming studies are proposed.

AB  - On September 6, 2017, Hurricane Irma, a Category 5 storm packing winds of 185 miles per hour skirted the northern coast of Puerto Rico, leaving 1 million residents without electrical power. Schools were closed for 5 days, but a major calamity was narrowly avoided. Overall, residents were grateful for their good fortune, but the same could not be said for the islands of Antigua and Barbuda, where the storm destroyed 90% of the buildings and left 50% of the population homeless. Two weeks later, hurricane Maria ravaged Puerto Rico with wind gusts of 150 miles per hour and widespread flooding. Maria was the strongest hurricane to strike the island in 80 years. One hundred percent of the island was without electricity; water from the ocean and swollen rivers inundated many communities; many roads were impassible due to downed trees; and a number of bridges were washed away, preventing access to residents who desperately needed basic supplies required for survival. Five days after Maria slammed Puerto Rico, author Frank J. Zenere, school psychologist and chair of the crisis management program in the Miami-Dade County Public Schools, and an Emeritus of the National Emergency Assistance Team was contacted by a clinical psychologist he met 2 months earlier at a training. The psychologist worked closely with a mental health professional on the island, who serves as an advisor to the Secretary of Education of Puerto Rico. This connection led to a conference call to discuss their concerns, identify needs and available resources, and plan for the reopening of schools. Near the end of an hour-long dialogue, Zenere volunteered to go to the island to provide further consultation, assist in providing technical assistance, conduct training for school mental health professionals, and offer recommendations for preparing to meet the short and long-term needs of students, their families, teachers, and support staff. Zenere writes that he believes following a natural disaster, immediate attention should be focused upon meeting the needs of the population including food, water, and shelter. After that the next important step in the recovery process is the reopening of schools. This article details Zenere's journey through the seven days he was there as he helped set the foundation for recovery efforts following this devastating natural disaster. He shares his thoughts on recovery assistance based on his experiences with numerous other natural disasters around the globe.

AB  - Research in the field of animal-assisted therapy has shown that therapy dogs have a positive social-emotional impact on individuals in hospitals, nursing homes, and counseling. Recently, the literature has suggested that therapy dogs can yield positive psychological, social, and academic outcomes in schools, although this research is quite limited. The intent of this study was to examine perceptions on the effectiveness of therapy dogs in schools for promoting students’ psychological well-being, and an overall positive school climate. Preliminary evidence shows faculty and students from four rural school districts across Western New York indicated support for this emerging and viable school intervention. This qualitative and quantitative insight can help guide future research.

AB  - Children in foster care represent one of the most vulnerable, academically at risk populations in the United States. Aside from lower standardized achievement test scores, higher grade retention numbers, and a greater dropout rate than non-foster youth, between 30% to 50% of children in foster care are placed in special education programs, generally related to either a learning disability or an emotional disturbance. This study investigated the effectiveness on school performance of an education liaison from the school system who worked with social workers to resolve educational barriers to learning and achieving. Advocacy by the education liaison led to positive results in terms of school performance of foster youth. Recommendations are made for better addressing the educational needs of children in foster care.

AB  - Variations in the dosage of social interventions and the effects of dosage on program outcomes remain understudied. This study examines the dosage effects of the Chicago School Readiness Project, a randomized, multifaceted classroom-based intervention conducted in Head Start settings. Using a principal score matching method to address the issue of selection bias, the study finds that high-dosage levels of teacher training and mental health consultant class visits have larger effects on children's school readiness than the effects estimated through intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses. Low-dosage levels of treatment are found to have effects that are smaller than those estimated in ITT analyses or to have no statistically significant program effects. Moreover, individual mental health consultation services provided to high-risk children are found to have statistically significant effects on their school readiness.

AB  - Preschool teachers' job stressors have received increasing attention but have been understudied in the literature. We investigated the impacts of a classroom-based intervention, the Chicago School Readiness Project (CSRP), on teachers' perceived job stressors and confidence, as indexed by their perceptions of job control, job resources, job demands, and confidence in behavior management. Using a clustered randomized controlled trial (RCF) design, the CSRP provided multifaceted services to the treatment group, including teacher training and mental health consultation, which were accompanied by stress-reduction services and workshops. Overall, 90 teachers in 35 classrooms at 18 Head Start sites participated in the study. After adjusting for teacher and classroom factors and site fixed effects, we found that the CSRP had significant effects on the improvement of teachers' perceived job control and work-related resources. We also found that the CSRP decreased teachers' confidence in behavior management and had no statistically significant effects on job demands. Overall, we did not find significant moderation effects of teacher race/ethnicity, education, teaching experience, or teacher type. The implications for research and policy are discussed.

AB  - The present study aims to compare Teachers’ Professional Development (TPD) between Mainland China and Hong Kong, by addressing the following questions: how do different social-cultural and historical contexts impact policy making of TPD in two regions; what similarities and differences referring to policies on TPD have been made in Mainland China and Hong Kong; how do the two regions implement TPD individually in terms of models/approaches, including categories, bases/partnerships, responsibility system, financial resources, training content, length of time, technological support; and what experiences of TPD do teachers both from Mainland China and Hong Kong have in practice; what do they think of the experiences; from their perspective, what are the limitations or problems of current practices? A qualitative research strategy, based on principles of comparative design and multiple-case study, was utilized for the study. And data were collected from document analysis and interviews. Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted among 16 teachers totally both in Mainland China and Hong Kong. The collected data were analyzed under focus questions and themes identified in the reviewed literature. The fingdings show that social, economical, political and cultural factors have contributed to shaping the features of TPD in the two regions and have accounted for the similarities and differences identified in the study, in terms of policy making, implementations of TPD, and teachers’ experiences as well as problems of TPD. Moreover, the study found that although each region had its strengths in TPD, it also had its weaknesses and aspects that need improvement. Hence, what we shoud do in one region is not to indiscriminately copy the other’s successful practices but to learn lessons from the other and find out effective ways that suit own circumstances.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to review identified key features of teacher support and its influence on students' career decision making and development. It also examines the types of research approaches to data collection and analysis in order to provide a more in-depth evaluation of this field of study. Design/methodology/approach The review examined 18 studies, the majority being quantitative in design. Cross-sectional and longitudinal effects of teacher support were investigated, and differences in teacher support relative to grade level and gender were considered. Findings Results indicated that since 2000, there has been an increase in the number of empirical studies of teacher support in the career development field, the majority involving middle and high school students. The most commonly cited frameworks that underpin the studies are the social cognitive career theory, the career construction theory and Super's career development theory. The most frequently used instrument for data collection was the teacher support scale (Metheny et al., 2008). Originality/value The review will be beneficial to researchers, teachers and policy makers seeking to optimize support systems for students' career development. The findings contribute to further theory development and have practical implications for the career guidance field. Recommendations for future research and practice are suggested.

Nonetheless, technology and its tools can also extend and enhance family-teacher relationships and partnerships. This paper reviews definitions for online teacher and family community in early childhood programs and closely examines the literature associated with several key elements that comprise the community as recognized by the authors. Key elements that emerged were common or shared goals, interactivity, collaboration, trusting relationships, and sense of belonging or connectedness for a working online community, especially among teachers working with families of children with disabilities. Additionally, practical suggestions for teachers and family members are provided for developing and collaborating on an online community.

AB  - Biodiversity conservation is a required co-benefit of REDD+. Biodiversity monitoring is therefore needed, yet in most areas it will be constrained by limitations in the available human professional and financial resources. REDD+ programs that use forest plots for biomass monitoring may be able to take advantage of the same data for detecting changes in the tree diversity, using the richness and abundance of canopy trees as a proxy for biodiversity. If local community members are already assessing the above-ground biomass in a representative network of forest vegetation plots, it may require minimal further effort to collect data on the diversity of trees. We compare community members and trained scientists' data on tree diversity in permanent vegetation plots in montane forest in Yunnan, China. We show that local community members here can collect tree diversity data of comparable quality to trained botanists, at one third the cost. Without access to herbaria, identification guides or the Internet, community members could provide the ethno-taxonomical names for 95% of 1071 trees in 60 vegetation plots. Moreover, we show that the community-led survey spent 89% of the expenses at village level as opposed to 23% of funds in the monitoring by botanists. In participatory REDD+ programs in areas where community members demonstrate great knowledge of forest trees, community-based collection of tree diversity data can be a cost-effective approach for obtaining tree diversity information.

AB  - In many countries, large numbers of left-behind children (LBC) grow up experiencing prolonged separation from their migrant worker parents. These children are known to be vulnerable to psychological and developmental problems. Drawing on qualitative interview data as well as ethnographic observations, a realist approach was applied in this study to evaluate the feasibility, acceptance, preliminary outcomes and potential sustainability of a community-based intervention to provide care and support to LBC, in a migrant-sending area of rural China. The intervention program comprised “Children's Clubs” in local communities, in which LBC participate in play and educational activities under the care and supervision of local volunteers. Twelve Clubs in 12 different villages were evaluated for the study. In each village, semi-structured interviews were conducted with three community stakeholders, and children and primary caregivers from two families, to examine their perceptions and experiences with regard to the intervention. Our findings indicated that most Clubs adapted the initial program theory and implementation plan to specific community contexts, particularly the socio-economic situation and the support from village leadership and other community members. Program implementation mechanisms consisted of integrating available resources, engaging local volunteers, and delivering various Club activities. Preliminary outcomes indicated the success in establishing a community care platform to benefit the emotional and behavioral wellbeing of LBC, and to enhance the community support networks. To ensure program sustainability, the Children's Clubs should explore new funding schemes, expand the pool of qualified volunteers, and improve the curricular and activities at the Clubs.

AB  - With the aim of supporting the development of comprehensive policies for revitalizing bicycle transport in Beijing, this thesis has applied the socio-ecological model to guide the inquiry into the domains: individual, social environment, physical environment and policy. These four domains were embedded in the analyses of correlates of current cycling mode share and attitude towards future cycling among Beijing residents, as well as an in-depth analysis of bicycle infrastructure planning and planning cultures in Beijing and Copenhagen. The study contributes to the state-of-the-art in the fields of transport and planning research by strengthening the knowledge base on the conditions that affect the use of bicycles in the megacities of developing world as well as by exploring the factors governing the populations’ attitudes towards their future mobility. Furthermore, the study contributes to the knowledge base of planning research by comparatively analyzing the states of bicycle infrastructure planning in Beijing and Copenhagen. It highlights the differences of supportiveness in planning cultures between the two cities, in order to enable the transference of knowledge and experiences for accelerating the identification of effective solutions in specific cities and in specific planning cultures. For Beijing residents, the bicycle is currently a mode of transport for those with limited education and limited financial resources. The young Beijingers are least likely to cycle. This age difference is likely to be partly due to a cohort difference and, thus, indicates a growing problem for cycling in Beijing. On the other hand, clear associations with density and other urban form variables indicate that the proximity environment and urban development policies can also affect cycling. The effect of residents’ hukou status indicates how country-specific conditions can influence findings related to both current and future travel behavior. However, even though Beijing is a highly dense city in the developing world, conclusions with respect to urban form and cycling are, for the large part, the same as for many developed world cities. Focusing on the Beijing residents’ attitudes towards their future travel modes provides a new perspective on probable drivers of ongoing change in mobility. The current socio-economic profile of the respondents was found to be weakly linked with attitudes towards future cycling, but was important for their inclination to drive a car in the future. The objectively measured urban environment was found to be not related to attitudes towards future cycling and car driving. Pro-cycling attitudes as well as the perceived quality of the cycling environment were found to be significantly associated with current cyclists’ inclination to continue to cycle, non-cyclists’ intentions towards taking up cycling as well as non-car owners’ intentions to drive a car. Additionally, short (<2km) everyday travel distances were linked to certainty in terms of continuing cycling or cycling more in the future, whereas long everyday travel distances (>10km) were linked to uncertainty regarding future cycling. The combination of a link between car aspirations and perceived environment for cycling, as well as the unclear socio-economic profile of attitudes towards future cycling may be seen as a ‘window of opportunity’ for Beijing’s cycling promotion. Bicycle infrastructure planning plays an important role in creating a supportive cycling environment. The study found that bicycle infrastructure planning is far more than a technical task. The planning culture, reflected by the values, perceptions and cognitive frames shared in the public domain, is found to be closely connected with the bicycle infrastructure planning outcomes. Assumptions and espoused beliefs shared in the planning environments impact how generic planning principles for bicycle-friendly infrastructure are considered in the planning process, consequently, resulting in differentiated local planning practices. Cohesion and safety are considered the most important principles in both cities, while directness, attractiveness, and comfort are considered secondary in Beijing, but are well developed and considered important in Copenhagen. The values and beliefs of the planners that are embedded not only in a planning environment, but are also rooted in the wider societal environment, contribute to shaping the status and the role of bicycle transport in the specific urban context of two cities. Beijing planners’ viewpoints indicate uncertainty with respect to the feasibility and suitability of bicycles as a travel mode in the city and for themselves. This is in contrast to the Copenhagen planners, who consider bicycles as a key element of future mobility, and tend to have strong professional identities connected to bicycle planning, which are also linked to personal travel priorities. Comparative studies are found efficient for enabling knowledge exchange, which can stimulate cities with little bicycle infrastructure planning experience to learn from cities with long traditions of building bicycle infrastructures. By sharing experience on how to cope with challenges for bicycle infrastructure planning, the identification of effective solutions in specific cities and in specific planning cultures could be accelerated. According to the findings from the papers, the study suggests four policy perspectives to achieve comprehensive policy to revitalize bicycle transport in Beijing. Those policy perspectives include targeting specific socio-demographic groups, increasing public awareness of the benefits of cycling, enhancing the bicycle-friendliness of infrastructure planning and design and prioritizing bicycle transport through comprehensive policies.

AB  - Despite the increasing volume of research in peer assessment for writing, few studies have been conducted to explore teachers' perceptions of its appropriateness for writing instruction. It is essential to understand teachers' perceptions of peer assessment as teachers play an important role in whether and how peer assessment is implemented in their instruction. The current study investigated tertiary English writing tutors' perceptions of the appropriateness of peer assessment for English as a Foreign Language writing in China, where peer assessment has been increasingly discussed and researched but only occasionally used in teaching. The current study scrutinised the reasons behind its limited use via in-depth exploratory interviews with 25 writing tutors with different teaching backgrounds. The interview data showed tutors' limited knowledge of peer assessment and unanimous hesitation in using it. The former was explained by insufficient instruction and training in peer assessment. The latter relates to the incompatibility of peer assessment with the examinations-oriented education system, learners' low English language proficiency and learning motivation, and the conflict of peer assessment with the entrenched teacher-driven learning culture. Suggestions are made about training and engaging teachers to effectively use peer assessment in instruction. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Background One component of the 2009 Chinese health care reform plan is to train general practitioners to improve the delivery of primary care services. This continuing professional development is expected to further improve the physicians' competencies to be general practitioners in primary care. Augmented reality +/- a combination of virtual information and the real environment +/- may enhance general practitioners' continuing professional development by allowing their learning experiences to overlap with their workplace practice. Objective To explore the needs, opportunities, and challenges involved in continuing professional development for Chinese physicians becoming competent general practitioners within primary care, with a special focus on the possibilities of applying augmented reality. Methods This study used a qualitative approach with semi-structured face-to-face interviews. Two managers and thirteen physicians (from four community health centers and stations) participated. The data were analyzed using a thematic inductive analysis approach. Results Based on our interviews, most of the physicians were not fully trained as general practitioners but still assumed the duties of that position; they were supposed to eventually become fully trained in line with the reforms of the Chinese primary care system. However, they reported a lack of in-service training opportunities to fulfill this goal. Even those who said that they had such opportunities perceived the efficacy of that training as being poor. The managers and most of the physicians reacted positively to the idea of using augmented reality in continuing professional development, and they suggested antibiotics treatment, surgery, and emergency care as learning areas in which augmented reality could be applied. Conclusions Due to the Chinese reforms of the primary care system, both managers and the physicians themselves expect general practitioners to become qualified by engaging in continuing professional development. Both groups also regarded augmented reality as a potentially useful tool.

AB  - Background: General practitioners (GPs) are the gatekeepers of health care in most societies, serving as patients’ first point of contact. Continuing professional development (CPD) is needed for GPs to improve their competence and provide successful patient care. Information communication technologies (ICTs) are expected to be used to support effective CPD. Augmented reality (AR), as a new ICT, might have a potential as a learning tool for CPD, but it has not been explored in primary care for GPs’ CPD. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine how to design AR-based CPD to fit the learning needs of primary care physicians in their clinical practice. Methods: Multiple methods used in design-based research (DBR) were applied in this study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to understand physicians’ CPD needs and attitudes toward AR (Study I). An integrative review was conducted to understand AR in health care education (Study II). A conceptual framework analysis method (CFAM) was used to construct the AR design framework (Study III). Based on the framework, semi-structured interviews were used to identify AR design needs with the physicians in the chosen setting (Study IV). Results: Most primary care providers accepted the idea of AR-based CPD, but their current CPD model did not help them become qualified GPs. Although the learning needs varied between physicians, they shared a need for integrated clinical competence. Our integrative review showed that AR has been investigated for various research purposes and for all levels of health professionals; however, except for a few reports supported by situation learning theory, 80 percent of the published papers lacked support from learning theories. Driven by situated, experiential, and transformative learning theories, the Mobile AR Education (MARE) framework was proposed, which included identifying learners’ personal paradigms, clarifying learning objectives (LOs), and designing AR learning environments and learning activities to develop learners’ personal paradigms with respect to domain expectations. The application of MARE has demonstrated physicians’ perspectives of AR design needs with the example of rationally using antibiotics. The guidelines, local antibiotics resistance pattern, and physicians’ personal paradigms related to diagnosis, treatment, and prescription, including the choice of drug, were the context for the design needs. Conclusions: To my knowledge, this is the first exploration of learning design for AR-based CPD through practice and theory. The main contribution of this thesis is the design of the MARE framework due to a lack of learning theories supporting the use of AR in medical education. The MARE framework as applied to the Chinese primary care setting shows the usefulness of identifying physicians’ personal paradigms in their decision-making process and their expectations for AR-based CPD to improve their personal paradigms. As a future step, AR prototypes and applications might be designed to meet these expectations.

AB  - The benefits of providing early intervention services (including multidisciplinary therapy and family support) for children with physical disabilities and their families are widely acknowledged. Evidence, however, of their efficacy is not well documented. Furthermore, many studies fail to adequately describe the programs being evaluated and how these programs have been implemented by service provider organisations. From a policy perspective, evaluators need to be mindful of contextual variations in program implementation when examining initiatives and determining their efficacy. In this paper we discuss how implementation of a cross-organisational early intervention initiative policy for children with physical disabilities was enacted by three different service providers. In the present study, program logic was employed to identify and explore these variations in implementation. While each individual agency provided services and identified outcomes that were consistent with policy objectives, program delivery varied considerably across service providers.

AB  - The conceptions of what constitutes nursing competence and how such competence is taught and learned are changing, due to rapid changes in in the health sector. Nurse teachers' competencies for providing high-quality, up-to-date nursing education, are developing accordingly. This paper reviews the existing research on nurse teachers' competencies and addresses how this research identifies, describes, and conceptualizes these competencies. A rigorous search, retrieval and appraisal process identified 25 relevant studies for inclusion in the review. A thematic synthesis was applied to the findings of the studies and subsequent themes were synthesized. The thematic synthesis of the empirical evidence resulted in the five broad themes: academic, nursing, and pedagogical competencies; attitudes; management and digital technology. However, these separate elements appeared to be highly integrated. Hence, this paper indicates that nurse teachers' competencies may be assessed using a holistic approach, which could bring together the disparate attributes required for successful professional performance in specific situations.

AB  - This paper examines the associations between the cultural identity of Arab social workers in Israel and their intervention preferences. The Arab cultural identity was assessed by means of four scales measuring attributes that are central to Arab culture: religiosity, collectivism, belief in gender hierarchy and attitudes towards sexual behaviour. The choice of intervention strategies was ascertained using hypothetical vignettes of cases that social workers might encounter. The findings are based on the responses of 491 Arab social workers employed in the municipal social services of the Arab communities who completeda self-administered questionnaire. The findings point both to the predominance of the professional strategies the Arab social workers learned in their social work training and, at the same time, indicate the social workers' readiness to avail themselves of strategies anchored in their own culture and society, whether separately or in combination with professional ones. The findings suggest that Arab social workers in Israel adopt cultural strategies that are appropriate to the circumstances in which they live and in situations in which Western interventions would have been insufficient, irrelevant or harmful.

AB  - Objective To report 1-year results of newly developed method, guided self-determination (GSD), applied in group training (GSD-GT) for Type 1 diabetes patients with persistent poor glycaemic control. Methods GSD was designed on the basis of qualitative research to help patients develop life skills with diabetes using worksheets filled in at home and coached by nurses in mutual reflection. We randomized 18�49-year-old adults at a Danish university hospital to either 16 h GSD-GT in 2001 or to similar training 1 year later. Inclusion criteria: mean A1C = 8.0% for at least 2 years, disease onset =40 years and insulin treatment from onset. Results Thirty GSD-GT patients and 20 controls completed the study. GSD-GT patients did better than control patients in terms of (a) increased autonomy support perceived from health professionals (p < 0.01); (b) higher frequency of self-monitored blood glucoses (p < 0.001); (c) increased perceived competence in managing diabetes (p < 0.01); (d) fewer diabetes-related problems (p < 0.05); and (e) improved glycaemic control (p < 0.01). Conclusion GSD was effective in improving life skills with diabetes, including A1C, over a period of 1 year. Practice implications GSD is a worthy candidate for further research. We consider it adjustable to people with type 2 diabetes and other chronic conditions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Person-centred care [PCC] can engage people in living well with a chronic condition. However, translating PCC into practice is challenging. We aimed to compare the translational potentials of three approaches: motivational interviewing [MI], illness integration support [IIS] and guided self-determination [GSD]. METHODS: Comparative analysis included eight components: (1) philosophical origin; (2) development in original clinical setting; (3) theoretical underpinnings; (4) overarching goal and supportive processes; (5) general principles, strategies or tools for engaging peoples; (6) health care professionals' background and training; (7) fidelity assessment; (8) reported effects. RESULTS: Although all approaches promoted autonomous motivation, they differed in other ways. Their original settings explain why IIS and GSD strive for life-illness integration, whereas MI focuses on managing ambivalence. IIS and GSD were based on grounded theories, and MI was intuitively developed. All apply processes and strategies to advance professionals' communication skills and engagement; GSD includes context-specific reflection sheets. All offer training programs; MI and GSD include fidelity tools. CONCLUSION: Each approach has a primary application: MI, when ambivalence threatens positive change; IIS, when integrating newly diagnosed chronic conditions; and GSD, when problem solving is difficult, or deadlocked. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Professionals must critically consider the context in their choice of approach.

AB  - Home visitation programs to prevent child maltreatment are offered in many communities. Agencies in these communities want to help families in need while under increased pressure to provide effective services. Funding is limited and competitive; some agencies might choose to limit funds spent on supervision, training, and evaluation as a way to provide more direct service. In this article, we use an implementation science framework and the results of an evaluation of a small home visitation program to underscore the importance of ongoing training and supervision, attention to fidelity, and program evaluation. The evaluation included 17 families entering the program during 21 months. Evaluators visited families in their homes at the beginning of the program and again 10 months later. Like many other well-intended, small-scale programs, this one “borrowed” from evidence-based models and expanded enrollment criteria in an attempt to better serve families.

AB  - Teachers' efficacy beliefs exert a significant influence on their practice and their students' learning. This study investigates the contribution of two six-month Professional Learning Community (PLC) interventions to 10 English as a Foreign Language (EFL) novice and experienced teachers' self-efficacy. The data were collected through pre and post-interviews with the participants, their reflective journals, and recordings of the PLC meetings. The findings suggest that the experienced teachers' self-efficacy improved in terms of employing innovative instructional strategies and language proficiency. An increase was also observed in the novice teachers' self-efficacy for classroom management, their autonomy, and their perceived language proficiency. Finally, the participants in both groups developed a stronger sense of professional community membership as reflected in their focus on their collective efficacy toward the end of the PLCs.

AB  - Research findings indicate that children who witness violence, particularly in the family, are adversely affected and become silent and hidden victims. To aid in this problem, teachers must become more aware of identifying warning signs, appropriate interventions, and available resources. This study focused on determining what knowledge teachers have relative to the impact of domestic violence on children, the resources available for appropriate intervention, and more importantly, knowledge of prevention strategies. Results indicated that teachers do agree that students are negatively impacted by family violence, that the majority of teachers have no formal training in this area, and some schools have support teams in place to assist children who suffer from family violence. Implications of the study support the need to train teachers how to identify children experiencing family violence, the need for school social work services, and the need for increased awareness so that school personnel can better meet the needs of individual children, leaving no child behind.

AB  - Introduction: Engaging health professionals in the processes of first building and then participating in simulations has not yet been explored. This qualitative study explored the experience of building and participating in a simulation as an educational intervention with experienced clinicians. Methods: Pediatric rehabilitation clinicians, along with a patient facilitator and standardized patients, created simulations and subsequently participated in a live simulation. The educational content of the simulation was culturally sensitive communication. We collected participants' perspectives about the process from individual journal entries and focus groups. A thematic analysis of these data sources was conducted. Results: Participants described a process of building and participating in a simulation that provided: 1) a unique opportunity for clinicians to reflect on their current practice; 2) a venue to identify different perspectives through discussion and action in a group; and 3) a safe environment for learning. Discussion: The combined process of building and participating in a simulation stimulated reflection about the clinicians' own abilities in culturally sensitive communication through discussion, practice, and feedback. It provided a safe environment for participants to share their multiple perspectives and to develop new ways of communicating. This type of educational intervention may contribute to the continuing education of experienced clinicians in both academic and community settings. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Despite increased access to antiretrovirals, HIV/AIDS continues to impact millions across sub-Saharan Africa. In Uganda, stigmatization compounds the challenges of poverty and poor government service provision, often limiting children's school participation. Holistic family support interventions are a promising strategy to ensure that children enroll in and attend school. This article reports on the Western Uganda Bantwana Program, which worked with more than 1,000 HIV/AIDS-affected families with the goals of improving socioeconomic status, psychosocial functioning, and educational participation. Bantwana provided training and materials for families to improve agricultural practices and marketing of their products, offered home visits for psychosocial support, and connected vulnerable families to social services as needed. Using Bantwana's child profiling data tracking 75 youth across 3 waves of data collection from 2009 to 2012 and 138 additional youth across 2 waves of data collection, this analysis revealed positive trends over time in economic wellbeing and psychosocial functioning, as well as possible impacts on school participation. These findings suggest that multifaceted, family-focused programs may be part of the solution to ensuring lasting educational access for vulnerable youth in Uganda. Given this encouraging preliminary evidence, further research using rigorous evaluation methods is recommended.

AB  - This chapter is concerned with training teachers working in difficult educational situations in Southern Italy. It describes a number of psychoanalytically informed interventions to help teachers, and reflections on those experiences. Generally speaking, it is always difficult to promote interventions in very structured organisations; in such contexts, it is important to keep in mind that even when an intervention is directly requested, various forms of resistance to any potential change are evident. Following from this general point, I believe that any intervention should be respectful of the particular characteristics of each organisation, of its history, and of relationships between individuals. It is worth highlighting the view that any successful training process requires willingness to learn and change. However, such motivation cannot be taken for granted, and needs to be developed as part of the training process itself, including among those working in education. Furthermore, the training process can be viewed as a constant work in progress, rather than leading to a position of mastery. The teaching of knowledge and skills are two aspects of the training, but it is contended that the training is a relational process which challenges trainees and trainers to encounter deeper and more personal feelings. Therefore, the term formative relationship (Blandino & Granieri, 1995) is used to describe interactions between two or more people to recognise the part played by individuals' inner worlds and particular emotional experiences. This chapter explores this approach, illustrating a psychological intervention located within the frame of what are termed Operative National Programmes (PON).

AB  - This descriptive statistical dissertation was designed to evaluate the efficacy of interventions available in a high school district on academic achievement. The district had a variety of academic and behavioral interventions available. Several types of norm-referenced assessment data were administered to students. While the entire student body was monitored for potential identification for interventions, not all interventions were made available to all students. Some were provided on a referral-only basis and others were self-selective, at the choice of individual students. The researcher developed a database to run descriptive statistical analyses to determine which interventions had the best outcome results on assessments. District assessment data includes NWEA MAP, ACT, PLAN, and Scholastic Reading Inventory. Data on all students was included in the database and the following interventions were tracked: literacy support, supplemental guidance counseling, night school, after-school tutoring, and unit recovery. Growth was measured in both math and reading. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

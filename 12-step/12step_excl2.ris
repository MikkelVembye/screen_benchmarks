AB  - Background Acute ureteric colic is commonly associated with severe and debilitating pain. Theoretically, increasing fluid flow through the affected kidney might expedite stone passage, thereby improving symptoms more quickly. The efficacy and safety of interventions such as high volume intravenous (IV) or oral fluids and diuretics aimed at expediting ureteric stone passage is, however, uncertain. Objectives To look at the benefits and harms of diuretics and high volume (above maintenance) IV or oral fluid therapy for treating adult patients presenting with uncomplicated acute ureteric colic. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's specialised register (3 January 2012). Previously we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL T h e Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (from 1966), EMBASE (from 1980) and handsearched reference lists of nephrology and urology textbooks, review articles, relevant studies, and abstracts from nephrology scientific meetings. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs (including the first period of randomised cross-over studies) looking at diuretics or high volume IV or oral fluids for treating uncomplicated acute ureteric colic in adult patients presenting to the emergency department for the first time during that episode were included. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random-effects model for multiple studies of the same outcomes, otherwise the fixed-effect model was used. Results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or as mean differences (MD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main results Two studies (enrolling 118 participants) examined the association between intense hydration and ureteric colic outcomes. There was no significant difference in pain at six hours (1 study, 60 participants: RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.57), surgical stone removal (1 study, 60 participants: RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.41 to 3.51) or manipulation by cystoscopy (1 study, 60 participants: RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.21 to 2.13) when no fluids over six hours was compared to three litres IV fluids administered over a six hour period. There was no difference in stone clearance (1 study 43 participants: RR 1.38, 95% CI 0.50 to 3.84), hourly pain score or patients' narcotic requirements (P > 0.05 for all comparisons) when forced IV hydration of two litres over four hours was compared with minimal IV hydration at 20 mL/hour. One study did not provide any details which would have allowed us to assess any of the risk of bias items (selection, detection, performance, attrition or reporting bias). The second study did not report the method of randomisation or allocation (selection bias - unclear), they reported that the patients were blinded to therapy (low risk of bias), analgesics were administered according to predetermined pain score criteria (low risk), and assessment of stone passage was unlikely to have been biased by knowledge of group assignment (low risk). However the second study also reported a high percentage of participants excluded post randomisation (26%; high risk of bias). We were unable to assess or ascertain any of the other risk of bias items. Authors' conclusions We found no reliable evidence in the literature to support the use of diuretics and high volume fluid therapy for people with acute ureteric colic. However, given the potential positive therapeutic impact of fluids and diuretics to facilitate stone passage, the capacity of these interventions warrants further investigation to determine safety and efficacy profiles

AB  - Background: Many computerized provider order entry (CPOE) systems include the ability to create electronic order sets: collections of clinically related orders grouped by purpose. Order sets promise to make CPOE systems more efficient, improve care quality and increase adherence to evidence-based guidelines. However, the development and implementation of order sets can be expensive and time-consuming and limited literature exists about their utilization. Methods: Based on analysis of order set usage logs from a diverse purposive sample of seven sites with commercially and internally developed inpatient CPOE systems, we developed an original order set classification system. Order sets were categorized across seven non-mutually exclusive axes: admission/discharge/transfer (ADT), perioperative, condition-specific, task-specific, service-specific, convenience, and personal. In addition, 731 unique subtypes were identified within five axes: four in ADT (S = 4), three in perioperative, 144 in condition-specific, 513 in task-specific, and 67 in service-specific. Results: Order sets (n = 1914) were used a total of 676,142 times at the participating sites during a one-year period. ADT and perioperative order sets accounted for 27.6% and 24.2% of usage respectively. Peripartum/labor, chest pain/acute coronary syndrome/myocardial infarction and diabetes order sets accounted for 51.6% of condition-specific usage. Insulin, angiography/angioplasty and arthroplasty order sets accounted for 19.4% of task-specific usage. Emergency/trauma, obstetrics/gynecology/labor delivery and anesthesia accounted for 32.4% of service-specific usage. Overall, the top 20% of order sets accounted for 90.1% of all usage. Additional salient patterns are identified and described. Conclusion: We observed recurrent patterns in order set usage across multiple sites as well as meaningful variations between sites. Vendors and institutional developers should identify high-value order set types through concrete data analysis in order to optimize the resources devoted to development and implementation.

AB  - To support the rationale behind the development of the huperzine A patches and its pharmacological effects in clinical therapy, an LC-MS-MS method was developed and validated for determination of huperzine A in human plasma and then applied to the clinic pharmacokinetics study on transdermal patches of huperzine A. After a simple liquid-liquid extraction with ethyl acetate, analytes were separated on a C18 column with isocratic elution. The detection of analytes was performed on a tandem mass system equipped with an electrospray ionization source in positive mode using multiple-reaction monitoring. The MS-MS ion transitions monitored were m/z 243.2 -> 210.1 for huperzine A and m/z 248.1 -> 128.0 for tinidazole (internal standard). Method validation and sample analysis were performed according to FDA guidelines and the results met the acceptance criteria. The pharmacokinetic profiles of huperzine A following single transdermal administration of 8, 10 and 12 mg huperzine A to healthy human volunteers were depicted using the established method. The results showed that the pharmacokinetic behavior of huperzine A in vivo was present as linear dynamic characteristics with much longer T (max), lower C (max), and relatively constant plasma concentration. No gender difference and obvious adverse effects were observed from all three groups in our study. Our study indicated that the huperzine A transdermal patches could provide continuous drug delivery over 120 h with favorable tolerability. This may allow patients to obtain optimal plasma concentrations of drugs and to benefit from a longer duration of treatment

AB  - Introduction: Some studies have shown that the defibrillation threshold (DFT) differs between short-duration ventricular fibrillation (SDVF, < 1 minute) and long-duration ventricular fibrillation (LDVF > 1 minute). The goal of this study is to evaluate the effects of acute intravenous amiodarone on SDVF-DFT and LDVF-DFT and its possible mechanism as well. Methods: Twelve open-chest dogs were randomly divided into 2 groups (control group, normal saline, 10 mL.kg(-1).h(-1) maintenance, n = 6; amiodarone group, loading dose 10 mg/kg over 10 minutes, maintenance dose 5 mg.kg(-1).h(-1), n = 6). VF was electrically induced and recorded with a 12 x 12 unipolar electrode plaque (2-mm spacing) sutured on the left ventricular epicardium and a plunge needle (6 unipolar electrode) inserted in the left ventricular apex. The DFTs of SDVFand LDVF were determined 20 seconds and 3 minutes after VF induction, respectively. Restitution was estimated from activation recovery intervals during pacing from the plaque and plunge needle electrodes. The activation rate was estimated by Fast Fourier Transform analysis of VF at same electrodes. The VF cycle length was defined as the reciprocal of the activation rate. The epicardial and transmural dispersion of the maximal slope of the restitution curve and VF cycle length of SDVF and LDVF were calculated, respectively. Results: In controls, LDVF-DFT was higher than SDVF-DFT (645 +/- 61 vs. 520 +/- 63 V, P < 0.01). Amiodarone did not significantly alter SDVF-DFTs (496 +/- 49 vs. 552 +/- 69 V, P > 0.05) but decreased LDVF-DFT by 31% (P < 0.01). Compared with control, amiodarone significantly reduced the maximum slope of the restitution curve (1.12 +/- 0.35 vs. 0.81 +/- 0.25, P = 0.03) and its epicardial dispersion (0.32 +/- 0.07 vs. 0.24 +/- 0.04, coefficient of variation, P = 0.017). Amiodarone significantly increased the SDVF-CL (92 +/- 8 vs. 99 +/- 10 milliseconds, P < 0.01) and epicardial dispersion 0.14 +/- 0.06 vs. 0.18 +/- 0.05, P < 0.01. Amiodarone did not change the LDVF-CL (228 +/- 12 vs. 226 +/- 10 milliseconds, P > 0.05) or epicardial dispersion (0.17 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.15 +/- 0.02, P > 0.05) compared with control. However, the drug significantly decreased the transmural dispersion of LDVF-CL (68 +/- 28 vs. 39 +/- 14 milliseconds, P < 0.01) without changing the transmural dispersion of SDVF-CL (29 +/- 22 vs. 32 +/- 30 milliseconds, P > 0.05). Conclusions: Acute amiodarone significantly decreased the LDVF-DFT. The decreased transmural dispersion of LDVF-CL by amiodarone might contribute to the decreased LDVF-DFT

AB  - Background Most gastric cancer patients who undergo gastrectomy develop malnutrition. It is, therefore, crucial to establish an effective means to provide nutrition for these patients. To perform home enteral nutrition (EN) to ensure adequate nutritional intake in gastric cancer patients, we placed a jejunostomy catheter during gastric surgery. Most patients showed improved nutritional status. Methods Twenty-nine inpatients at our hospital underwent radical gastrectomy and jejunostomy from December 2002 to December 2007 and were designated as the jejunostomy group, and 32 matched patients without a jejunostomy tube were designated as the tube-free group. The jejunostomy group was treated with EN from 72 hours to 3 months postoperatively. The tube-free group did not receive EN. Data including preoperative and postoperative body weight, body mass index (BMI), nutrition risk screening (NRS) score, Karnofsky performance score (KPS), and laboratory biochemical indicators were documented respectively and compared. Results Compared with preoperative week 1, both groups showed decreased body weight and BMI at 3 months postoperatively. The weight loss in the jejunostomy group ((7.1 +/- 3.3) kg) was significantly less than that in the tube-free group ((9.9 +/- 3.1) kg). Similarly, BMI decreased by (2.4 +/- 1.0) kg/m(2) in the jejunostomy group, which was significantly less than in the tube-free group ((3.2 +/- 0.9) kg/m(2)). The number of patients with postoperative NRS was decreased in the jejunostomy group, but was increased in the tube-free group, and this difference was significant. There were no significant differences between the two groups in total lymphocyte count, hemoglobin, albumin and prealbumin, and adverse drug effects. Conclusions Short-term (3 months) EN supplementation via jejunostomy tube can reduce the risk of malnutrition and weight loss, and improve tolerance of chemotherapy. Tube feeding is reliable for achieving these goals because it is not important whether or not the patients have appetites. Chin Med J 2011;124(20):3297-3301

AB  - Background: This study examined national trends, patterns, correlates, and barriers to substance abuse treatment use by adolescents aged 12-17 years who met at least one of the past-year criteria for prescription opioid abuse or dependence (N = 1788). Methods: Data were from the 2005-2008 National Surveys of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). Past-year substance use disorders, major depression, and treatment use were assessed by audio computer-assisted self-interviewing. Results: About 17% of adolescents with opioid dependence (n = 434) and 16% of those with opioid abuse (n = 355) used any substance abuse treatment in the past year compared with 9% of subthreshold users, i.e., adolescents who reported 1-2 prescription opioid dependence criteria but no abuse criteria (n = 999). Only 4.2% of adolescents with opioid dependence, 0.5% of those with abuse, and 0.6% of subthreshold users reported a perceived need for treatment of nonmedical opioid use. Self-help groups and outpatient rehabilitation were the most commonly used sources of treatment. Few black adolescents used treatment (medical settings, 3.3%; self-help groups, 1.7%) or reported a need for treatment (1.8%). Talking to parents/guardians about dangers of substance use increased the odds of treatment use. Barriers to treatment use included "wasn't ready to stop substance use," "didn't want others to find out," and "could handle the problem without treatment." Conclusions: Adolescents with prescription opioid use disorders markedly underutilize treatment. Non-financial barriers are pervasive, including stigma and a lack of perceived treatment need.

AB  - The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of genetically modified recombinant human IL-11 (mIL-11), using original IL-11 as an active control, in a multicenter randomized trial involving 88 cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy Eighty-eight subjects who had platelets a parts per thousand broken vertical bar 75 x 10(9)/L during the prior chemotherapy were randomized to the MR or RM group. Cohort MR consists of subcutaneous injection of mIL-11 (7.5 mu g/kg/day) for 10 days, beginning 72 h after chemotherapy for a 21-day chemotherapy cycle (cycle-1) followed by that of recombinant human interleukin-11 (rhIL-11) (25 mu g/kg/day) for another 10 days (cycle-2). Cohort RM represents the reverse sequence. Intent-to-treat populations of mIL-11 (n = 73) or rhIL-11 (n = 80) were analyzed to evaluate the safety. The incidence of drug-related adverse events of mIL-11 (32.9%) was lower than that of rhIL-11 (51.3%) (p = 0.033). There were no unexpected a parts per thousand yengrade-3 adverse events, and no subject developed antibodies to the mIL-11 protein. Sixty-two subjects were analyzed for efficacy by measuring average platelet levels. Both mIL-11 and rhIL-11 increased nadir platelet levels (62.6 +/- 34.9 x 10(9)/L for mIL-11 vs. 60.2 +/- 31.7 x 10(9)/L for rhIL-11) as compared with the untreated control group (41.2 +/- 17.7 x 10(9)/L) (p < 0.0001). There was no statistical difference in average platelet levels and platelet recovery rate between mIL-11 and rhIL-11. This study shows that mIL-11 is well tolerated and has thrombopoietic activity equivalent to one third of the clinical dose of rhIL-11, indicating the potential of mIL-11 for use in the treatment of CIT

AB  - Background: Data on effect of regular liver function monitoring during anti-TB treatment is limited in China. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of scheduled liver function monitoring on identification of asymptomatic liver damage and anti-TB treatment outcomes during anti-TB treatment. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed based on a national-level cohort study. A total of 273 patients developing liver dysfunction were divided into two groups, 111 patients who were diagnosed through scheduled liver function test within two months after initiation of anti-TB treatment formed scheduled monitoring group, others who were diagnosed due to developing symptoms formed passive detection group (n = 162). The two groups were compared through clinical features, prognosis of liver dysfunction and impact on anti-TB treatment using propensity score weighting analysis. Results: 33.3% of 273 patients did not have any clinical symptoms, including 8 with severe hepatotoxicity. 1.8% in scheduled monitoring group and 11.1% in passive detection group required hospitalization (P = 0.004). Regarding the prognosis of liver dysfunction, most patients recovered, no death happened in scheduled monitoring group while 3 died in passive detection group. In terms of impact on anti-TB treatment, 35.1% in scheduled monitoring group and 56.8% in passive detection group changed their anti-TB treatment (P = 0.001). Conclusions: Scheduled monitoring is effective in identifying asymptomatic liver damage, reducing hospitalization rate and improving compliance of anti-TB treatment

AB  - Background and Objective Transcranial laser therapy (TLT) has been used successfully for the treatment of stroke in animal models and clinical trials. These results support the hypothesis that TLT could be used to treat other central nervous system conditions, such as depression. Current therapy for depression emphasizes pharmaco-therapeutics. However, these interventions often cause unwanted side effects. Here, TLT as a treatment for depression was studied in a rat model of chronic mild stress (CMS). Study Design/Material and Methods: Wistar rats were randomized into four experimental groups (n 8): (1) Nostress; (2) stress without treatment (Stress); (3) stress treated with an antidepressant (Drug); and (4) stress treated with TLT (TLT). The rats in the stress groups were exposed sequentially to a variety of mild stressors for 8 weeks. Rats were weighed weekly. After 5 weeks of stressing, the Drug group received a daily injection of fluoxetine (10 mg/kg), and the TLT group was irradiated transcranially 3 times a week (810 nm wavelength laser, 3 mm diameter probe, 350 mW peak power, 100 Hz with 20% duty cycle, 2-minute treatment time, 120 J/cm2 average energy density on skin surface). After 3 weeks of treatment, a forced swimming test (FST) was performed and recorded for behavioral assessment. Animals were euthanized after 8 weeks of the study. Results: The No-stress group had significantly higher body weight than stress groups from week 5 (P < 0.05). No weight difference was found between the stress groups before treatment. However, the Drug group had significantly less body weight than both Stress and TLT groups after 2 weeks of treatment (P < 0.05). FST showed that the Stress group had significantly more immobility than the No-stress group (P < 0.05). Both Drug and TLT groups had significantly less immobility than the stress group (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in immobility between both Drug and TLT groups (P 0.62). Conclusions: TLT was comparable to fluoxetine in improving the behavioral outcome after CMS. TLT did not cause weight loss, which is consistently seen in patients treated with fluoxetine. This study demonstrates that TLT has potential as an effective treatment for depression. Lasers Surg.

AB  - In order to expand the properties and applications of aliphatic absorbable polyesters, a new biodegradable block copolymer family, poly(ester amide)-b-poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PEA-b-PCL), was synthesized and characterized. These copolymers were synthesized by first preparing L-phenylalanine-based poly(ester amide) macroinitiators (Phe-PEAs) with free amine end groups via a solution polycondensation. The amine-terminated Phe-PEA macroinitiators were then used to initiate the ring-opening polymerization of epsilon-caprolactone monomer to prepare the PEA-b-PCL copolymers. The molecular weight (MW) of PEA-b-PCLs can be well controlled by adjusting the Phe-PEA MW and weight ratio of epsilon-caprolactone to Phe-PEA, and ranged from 7 to 50 kg mol(-1). The copolymers' structure and properties were characterized by various physicochemical methods, such as nuclear magnetic resonance, gel permeation chromatography and solubility testing. The in vitro enzymatic biodegradation tests were performed to evaluate the biodegradation rate of the copolymers. The results showed that the introduction of Phe-PEA to PCL did not significantly change the degradation rate of PCL. Biological studies were conducted to assess the polymer's biological properties, like supporting the cell attachment and proliferation, and inflammation response. The results showed that the bovine aortic endothelial cells had very good attachment and proliferation performance on PEA-b-PCL coating surface. TNF-alpha release profiles showed that PEA-b-PCL exhibited a muted J774 macrophage inflammatory response. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved

AB  - The extracellular stability versus intracellular drug release dilemma has been a long challenge for micellar drug delivery systems. Here, core-crosslinked pH-sensitive degradable micelles were developed based on poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(mono-2,4,6-trimethoxy benzylidene-pentaerythritol carbonate-co-acryloyl carbonate) (PEG-b-P(TMBPEC-co-AC)) diblock copolymer that contains acid-labile acetal and photo-crossslinkable acryloyl groups in the hydrophobic polycarbonate block for intracellular paclitaxel (PTX) release. The micelles following photo-crosslinking while displaying high stability at pH 7.4 were prone to rapid hydrolysis at mildly acidic pHs of 4.0 and 5.0, with half lives of ca. 12.5 and 38.5 h, respectively. Notably, these micelles showed high drug loading efficiencies of 76.0-93.2% at theoretical PTX loading contents of 5-15 wt.%. Depending on drug loading contents, PTX-loaded micelles had average sizes varying from 132.2 to 171.6 nm, which were decreased by 17-22 nm upon photo-crosslinking. The in vitro release studies showed that PTX release at pH 7.4 was greatly inhibited by crosslinking of micelles. Notably, rapid drug release was obtained under mildly acidic conditions, in which 90.0% and 78.1% PTX was released in 23 h at pH 4.0 and 5.0, respectively. MTT assays showed that PTX-loaded crosslinked micelles retained high anti-tumor activity with a cell viability of 9.2% observed for RAW 264.7 cells following 72 h incubation, which was comparable to PTX-loaded non-crosslinked counterparts (cell viability 7.5%) under otherwise the same conditions, supporting efficient drug release from PTX-loaded crosslinked micelles inside the tumor cells. These core-crosslinked pH-responsive biodegradable micelles with superior extracellular stability and rapid intracellular drug release provide a novel platform for tumor-targeting drug delivery.

AB  - Background: Hypothyroidism is a chronic condition of endocrine disorder and its precise molecular mechanism remains obscure. In spite of certain efficacy of thyroid hormone replacement therapy in treating hypothyroidism, it often results in other side effects because of its over-replacement, so it is still urgent to discover new modes of treatment for hypothyroidism. Sini decoction (SND) is a well-known formula of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and is considered as efficient agents against hypothyroidism. However, its holistic effect assessment and mechanistic understanding are still lacking due to its complex components. Methodology/Principal Findings: A urinary metabonomic method based on ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry was employed to explore global metabolic characters of hypothyroidism. Three typical hypothyroidism models (methimazole-, propylthiouracil-and thyroidectomy-induced hypothyroidism) were applied to elucidate the molecular mechanism of hypothyroidism. 17, 21, 19 potential biomarkers were identified with these three hypothyroidism models respectively, primarily involved in energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism and purine metabolism. In order to avert the interference of drug interaction between the antithyroid drugs and SND, the thyroidectomy-induced hypothyroidism model was further used to systematically assess the therapeutic efficacy of SND on hypothyroidism. A time-dependent recovery tendency was observed in SND-treated group from the beginning of model to the end of treatment, suggesting that SND exerted a recovery effect on hypothyroidism in a time-dependent manner through partially regulating the perturbed metabolic pathways. Conclusions/Significance: Our results showed that the metabonomic approach is instrumental to understand the pathophysiology of hypothyroidism and offers a valuable tool for systematically studying the therapeutic effects of SND on hypothyroidism

AB  - Riluzole, a sodium/glutamate antagonist has shown promise as a neuroprotective agent. It is licensed for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and is in clinical trial development for spinal cord injury (SCI). This study investigated the therapeutic time-window and pharmacokinetics of riluzole in a rodent model of cervical SCI. Rats were treated with riluzole (8 mg/kg) at 1 hour (P1) and 3 hours (P3) after injury or with vehicle. Afterward, P1 and P3 groups received riluzole (6 (mg/kg) every 12 hours for 7 days. Both P1 and P3 animals had significant improvements in locomotor recovery as measured by open field locomotion (BBB score, BBB subscore). Von Frey stimuli did not reveal an increase in at level or below level mechanical allodynia. Sensory-evoked potential recordings and quantification of axonal cytoskeleton demonstrated a riluzole-mediated improvement in axonal integrity and function. Histopathological and retrograde tracing studies demonstrated that delayed administration leads to tissue preservation and reduces apoptosis and inflammation. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was undertaken to examine the pharmacokinetics of riluzole. Riluzole penetrates the spinal cord in 15 min, and SCI slowed elimination of riluzole from the spinal cord, resulting in a longer half-life and higher drug concentration in spinal cord and plasma. Initiation of riluzole treatment 1 and 3 hours post-SCI led to functional, histological, and molecular benefits. While extrapolation of post-injury time windows from rat to man is challenging, evidence from SCI-related biomarker studies would suggest that the post-injury time window is likely to be at least 12 hours in man

AB  - Objective: Knowledge of patients' treatment needs is an important requirement for comprehensive long-term patient care. The objective of this investigation was to assess the requirements of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) regarding pharmacotherapy. Methods: A total of 17,500 members of the German Parkinson Association were given the opportunity to anonymously answer a questionnaire about their health-related quality of life, PD pharmacotherapy and their improvement suggestions for new PD medication. Results: Answers from 6351 patients were available for analysis. The majority (87.2%) of patients were older than 60 years; 88.9% had been diagnosed with PD for longer than 3 years and 84.4% selected one of the three most severe categories (categories 1-3 on a 6-point scale) when rating the impact of PD on their quality of life. Symptoms that were regarded as very important for improvement with pharmacotherapy included motor fluctuations (66.3%), early morning akinesia (55.4%) and sleep disturbances (43.5%). Properties of a new PD medication that were rated as very important included continuous drug delivery over 24 hours (66.6%) and 24-hour symptom control (55.8%). The majority of patients used physicians (84.2%) and/or self-help groups (69.4%) to obtain information about PD. Topics of particular interest included comorbid diseases (78.3%), mobility and exercise (77.3%) and research (53%). Conclusion: PD has a major impact on patients' quality of life. From the patient's perspective, PD pharmacotherapy needs to address a range of symptoms including not only motor symptoms, but also non-motor symptoms such as sleep disturbances. In selecting the most appropriate treatment regimen, patient preference is an important consideration

AB  - I. Efforts Toward the Synthesis of (-)-Tetracycline . A macrocyclic approach toward (-)-tetracycline is described. Traditional approaches towards the synthesis of tetracycline antibiotics employ the linear construction of the core structure starting with either the A- or D-rings. In contrast to this iterative annulation-based strategy, we have sought to employ a chiral macrocycle in our approach. Key to the success of our synthesis endeavor is the execution of two key steps: (1) a transannular Michael addition, which forms the A-ring and sets the C4a-stereogenic center; and (2) an isoxazole substitution reaction, which effects a ring contraction to produce both the B- and C-rings. This work describes our implementation of the strategy and focuses on the stereochemical interplay between the C4-, C4a-, C6-, and C12a-stereocenters within the context of the key steps. II. Analysis of the Peripheral Attack Model . The application of the peripheral attack model to 34 literature examples of intermolecular macrocyclic stereocontrol is described. While the peripheral attack model has been broadly applied in complex molecule synthesis, the validity of the model has not been subjected to analysis since being proposed in the early 1980's. In order to assess the value of the model to organic chemists, we have developed a systematic method for probing the conformational profile of macrocycles. Using this tool, we then analyzed each of the 34 literature substrates and concluded whether the peripheral attack model predicts the correct stereochemical outcome in both a binary- and magnitude-based capacity. Analysis of both the bulk dataset and subsets of the dataset is included

AB  - This review summarizes existing evidence on interventions to address substance use problems among homeless youth. Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria of the review. The quality of included studies was analyzed using explicit and well-validated criteria. Interventions evaluated ranged from individual-focused therapies such as brief motivational intervention, community reinforcement approach, and knowledge and skills training, to broader interventions such as family therapy, support groups, and shelter-based health care and housing programs. Participants reported improvements in substance use outcomes over time in most of the studies. However, the superiority of a specific intervention is difficult to determine because of the heterogeneity of the interventions and the few studies conducted on each intervention. Implications for practice and research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB  - Background Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common sexual disease in male patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Sildenafil citrate is considered as an effective drug in the treatment of male ED in the general population, but it has not been systematically reviewed in patients with MS. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of sildenafil citrate for ED in patients with MS. Search methods We searched the Cochrane (November 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 4 of 4, 2011), MEDLINE (PubMed) (January 1966 to November 2011), EMBASE (January 1974 to November 2011) and the China Biological Medicine Database (CBM) (1979 to November 2011). We searched trials registers and conference proceedings and contacted pharmaceutical company and authors of included studies for additional data. There were no language restrictions. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing sildenafil citrate with placebo or no treatment for ED in patients with MS. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected articles for inclusion, extracted data and assessed trial quality. Disagreements were resolved by discussion between review authors. Authors of included studies were contacted for additional information. Results were presented as relative risks (RR) or mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main results Two randomised controlled trials involving a total of 420 patients were identified. Both trials investigated the short-term efficacy and safety of sildenafil citrate for ED in patients with MS. Patients taking sildenafil citrate were more likely to improve their ability to achieve and maintain an erection measured by International Index of Erectile Function and achieve vaginal penetration ((RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.78) and complete intercourse measured by Sexual Encounter Profile diary (RR RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.90). and receive A global well respond measured by Global Assessment Question (RR 2.72, 95% CI 1.40 to 5.28) was reported. One trial showed sildenafil citrate is effective in quality of life improvement, while the other trial did not find any significant difference between both groups. Both included trials were judged as high risk of attrition bias. Adverse events were also reported: the most common were headache, flushing, rhinitis, visual disturbances and dyspepsia. Two patients suffered serious adverse events: one with coronary artery disease requiring triple bypass surgery and one with a cerebrovascular accident. Authors' conclusions There is limited evidence to support sildenafil citrate as an effective treatment for ED in patients with MS. Future well designed randomised, double blinded, placebo-controlled trials with long-term duration are needed

AB  - Antischistosomal activities of a synthetic peroxide OZ78 (an ozonide carboxylic acid) against Schistosoma japonicum have been studied in mice and rabbits. Among 132 mice used, 30 of them were infected with 80-100 S. japonicum cercariae for collection of juvenile and adult schistosomes applied in in vitro tests. The remaining 102 mice were infected with 40 schistosome cercariae used for experimental treatment. Other 13 rabbits infected each with 200 schistosome cercariae were treated orally with OZ78 42 days post-infection. Most treated mice and rabbits were sacrificed 4 weeks post-treatment to collect residual schistosomes for evaluation of the drug efficacy. OZ78 and its sodium salt (OZ78-Na salt) 10-60 mu g/mL alone exhibited no in vitro effect against day 14, day 21 schistosomula, and day 35 adult schistosomes. But OZ78 and OZ78-Na salt 10 and 20 mu g/mL together with hemin 80 mu g/mL showed decrease in worm motor activity and severe damage to the worm tegument and intestine, and all worms died within 3 days post-incubation. After infected mice were treated orally with OZ78 at a single dose of 400 mg/kg for 1 day, 34.9% of the worms shifted to the liver. Three and 7 days post-treatment, 100% of the worms were recovered from the liver. Fourteen days post-treatment, 92.3% of the worms still remained in the liver and 7.7% of the worms returned back to the mesenteric veins. Male and female worms shifted to the liver revealed in apparent shrinkage, degeneration of worm body, depigmentation in gut, and disappearance of ova in the uterus of some female worms. Meanwhile, dead worm and dead worm fragments were found in the liver tissues. In mice infected with various stages of schistosomes and treated orally with single OZ78 400 mg/kg, moderate or potential effect of the drug against day 0 (3-h-old worm), day 7, day 14, and day 21 juvenile worms and day 28, day 35 as well as day 42 adult worms were observed, the differences of total or female worm burdens between each treated group and control group were statistically significant (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05). Among the various stages of juveniles, day 7 worms were more susceptible to OZ78 with worm reduction of 83.8%, while the effect of OZ78 against day 28 to day 42 adult worms were similar. Finally, rabbits infected with adult schistosomes and treated with OZ78 at a single dose of 45 mg/kg or a daily dose of 35 mg/kg for three consecutive days resulted in significantly lower total and female worm burdens in comparison with that of control (P < 0.05) with total and female worm reductions of 84.1% and 84.7% as well as 74.3% and 77.4%, respectively. The results demonstrate that OZ78 possesses effect against both juvenile and adult S. japonicum in mouse model, and also shows effect against adult schistosomes in rabbits

AB  - This paper presents a methodology based on multivariate data analysis for identifying input sources of perfluoroallkyl substances (PFASs) detected in 37 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) across more than 40 cities in the state of Minnesota (USA). Exploratory analysis of data points has been carried out by unsupervised pattern recognition (cluster analysis), correlation analysis, ANOVA and per capita discharges in an attempt to discriminate sources of PFASs in WWTPs. Robust cluster solutions grouped the database according to the different PFAS profiles in WWTP influent. Significantly elevated levels of perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and/or perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) in influent have been found in 18 out of 37 WWTPs (49%). A substantial increase in the concentrations of PFHxA and/or PFOA from influent to effluent was observed in 59% of the WWTPs surveyed, suggestive of high concentration inputs of precursors. The fate of one precursor (8:2 fluorotelomer alcohol) in WWTP was modeled based on fugacity analysis to understand the increasing effluent concentration. Furthermore, population-related emissions cannot wholly explain the occurrence and levels of PFASs in WWTPs. Unusually high influent levels of PFASs were observed in WWTPs located in specific industrial areas or where known contamination had taken place. Despite the restriction on the production/use of PFOA and PFOS, this paper demonstrates that wastewater from industrial activities is still a principal determinant of PFAS pollution in urban watersheds.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to assess the ultrastructural alterations of juvenile Schistosoma japonicum induced by mefloquine. Mice infected with 14-day-old S. japonicum were treated orally with mefloquine at a single dose of 400 mg/kg. Between 8 h and 7 days after treatment, groups of two mice were sacrificed, and schistosomula were recovered for transmission electron microscopic observations. Ultrastructural damage was seen in the tegument, subtegumental musculature, parenchymal tissues, and gut epithelial cell. It was already prominent 8 h after drug administration and increased in severity rapidly to reach a peak 3 days post-treatment. Tegumental alterations were characterized by emergence of irregular and elongated cytoplasmic processes, which further fused together accompanied by indistinction of matrix and roughness of external plasma membrane. Meanwhile, in the subtegument, damage to the syncytium, swelling, and lysis of muscle bundles and parenchymal tissues were universal, which further aggravated the lesion on the tegument, followed by collapse or disintegration of damaged tegument to form numerous fragment or debris of cytoplasmic process detached from the worm surface. Severe damage to the gut epithelial cell was also observed 8 h post-mefloquine treatment, which included focal lysis of cytoplasm accompanied by formation of vacuoles and degeneration of mitochondria, emergence of enlarged and contracted nucleus with indistinct or focal disrupted nuclear membrane, and decrease in microvilli. All these alterations further increased in severity and reached the peak 3 days post-treatment. The findings of our study indicate that mefloquine exhibits a fast and potent ability to cause extensive ultrastructural damage to juvenile S. japonicum, which correlates with its high efficacy against juvenile schistosomes

AB  - Background: Hydrogen recovered from organic wastes and solar energy by photo-fermentative bacteria (PFB) has been suggested as a promising bioenergy strategy. However, the use of PFB for hydrogen production generally suffers from a serious biomass washout from photobioreactor, due to poor flocculation of PFB. In the continuous operation, PFB cells cannot be efficiently separated from supernatant and rush out with effluent from reactor continuously, which increased the effluent turbidity, meanwhile led to increases in pollutants. Moreover, to replenish the biomass washout, substrate was continuously utilized for cell growth rather than hydrogen production. Consequently, the poor flocculability not only deteriorated the effluent quality, but also decreased the potential yield of hydrogen from substrate. Therefore, enhancing the flocculability of PFB is urgent necessary to further develop photo-fermentative process. Results: Here, we demonstrated that L-cysteine could improve hydrogen production of Rhodopseudomonas faecalis RLD-53, and more importantly, simultaneously trigger remarkable aggregation of PFB. Experiments showed that L-cysteine greatly promoted the production of extracellular polymeric substances, especially secretion of protein containing more disulfide bonds, and help for enhancement stability of floc of PFB. Through formation of disulfide bonds, L-cysteine not only promoted production of EPS, in particular the secretion of protein, but also stabilized the final confirmation of protein in EPS. In addition, the cell surface elements and functional groups, especially surface charged groups, have also been changed by L-cysteine. Consequently, absolute zeta potential reached a minimum value at 1.0 g/l of L-cysteine, which obviously decreased electrostatic repulsion interaction energy based on DLVO theory. Total interaction energy barrier decreased from 389.77 KT at 0.0 g/l of L-cysteine to 127.21 kT at 1.0 g/l. Conclusions: Thus, the strain RLD-53 overcame the total energy barrier and flocculated effectively. After a short settlement, the biomass rush out will be significantly reduced and the effluent quality will be greatly improved in the continuous operation. Furthermore, aggregation of PFB could enable high biomass hold-up of photobioreactor, which allows the photobioreactor to operate at low hydraulic retention time and high organic loading rate. Therefore, the described flocculation behaviour during photo-hydrogen production is potentially suitable for practicable application

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Allium sativum L (DaSuan in Mandarin) is a traditional Chinese herb that has been used to prevent and heal cardiovascular diseases. Objective: To study the effects of allitridi (an active constituent of Allium sativum L) and amiodarone on the conduction system and on reverse use-dependence in the isolated hearts of normal rats and rats with myocardial infarction (Ml). Materials and methods: Male Sprague Dawley rats, with a ligated left anterior descending coronary artery, were used as myocardial infarction models to investigate the biological effects of the traditional Chinese herb. A single-phase electrode assay and isolated heart perfusion administration methods were employed to study and compare the electrophysiological effects of allitridi and amiodarone on normal and MI rats. Monophasic action potential (MAP) in vitro, effective refractory period (ERP) and monophasic action potential duration (MAPD)/ERP were measured to investigate reverse use-dependence (RUD) with allitridi and amiodarone. Moreover, bundle maps and heart rates were analyzed to evaluate the electrophysiological effects of allitridi on the conduction system of the cardiac muscles. Coronary flow was used to study the beneficial effects of the two drugs on the bundle of His in myocardial infraction. Results: (1) Allitridi and amiodarone can reduce the infarction model of the His bundle (A-H, H-V) conduction and cardiac sinus rhythm in normal rats and isolated rat hearts. After washing in physiological solution (AK-H) for 15 min, the allitridi group partially recovered, but the amiodarone group did not recover. (2) Allitridi and amiodarone had no significant effects on the change of MAPD(90) or ERP in normal and MI rat hearts at different pacing frequencies (200, 250 and 300 beats/min), which indicated no RUD. In addition, the effects of allitridi on prolonging MAPD(90) and ERP were weaker than those of amiodarone (P<0.01). The effects of allitridi on myocardial repolarization and its variation rate were also weaker than those of amiodarone (P<0.01). However, the prolonged administration of allitridi still did not cause RUD. Allitridi and amiodarone can significantly increase the ERP/APD(90) rate of the isolated heart ventricles of normal rats and rats with MI. Conclusion: We propose that allitridi and amiodarone have similar effects on the cardiac conduction system and on the electrophysiology without RUD, which may be the result of the use of multi-channel blockers, such as calcium channel blockers and IKr and IKs channel blockers. Allitridi may be a promising antiarrythmic drug. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved

AB  - PH-797804 ((aS)-3-{3-bromo-4-[(2,4-difluorobenzyl)oxy]-6-methyl-2-oxopyridin-1(2H)-yl}-N,4-dimethylbenzamde) is a diarylpyridinone inhibitor of p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase derived from a racemic mixture as the more potent atropisomer (aS), first proposed by molecular modeling and subsequently confirmed by experiments. Due to steric constraints imposed by the pyridinone carbonyl group and the 6- and 6'-methyl substituents of PH-797804, rotation around the connecting bond of the pyridinone and the N-phenyl ring is restricted. Density functional theory predicts a remarkably high rotational energy barrier of >30 kcal?mol-1, corresponding to a half-life of more than one hundred years at room temperature. This gives rise to discrete conformational spaces for the N-phenylpyridinone group, and as a result, two atropic isomers that do not interconvert under ambient conditions. Molecular modeling studies predict that the two isomers should differ in their binding affinity for p38a kinase; whereas the atropic S (aS) isomer binds favorably, the opposite aR isomer incurs significant steric interference with p38a kinase. The two isomers were subsequently identified and separated by chiral chromatography. IC50 values from p38a kinase assays confirm that one atropisomer is >100-fold more potent than the other. It was ultimately confirmed by small-molecule X-ray diffraction that the more potent atropisomer, PH-797804, is the aS isomer of the racemic pair. Extensive pharmacological characterization supports that PH-797804 carries most activity both in vitro and in vivo, and it has a stability profile compatible with oral formulation and delivery options

AB  - Objective: We supposed that it will be a promising strategy to "prevent" multidrug resistance (MDR) instead of "reversing" it. This study was designed to investigate the potency of curcumin to prevent the acquired drug resistance induced by adriamycin (ADM) in native K562 cells. Methods: K562 cells were pretreated with curcumin or 0.5% DMSO for 24 h and then were co-incubated with ADM. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and mdr1 mRNA levels were analyzed separately by flow cytometry and quantitative real-time RT-PCR. The intracellular Rh-123 accumulation was also detected by flow cytometer. Finally, we performed a MTT assay to determine the ADM-induced cytotoxicity with or without pretreatment of curcumin. Results: P-gp and mdr1 mRNA expressions were elevated in the ADM alone group. While in the curcumin pretreated groups, the induced P-gp and mdr1 mRNA levels gradually decreased with increasing curcumin concentrations, and the Rh-123 accumulation level was almost recovered close to the control group's. Finally, the MTT colorimetric assay verified the enhanced effect of curcumin on ADM-induced cytotoxicity. Conclusion: Our present study suggested that curcumin exhibits the novel ability to prevent the up-regulation of P-gp and its mRNA induced by ADM. The prevention capacity is also functionally associated with the elevated intracellular drug accumulation and parallel enhanced ADM cytotoxicity. We revealed a novel function of curcumin as a potential drug resistance preventor

AB  - Ultralow molecular weight (ULMW) heparins are sulfated glycans that are clinically used to treat thrombotic disorders. ULMW heparins range from 1500 to 3000 daltons, corresponding from 5 to 10 saccharide units. The commercial drug Arixtra (fondaparinux sodium) is a structurally homogeneous ULMW heparin pentasaccharide that is synthesized through a lengthy chemical process. Here, we report 10- and 12-step chemoenzymatic syntheses of two structurally homogeneous ULMW heparins (MW = 1778.5 and 1816.5) in 45 and 37% overall yield, respectively, starting from a simple disaccharide. These ULMW heparins display excellent in vitro anticoagulant activity and comparable pharmacokinetic properties to Arixtra, as demonstrated in a rabbit model. The chemoenzymatic approach is scalable and shows promise for a more efficient route to synthesize this important class of medicinal agent

AB  - Background: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by the absence of the mRNA-binding protein Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), encoded by the Fmr1 gene. Overactive signaling by group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptor (Grp1 mGluR) could contribute to slowed synaptic development and other symptoms of FXS. Our previous study has identified that facilitation of synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) by D1 receptor is impaired in Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice. However, the contribution of Grp1 mGluR to the facilitation of synaptic plasticity by D1 receptor stimulation in the prefrontal cortex has been less extensively studied. Results: Here we demonstrated that DL-AP3, a Grp1 mGluR antagonist, rescued LTP facilitation by D1 receptor agonist SKF81297 in Fmr1KO mice. Grp1 mGluR inhibition restored the GluR1-subtype AMPA receptors surface insertion by D1 activation in the cultured Fmr1KO neurons. Simultaneous treatment of Grp1 mGluR antagonist with D1 agonist recovered the D1 receptor signaling by reversing the subcellular redistribution of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) in the Fmr1KO neurons. Treatment of SKF81297 alone failed to increase the phosphorylation of NR2B-containing N-methyl D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) at Tyr-1472 (p-NR2B-Tyr1472) in the cultures from KO mice. However, simultaneous treatment of DL-AP3 could rescue the level of p-NR2B-Tyr1472 by SKF81297 in the cultures from KO mice. Furthermore, behavioral tests indicated that simultaneous treatment of Grp1 mGluR antagonist with D1 agonist inhibited hyperactivity and improved the learning ability in the Fmr1KO mice. Conclusion: The findings demonstrate that mGluR1 inhibition is a useful strategy to recover D1 receptor signaling in the Fmr1KO mice, and combination of Grp1 mGluR antagonist and D1 agonist is a potential drug therapy for the FXS

AB  - The anti-neoplastic agent didemnin B from the Caribbean tunicate Trididemnum solidum was the first marine drug to be clinically tested in humans. Because of its limited supply and its complex cyclic depsipeptide structure, considerable challenges were encountered during didemnin B's development that continue to limit aplidine (dehydrodidemnin B), which is currently being evaluated in numerous clinical trials. Herein we show that the didemnins are bacterial products produced by the marine alpha-proteobacteria Tistrella mobilis and Tistrella bauzanensis via a unique post-assembly line maturation process. Complete genome sequence analysis of the 6,513,401 bp T. mobilis strain KA081020-065 with its five circular replicons revealed the putative didemnin biosynthetic gene cluster (did) on the 1,126,962 bp megaplasmid pTM3. The did locus encodes a 13-module hybrid non-ribosomal peptide synthetase-polyketide synthase enzyme complex organized in a collinear arrangement for the synthesis of the fatty acylglutamine ester derivatives didemnins X and Y rather than didemnin B as first anticipated. Imaging mass spectrometry of T. mobilis bacterial colonies captured the time-dependent extracellular conversion of the didemnin X and Y precursors to didemnin B, in support of an unusual post-synthetase activation mechanism. Significantly, the discovery of the didemnin biosynthetic gene cluster may provide a long-term solution to the supply problem that presently hinders this group of marine natural products and pave the way for the genetic engineering of new didemnin congeners

AB  - Background: Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is involved in stress regulation. Genetic variations predict plasma NPY and neural correlates of emotion and stress. We examined whether the functional NPY haplotype modulates stress-induced NPY and anxiety responses, and if plasma NPY stress responses are associated with substance dependence outcomes. Methods: Thirty-seven treatment-engaged, abstinent substance dependent (SD) patients and 28 healthy controls (HCs) characterized on NPY diplotypes (HH: high expression; HLLL: intermediate/low expression) were exposed to stress, alcohol/drug cues and neutral relaxing cues, using individualized guided imagery, in a 3-session laboratory experiment. Plasma NPY, heart rate and anxiety were assessed. Patients were prospectively followed for 90-days post-treatment to assess relapse outcomes. Results: HH individuals showed significantly lower stress-induced NPY with greater heart rate and anxiety ratings, while the HLLL group showed the reverse pattern of NPY, anxiety and heart rate responses. This differential genetic modulation of NPY stress response was suppressed in the SD group, who showed no stress-related increases in NPY and higher heart rate and greater anxiety, regardless of diplotype. Lower NPY predicted subsequent higher number of days and greater amounts of post-treatment drug use. Conclusion: These preliminary findings are the first to document chronic drug abuse influences on NPY diplotype expression where NPY diplotype modulation of stress-related plasma NPY, heart rate and anxiety responses was absent in the substance abuse sample. The finding that lower stress-related NPY is predictive of greater relapse severity provides support for therapeutic development of neuropeptide Y targets in the treatment of substance use disorders.

AB  - The shear behavior of reinforced ultrahigh toughness cementitious composite (RUHTCC) beams without transverse reinforcement was investigated in the present paper, in which UHTCC has tensile strain-hardening behavior due to the steady propagation of multiple fine cracks. A total of 15 simply supported beams were subjected to a concentrated load at midspan, of which nine beams were RUHTCC beams and six beams were RC counterpart beams. The varied parameters were shear span-effective depth ratio and longitudinal reinforcement ratio. The experimental results showed that an enhanced ultimate shear strength that was about two times larger than that of an RC beam was obtained for slender beams with use of UHTCC, whereas only a marginal improvement was obtained for short beams. All tested RUHTCC beams presented a diagonal multiple-cracking mode and a stable diagonal crack propagation process. The maximum crack width was controlled within 0.1 mm at the service state and the high postcracking shear reserve strength was obtained, which means that there is no need to limit the minimum web reinforcement ratio in the engineering design for a RUHTCC beam. On the basis of the present test and tests by other investigators, a group of empirical formulae are suggested for predicting the ultimate shear strength of fiber-reinforced beams without stirrups. A good agreement between the predicted strength and tested value was shown, with the mean and coefficient of variation of the ratio between them about 1.02 and 0.10, respectively.

AB  - Purpose: To investigate the effect of various organ-specific procedures on the incidence of dreaming, the content of the dream, and patient satisfaction during propofol short sedation. Methods: A total of 100 female patients presenting for elective upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (group I) and 100 female patients presenting for first-trimester surgical abortion (group II) were allocated into 2 groups with propofol sedation. Patients were interviewed immediately after they emerged from sedation using the modified Brice questionnaire. If dreaming was reported, the dreamers were immediately asked to complete a 5-point Likert scale regarding the dream. The dream content, the recovery time, and satisfaction were also assessed. Results: A total of 200 patients were included in this analysis with complete data. The incidence of dreaming was 18% in group I and 33% in group II (P < 0.05), despite a similar recovery time. Most dreams were simple, meaningful, and had no significant sexual content during propofol short sedation. Patient satisfaction was comparable between the 2 groups. Conclusions: Different organ of genital atrium and gastrointestinal tract-specific procedures could affect the incidence of dreaming intrasedation. First-trimester surgical abortion did increase the incidence of dreaming during propofol short sedation. Most dreams were simple, with no significant sexual content and no influence on patients' satisfaction. Propofol is a satisfactory short hypnotic drug for patients undergoing first-trimester surgical abortion

AB  - Cancer cells cultured in physiologically relevant, three-dimensional (3D) matrices can recapture many essential features of native tumor tissues. In this study, a hyaluronic acid (HA)-based bilayer hydrogel system that not only supports the tumoroid formation from LNCaP prostate cancer (PCa) cells, but also simulates their reciprocal interactions with the tumor-associated stroma was developed and characterized. HA hydrogels were prepared by mixing solutions of HA precursors functionalized with acrylate groups (HA-AC) and reactive thiols (HA-SH) under physiological conditions. The resultant viscoelastic gels have an average elastic modulus of 234 +/- 30 Pa and can be degraded readily by hyaluronidase. The orthogonal and cytocompatible nature of the crosslinking chemistry permits facile incorporation of cytokine-releasing particles and PCa cells. In our bilayer hydrogel construct, the top layer contains heparin (HP)-decorated, HA-based hydrogel particles (HGPs) capable of releasing heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) in a sustained manner at a rate of 2.5 wt%/day cumulatively. LNCaP cells embedded in the bottom layer receive the growth factor signals from the top, and in response form enlarging tumoroids with an average diameter of 85 gm by day 7. Cells in 3D hydrogels assemble into spherical tumoroids, form close cellular contacts through E-cadherin, and show cortical organization of F-actin, whereas those plated as 2D monolayers adopt a spread-out morphology. Compared to cells cultured on 2D, the engineered tumoroids significantly increased the expression of two pro-angiogenic factors, vascular endothelial growth factor-165 (VEGF(165)) and interleukin-8 (IL-8), both at mRNA and protein levels. Overall, the HA model system provides a useful platform for the study of tumor cell responses to growth factors and for screening of anticancer drugs targeting these pathways. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Reactive gliosis had been implicated in injury and recovery patterns associated with hydrocephalus. Our aim is to determine the efficacy of minocycline, an antibiotic known for its anti-inflammatory properties, to reduce reactive gliosis and inhibit the development of hydrocephalus. Results: The ventricular dilatation were evaluated by MRI at 1-week post drugs treated, while GFAP and Iba-1were detected by RT-PCR, Immunohistochemistry and Western blot. The expression of GFAP and Iba-1 was significantly higher in hydrocephalic group compared with saline control group (p < 0.05). Minocycline treatment of hydrocephalic animals reduced the expression of GFAP and Iba-1 significantly (p < 0.05). Likewise, the severity of ventricular dilatation is lower in minocycline treated hydrocephalic animals compared with the no minocycline group (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Minocycline treatment is effective in reducing the gliosis and delaying the development of hydrocephalus with prospective to be the auxiliary therapeutic method of hydrocephalus

AB  - We examined the reliability of, and relationships among, the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART), the Delay Discounting Task (DDT), and the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), with a group of healthy Chinese young adults. The BART and the DDT showed moderate to high test-retest reliability across 3 test sessions conducted at 2-weekly intervals. However, the IGT showed low reliability for session 1 but high reliability for sessions 2 and 3. Between tasks, there were significant correlations only for the BART and the IGT and only for session 2 and session 3. These findings support the view that impulsivity is a complex construct with no single personality trait underlying the disposition for impulsive behaviors

AB  - Objective: Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction is receiving more attention in patients with end-stage liver diseases. The importance of diastolic dysfunction observed before orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) and its adverse effects on hemodynamics and outcomes of OLT patients, have not been fully explored. We carried a retrospective study to investigate the influence of diastolic dysfunction on OLT patients. Methods: Included in this retrospective study were 330 consecutive patients scheduled for cadaveric OLT over a 5-year period. According to preoperative Doppler echocardiogram (ECHO) findings, patients were divided into two groups: DD group (patients with diastolic dysfunction) and control group (patients with normal ECHO). Patient characteristics, operation variables, hemodynamic course, blood products and drug requirements, postoperative courses and outcomes were evaluated. Results: 306 patients met the study entry criteria and 100 had preoperative diastolic dysfunction. Mean artery blood pressure was significantly lower in DD group after graft reperfusion than that in control group (P<0.01). More patients in DD group required epinephrine, and the mean dose of epinephrine was higher in DD group than that in control group (P<0.01). There was no significant difference in postoperative ventilation time, duration of ICU and hospital stay, renal failure and postoperative mortality between the two groups. Conclusion: Diastolic dysfunction is common in liver transplant recipients. Patients with diastolic dysfunction may be associated with substantial hemodynamic alterations after graft reperfusion and need more inotropic support during OLT. Diastolic dysfunction was not associated with significant adverse postoperative outcomes

AB  - Small-interfering RNA (siRNA) has a high application potential for therapeutic silencing of pathologic or drug-resistance genes. However, although recent research has led to several nonviral nucleic acid delivery systems with encouraging transfection performance, there remains a substantial gap between these systems and an ideal siRNA carrier that can be safely and effectively used for the more complex delivery tasks such as cancer management. We hypothesized that by integrating the high transfection performance of linear polyethylenimine (PEI) with the controlled release properties of solid lipid components, and complementing the resulting lipid-PEI hybrid nanocarrier (LPN) with receptor-targeting capability, multiple limitations of the conventional siRNA carriers would be simultaneously overcome, Data comparing this new hybrid system with the conventional siRNA-PEI polyplexes showed 15 to 21% less loss of siRNA, higher selectivity for prostate cancer cells over noncancerous prostate cells, and significant reduction in both acute and delayed carrier toxicity especially to the noncancerous RWPE1 cells (e.g., 71.2% of LPN-treated cells preserved proliferative capacity versus <= 30.2% in other groups). We further demonstrated sustained intracellular siRNA release from LPNs, which was shown translatable into extended in vitro and in vivo RNA-interference effects for a minimum of one week. Our findings generally support the use of LPN technology to achieve a longer-acting, less toxic, more efficient, and cancer-specific form of siRNA therapy in an "all-in-one" manner, This brings the nonviral siRNA delivery approach one important step closer to its clinical application

AB  - The reactivity of capsular extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) to chlorine and monochloramine was assessed and compared in this study. The impact of capsular EPS on Gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa inactivation mechanisms was investigated both qualitatively and quantitatively using a combination of batch experiments, viability tests with LIVE/DEAD staining, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Both wild-type and isogenic mutant strains with different alginate EPS production capabilities were used to evaluate their susceptibility to chlorine and monochloramine. The mucA22 mutant strain, which overproduces the EPS composed largely of acidic polysaccharide alginate, exhibited high resistance and prolonged inactivation time to both chlorine and monochloramine relative to PAO1 (wild-type) and algT(U) mutant strains (alginate EPS deficient). Multiple analyses were combined to better understand the mechanistic role of EPS against chlorine-based disinfectants. The extracted EPS exhibited high reactivity with chlorine and very low reactivity with monochloramine, suggesting different mechanism of protection against disinfectants. Moreover, capsular EPS on cell membrane appeared to reduce membrane permeabilization by disinfectants as suggested by deformation of key functional groups in EPS and cell membrane (the COC stretching of carbohydrate and the C=O stretching of ester group). The combined results supported that capsular EPS, acting either as a disinfectant consumer (for chlorine inactivation) or limiting access to reactive sites on cell membrane (for monochloramine inactivation), provide a protective role for bacterial cells against regulatory residual disinfectants by reducing membrane permeabilization

AB  - Although there are several effective drugs available for the treatment of intestinal helminths, the fact remains that they continue to remain out of reach to a vast majority of people in the world, especially in developing countries. On the other hand, there are a great many herbal remedies that are effective against common intestinal worms and are easily available to common people in developing countries. Clerodendrum colebrookianum Walp. (Lamiaceae) is a perennial shrub which is native to South and Southeast Asia. Traditionally, the leaves of this plant are used by the indigenous people of Northeast India as a remedy for the treatment of intestinal tapeworm infections. The aim of this study was to evaluate and authenticate the anthelmintic efficacy of C. colebrookianum leaf extract in experimentally induced Hymenolepis diminuta (a zoonotic tapeworm) infections in Wistar rats. The efficacy of the plant extract was assessed by monitoring the eggs per gram of faeces (EPG) counts and worm recovery rates of experimental animals, following treatment with the leaf extract of this plant at three different doses, i.e. 200, 400 and 800 mg/kg body weight, each given singly for 5 days. The results obtained revealed that the leaf extract of C. colebrookianum possesses a dose-dependent efficacy against the larval, immature and adult stages of H. diminuta. However, the efficacy of the extract was found to be considerably high only against the adult stages of the parasite. For this stage, a single 800-mg/kg dose of extract, given for 5 days, resulted into 68.42 % reduction in the EPG counts and 62.50 % reduction in the worm counts in the extract-treated group of animals, as compared to the control. The reference drug, praziquantel (5 mg/kg, single dose), however, showed slightly better efficacy and caused 95.16 and 87.00 % reductions in the EPG and worm counts of treated animals, respectively. Unlike the adult stages, the efficacy of the plant extract was recorded to be comparatively low against the larval and immature stages of the parasite, as the treatment of animals with the highest dose of extract (800 mg/kg) could cause only 37.50 and 54.00 % reductions in worm counts, respectively. The experimental evidence obtained in this study suggests that leaves of C. colebrookianum possess significant anthelminthic properties and supports their use against intestinal tapeworm infections in traditional medicine

AB  - The oxidation of isoniazid by bromate was investigated kinetically under pseudo-first-order conditions in acid medium. The reaction was accelerated by the hydrogen ion due to the various protonation equilibria of both the reactants. The mechanism involves diprotonated isoniazid as the active species which forms two complexes with the diprotonated and unprotonated oxidant. The complex formed between the diprotonated oxidant and the protonated -NH2 group of hydrazide moiety of isoniazid decomposes into isonicotinic acid. Formation of another stable ion pair complex decreases the rate of reaction. The UV-vis examination of the solutions support the formation of both protonated isoniazid and the complexes. A probable mechanism on the basis of kinetic results involving formation of an acyl diimide of the isoniazid was proposed

AB  - Hypothyroidism induced by xenobiotic treatment was analyzed for possible underlying mechanism(s) on the basis of different responses of the thyroid gland and the liver, using a newly-created database of repeated-dose toxicity of 500 chemicals. Two mechanisms are proposed: direct inhibition of thyroid hormone biosynthesis in the thyroid gland, and stimulated degradation of thyroid hormone by induction of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. In the database there were 10 chemicals inducing hypertrophy/hyperplasia of follicular cells in the thyroid gland and having data on thyroid glands. On the basis of the chemical structure and information available in the literature, we judged three chemicals to be typical thioamide derivatives that act directly on the thyroid gland, and the others as non-thioamide derivatives that were unlikely to have any direct action on the thyroid gland. All these chemicals were classified into two groups using the ratios of relative weight increase rate of thyroid gland versus that of the liver. These values were at least 1.7, but 3.2 or more in the most of the cases for thioamide derivatives, and 1.2 or less for non-thioamide derivatives. This background analysis suggests the feasibility of parameter-supported speculation on the possible underlying mechanism when new repeated-dose toxicity data on hypothyroidism becomes available

Although recent theoretical and empirical work has led to major refinements of the community structure research, there remain substantive and promising issues that deserve to be examined by mass communication scholars. This article recasts the original structural model by integrating a community-oriented approach to social control and formulates a set of hypotheses with regard to the role of local mass media in community social control.

AB  - Background: This study examined the prevalence and risk factors for intimate partner violence (IPV) among Chinese older couples in Hong Kong. Methods: A population representative sample was surveyed. Results: The prevalence of IPV in older adults was found to be quite high in the present study, with a lifetime prevalence ranging from 1.4% to 53.6%, and a past year prevalence ranging from 0.4% to 36.1% for various forms of aggression. Results of logistic regression analyses showed that older persons who were younger among this "older" group, who were not employed, who had a substance abuse problem, who had witnessed parental violence during their childhood, who had a criminal history, who had a low level of assertiveness, who had an anger management problem, who experienced a low level of social support and/or experienced stressful conditions, were all more likely to fall victims of IPV. Conclusion: It is suggested that IPV in older couples is a complex phenomenon that is closely intertwined with other forms of domestic violence, including spousal violence, child abuse, in-law conflicts, and elderly adult abuse. Thus, before we have more definitive and concrete evidence that IPV in older couples should definitively come under the category of elder abuse or IPV, it is advisable to treat it under its own separate category of family violence

AB  - Purpose: To investigate the therapeutic efficacy and optimal drug dose of an intravitreally implantable voriconazole (VCZ) drug delivery system (DDS) in experimental endophthalmitis of Aspergillus fumigatus. Methods: Vitrectomy was performed in albino rabbits with intravitreal inoculation of susceptible A. fumigatus. The animals were randomized into groups of control, polylactic-co-glycolic acid implantation, VCZ injection, and intravitreal VCZ DDS containing 0.5, 0.9, and 1.2 mg of VCZ, respectively. The therapeutic effect was assessed by clinical observation, histology, and microbiology. Results: The inflammation in the VCZ injection and DDS groups was milder than the untreated and polylactic-co-glycolic acid groups (P <= 0.046). The 0.9-mg and 1.2-mg DDS groups presented milder anterior chamber and vitreous inflammation than the injection group during the first 3 weeks (P <= 0.044), but only the 1.2-mg DDS group had clearer vitreous thereafter (P <= 0.037). Smear and fungal culture showed negative results in all DDS groups. Normal histologic structure of the retina was observed in the eyes recovering from endophthalmitis. Conclusion: The therapeutic effect of intravitreal VCZ DDS on fungal endophthalmitis appears to be significantly better than intravitreal injection of VCZ. The optimal dose of VCZ in the DDS in this study was 1.2 mg. RETINA 31: 1791-1800, 2011

AB  - The relationship between abnormal HER2 expression and cancer is important in cancer therapeutics. Formation and spread of cancer cells may be restricted by inhibiting HER2. We conducted ligand-based and structure-based studies to assess the potency of natural compounds as potential HER2 inhibitors. Multiple linear regression (MLR) and support vector machine (SVM) models were constructed to predict biological activities of natural compounds, and molecular dynamics (MD) was used to assess their stability with HER2 under a dynamic environment. Predicted bioactivities of the natural compounds ranged from 6.014-9.077 using MLR (r(2) = 0.7954) and 5.122-6.950 using SVM (r(2) = 0.8620). Both models were in agreement and suggest bioactivity based on candidate structure. Conformation changes caused by MD favored the formation of stabilizing H-bonds. All candidates had higher stability than Lapinatib, which may be due to the number and spatial distribution of additional H-bonds and hydrophobic interactions. Amino acids Lys724 and Lys736 are critical for binding in HER2, and Thr798, Cys805, and Asp808 are also important for increased stability. Candidates may block the entrance to the ATP binding site located within the inner regions and prevent downstream activation of HER2. Our multidirectional approach indicates that the natural compounds have good ligand efficacy in addition to stable binding affinities to HER2, and should be potent candidates of HER2 inhibitors. With regard to drug design, designing HER2 inhibitors with carboxyl or carbonyl groups available for H-bond formation with Lys724 and Lys736, and benzene groups for hydrophobic contact with Cys805 may improve protein-ligand stability

AB  - The barrier functions of the stratum corneum and the epidermal layers present a tremendous challenge in achieving effective transdermal delivery of drug molecules. Although a few reports have shown that poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers are effective skin-penetration enhancers, little is known regarding the fundamental mechanisms behind the dendrimer-skin interactions. In this Article, we have performed a systematic study to better elucidate how dendrimers interact with skin layers depending on their size and surface groups. Franz diffusion cells and confocal microscopy were employed to observe dendrimer interactions with full-thickness porcine skin samples. We have found that smaller PAMAM dendrimers (generation 2 (G2)) penetrate the skin layers more efficiently than the larger ones (G4). We have also found that G2 PAMAM dendrimers that are surface-modified by either acetylation or carboxylation exhibit increased skin permeation and likely diffuse through an extracellular pathway. In contrast, amine-terminated dendrimers show enhanced cell internalization and skin retention but reduced skin permeation. In addition, conjugation of oleic acid to G2 dendrimers increases their 1-octanol/PBS partition coefficient, resulting in increased skin absorption and retention. Here we report that size, surface charge, and hydrophobicity directly dictate the permeation route and efficiency of dendrimer translocation across the skin layers, providing a design guideline for engineering PAMAM dendrimers as a potential transdermal delivery vector

AB  - Energetic material is a reactive substance that contains a great amount of potential energy, which is extremely sensitive to external stimuli like force. In this work, one-molecule-thick single-crystalline nanosheets of energetic material were synthesized. Very small force applied on the nanosheet proves to lead to the rotation of the tilted nitro groups, and subsequently change of current of the nanosheet. We apply this principle to design high-sensitive force sensor. A theoretical model of force-current dependence was established based on the nanosheets' molecular packing structure model that was well supported with the high resolution XPS, AFM analysis results. An ultra-low-force with range of several picoNewton to several nanoNewton can be measured by determination of corresponding current value

AB  - In this work, the interior-walls decyl-perfluorinated functionalized magnetic mesoporous microspheres (F17Fe3O4@mSiO2) were synthesized for the first time, and applied as adsorbents to extract and concentrate perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) from water samples. The fluorous functionalized interior pore-walls contributed to the high-selective preconcentration of PFCs due to fluorous affinity; and abundant silanol groups on the exterior surface of microspheres contributed to the good dispersibility in water sample. Four kinds of PFCs were selected as model analytes, including perfluorooctanoic acid, perfluorononanoic acid, perfluorododecanoic acid, and perfluorooctane sulphonate. In addition, UHPLC-ESI/MS/MS was introduced to the fast and sensitive detection of the analytes after sample pretreatment. Important parameters of the extraction procedure were optimized, including salinity, eluting solvent, the amount of F17Fe3O4@mSiO2 microspheres, and extraction time. The optimized procedure took only 10 min to extract analytes with high recoveries and merely 800-mu L acetonitrile to elute analytes from the magnetic adsorbents. Validation experiments showed good linearity (0.9940.998), precision (2.67.6%), high recovery (93.4105.7%) of the proposed method, and the limits of detection were from 0.008 to 0.125 mu g/L. The F17Fe3O4@mSiO2 magnetic microspheres have the advantages of great dispersibility in aqueous solution, high specificity of extraction, large surface area, and efficient separation ability. The results showed that the proposed method based on F17Fe3O4@mSiO2 microspheres is a simple, fast, and sensitive tool for the analysis of PFCs in water sample

AB  - This work investigated the effect of diagnostic ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) on the permeability of normal liver tissue and the safety of this technique. One hundred and four rats were divided into four groups: the control group, the microbubble-only (MB) group, the ultrasound-only (US) group, and the ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction group (UTMD). The permeabilities of capillaries and cell membranes were determined using Evans blue and lanthanum nitrate as tracers, respectively. The amount of Evans blue was approximately fourfold higher in the UTMD group than in the control, MB-only, and US-only groups (all P<0.01). Evans blue extravasation, visualized as red fluorescence, was detectable by laser confocal scanning microscopy in the parenchyma only in the UTMD group. Lanthanum nitrate-tracing transmission electron microscopy examination indicated that intracellular lanthanum was detectable in the cytoplasm only in the UTMD group. Blood chemical analysis indicated that the effect of diagnostic ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction on the rats' serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels was transient and recoverable and that this technique had no obvious effect on renal function. Cellular swelling was observed in liver cells in the UTMD group at 0.5 h, but this swelling was no longer apparent after 1 week. These results suggest that diagnostic ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction can increase the capillary and cell membrane permeabilities in normal liver tissue without a significant increase in hepatic and renal toxicity.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Physicians are challenged to effectively treat opioid dependent patients while minimizing diversion of potentially abusable medications, such as buprenorphine. The present study was designed to obtain information on steps physicians report taking to reduce diversion of buprenorphine. Method: National quarterly surveys from 2008 to 2009 of qualified physicians who have prescribed buprenorphine were analyzed (N = 2,330). One part of the survey queried physicians about what steps they had taken to reduce abuse and diversion of buprenorphine from a pre-specified list of 12 steps. Other parts of the survey included questions on the physicians' training and experience. Results: Physicians reported taking a mean of 4.4 steps. Longer experience prescribing buprenorphine, more buprenorphine-related educational training, and concern about diversion as a limitation on using buprenorphine for maintenance were associated with higher number of steps taken. Conclusions and Scientific Significance: Physicians are currently taking multiple steps to reduce diversion. Future research needs to verify if these steps are effective or are instead reducing access to treatment

AB  - Induced reprogramming of somatic cells has had a great impact on stem cell research, and the reprogramming technologies have evolved from four transgenic factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc; OSKM) to just a few microRNAs (mainly miR-290/302 seed family). Despite these advances, the molecular events occurring during various stages of reprogramming remain largely unknown. Here, we concisely review current knowledge of miRNA regulation from the initiation phase of OSKM-induced reprogramming, through the transitional stage, to final maturation. At the start of reprogramming, the microRNAs miR-21, miR-29a, let-7a, and miR-34 act as guards to secure the somatic identity and genomic integrity of the cell of origin. As reprogramming proceeds, miR-155, miR-10b, miR-205, and miR-429 modulate the epithelial-mesenchymal/mesenchymal-epithelial transition (EMT/MET), which is a critical step towards transformed pluripotent status. Finally, the pluripotency regulatory network is secured in the iPSCs and fine-tuned by a group of miRNAs belonging to the miR-290/302 seed family. Among the four reprogramming factors, c-Myc plays the dominant role in regulating the miRNAs under reprogramming-specific conditions. Accumulating evidence suggests that the reprogramming efficiency can be improved by either blocking barrier miRNAs or introducing helper miRNAs. Intriguingly, induced pluripotency can be obtained by introducing a single miR-302 cluster, although the supportive molecular mechanism is still lacking. In the near future, we may be able to realize the broad potential of miRNAs in the stem cell field, such as altering cell identities with high efficiency through the transient introduction of tissue-specific miRNAs

AB  - This study is aimed to explore the relationship between bone marrow characteristics and clinical prognosis of antithyroid drug (ATD) induced agranulocytosis. A retrospective study was conducted in the first affiliated hospital of the University of South China. A total of 33 hospitalized patients diagnosed with ATD-induced agranulocytosis were analyzed. The bone marrow characteristics were classified into two types. Type I was characterized by reduction or absence of granulocytic precursors and type 11 was recognized as hypercellular bone marrow with dysmaturity of granulocytic cells. Bone marrow of 20 cases (61%) were characterized with type I whereas 13 cases (39%) with type II. The median duration of neutrophil recovery and high-grade fever were 4.7 +/- 1.0 days and 3.6 +/- 2.5 days respectively for type II, compared to 8.0 +/- 2.8 days and 8.6 +/- 3.1 days for type I (p < 0.01 in both compared groups). However, there was no significant difference between the two types in terms of age, median duration of drug administration before the diagnosis of agranulocytosis, the amount of neutrophil count on admission and the total administration dose of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) before bone marrow examination. Two cases of type I died of complications from infection. This study showed that the bone marrow characteristics of ATD-induced agranulocytosis could be classifed into two types. Also, the clinical prognosis was closely related to the bone marrow features. Type I is the dominant type which is usually associated with worse clinical prognosis compared to type II

AB  - Background: Neurite outgrowth inhibitor-A (Nogo-A), myelin-associated glycoprotein, and oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein are three myelin-associated proteins that act as inhibitors to central nervous system regeneration. Neurite outgrowth inhibitor-A imposes the strongest effect on inhibiting axonal regeneration after traumatic brain injury. Alphatocopherol, a member of the vitamin E family, is recognized as an active antioxidative substance. Its use has not been well studied in brain injury research, especially in axonal regeneration research. Methods: We obtained 99 intact adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-250 g) from the Experimental Animal Center of Central South University. We used the modified method of Freeney to generate moderate brain injury in the rats. We injected 600 mg/kg alpha-tocopherol intraperitoneally daily as traumatic brain injury (TBI) treatment. Then, we performed behavioral tests in the corresponding time point, examined brain tissues after hematoxylin-eosin staining to identify changes in cell morphology, and performed immunohistochemical staining and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction to detect the expression of NoGo and Nogo receptor (NgR) in brain tissue. Results: For the Neurological Severity Scores of rats, there were obvious differences among the three groups at the corresponding time points. Standard hematoxylin-eosin staining showed that the brain structure of a sham-operated group of rats was clear, uniform, and compact. A TBI group exhibited hemorrhage, edema, inflammatory cell infiltration, condensed nuclei, and necrosis. We also saw glial cells and fibrous tissue proliferation. The alpha-tocopherol-treated TBI group had similar but less severe changes than the TBI group. Expression of Nogo-A and NgR increased after TBI compared with the sham-operated group. However, Nogo-A and NgR expression was significantly lower in the alpha-tocopherol-treated TBI group compared with the TBI group. Similarly, results showed that functional neurological deficits among rats in the alpha-tocopherol-treated TBI group were less pronounced than in the TBI group (model group). Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that alpha-tocopherol-treated rats had reduced microscopic evidence of brain damage. Alpha-tocopherol reduced Nogo-A and NgR expression in brain tissue after traumatic brain injury and promoted nerve regeneration. Alpha-tocopherol treatment of TBI rats had a neuroprotective role in their recovery. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved

AB  - The study of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with curved surfaces, also known as buckybowls or fullerene fragments, represent an area which is under intense investigation by organic chemists and material scientists. This dissertation describes research that contributes to this field. The availability of multi-gram quantities of the smallest buckybowl, corannulene, has led to the synthesis of several larger systems with buckybowl subunits. Cyclotrimerization of corannulyne using palladium(0) as the catalyst is described. The resulting product, C60 H24 , is a highly nonplanar hydrocarbon with very interesting conformational dynamics. The X-ray crystallography of the cyclotrimer confirms the "twist" conformation with C1 symmetry. The cyclotrimer also shows three distinct corannulene bowls with very different inversion barriers as confirmed by both experiment and calculations. The bowl to bowl inversion of the corannulene bowl with the lowest inversion barrier results in pseudorotation of the cyclotrimer, which gives rise to a symmetrized 1 H NMR spectrum exhibiting 12 distinct proton signals. 1 H NMR line shape analysis gives an estimation of the inversion barrier at 8.5 - 8.6 kcal/mol. The tetrameric hydrocarbon C80 H32 was synthesized through the Diels-Alder reaction of the cyclotrimer and 1,2-didehydrocorannulene. The six membered rings adjacent to the central ring in the cyclotrimer are activated enough to react with another corannulyne. The tetramer exhibits different conformational and optical absorption properties when compared to the cyclotrimer. The tetramer (C 80 H32 ), which is highly nonplanar and sterically congested, represents the largest fully characterized oligomer of corannulyne reported to date. This is also the first reported example of a cycloaddition reaction in which a corannulene subunit acts as a diene. A tripodal molecular receptor (C87 H54 O6 ) with three corannulene pincers and a cyclotriveratrylene tether was synthesized. The molecular receptor was evaluated by 1 H NMR titration in toluene-d8 for its ability to bind fullerenes. The experiment demonstrates the formation of 1:1 inclusion complexes of the molecular receptor with fullerenes and provides the association constants of 1500 -� 50 and 1180 -� 30 M-1 for C60 and C70 , respectively

AB  - Sifuvirtide (SFT) is an electrostatically constrained alpha-helical peptide fusion inhibitor showing potent anti-HIV activity, good safety, and pharmacokinetic profiles, and it is currently under phase II clinical trials in China. In this study, we demonstrate its potent and broad anti-HIV activity by using diverse HIV-1 subtypes and variants, including subtypes A, B, and C that dominate the AIDS epidemic worldwide, and subtypes B', CRF07_BC, and CRF01_AE recombinants that are currently circulating in China, and those possessing cross-resistance to the first and second generation fusion inhibitors. To elucidate its mechanism of action, we determined the crystal structure of SFT in complex with its target N-terminal heptad repeat region (NHR) peptide (N36), which fully supports our rational inhibitor design and reveals its key motifs and residues responsible for the stability and anti-HIV activity. As anticipated, SFT adopts fully helical conformation stabilized by the multiple engineered salt bridges. The designing of SFT also provide novel inter-helical salt bridges and hydrogen bonds that improve the affinity of SFT to NHR trimer. The extra serine residue and acetyl group stabilize alpha-helicity of the N-terminal portion of SFT, whereas Thr-119 serves to stabilize the hydrophobic NHR pocket. In addition, our structure demonstrates that the residues critical for drug resistance, located at positions 37, 38, 41, and 43 of NHR, are irreplaceable for maintaining the stable fusogenic six-helix bundle structure. Our data present important information for developing SFT for clinical use and for designing novel HIV fusion inhibitors

AB  - Cytomegalovirus infection is often life threatening in immunocompromised patients. Three anti-CMV drugs, ganciclovir, valganciclovir and foscarnet are available in commercial basis in Japan. In addition to them, cidofovir is provided for patients with HIV by a research group supported by Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. Every anti-CMV drug has serious side effects, as bone marrow suppression with ganciclovir and valganciclovir, renal toxicity with foscarnet and both with cidofovir. Strict dose adjustment to the renal function and close monitoring with laboratory examinations are essential when using those drugs

AB  - The goals of this study were to (a) examine the phenomenology and developmental correlates of problematic Internet use (PIU) in a large and diverse college student sample; (b) evaluate a developmental process model of PIU in which the expected association between child maltreatment and PIU would be explained by alexithymia; and (c) explore these relations as a function of gender and race. PIU was assessed in a sample of 1,470 college students (62.9 percent female, 37.1 percent male; M-age = 19.13 years [SD = 1.49]; 46.1 percent Asian, 28.2 percent Hispanic, 16.3 percent White, 5.9 percent Black, and 3.5 percent Multiracial/Other) who participated in a larger study of young adult adaptation, which included measures of child maltreatment, alexithymia, self-concept, social support, and psychopathology. Males and Asian students endorsed higher levels of PIU than females and other ethnoracial groups, respectively. PIU was related to contemporaneous maladaptation in the form of decreased self-concept, lower social support, and increased psychopathology across groups. Experiences of child maltreatment were related to increased PIU, and mediation analyses showed that this relation was partially explained by alexithymia. These relations were comparable across males and females and between Asian and non-Asian respondents. The analyses provide evidence for the significant role of child maltreatment and the cognitive-affective deficits it precipitates in understanding pathways toward PIU in young adulthood. Our findings suggest that maltreated youth are at disproportionate risk for PIU, and their capacities to regulate and process emotion are important targets for prevention and therapeutic intervention

AB  - Background: The choice of appropriate artemisinin-based combination therapy depends on several factors (cost, efficacy, safety, reinfection rate and simplicity of administration). To assess whether the combination dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) could be an alternative to artemether-lumefantrine (AL), the efficacy and the tolerability of the two products for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in sub-Saharan Africa have been compared. Methods: A multicentric open randomized controlled clinical trial of three-day treatment of DP against AL for the treatment of two parallel groups of patients aged two years and above and suffering from uncomplicated falciparum malaria was carried out in Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire and Senegal. Within each group, patients were randomly assigned supervised treatment. DP was given once a day for three days and AL twice a day for three days. Follow-up visits were performed on day 1 to 4 and on day 7, 14, 21, 28 to evaluate clinical and parasitological results. The primary endpoint was the recovery rate by day 28. Results: Of 384 patients enrolled, 197 were assigned DP and 187 AL. The recovery rates adjusted by genotyping, 99.5% in the DP group and 98.9% in the AL group, were not statistically different (p = 0.538). No Early Therapeutic Failure (ETF) was observed. At day 28, two patients in the DP group and five in AL group had recurrent parasitaemia with Plasmodium falciparum. In the DP group, after PCR genotyping, one of the two recurrences was classified as a new infection and the other as recrudescence. In AL group, two recurrences were classified after correction by PCR as recrudescence. All cases of recrudescence were classified as Late Parasitological Failure (LPF). In each group, a rapid recovery from fever and parasitaemia was noticed. More than 90% of patients did no longer present fever or parasitaemia 48 hours after treatment. Both drugs were well tolerated. Indeed, no serious adverse events were reported during the follow-up period. Most of the adverse events which developed were moderate and did not result in the treatment being stopped in either treatment group. Conclusions: Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine was as effective and well-tolerated as artemether-lumefantrine in the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria. In addition, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, a single daily dose, could be an advantage over artemether-lumefantrine in Africa because of better treatment observance

AB  - Accurate rates of herpes zoster incidence and complication have become of greater interest as studies have suggested an increasing temporal trend in incidence rates across all age groups and long-term follow-up studies of vaccine effectiveness are required by the Food and Drug Administration. This study compares the results obtained from the most commonly used method to obtain herpes zoster data (rates obtained from administrative data) with results obtained when administrative data are supplemented by medical record review. Administrative billing code data identified 1,959 cases of herpes zoster in Olmsted County, Minnesota, adults between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 2001. Of those 1,959 cases, 1,669 (85.2%) could be confirmed by medical record review, a decrease in incidence rate of 14.8%, resulting in a decrease of 0.61/1,000 person-years when adjusted to the US adult population. Complication rates were also significantly different between the 2 methods. It is not clear if the 15% decrease in incidence rates would be seen in every administrative data set or if the lack of confirmation of cases may be variable in both validity and reproducibility between data sets, making estimations in temporal trends and pre/post-vaccine rates difficult to compare across data resources

AB  - Drugs sharing similar therapeutic function may not bind to the same group of targets. However, their targets may be involved in similar pathway profiles which are associated with certain pathological process. In this study, pathway fingerprint was introduced to indicate the profile of significant pathways being influenced by the targets of drugs. Then drug-drug network was further constructed based on significant similarity of pathway fingerprints. In this way, the functions of a drug may be hinted by the enriched therapeutic functions of its neighboring drugs. In the test of 911 FDA approved drugs with more than one known target, 471 drugs could be connected into networks. 760 significant associations of drug-therapeutic function were generated, among which around 60% of them were supported by scientific literatures or ATC codes of drug functional classification. Therefore, pathway fingerprints may be useful to further study on the potential function of known drugs, or the unknown function of new drugs

AB  - The use of flunixin meglumine (FM), a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug, during experimentally induced Escherichia coli, mastitis was evaluated. Twenty-four primiparous and multiparous lactating dairy cows were challenged with 1 x 10(2) cfu of E. coli 727 in 1 uninfected quarter. Of the 24 E. coli-challenged animals, 12 were administered FM [ECF; 100 mg (2 cc)/45.5 kg of body weight) at the onset of clinical mastitis signs. The remaining 12 challenged cows were untreated (EC). An additional 11 cows were infused with 1 mL of sterile phosphate-buffered saline and served as the nonchallenged control (CTL) group. Activity measures, dry matter intake (DMI), milk production, milk bacterial counts from challenged mammary glands, and somatic cell score (SCS) were collected on all animals. Activity measurements were collected using both a behavior-monitoring system and data loggers. Activity was summarized by day (behavior-monitoring system) and in 3-h time periods (data loggers). An examination of animal activity indicated that EC and ECF cows stood more and lay less as compared with the CTL animals in the first 6 h after FM administration. When DMI was analyzed, CTL and ECF animals had greater DMI than the EC animals on d 1 postchallenge. However, by d 2 postchallenge, DMI for ECF and EC cows was significantly less than for the CTL cows. The ECF cows had greater milk yield than did EC animals by d 3 and 4 postchallenge, and no significant difference in yield was observed between the ECF and CTL animals. No differences in SCS were observed between the parity groups. Yet, bacterial counts in milk were greater in multiparous animals compared with the primiparous cows. Therefore, it can be concluded that E. coli mastitis does alter animal activity and may have a negative effect on animal well-being. However, the improvement in DMI and milk production for ECF animals provides evidence for using a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug as supportive therapy in alleviating the adverse effects associated with E. coli mastitis

AB  - Objective CXCL10 (also known as interferon-?inducible 10-kd protein [IP-10]) is a chemokine that potentially plays a role in the immunopathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We undertook this phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MDX-1100, a fully human, anti-CXCL10 (antiIP-10) monoclonal antibody, in RA patients whose disease responded inadequately to methotrexate (MTX). Methods Patients with active RA receiving stable doses of MTX (1025 mg weekly) were randomized to receive intravenous doses of 10 mg/kg MDX-1100 (n = 35) or placebo (n = 35) every other week. The primary end point was the proportion of patients meeting the American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement criteria (achieving an ACR20 response) on day 85, and patients were followed up for safety to day 141. Results The ACR20 response rate was significantly higher among MDX-1100treated patients than among placebo-treated patients (54% versus 17%; P = 0.0024). Statistically significant differences in the ACR20 response rate between treatments were observed starting on day 43 (P < 0.05). The ACR50 and ACR70 response rates on day 85 did not differ between the groups. Overall, 51.4% of MDX-1100treated patients and 30.3% of placebo-treated patients experienced at least 1 adverse event (AE). No study drugrelated serious AEs were reported. Conclusion MDX-1100 was well tolerated and demonstrated clinical efficacy in RA patients whose disease responded inadequately to MTX. This is the first study to demonstrate clinical efficacy of a chemokine inhibitor in RA and supports the notion of a potential role of IP-10 in the immunopathogenesis of RA

AB  - Naltrexone is of proven efficacy as a treatment modality in the relapse preventive programme of opiate abusers. It complements the other interventions such as individual counselling, family therapy and self-help groups. The initiation of naltrexone therapy after detoxification would be of vital importance in maintaining an individual's drug-free state. Naltrexone has no intrinsic opiate activity and has no resale value in the black market unlike methadone

AB  - Flavodoxin (Fld) is a bacterial electron-transfer protein that possesses flavin mononucleotide as a prosthetic group. In the genomes of the Pseudomonas species, the mioC gene is the sole gene, annotated Fld, but its function remains unclear. In this study, phenotype microarray analysis was performed using the wild-type and mioC mutant of pathogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. Our results showed that the mioC mutant is very resistant to oxidative stress. Different antibiotics and metals worked differently on the sensitivity of the mutant. Other pleiotropic effects of mutation in the mioC gene, such as biofilm formation, aggregation ability, motility and colony morphology, were observed under iron stress conditions. Most of the phenotypic and physiological changes could be recovered in the wild type by complementation. Mutation of the mioC gene also influenced the production of pigments. The mioC mutant and mioC over-expressed complementation cells, over-produced pyocyanin and pyoverdine, respectively. Various secreted chemicals were also changed in the mutant, which was confirmed by 1H NMR analysis. Interestingly, physiological alterations of the mutant strain were restored by the cell-free supernatant of the wild type. The present study demonstrates that the mioC gene plays an important role in the physiology of P.aeruginosa and might be considered as a suitable drug target candidate in pathogenic P.aeruginosa

AB  - Ricin is a toxin that is naturally produced by the seeds of the castor bean plant Ricinus communis , and is part of a family of A-B toxins that includes Shiga, cholera, and anthrax toxins. The toxin consists of two subunits, RTA and RTB, which are linked by a disulfide bond. RTA is an RNA N-glycosidase that selectively targets and inactivates 28S ribosomal RNA, thereby arresting protein synthesis and leading to cell death. RTB is a galactose/ N-acetylgalactosamine-specific lectin that mediates attachment, entry, and intracellular trafficking of ricin in host cells. Currently, there is no approved vaccine or therapeutics available against this Category B select agent and the details of toxin neutralization by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are still elusive. In an effort to identify which regions on RTB are responsible for eliciting protective immunity to ricin, I generated and characterized a collection of RTB-specific murine mAbs. These mAbs were characterized based on their affinity for ricin and ability to neutralize ricin both in vitro and in vivo . I then identified their target epitope on RTB. I determined that the majority of RTB-specific mAbs are non-neutralizing and target the internal sub-domains 1+�, 1+�, 2+� and 2+� of RTB. In contrast, neutralizing mAbs are relatively rare (<1% of total RTB-specific mAbs) and target the galactose binding sub-domains 1+� and 2+�. These results suggest that there are a limited number of neutralizing epitopes present on RTB. Furthermore, investigation of RTB-mAb interactions in vitro revealed that there are two classes of neutralizing RTB-specific mAbs; (i) ones that block ricin attachment to cell surface receptors (i.e mAb SylH3), and a novel class (ii) that neutralizes ricin intracellularly, but does not block attachment (i.e. mAb 24B11). I determined that 24B11 neutralized ricin intracellularly, by interfering with retrograde transport of ricin to the TGN. Finally, I investigated the mechanisms of ricin neutralization by mAbs in vivo , demonstrating that Fab fragments from SylH3 and 24B11 were sufficient to protect mice against a lethal systemic ricin challenge. These results suggest that neutralization of ricin in vivo , occurs independently of Fc Receptor-mediated clearance

AB  - Subsyndromal symptomatic depression (SSD) is a subtype of subthreshold depressive and also lead to significant psychosocial functional impairment as same as major depressive disorder (MDD). Several studies have suggested that SSD is a transitory phenomena in the depression spectrum and is thus considered a subtype of depression. However, the pathophysioloy of depression remain largely obscure and studies on SSD are limited. The present study compared the expression profile and made the classification with the leukocytes by using whole-genome cRNA microarrays among drug-free first-episode subjects with SSD, MDD, and matched controls (8 subjects in each group). Support vector machines (SVMs) were utilized for training and testing on candidate signature expression profiles from signature selection step. Firstly, we identified 63 differentially expressed SSD signatures in contrast to control (P < = 5.0E-4) and 30 differentially expressed MDD signatures in contrast to control, respectively. Then, 123 gene signatures were identified with significantly differential expression level between SSD and MDD. Secondly, in order to conduct priority selection for biomarkers for SSD and MDD together, we selected top gene signatures from each group of pair-wise comparison results, and merged the signatures together to generate better profiles used for clearly classify SSD and MDD sets in the same time. In details, we tried different combination of signatures from the three pair-wise compartmental results and finally determined 48 gene expression signatures with 100% accuracy. Our finding suggested that SSD and MDD did not exhibit the same expressed genome signature with peripheral blood leukocyte, and blood cell�_"derived RNA of these 48 gene models may have significant value for performing diagnostic functions and classifying SSD, MDD, and healthy controls.

AB  - Depression may relate to neurocognitive impairment that results from alteration of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) levels. Venlafaxine and escitalopram are two drugs commonly used to treat depression. The drugs may affect expression of NMDARs, which mediate learning and memory formation. The aim of the study was to examine whether the effects of venlafaxine and escitalopram treatments are associated with NMDARs in a rat model of depression. Forty male Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into four groups (n = 10) as follows: control group, chronic mild stress group (CMS), venlafaxine (20 mg/kg body weight per day) + CMS, and escitalopram (10 mg/kg body weight per day) + CMS. After induction of depression, a decrease in the concentration of NR2B was observed; venlafaxine treatment prevented the reduction of NR2B expression. Escitalopram treatment did not effect the reduced levels of NR2B resulting from depression. There was no significant difference in NR2A concentration among groups. The present data support the notion that venlafaxine plays a role in maintaining NR2B receptor in experimental depression. It may be possible that treatment with escitalopram has no effect on NMDARs in experimental depression

AB  - Our aim is to investigate the follicular fluid concentrations of antimullerian hormone and its effect on assisted reproductive technology (ART) outcome in non-obese, non-hyperandrogenemic polycystic ovary syndrome patients. Subjects were categorized according to in vitro fertilization (IVF) indications: Group 1 PCOS (n:16), Group 2 male factor infertility (n: 19) and Group 3 unexplained infertiliy patients (n: 19). Follicular fluid antimullerian hormone levels (FF AMH) on the day of oocyte retrieval were analysed and ART outcome was studied. FF AMH levels in group 1, 2 and 3 were 35.70 ng/ml (median); 17.90 ng/ml (median); 17.90 ng/ml (median), respectively (p=0.18). There were correlations between the FF AMH levels and follicle, oocyte, 2PN and embryo numbers in pathophysiology of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients (p=0.012; 0.024; 0.027; 0.013 respectively). There were no correlations between the FF AMHand ART outcome parameters in group 2 and 3. FF AMH levels were not different between the groups who were pregnant or not (p=0.06). In conclusion there were no significant differences in terms of FF AMH levels in the three groups. FF AMH levels can predict the recovery of oocytes but not oocyte quality, embryo quality or pregnancy in non-obese non-hyperandrogenemic PCOS patient

AB  - Background Adrenal crisis is a life threatening condition which can be induced by stress during surgery in patients with adrenal insufficiency. This may be prevented by perioperative administration of high doses of steroids. There is disagreement on whether supplemental perioperative steroids are required and, when administered, on the amount and frequency of doses. The review was originally published in 2009 and was updated in 2012. Objectives To assess whether it is necessary to administer supplemental perioperative steroids in adult patients on maintenance doses of glucocorticoids because of adrenal insufficiency. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 2); MEDLINE (1966 to February 2012); EMBASE (1980 to February 2012); LILACS (1982 to May 2012); and the databases of ongoing trials. We handsearched the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (1982 to 2008), Clinical Endocrinology (1972 to 2008), Surgery (1948 to 1994), Annals of Surgery (1948 to 1994), and Anaesthesia (1948 to 2001). The original search was performed in January 2009. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials that compared the use of supplemental perioperative steroids to placebo in adult patients on maintenance doses of steroids and who required surgery. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for missing information. We used mean differences and standard deviations to summarize the data for each group. Main results Two trials involving 37 patients were included. These studies reported that supplemental perioperative steroids were not required during surgery for patients with adrenal insufficiency. Neither study reported any adverse effects or complications in the intervention and control groups. Both studies were graded as having a high risk of bias. Authors' conclusions Owing to the small number of patients, the results may not be representative. Based on current available evidence, we are unable to support or refute the use of supplemental perioperative steroids for patients with adrenal insufficiency during surgery

AB  - Objective 1) To investigate the relationship between NrCAM polymorphisms and methamphetamine abuse in an ethnically homogenous Korean population. 2) To further support our findings by investigating the association among NrCAM gene variants, certain personality traits, and addictive symptoms of methamphetamine abusers. Methods Thirty-seven male methamphetamine abusers (age=43.3 +/- 7.8) and 30 non-users (16 men, 14 women; age=59.8 +/- 10.4) were recruited. Ten single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the NrCAM gene were assayed to compare genotype distributions between the 2 groups. Personality characteristics were measured using the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) and the NEO Personality Inventory, Revised (NE0 PI-R). Addictive symptoms were assessed using the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies (DIGS) and reviews of the subject's medical records. Results Among the 10 SNPs in the NrCAM gene, the frequency of the TA genotype at rs1990162 was significantly lower in methamphetamine abusers compared to non-users (p=0.042). In the 3 NrCAM gene SNPs (rs381318, rs2072546, and rs6954366), the distribution of genotypes and alleles were significantly associated with some traits in the TCI and NEO PI-R. Genotypes and alleles at 5 gene SNPs (rs2142325, rs381318, rs1269621, rs1269634, and rs1990162) were associated with certain addictive symptom dimensions in the patients. Conclusion These findings support the idea that NrCAM is associated with genetic susceptibility of methamphetamine abuse and is also associated with certain personality characteristics that may increase disturbed addictive behavior.

AB  - Background. Rifampin (RFP) is a first-line antituberculosis drug, but it increases the risk of acute rejection (AR) in transplant recipients. This study evaluated whether quinolone (QNL) can replace RFP in renal transplant recipients with tuberculosis. Methods. One hundred nine patients with active tuberculosis were included. Patients consisted of RFP (n = 91) and QNL (n = 18) groups based on the initial treatment regimen. Patients with RFP-associated adverse effects were subdivided into RFP-maintenance (RFP-M; n = 18) and QNL-conversion (QNL-C; n = 8) groups. Clinical outcomes were compared between groups. Results. The incidence of AR was higher in the RFP group than in the QNL group (24.2% vs 5.6%). The QNL group showed significantly higher 10-year graft survival rates than the RFP group (88.1% vs 66.5%; P = .022). The QNL-C group showed significantly higher 10-year graft survival rates than the RFP-M group (87.5% vs 27.8%; P = .011). The rate of complete functional recovery after AR was higher in the QNL-C group than in the RFP-M group (50% vs 22.2%). Conclusions. A QNL-based regimen may be safe and effective for treatment of tuberculosis and may lower the risk of graft failure in renal transplant recipients

AB  - Object. It has been demonstrated that an extensive resection (total or subtotal) may significantly increase the overall survival in patients with WHO Grade II gliomas (low-grade gliomas [LGGs]). Yet, recent data have shown that conventional MR imaging underestimates the spatial extent of LGG, since tumor cells were found up to 20 mm around MR imaging abnormalities. Thus, it was hypothesized that an extended resection with a margin beyond MR imaging defined abnormalities-a "supratotal" resection-might improve the outcome of LGG. However, because of the frequent location of LGG within "eloquent" brain areas, it is often difficult to achieve such a supratotal resection. This could nevertheless be possible when LGGs involve "noneloquent" areas, even in the left dominant hemisphere. The authors report on their use of awake electrical mapping to tailor the resection according to functional boundaries, that is, to pursue the resection beyond MR imaging-defined abnormalities, until corticosubcortical eloquent structures are encountered. Their aim was to apply this reliable surgical technique to LGGs located not within eloquent areas but distant from eloquent areas, to take a margin around the LOG visible on MR imaging while preserving brain function. Methods. Fifteen right-handed patients with a total of 17 tumors underwent resection of WHO Grade II gliomas involving nonfunctional areas within the left dominant hemisphere. In all patients, seizures were the initial manifestation of the tumors. Awake surgery with intraoperative electrostimulation was performed in all cases. The resection was continued until the surgeon reached cortical and subcortical areas crucial for brain function, especially language, as defined by the intrasurgical electrical mapping. The extent of resection was evaluated on postoperative FLAIR-weighted MR images. Results. Despite transient neurological worsening in 60% of cases, all patients recovered and returned to a normal life. Seizure control was obtained in all patients with a decrease of antiepileptic drug therapy. Postoperative MR imaging showed that total resection was achieved in all 17 tumors and supratotal resection in 15. The average volume of the postoperative cavity (36.8 cm(3)) was significantly larger than the mean preoperative tumor volume (26.6 cm3) (p = 0.009). Neuropathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of WHO Grade II glioma in all cases. The mean duration of postoperative follow-up was 35.7 months (range 6-135 months). Only 4 of 15 patients experienced recurrence (without anaplastic transformation); the average time to recurrence in these cases was 38 months; radiotherapy was performed 6 years after the relapse in 1 case; no other patients received any adjuvant treatment. This series was compared with a control group of 29 patients who had "only" complete resection: anaplastic transformation was observed in 7 cases in the control group but not in any case in the series of patients who underwent supracomplete resection (p = 0.037). Furthermore, adjuvant treatment was administered in 10 patients in the control group compared with I patient who underwent supracomplete resection (p = 0.043). Conclusions. These findings support the usefulness of awake surgery with intraoperative functional (language) mapping with the attempt to perform supratotal resection of LGGs involving noneloquent areas in the left hemisphere. Indeed, the extent of resection was significantly increased in all cases but 2, with no additional permanent deficit and with control of seizures in all patients. The goal of supracomplete resection is currently to delay the anaplastic transformation, even if it does not (yet) enable a cure. (DOI: 10.3171/2011.3.JNS101333)

AB  - Recently, recycling of rare metals has been of great interest because of the rapid growth in their demands and maldistribution of the natural resources. Substance flow analysis (SFA) is a useful tool to figure out the flow of substance in specific regions. However, few SEA has so far been conducted for rare metals. In this paper, we focused on indium and conducted SFA of indium in Japan and global scale. The most of indium is used as Indium Tin Oxide (ITO). The end use of ITO was categorized into 2 groups; Liquid Crystal Display modules and Plasma Display Panel modules, which were further assembled to final end use products. Quantified was the flow of indium during its lifecycle; mining and smelting, manufacturing, use and waste management. In mining and smelting, the data about the indium content in ore and production of primary metal of indium during 1999-2008 were collected. In manufacturing, we estimated the content of indium of final end use products, and estimated the input of indium for producing ITO in Japan. Then, we extrapolated the results to SFA in global scale. In use stock and discard of indium were estimated by dynamic SFA, in which the time series data about the input of indium in final end use products and their lifetime distribution were used. In this study, we estimated the loss of indium in each process as recovery potential. It was found that the extraction rate of indium in mining and smelting process was 8-11%, and the loss of indium in the process was 4,826 t in 2004. The amount of loss in manufacturing process was 310 t, in use stock of indium was 115 t, and the discarded indium in end of life products was 5 t in global scale in 2004. Therefore, it was concluded the biggest recovery potential of indium was in mining and smelting

AB  - We assayed the effects of a variety of antiprotozoal compounds against trophonts of Cryptocaryon irritans, the causative agent of 'white spot disease of marine fish' in vitro using the double layered media that we developed previously for the culture of the parasite. In the assay, ionophores, particularly sodium salinomycin, showed apparent killing and growth-suppression effects against the parasite. As there was no mortality in Japanese flounder Paralychthys olivaceus that were fed a diet containing sodium salinomycin (200 ppm) for two weeks, we evaluated the efficacy of 200 ppm sodium salinomycin against C irritans in Japanese flounder. We fed Japanese flounders a medicated diet for 5 d prior to and 3 d after challenge with C irritans. In the experimental group, the number of protomonts recovered from the fish and the size of tomonts that were transformed from the protomonts were significantly reduced, when compared to the control group. Furthermore, in a different experiment, the fish that were fed a diet medicated with sodium salinomycin survived longer than those fed an unmedicated diet after challenge. Sodium salinomycin can be a good candidate drug for chemotherapy and control of Cryptocaron irritans infection. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved

AB  - Background Treatments that confer survival benefit are needed in patients with heavily pretreated metastatic colorectal cancer. The aim of this trial was to investigate the efficacy and safety of TAS-102-a novel oral nucleoside antitumour agent. Methods Between August 25, 2009, and April 12, 2010, we undertook a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial in Japan. Eligible patients were 20 years or older; had confirmed colorectal adenocarcinoma; had a treatment history of two or more regimens of standard chemotherapy; and were refractory or intolerant to fluoropyrimidine, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin. Patients had to be able to take oral drugs; have measurable lesions; have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of between 0 and 2; and have adequate bone-marrow, hepatic, and renal functions within 7 days of enrolment. Patients were randomly assigned (2: 1) to either TAS-102 (35 mg/m(2) given orally twice a day in a 28-day cycle [2-week cycle of 5 days of treatment followed by a 2-day rest period, and then a 14-day rest period]) or placebo; all patients received best supportive care. Randomisation was done with minimisation methods, with performance status as the allocation factor. The randomisation sequence was generated with a validated computer system by an independent team from the trial sponsor. Investigators, patients, data analysts, and the trial sponsor were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. Safety analyses were done in the per-protocol population. The study is in progress and is registered with Japan Pharmaceutical Information Center, number JapicCTI-090880. Findings 112 patients allocated to TAS-102 and 57 allocated to placebo made up the intention-to-treat population. Median follow-up was 11.3 months (IQR 10.7-14.0). Median overall survival was 9.0 months (95% CI 7.3-11.3) in the TAS-102 group and 6.6 months (4.9-8.0) in the placebo group (hazard ratio for death 0.56, 80% CI 0.44-0.71, 95% CI 0.39-0.81; p=0.0011). 57 (50%) of 113 patients given TAS-102 in the safety population had neutropenia of grade 3 or 4, 32 (28%) leucopenia, and 19 (17%) anaemia. No patient given placebo had grade 3 or worse neutropenia or leucopenia; three (5%) of 57 had grade 3 or worse anaemia. Serious adverse events occurred in 21 (19%) patients in the TAS-102 group and in five (9%) in the placebo group. No treatment-related deaths occurred. Interpretation TAS-102 has promising efficacy and a manageable safety profile in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who are refractory or intolerant to standard chemotherapies

AB  - The purpose of this thesis project is to present the importance of developing four specific core competencies in the area of pastoral counseling. It is problematic that most pastors have received minimal or no training in counseling resulting in inadequate therapy when parishioners seek pastoral counseling during times of crisis. The material presented in this thesis project enables pastoral care givers to become proficient counselors through a series of learning objectives, best practices, critical tasks, and accomplished practices directed toward improving counseling competencies in the area of personal, marriage, and family counseling. Additionally, this project addresses the problem of pornography, and proposes a blueprint to be implemented in developing a church program that would assist men in overcoming addictions to pornography

AB  - The fascinating conundrum that some individuals who are exposed to HIV in ways that would make viral transmission highly likely, yet are able to remain uninfected, has been appreciated for many years. As early as the late 1980s, reports of such individuals began appearing in the HIV/AIDS literature. Despite the critical importance of understanding possible mechanisms of natural HIV resistance for developing effective prevention strategies, numerous obstacles have prevented this essential area of scientific exploration from moving forward. The Workshop held on July 8-9, 2010 and supported by the Office of AIDS Research (OAR), the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) at the NIH hosted 200 participants and utilized the expertise of 42 AIDS researchers as invited speakers, session chairs, and discussion leaders for presentations and breakout sessions in an attempt to remove some of those obstacles. Accomplishments of the participants included developing a consensus for a new general term for the field, HIV-exposed seronegative (HESN), while recognizing the necessity to identify and utilize secondary descriptive criteria such as exposure level, risk group, duration of seronegativity, or natural resistance. Three key questions for future research were also identified by the group: (1) What is different in HESN versus those who get infected? (2) What is the immune response in HESN and is it just a marker of exposure or a correlate of protection? (3) What are the HESN host factors that help HESN resist infection? This report briefly summarizes the presentations, and describes future directions for addressing these questions and challenges

AB  - My dissertation reappraises the Puritan conversion narrative's influence on early and later American literature. It centers around the accounts recorded by the Reverend Thomas Shepard, minister to Cambridge's first church, and looks at how New England's earliest settlers represented their spiritual encounters. My study argues for Puritanism's continued cultural relevance by explaining how the inter-personal, social, and expressive energies that informed Puritan spiritual confession is both sustained and evolves in the 17 th , 18th , 19th , and 20th centuries. Chapter I accounts for the social, historical, and intellectual contexts in which the Puritan conversion narrative took place and outlines the scholarship it has received. Amid this scholarship I offer my analysis in Chapter II, pointing to the performance's formal, doctrinal, and expressive requirements to explain how believers delivered successful narratives and how they pushed the bounds of the religious doctrine that informed their accounts. Chapter III re-imagines the experience of Puritan conversion. It considers the performance from an affective framework and argues that the ambivalence endemic to spiritual assurance provoked in believers a psychogenic and narratological discord that promoted a form of self-understanding in which believers were unsure of themselves even as their spiritual communities were certain that their conversions were complete. Chapter III concludes by assessing the literary consequences of this relationship with reference to Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography as I look ahead to the conversion narrative's development in the 18th century, especially in writing. In Chapter IV, I reflect on the conversion narrative's role in the Great Awakening. I focus on two 18th century black Atlantic autobiographers, James Albert Gronniosaw and John Marrant, whose spiritual narratives give evidence of the Puritan conversion narrative's formal and ideological continuity. Chapter V considers how Puritan confession can be read against two canonical works of 19 th century American fiction: Washington's Irving's "Rip Van Winkle" and Herman Melville's Moby-Dick. Finally, Chapter VI theorizes how Puritan spirituality has come to shape contemporary American culture by reading the tenets, sentiment, and religious and expressive practices first initiated in Shepard's Cambridge against the ideology informing Alcoholics Anonymous' 12-Step program

AB  - Stroke results in damages to many biochemical, molecular and behavioral deficits. Present study provides evidence of the protective efficacy of a Unani herbal medicine, Majun Khadar (MK), against cerebral ischemia-induced behavioral dysfunctions and neurochemical alterations in the hippocampus (HIP). Transient focal cerebral ischemia was induced for 2 h followed by reperfusion for 22 h in a rat model. Rats were divided into four groups: sham, middle cerebral artery occluded (MCAO), drug sham (MK; 0.816 g kg(-1) orally for 15 days) and MK pre-treated ischemic group (MK + MCAO). Levels of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants were estimated in HIP along with behavioral testing. MK pre-treatment significantly (P < .05-.001) restored the activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and decreased the level of lipid peroxidation (LPO) and H(2)O(2) content in HIP in the MK + MCAO group which were severely altered in the MCAO group. The content of glutathione (GSH), total thiols (TT) and ascorbic acid (AsA) was significantly depleted in the MCAO group; pretreatment with MK was able to restore its levels. Also in the MK + MCAO group, significant (P < .5-.001) recovery in behavioral testing by rota rod and open-field activities was seen as compared with the MCAO group. MK alone did not show any change neither in the status of various antioxidants nor behavioral functions over sham values. Although detailed studies are required for the evaluation of exact neuroprotective mechanism of MK against cerebral ischemia these preliminary experimental findings conclude that MK exhibits neuroprotective effect in cerebral ischemia by potentiating the antioxidant defense system of the brain

AB  - Novel injectable biodegradable glycol chitosan hydrogels were developed based on thiolated glycol chitosan (GC-SH) and water soluble oligo(acryloyl carbonate)-b-poly(ethylene glycol)-b-oligo(acryloyl carbonate) (OAC-PEG-OAC) triblock copolymers via Michael-type addition reaction. The rheology measurements showed that robust hydrogels were formed rapidly upon mixing aqueous solutions of GC-SH and OAC-PEG-OAC at remarkably low total polymer concentrations of 1.5-4.5 wt % under physiological conditions. The gelation times (varying from 10 s to 17 min) and storage moduli (100 to 4300 Pa) of hydrogels could be controlled by degrees of substitution (DS) of GC-SH, solution pH, and polymer concentration. These glycol chitosan hydrogels had microporous structures, low swelling and slow hydrolytic degradation (stable for over 6 months) under physiological conditions. Notably, these hydrogels were prone to enzymatic degradation with lysozyme. The multiple acryloyl functional groups of OAC-PEG-OAC allowed facile conjugation with thiol-containing biomolecules prior to gelation endowing hydrogels with specific bioactivity. The preliminary cell culture studies revealed that these glycol chitosan hydrogels were cell non-adhesive while Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Cys (GRGDC) peptide modified hydrogels could well support adhesion and growth of both MG63 osteoblast and L929 fibroblast cells. These rapidly in situ forming enzymatically biodegradable hybrid hydrogels have great potentials in the development of injectable cell-specific bioactive extracellular matrices for tissue engineering.

AB  - Objective: To examine the effect of a Chinese medicinal herbal formula (Feitai Capsule, (sic) on the quality of life (QOL) and progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods: Sixty-two patients were randomly divided into the treatment group (31 cases) and the control group (31 cases). For the treatment group, 4 capsules (1.2 g/capsule) of Feitai Capsule were administered 3 times a day after meals for 3 weeks; then no drug was administered for 1 week. This schedule was continued for at least 3 more cycles (12 weeks totally). If there were no obvious toxic reactions, the treatment was extended. The patients were evaluated at least once every 8 weeks until progressive disease (PD). For the control group, the regular follow-up and evaluation were performed at least once every 8 weeks until PD. Clinical symptoms, objective response, physical constitution and energy, QOL, and PFS were evaluated regularly. Analysis of variance (ANOVA), a non-parametric test, and analysis of covariance were used to compare clinical features, amelioration of clinical symptoms, physical constitution and energy, and QOL. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to compare the two-group PFS. Results: Sixty patients finished the final evaluation, with 30 patients in each group. Baseline characters between groups were not significantly different (P>0.05). The control group had a 36.7% improvement in clinical symptoms, while the treatment group had a 73.3% improvement. This difference was statistically significant (Z=-2.632, P=0.008). The control group had a 26.7% improvement in the Karnofsky performance status (KPS), while the treatment group had a 53.4% improvement. This was also significantly different (Z=-2.182, P=0.029). A comparative analysis indicated a positive correlation (r=0.917, P<0.001). Compared with the control group, QOL in the treatment group was significantly improved, except in the social/family condition and doctor-patient relationship indicators. The PFS of the treatment group and control group were 6.23 months and 4.67 months, respectively (P=0.048). Conclusion: Feitai Capsule, a Chinese medicinal herbal treatment could improve the QOL and extend the PFS of the unresectable NSCLC patients

AB  - Background and significance: According to New York statewide substance abuse treatment and discharge data, Asians are a small minority who differ significantly from other racial-ethnic groups on income, primary language, treatment setting, substance abuse, referral source, and discharge status. Objectives: The present study further compares alcohol and substance abuse service utilization patterns of Asians with those of Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics in New York State. Methods: Cox regressions were employed to examine the differences in treatment admission patterns among Asians and other ethnic groups, while controlling a number of demographic, treatment-related, and non-treatment-related factors. A sample of 408,158 clients was selected from the Client Data System of the New York State Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services for the analysis. Results: While Asians in general are less likely to use treatment services and to have multiple treatment admissions compared with other groups, those Asians with multiple admissions tend to show utilization patterns - the period of greatest risk for readmission, the rate at which readmissions occur, and the likelihood of readmission - similar to the other groups at each subsequent admission. Conclusion: These findings suggest both similarities and differences in treatment readmission patterns between Asians and other clients of substance abuse treatment services. Future research on the cultural and linguistic factors related to Asians' recovery and service utilization patterns after the initial treatment experience may be particularly important for systems of care seeking to be responsive to Asians' needs

We hypothesized that reduced peritoneal desiccation would improve patient-centered outcomes in children after laparoscopic appendicectomy. Method: A double-blinded, randomized controlled trial was conducted. Intervention group participants received warm (37 degrees C), humidified (98% relative humidity) CO2 gas insufflation, whereas control participants received standard room temperature (20 degrees C) gas with 0% relative humidity. Perioperative analgesia and anesthesia were standardized. Postoperative opiate usage was converted to morphine equivalent daily dosages (MEDD) for comparison, and pain intensity at rest and on moving was rated by participants using visual analog scales. Postoperative recovery and return to normal activities was assessed using a questionnaire on day 10. Results: Between February 2010 and March 2011, a total of 190 participants were randomized. Both intervention and control groups were matched at baseline. Postoperative MEDD and pain scores were also similar. There were no differences in postoperative recovery parameters. Conclusions: Warm, humidified CO2 insufflation for acute laparoscopic appendicectomy has no short-term clinical benefits on postoperative outcomes in pediatric patients (ClinicalTrials.gov trial identifying code: NCT01027455)

AB  - The trading of emissions permits, as an effective market-based approach for emissions control, is becoming widespread over the world. Similar to any other production input, the emissions permit is a factor of production much like commodity inputs. However, a firm participating in emissions trading has only to balance its permits at the end of a time horizon, say one year. Another key feature of permit trading is the existence of non-negligible, fixed, transaction costs. This paper attempts to shed light on how such a firm should optimally coordinate its production and permit purchasing decisions in order to minimize its total cost in the long run. In each period, the firm has to decide on its permit purchase quantities and production levels based on its on-hand permit and inventory levels as well as the market-prevalent permit price. The latter evolves as a Markov process and the firm also faces random demand. We characterize the optimal joint policy structure: an optimal purchase policy is of the state-dependent ( s, S ) type and an optimal production decision nearly follows a state-dependent base-stock form. A heuristic based on decomposition is found to be effective from computational studies. Our enabling technique is the identification of a class of two-dimensional functions that in one dimension it looks like K- convex and in another it is similar to convex. Key words: emissions trading; dynamic programming; C2 (K ) functions; (s, S ) policy; base-stock policy

AB  - Objective: The objective of this study was to compare the effects of two drugs on motor performance and analgesic efficacy in a rat model. Material and methods: Rats were randomly divided into four groups as follows: propofol (600 mu g/kg/min), dexmedetomidine (1 mu g/kg/min), morphine (83 mu g/kg/min) and control. The rats were placed on a rotating rod and tested at the slowest speed (5 rpm) and then at increasing increments from 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 to 40 rpm. The speed was set up again from 1 to 79 rpm within 4 and 10 min for the accelerod test, respectively. Pain reflexes in response to a thermal stimulus were measured at 0, 10, 20 and 60 min after the drug injection using the hot-plate test. Results: Dexmedetomidine injected rats showed an increased length of time compared to the propofol group at 20 rpm, 25 rpm, 35 rpm and 40 rpm speeds during the rotarod test. The latency times for the hot-plate test increased significantly for the propofol, at 0, 10 and 20 min compared to the control. At 10 min the latency times of the propofol group were longer than the dexmedetomidine group. Conclusions: For long-term analgesic benefit, propofol treatment seems to be better than the dexmedetomidine group. Dexmedetomidine may be preferable in day-case surgery and sedation applications in intensive care units as it provided a faster onset of recovery of motor coordination performance

AB  - Polymeric cryogels are sponge-like materials with supermacroporous structure, allowing them to be of interest as new chromatographic supports, cell scaffolds and drug carriers in biological and biomedical areas. The matrices of cryogels are always prepared in the form of monoliths by cryo-polymerization under frozen conditions. However, there are limited investigations on the production of cryogels in the form of adsorbent beads suitable for bioseparation. In this work, we provide a new approach by combining the microchannel liquid-flow focusing with cryo-polymerization for the preparation of polyacrylamide-based supermacroporous cryogel beads with a narrow particle size distribution. The present method was achieved by introducing the aqueous phase solution containing monomer, cross-linker and redox initiators, and the water-immiscible organic oil phase containing surfactant simultaneously into a microchannel with a cross-shaped junction, where the aqueous drops with uniform sizes were generated by the liquid shearing and the segmentation due to the steady flow focusing of the immiscible phase streams. These liquid drops were in situ suspended into the freezing bulk oil phase for cryopolymerization and the cryogel matrix beads were obtained by thawing after the achievement of polymerization. By grafting the polymer chains containing sulfo binding groups onto these matrix beads, the cation-exchange cryogel beads for protein separation were produced. The results showed that at the aqueous phase velocities from 0.5 to 2.0 cm/s and the total velocities of the water-immiscible phase from 2.0 to 6.0 cm/s, the obtained cryogel beads by the present method have narrow size distributions with most of the bead diameters in the range from 800 to 1500 mu m with supermacropores in sizes of about 3-50 mu m. These beads also have high porosities with the averaged maximum porosity of 96.9% and the mean effective porosity of 86.2%, which are close to those of the polyacrylamide-based cryogel monoliths. The packed bed using the cryogel beads with mean diameter of 1248 mu m as an example, has reasonable and acceptable liquid dispersion, but high water permeability (4.29 x 10(-10) m(2)) and high bed voidage (90.2%) owing to the supermacropores within the beads, enhanced the rapid binding and separation of protein from the feedstock even at high Bow velocities. The purity of the obtained lysozyme from chicken egg white by one-step chromatography using the packed bed was in the range of about 78-92% at the flow velocities of 0.5-15 cm/min, indicating that the present cryogel beads could be an effective chromatographic adsorbent for primary bioseparation.

AB  - It is well known that oxidative stress plays an important role in the etiology of epilepsy. We investigated effects of selenium (Se) and topiramate (TPM) combination supplementation on antioxidant and oxidant values in control and patients with epilepsy and refractory epilepsy. For the aim, we used control (n = 19), epilepsy + TPM (n = 19), epilepsy + TPM + Se (n = 15) groups. We also used control (n = 15), refractory epilepsy (n = 15), and refractory epilepsy + Se (n = 8) groups. TPM (0.2 mg/daily) and Se, as sodium selenite (twice daily with 0.1 mg doses), were orally supplemented to the patients for 45 days. Erythrocyte lipid peroxidation levels were higher in refractory epilepsy groups than in control although its level and seizure numbers were decreased in TPM and TPM + Se supplemented groups of the patients. The erythrocyte reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), plasma total antioxidant status (TAS), and vitamin E concentration in refractory epilepsy group were lower than in control. However, the erythrocyte and plasma TAS, erythrocyte GSH and GSH-Px, and plasma vitamins A and C values were increased either by Se or Se + TPM in epilepsy and refractory epilepsy groups. There were no effects of TPM and Se on plasma beta-carotene values in the groups. In conclusion, TPM and selenium caused protective effects on the epilepsy and refractory epilepsy-induced oxidative injury by inhibiting free radical production and supporting antioxidant redox system

AB  - This prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study evaluated the effects of dexketoprofen as an adjunct to lidocaine in intravenous regional anaesthesia (IVRA) or as a supplemental intravenous (i.v.) analgesic. Patients scheduled for elective hand or forearm soft-tissue surgery were randomly divided into three groups. All 45 patients received 0.5% lidocaine as IVRA. Dexketoprofen was given either i.v. or added into the IVRA solution and the control group received an equal volume of saline both i.v. and as part of the IVRA. The times of sensory and motor block onset, recovery time and postoperative analgesic consumption were recorded. Compared with controls, the addition of dexketoprofen to the IVRA solution resulted in more rapid onset of sensory and motor block, longer recovery time, decreased intra- and postoperative pain scores and decreased paracetamol use. It is concluded that coadministration of dexketoprofen with lidocaine in IVRA improves anaesthetic block and decreases postoperative analgesic requirements

AB  - Two prominent and important risk factors for nonmedical use of prescription opioids (NMUPO) identified in epidemiological studies are smoking status and sex (i.e., there is a greater likelihood of NMUPO in smokers and in men, relative to nonsmokers and women). Interestingly, nonsmokers and women are at greater risk for the aversive effects of postoperative nausea and vomiting. We have conducted six studies examining the subjective effects of oral oxycodone (0, 10, 20 mg) in samples that included both men and women and nonsmokers and light smokers (fewer than six cigarettes per day). Four groups were comprised of 115 volunteers: male smokers (n = 20), male nonsmokers (n = 38), female smokers (n = 15), and female nonsmokers (n = 42). We hypothesized that there would be an additive effect between smoking status and sex such that male smokers would experience less nausea and disliking, and greater overall liking, and that female nonsmokers would respond in the opposite fashion. As predicted, nausea and disliking ratings were lowest, and overall liking ratings the highest, in male smokers after oxycodone administration, whereas nausea and disliking ratings were highest, and overall liking ratings the lowest, in female nonsmokers. Thus, our hypotheses were generally supported, and suggest a possible biobehavioral mechanism for the epidemiological links between smoking status and sex and increased risk of NMUPO

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have previously been found to have a long delay to diagnosis and low utilization of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Over the past 5 years, support groups, awareness programs, and public campaigns have been instituted in the region AIM: This study aimed to assess whether such initiatives have affected the lag to diagnosis previously observed METHODS: Demographic, disease, and treatment data on the first 100 patients meeting American College of Rheumatology (1987) criteria for RA, presenting to our practice for the first time, were compared with similar data from 2006 on patients presenting to a different musculoskeletal clinic RESULTS: Subjects had a mean age of 40.2 (+/-11.0) years (42.2 [+/-12.3] years in the previous study; Student t test, P > 0.05). Rheumatoid factor was positive in 62% of subjects, whereas 73% were titer positive in the previous study ((2) test, P > 0.05). There was a mean reduction in lag time from symptom onset to diagnosis by 45.8%, from 14.4 (+/-15.6) to 7.8 (+/-12.1) months (Student t test, P = 0.001) between data sets. The lag to initial DMARD was also reduced by a mean of 34.9%, from 19.2 (+/-24) to 12.5 (+/-21.7) months (Student t test, P = 0.04) CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that the lag to diagnosis and initiation of DMARD therapy has reduced significantly among patients with RA in the United Arab Emirates, over the past 5 years. This may be attributed to the inception of patient support groups and increasing public awareness. Larger studies are needed to substantiate this further and to address whether shorter lag times can positively influence rates of disease remission and quality of life for our patients with RA (as this was a region specific study)

AB  - In recent decades, the considerable proliferation of the self-help groups (especially those of the Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA)) has attracted the interest of those engaged in the social sciences as well as of those responsible for mapping out health policies. This article is based on the 10-year involvement of the authors in a participatory action research project for the promotion of self-help groups in Greece as well as to an extensive literature review of the AA and NA movements. Based on this methodology, the objective of this article is twofold. First, it identifies the radical perspective of self-help groups, as the main source for their effectiveness, while it attempts an assessment of their effect on traditional professional attitudes. Second, it raises concerns over the radical perspective of these initiatives in the framework of their transition from an alternative stance towards their integration in formal Health Systems. This transition process is manifested in the following developments: (1) the constantly increasing number of old members who quit the role of the volunteer sponsor and undertake the financially beneficial role of (para-) professional addiction counselor; (2) the instrumentalization of 12 steps; (3) the increasing number of members who adopt the nosological perspective of addiction 4. The various adverse effects of dominant culture on the internal working of the groups are studied. Moreover, this article attempts a comparative assessment of the produced experience with the AA and NA movements in Greece and abroad.

AB  - Context Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a serious public health problem in the United States, yet no treatment is currently available to improve outcome after TBI. Approved for use in TBI in 59 countries, citicoline is an endogenous substance offering potential neuroprotective properties as well as facilitated neurorepair post injury. Objective To determine the ability of citicoline to positively affect functional and cognitive status in persons with complicated mild, moderate, and severe TBI. Design, Setting, and Patients The Citicoline Brain Injury Treatment Trial (COBRIT), a phase 3, double-blind randomized clinical trial conducted between July 20, 2007, and February 4, 2011, among 1213 patients at 8 US level 1 trauma centers to investigate effects of citicoline vs placebo in patients with TBI classified as complicated mild, moderate, or severe. Intervention Ninety-day regimen of daily enteral or oral citicoline (2000 mg) or placebo. Main Outcome Measures Functional and cognitive status, assessed at 90 days using the TBI-Clinical Trials Network Core Battery. A global statistical test was used to analyze the 9 scales of the core battery. Secondary outcomes were functional and cognitive improvement, assessed at 30, 90, and 180 days, and examination of the long-term maintenance of treatment effects. Results Rates of favorable improvement for the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended were 35.4% in the citicoline group and 35.6% in the placebo group. For all other scales the rate of improvement ranged from 37.3% to 86.5% in the citicoline group and from 42.7% to 84.0% in the placebo group. The citicoline and placebo groups did not differ significantly at the 90-day evaluation (global odds ratio [OR], 0.98 [95% CI, 0.83-1.15]); in addition, there was no significant treatment effect in the 2 severity subgroups (global OR, 1.14 [95% CI, 0.88-1.49] and 0.89 [95% CI, 0.72-1.49] for moderate/severe and complicated mild TBI, respectively). At the 180-day evaluation, the citicoline and placebo groups did not differ significantly with respect to the primary outcome (global OR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.72-1.04]). Conclusion Among patients with traumatic brain injury, the use of citicoline compared with placebo for 90 days did not result in improvement in functional and cognitive status

AB  - Several reports highlighted the cardioprotective effect of statins after different types of ischemic injury. We studied the effect of rosuvastatin on acute myocardial infarction induced experimentally in rats focusing on angiogenesis as a potential mechanism underlying the drug effect. Acute myocardial infarction was induced by injecting the rats with two doses of isoproterenol (85 mg/kg/24 h, s.c.). Rats were examined for their electrocardiographic pattern and myocardial fibrosis one week after injection of isoproterenol (time for initiating therapy) and eight weeks thereafter (the end of therapeutic period) to examine the progression of the injury. Examination of the heart tissues at the end of week 9 showed a non significant decrease in the degree of myocardial fibrosis compared to those observed at week 1, indicating a slow rate of recovery from isoproterenol-induced injury. Treatment with rosuvastatin (5 or 10 mg/kg) for 8 weeks in myocardial-infarct rats enhanced the electrocardiographic pattern, reduced serum cardiac biomarkers, reduced tissue tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and upregulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) level. In addition, immunohistochemical staining revealed higher expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), VEGF and CD34 (a marker for microvessel density) in the cardiac tissues after treatment with rosuvastatin compared to control group. The immunostaining for VEGF was positively correlated with microvessel density and iNOS. Overall, the current results provide evidence that the effect of rosuvastatin on myocardial-infarct rats involves induction of angiogenesis. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved

AB  - The molecular characteristics of recurrent ovarian cancers following chemotherapy treatment have been poorly characterized. Such knowledge could impact salvage therapy selection. Since 2008, we have profiled 168 patients' ovarian cancers to determine the expression of proteins that may predict chemotherapy response or are targets for drugs that are in clinical trials for ovarian cancer treatment. Expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), HER2, VEGF, ER, c-Met, IGF1R, Ki67, COX2, PGP/MDR1, BCRP, MRP1, excision repair complementation group 1 (ERCC1), MGMT, TS, RRM1, TOPO1, TOP2A, and SPARC was measured by immunohistochemical analyses at Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-certified laboratories. Our univariate analysis of 56 primary and 50 recurrent tumors from patients with advanced stage ovarian serous carcinoma revealed that PGP and ERCC1 were significantly upregulated in recurrent lesions (P < 0.05). To determine whether these or any of the other markers were differentially expressed in specimens obtained from the same individual at diagnosis and at recurrence, we analyzed 43 matched tumor specimens from 19 advanced stage ovarian carcinoma patients. We confirmed the expression differences in PGP and ERCC1 that were observed in the cohort analysis but discovered that the expression levels of BCRP, RRM1, and COX2 were also discordant in more than 40% of the matched tumor specimens. These results may have implications both for the use of biomarkers in therapy selection as well as for their discovery and validation. Expression of these and other candidate response biomarkers must be evaluated in much larger studies and, if confirmed, support the need for profiling of recurrent tumor specimens in future clinical trials.

AB  - Trigeminal neuralgia is defined as sudden, usually unilateral, severe, brief, stabbing recurrent episodes of pain within the distribution of one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve, which has a profound effect on quality of life. The diagnosis is made on history alone, and time needs to be taken to elicit the key features and differentiate from toothache or one of the trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias. Most trigeminal neuralgia is idiopathic, but a small percentage is due to secondary causes-for example, tumours or multiple sclerosis-which can be picked up on CT or MRI. Recently published international guidelines suggest that carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine are the first-line drugs. There is limited evidence for the use of lamotrigine and baclofen. If there is a decrease in efficacy or tolerability of medication, surgery needs to be considered. A neurosurgical opinion should be sought early. There are several ablative, destructive procedures that can be carried out either at the level of the Gasserian ganglion or in the posterior fossa. The only non-destructive procedure is microvascular decompression (MVD). The ablative procedures give a 50% chance of patients being pain free for 4 years, compared with 70% of patients at 10 years after MVD. Ablative procedures result in sensory loss, and MVD carries a 0.2-0.4% risk of mortality with a 2-4% chance of ipsilateral hearing loss. Surgical procedures result in markedly improved quality of life. Patient support groups provide information and support to those in pain and play a crucial role

AB  - Tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib and sunitinib have greatly improved clinical outcomes for patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). Dose optimization of these agents is critical and involves multiple considerations, including ensuring a durable response, monitoring drug blood levels to confirm adequate dosing, deciding whether to use high-dose imatinib or switch to second-line sunitinib in the event of disease progression and appropriately managing treatment-associated side effects. Imatinib is the standard first-line therapy for unresectable or metastatic GIST and is also an option for the adjuvant treatment of resected disease. Despite the efficacy and safety of imatinib in patients with advanced GIST, some individuals develop primary or secondary resistance or intolerance to the drug. For patients with advanced disease, imatinib dose escalation to 800 mg/day is warranted in cases of disease progression on imatinib 400 mg/day. In addition, patients with documented KIT exon 9 mutations are likely to derive benefit from initial treatment with high-dose imatinib to improve clinical outcomes. For patients who fail imatinib, sunitinib is an effective treatment option. However, the decision to use either high-dose imatinib or sunitinib should be based on the underlying cause of failure on imatinib, KIT mutational status and on whether the patient is intolerant of or has developed a resistance to imatinib. In this article we review the existing literature supporting the use of imatinib and sunitinib in GIST to provide a current clinical perspective on how best to use these agents in the management of GIST to optimize patient outcomes

AB  - Pharmacological treatment currently used for alcohol dependence is not sufficient for the all patients, and there is a crucial need to find more effective treatments. Recent studies indicate that topiramate is likely the most promising new medication for alcohol dependence. The rationale for topiramate as treatment for alcohol addiction is based on its multifaceted neurochemical activity that targets multiple neural pathways. This study aims to assess the effect of repeated treatment with topiramate on voluntary alcohol intake and beta-endorphin plasma level in rats selectively bred for high alcohol preference. Initially, Warsaw high preferring rats (N = 50) were given a 24-h/day free choice between a 10 % (v/v) alcohol solution and water for three consecutive weeks. Subsequently, rats were administered with topiramate (40 or 80 mg/kg b.w.) or vehicle for 14 days and ethanol intake was measured daily. Subsequently, we examined the effects of topiramate on plasma beta-endorphin levels, while alcohol was available and when it was not available for an extended period time. We observed significantly increase in the levels of beta-endorphin in rats with free access to alcohol both in a topiramate- or vehicle-treated group. However, in topiramate-treated group, a voluntary consumption of alcohol diminished in comparison with the vehicle-treated rats. The results from this study indicated that topiramate reduces voluntary alcohol intake and support our previous findings that the increase of beta-endorphin level is responsible at least partly for the effectiveness of drugs in treating the alcohol addiction

AB  - Background: G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute one of the largest groupings of eukaryotic proteins, and represent a particularly lucrative set of pharmaceutical targets. They play an important role in eukaryotic signal transduction and physiology, mediating cellular responses to a diverse range of extracellular stimuli. The phylum Platyhelminthes is of considerable medical and biological importance, housing major pathogens as well as established model organisms. The recent availability of genomic data for the human blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni and the model planarian Schmidtea mediterranea paves the way for the first comprehensive effort to identify and analyze GPCRs in this important phylum. Results: Application of a novel transmembrane-oriented approach to receptor mining led to the discovery of 117 S. mansoni GPCRs, representing all of the major families; 105 Rhodopsin, 2 Glutamate, 3 Adhesion, 2 Secretin and 5 Frizzled. Similarly, 418 Rhodopsin, 9 Glutamate, 21 Adhesion, 1 Secretin and 11 Frizzled S. mediterranea receptors were identified. Among these, we report the identification of novel receptor groupings, including a large and highly-diverged Platyhelminth-specific Rhodopsin subfamily, a planarian-specific Adhesion-like family, and atypical Glutamate-like receptors. Phylogenetic analysis was carried out following extensive gene curation. Support vector machines (SVMs) were trained and used for ligand-based classification of full-length Rhodopsin GPCRs, complementing phylogenetic and homology-based classification. Conclusions: Genome-wide investigation of GPCRs in two platyhelminth genomes reveals an extensive and complex receptor signaling repertoire with many unique features. This work provides important sequence and functional leads for understanding basic flatworm receptor biology, and sheds light on a lucrative set of anthelmintic drug targets

AB  - In this work we investigated the ability of AM251 to reverse schizophrenia-like symptoms produced by a neurodevelopmental animal model based on a social isolation procedure. First, we assessed the validity of our isolation-rearing protocol and, as expected, isolation-reared rats showed hyperlocomotion in a novel environment, cognitive impairment in the novel object recognition (NOR) test and a significant increase in the number of aggressive behaviours in the social interaction test compared to group-housed controls. This behavioural picture was associated with a reduction in CB1 receptor/G protein coupling in specific brain areas as well as reduced c-Fos immunoreactivity in the prefrontal cortex and caudate putamen. In this model, chronic but not acute treatment with the CB1 receptor antagonist AM251 counteracted isolation-induced cognitive impairment in the NOR test and aggressive behaviours in the social interaction test. This behavioural recovery was accompanied by the rescue of CB1 receptor functionality and c-Fos levels in all brain regions altered in isolation-reared rats. Moreover, chronic AM251 also increased c-Fos immunoreactivity in the nucleus accumbens, as previously demonstrated for antipsychotic drugs. Interestingly, the behavioural recovery due to chronic AM251 administration persisted until 10 d after discontinuing the treatment, indicating a long-lasting effect of the cannabinoid antagonist on psychotic-like symptoms

AB  - The examination of the effect of interfering ions on the analytical signal of ruthenium measured by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry was initially performed in this work. The complexes of ruthenium(III) with thiosemicarbazide (TSd) and acetaldehyde thiosemicarbazone (AcTSn) were prepared and imprinted in polymeric network The ion-imprinted polymers were synthesized by copolymerization of methacrylic acid, as functional monomer and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, as crosslinking agent in the presence of 2,2-azobisisobutyronitrile as initiator. The effects of sample volume, pH, and flow rate on the extraction of analyte were studied in dynamic mode. The optimum pH for quantitative retention of ruthenium on each of the studied sorbents was 7.5 +/- 0.5. The elution of analyte was completed with 0.2 mol L(-1) thiourea in 0.2 mol L(-1) HCl. The effect of matrix ions on ruthenium(III) separation process was studied. The analytical performance of the Ru-TSd polymer in the presence of competing ions was better than Ru-AcTSn polymer, considering recovery of analyte, reproducibility of results, selectivity coefficients, and sorbent capacity. The detection limit of the proposed method (0.16 ng mL(-1) on Ru-TSd and 0.25 ng mL(-1) on Ru-AcTSn) is lower in comparison with the previously published methods. The developed separation method was successfully applied to the determination of trace amounts of ruthenium in spiked water samples, sludge, grass, and human hair. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Mdr1a-, Bcrp-, and Mrp2-knockout rats are a more practical species for absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) studies than murine models and previously demonstrated expected alterations in the pharmacokinetics of various probe substrates. At present, gene expression and pathology changes were systematically studied in the small intestine, liver, kidney, and brain tissue from male SAGE Mdr1a, Bcrp, and Mrp2 knockout rats versus wild-type Sprague-Dawley controls. Gene expression data supported the relevant knockout genotype. As expected, Mrp2 knockout rats were hyperbilirubinemic and exhibited upregulation of hepatic Mrp3. Overall, few alterations were observed within 112 ADME-relevant genes. The two potentially most consequential changes were upregulation of intestinal carboxylesterase in Mdr1a knockouts and catechol-O-methyltransferase in all tissues of Bcrp knockout rats. Previously reported upregulation of hepatic Mdr1b P-glycoprotein in proprietary Wistar Mdr1a knockout rats was not observed in the SAGE counterpart investigated herein. Relative liver and kidney weights were 22-53% higher in all three knockouts, with microscopic increases in hepatocyte size in Mdr1a and Mrp2 knockout rats and glomerular size in Bcrp and Mrp2 knockouts. Increased relative weight of clearing organs is quantitatively consistent with reported increases in the clearance of drugs that are not substrates of the knocked-out transporter. Overall, SAGE knockout rats demonstrated modest compensatory changes, which do not preclude their general application to study transporter-mediated pharmacokinetics. However, until future studies elucidate the magnitude of functional change, caution is warranted in rare instances of extensive metabolism by catechol-O-methyltransferase in Bcrp knockouts and intestinal carboxylesterase in Mdr1a knockout rats, specifically for molecules with free catechol groups and esters subject to gut-wall hydrolysis

AB  - Introduction. Acute pancreatitis is one of the common reasons for surgical admission. It is a potentially lethal disease that is increasing in its incidence. The most common causes of acute pancreatitis is from gallstones and alcohol. Other causes of acute pancreatitis include hypertriglyceridaemia, hyperparathyroidism, pancreatic malignancy, Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), trauma, infectious agents, drugs, autoimmunity, and hereditary. The treatment of acute pancreatitis is mainly supportive. The complication of ERCP in acute pancreatitis can be divided into local complication (pancreatic abscess, pseudocyst), systemic complications (renal failure, respiratory failure, cardiogenic shock) and biliary sepsis (acute cholangitis and acute cholecystitis). However, early ERCP and possible sphincterotomy should be kept in mind for patients with severe disease and biliary obstruction who are not improving with medical therapy. This study is done to compare the complication rate of ERCP and conservative management in acute pancreatitis for past 6 years in Pusat Perubatan UKM. Materials and Methods. The study is conducted retrospectively and the study population was from January 2003 until December 2008. About 100 patients involving 51 males and 49 females were included in this study. All of them were diagnosed acute pancreatitis based on the serum amylase level of 4 times than normal value detected from Chemistry Pathology record, Pathology Department, PPUKM. Then, data were collected from the patient's file which include the demographic data and patient clinical presentation, ultrasound finding, either patient went for ERCP within 72 hours or not. If ERCP not done within 72 hours of admission then it will considered that the patient is under conservative management. Results. From 100 patients that involved in this study about 44% was Malay, 36 % was Chinese, 18 % was Indian and the other 2 % was from other origin. There were 28 cases (28%) where ERCP was done within 72 hours, and the other 72 cases (72%) the treatment was conservative. Among 28 cases that ERCP was done within 72 hours after admission, 20 cases are mild where as only 8 cases are severe. However, in conservative group about 56 cases are mild and the other 16 are severe. Among the conservative group there are 12 cases which have complications. The complications are respiratory failure, renal failure, sepsis, shock and pancreatic necrosis. There are 7 cases whose have respiratory failure alone, 1 case developed renal failure and 1 case has a shock. 1 case developed both pancreatic necrosis with sepsis. 1 case each developed respiratory failure with sepsis and respiratory failure with renal failure. However no complications were noted in early ERCP group. Conclusion. As a conclusion in this study we found out that early ERCP have a significant role in acute pancreatitis compare to conservative management. Clin Ter 2012; 163(6):467-471

AB  - The low temperature fracture properties of polyphosphoric acid (PPA) modified mixtures are evaluated and compared with those of polymer modified mixtures. The main objective is to determine whether PPA can partially or completely substitute traditional polymer modifiers, without adversely affecting the mixture's resistance to thermal cracking. Laboratory compacted and field cored test samples from the Minnesota Road Research Project (MnROAD) were tested using traditional methods as well as newly developed fracture testing protocols: indirect tensile test (IDT), semicircular bending test (SCB), and disk-shaped compact tension test (DCT). The effects of temperature, air-void content, comma and long-term aging on low temperature fracture properties were analyzed; and field performance observations of the test cells from MnROAD were discussed. On the basis of the analysis, the fracture resistance of the PPA modified mixture is less than that of the SBS modified mixture. However, when PPA is used to substitute part of the SBS, a mixture with fracture resistance comparable to that of the mixture modified with SBS alone is produced.

AB  - Research has not consistently supported an association between stage of change and substance abuse treatment retention. This study examined whether social desirability response bias could help explain why. Participants (N = 200) recruited from an outpatient program completed the University of Rhode Island Change Assessment Scale (URICA), Treatment Readiness Tool (TREAT), Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale, and other measures. Number of treatment groups attended was collected from program records. In bivariate analyses, neither the URICA nor the TREAT was related to attendance. However, higher social desirability was strongly associated with lower URICA (but not TREAT) total scores, and in a multivariate path model, a moderately strong association emerged between higher URICA scores and greater treatment attendance when accounting for social desirability. Higher social desirability was also an independent predictor of greater treatment attendance and was strongly associated with lower Addiction Severity Index alcohol, drug, and psychiatric severity. Results underline a critical problem in measuring motivation and problem severity that has been largely neglected. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved

AB  - This study addresses the relative importance of specific 12-step activities to recovery, and how treatment affects participation in those activities. Data were from a clinical trial testing a 12-step facilitation intervention called MAAEZ (Making AA [Alcohol Anonymous] Easier). Participants (N = 508) were recruited at treatment entry. Analyses examined 8 activities measured at baseline, 7 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months. In simultaneous equations, meeting attendance and having a sponsor were the only strong and consistent predictors of abstinence across time points, though other activities (i.e., use of a home group, befriending members, service work, and reading the literature) were significant in some analyses. Treatment involvement had mixed effects on activity participation over time. Contradicting research suggesting that meeting attendance contributes little beyond other 12-step activities, the current results highlight the importance of consistent meeting attendance and sponsorship in recovery. The results suggest a need for enhanced facilitation of key activities even in typical 12-steporiented treatment

AB  - Background Chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an acquired autoimmune disorder that is characterized predominantly by a low platelet count. Thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonists increase production of platelets by stimulating the TPO receptor in people with chronic ITP. Objectives To determine the efficacy and safety of TPO receptor agonists in chronic ITP patients. Search strategy We searched MEDLINE (from 1950 to March 2011), EMBASE (from 1974 to March 2011), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 3) to identify all randomized trials in chronic ITP. We also contacted authors of included studies and TPO receptor agonists manufacturers. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing TPO receptor agonists alone, or in combination with other drugs, to placebo, no treatment, other drugs, splenectomy or another TPO receptor agonist in patients with chronic ITP. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened papers, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in the included studies. Main results Six trials with 808 patients were included. Five studies compared TPO receptor agonists with placebo (romiplostim: 100, eltrombopag: 299, placebo: 175); one study compared TPO receptor agonists with standard of care (SOC) (romiplostim: 157; SOC: 77). SOC included a variety of therapies, such as glucocorticoid, anti-D immune globulin, intravenous immune globulin, rituximab, azathioprine, and so on. Overall survival, one of our primary outcomes, was not studied by these RCTs and we could not estimate number needed to treat (NNT). Another primary outcome, improving significant bleeding events, did not reveal any significant differences between the TPO receptor agonists group and the control group (placebo or SOC) (versus placebo risk ratio (RR) 0.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20 to 1.15; versus SOC RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.63). For secondary outcomes, TPO receptor agonists statistically significantly improved overall platelet response (versus placebo RR 4.06, 95% CI 2.93 to 5.63; versus SOC RR 1.81, 95% CI 1.37 to 2.37), complete response (versus placebo RR 9.29, 95% CI 2.32 to 37.15) and durable response (versus placebo RR 14.16, 95% CI 2.91 to 69.01). There was a significant reduction in overall bleeding events (WHO grades 1 to 4) when compared to placebo (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.89), but not when compared to SOC(RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.26). Total adverse events (Grades 1 to 5) were not statistically significantly different between the treatment and control groups(both placebo and SOC) (versus placebo RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.15; versus SOC RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.26). Total serious adverse events (Grade 3 and higher adverse events) were increased when patients receiving treatment with SOC (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.92), but not receiving treatment with placebo (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.38). There are selective and performance biases because of open-label and inadequate allocation. Authors' conclusions There was currently no evidence to support that TPO receptor agonists are effective in chronic ITP. Compared to placebo or SOC, despite significantly increased platelet response, there was no evidence to demonstrate that TPO receptor agonists did improve significant bleeding events in chronic ITP. The effect on overall survival awaits further analysis. Although long-term studies are lacking, current data demonstrated adverse effects of TPO receptor agonists were similar to that of placebo and SOC

AB  - The aim of this investigation was to explore therapists' reactions and behaviors in response to the discussion of religion and spirituality in secular therapy, as well as to compare the perceived needs of and process of working with trauma clients to that of a more general therapy population. A modified grounded theory investigation was used to examine data from interviews with and questionnaires completed by 14 licensed psychotherapy providers who had worked with both trauma and non-trauma clients on issues of religion and spirituality. Therapists acknowledged the importance of discussing these topics, and outlined common reasons for engaging in religious/spiritual discussions in treatment. The religious/spiritual self of the provider, as well as his/her opinions about religion/spirituality have an effect on therapeutic work. Therapists utilize a variety of techniques, including both direct and more indirect practices, and are able to articulate specific goals for these discussions. Therapists view attention to religion/spirituality in trauma therapy as necessary, and see this work as qualitatively different from working with other client populations. This appears to be due in part to trauma clients' needs to find support and comfort, engage in questioning and meaning-making processes, and explore potentially changing religious/spiritual beliefs or practices. Implications for training, practice, and future research are discussed

AB  - In low-incidence countries, tuberculosis (TB) is now largely concentrated in high-risk groups such as migrants, homeless people, illicit drug users, alcoholics and prisoners. This has led to increased efforts to implement targeted active case finding for TB among specific populations. This review examines the evidence supporting active case finding in migrants and social risk groups, as well as the cost-effectiveness of interventions. "While data from observational studies support active case finding in defined high-risk groups, further research to determine the effectiveness of specific tools and the cost-effectiveness of screening strategies is needed to inform evidence-based control methods in low-incidence countries. Inevitably, addressing TB in low-incidence countries will depend on effective disease control in high-burden countries

AB  - Objectives: To investigate the mechanisms of platelet kinetics in the Strategies for Management of Antiretroviral Therapy (SMART) study that demonstrated excess mortality with CD4 guided episodic antiretroviral therapy (ART) drug conservation compared with continuous treatment viral suppression. Follow-up analyses of stored plasma samples demonstrated increased activation of both inflammatory and coagulation pathways after stopping ART. Design: SMART patients from sites that determined platelets routinely. Methods: Platelet counts were retrospectively collected from 2206 patients from visits at study entry, and during follow-up. D-dimer levels were measured at study entry, month 1, and 2. Results: Platelet levels decreased in the drug conservation group following randomization, but remained stable in the viral suppression group vertical bar median (IQR) decline from study entry to month 4: -24 000/mu l (-54000 to 4000) vs. 3000 (-22000 to 24000), respectively, P <0.0001)] and the rate of developing thrombocytopenia (<100 000/mu l) was significantly higher in the drug conservation vs. the viral suppression arm (unadjusted drug conservation/viral suppression [HR (95%Cl) = 1.8 (1.2-2.7)]. The decline in platelet count among drug conservation participants on fully suppressive ART correlated with the rise in D-dimer from study entry to either month 1 or 2 (r = -0.41; P = 0.02). Among drug conservation participants who resumed ART 74% recovered to their study entry platelet levels. Conclusion: Interrupting ART increases the risk of thrombocytopenia, but reinitiation of ART typically reverses it. Factors contributing to declines in platelets after interrupting ART may include activation of coagulation pathways or HIV-1 replication itself. The contribution of platelets in HIV-related procoagulant activity requires further study. (C) 2012 Wolters Kluwer Health vertical bar Lippincott Williams & Wilkins AIDS 2013, 27:59-68

AB  - Objective: Large randomized clinical trials have shown the efficacy of aspirin, ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) inhibitors and statins as secondary prevention measures in patients after an acute coronary syndrome with and without ST elevations. Therefore we aimed to determine the effect of a combination therapy with these three drugs on 1-year mortality after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Methods: We prospectively followed 9998 survivors of acute myocardial infarction treated with a beta-blocker for 1 year. Patients were divided into three groups according to their therapy with aspirin, ACE inhibitors and statins: 3 drugs, 2 drugs or 0-1 drug. Results: The majority of patients (n = 6260, 62.6%) were treated with 3 drugs, 2986 (29.9%) with 2 drugs and 752 (7.5%) with 0-1 drug. In the univariate analysis 1-year mortality was 4.9%, 9.7% and 13.6%, respectively. After adjusting for confounding factors in the propensity score analysis the odds ratios for 1-year mortality were significantly increased with 0-1 drug (odds ratio 1.67, 95% CI 1.24-2.27) and with 2 drugs (odds ratio 1.54, 95% CI 1.26-1.87) in comparison with the group treated with all 3 drugs. However, in the ACOS registry the treatment was left to the discretion of the physician. This could lead to a selection bias, which cannot be fully eliminated by using multiple regression analysis. Conclusions: A combination therapy with aspirin, an ACE inhibitor and a statin reduces 1-year mortality in patients after AMI. Therefore a polypill approach with these three agents should be considered to increase drug compliance and reduce mortality after acute myocardial infarction

AB  - Aims Major guidelines recommend lowering systolic blood pressure (SBP) to,140 mmHg in all hypertensives, but evidence is missing whether this is beneficial in (i) uncomplicated hypertensives, (ii) grade 1 hypertensives, and (iii) elderly hypertensives. Providing this missing evidence is important to justify efforts and costs of aggressive therapy in all hypertensives. Methods and results Felodipine Event Reduction (FEVER) was a double-blind, randomized trial on 9711 Chinese hypertensives, in whom cardiovascular outcomes were significantly reduced by more intense therapy (low-dose hydrochlorothiazide and low-dose felodipine) achieving a mean of 138 mmHg SBP compared with less-intense therapy (low-dose hydrochlorothiazide and placebo) achieving a mean of 142 mmHg. FEVER included older and younger patients, and patients with and without diabetes or cardiovascular disease. In the analyses here reported, Cox regression models assessed outcome differences between more and less-intense treatments in groups of patients with different baseline characteristics. Significant reductions in stroke were found in uncomplicated hypertensives (-39%, P = 0.002), in hypertensives with randomization SBP <153 mmHg (-29%, P = 0.03), and in elderly hypertensives (-44%, P < 0.001), when their SBP was lowered by more intense treatment. Significant reductions (between -29 and -47%, P = 0.02 to <0.001) were also found in all cardiovascular events and all deaths. Achieving mean SBP values,140 mmHg by adding a small dose of a generic drug prevented 2.1 (uncomplicated hypertensives) and 5.2 (elderly) cardiovascular events every 100 patients treated for 3.3 years. Conclusions These analyses provide strong support, missing so far, to guidelines recommending goal SBP,140 mmHg in uncomplicated hypertensives, individuals with moderately elevated BP and elderly hypertensives

AB  - Previous functional imaging studies on heroin addicts have focused on abnormal brain functions based on specific tasks, while few fMRI studies concentrated on the resting-state abnormalities of heroin-dependent individuals. In the current study, we applied the pattern classification technique, which employs the feature extraction method of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Its main purpose was to characterize the discrepancy in activation patterns between heroin-dependent individuals and healthy subjects during the resting state. The results displayed a high accuracy in the activation pattern differences of the two groups, which included the orbitofrontal cortex pm, cingulate gyrus, frontal and para-limbic regions such as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), hippocampal/parahippocampal region, amygdala, caudate, putamen, as well as the posterior insula and thalamus. These findings indicate that significant biomarkers exist among the network of circuits that are involved in drug abuse. The implications from our study may help explain the behavioral and neuropsychological deficits in heroin-dependent individuals and shed light on the mechanisms underlying heroin addiction.

AB  - To develop more biomarkers for diagnosis and therapy of ovarian cancer, a 12-mer phage display library was used to isolate peptides that bound specifically to the human ovarian tumor cell line SK-OV-3. After five rounds of in vitro screening, the recovery rate of phages showed a 69-fold increase over the first round of washings and a group of phage clones capable of binding to SK-OV-3 cells were obtained. A phage clone named Z1 with high affinity and specificity to SK-OV-3 cells was identified in vitro. More importantly, the synthetic biotin-labeled peptide, ZP1 (=SVSVGMKPSPRP), which corresponded to the sequence of the inserted fragment of Z1, demonstrated a high specificity to SK-OV-3 cells especially when compared to other cell lines (A2780 and 3T3). ZP1 might therefore be a biomarker for targeting drug delivery in ovarian cancer therapy

AB  - Liver cancer is one of the most common malignant cancers worldwide. Systemic chemotherapy remains the major treatment option, but with severe adverse effects. Combinations of systemic with targeted treatments may provide effective therapeutics. The objectives of this study were to demonstrate if insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) might serve as a functional target for liver cancer treatment and to investigate the chemo-sensitizing activity of IGF-IR downregulation. IGF-IR knockdown was achieved by stable transfection of liver cancer cells with IGF-IR small interfering RNA (siRNA). IGF-IR knockdown resulted in reduced growth, clonogenic survival, adhesion and migration of liver cancer cells, and increased sensitivities of liver cancer cells to apoptosis-inducing agents and chemotherapeutic drugs in vitro. In the animal studies, both IGF-IR knockdown and adriamycin (ADM) treatment significantly reduced the growth of liver tumors. IGF-IR knockdown enhanced the effect of ADM on tumor growth by further reducing tumor angiogenesis and inducing tumor cell apoptosis. The final tumor sizes in the IGFIR-siRNA, ADM-treated EGFP, and ADM-treated IGFIR-siRNA groups were significantly reduced by 52.5%, 33.8%, and 86.3%, respectively, compared with that in the EGFP control, suggesting that the ADM and the IGF-IR knockdown inhibit the growth of liver tumors in a synergistic manner. These results support that IGF-IR may serve as a functional molecular target for liver cancer treatment, and that the combination of systemic chemotherapy with targeted IGF-IR suppression may provide an effective treatment strategy for liver cancer

AB  - In this paper, we review the key solutions that enabled evolution of the lead optimization screening support process at Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) between 2004 and 2009. During this time, technology infrastructure investment and scientific expertise integration laid the foundations to build and tailor lead optimization screening support models across all therapeutic groups at BMS. Together, harnessing advanced screening technology platforms and expanding panel screening strategy led to a paradigm shift at BMS in supporting lead optimization screening capability. Parallel SAR and structure liability relationship (SLR) screening approaches were first and broadly introduced to empower more-rapid and informed decisions about chemical synthesis strategy and to broaden options for identifying high-quality drug candidates during lead optimization

AB  - Self-healing polymers represent a class of materials with built-in capability of rehabilitating damages. The topic has attracted increasingly more attention in the past few years. The on-going research activities clearly indicate that self-healing polymeric materials turn out to be a typical multi-disciplinary area concerning polymer chemistry, organic synthesis, polymer physics, theoretical and experimental mechanics, processing, composites manufacturing, interfacial engineering, etc. The present article briefly reviews the achievements of the groups worldwide, and particularly the work carried out in our own laboratory towards strength recovery for structural applications. To ensure sufficient coverage, thermoplastics and thermosetting polymers, extrinsic and intrinsic self-healing, autonomic and non-autonomic healing approaches are included. Innovative routes that correlate materials chemistry to full capacity restoration are discussed for further development from bioinspired toward biomimetic repair

AB  - Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) is a water-soluble, anionic, quinonoid substance that has been established as an essential nutrient in animals. Owing to the inherent properties of PQQ as an antioxidant and redox modulator in various systems, PQQ is expected to be used in pharmacological applications in the near future. Although many recent studies have investigated its neuroprotective effects, the effect of PQQ on traumatic brain injury (TBI) has not been examined. In this study we employed Morris water maze (MWM) training, the results of which showed that PQQ led to improved behavioral performance in post-TBI animals. Considering that many experiments have suggested that beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase I (beta-1,4-GalT-I) and -V play significant roles in inflammation and the nervous system, in the present study we used Western blot analysis to study the effect of PQQ on the expression of beta-1,4-GalT-I and -V. We found apparent expression upregulation of beta-1,4-GalT-I and -V after PQQ was systemically administered. Lectin-fluorescent staining with RCA-I also revealed that PQQ contributed to expression upregulation of the galactosidase beta-1 (Gal beta-1), 4-galactosyltransferase N-acylsphingosine (4-GlcNAc) group in microglia and neurons of the cortex and hippocampal CA2 region. In summary, our experiment established that PQQ may play an important role in recovery post-TBI

AB  - Background: The aim of this study was to investigate effect of single-and multiple-dose of parecoxib on shoulder pain after gynecologic laparoscopy. Methods: 126 patients requiring elective gynecologic laparoscopy were randomly allocated to three groups. Group M (multiple-dose): receiving parecoxib 40mg at 30min before the end of surgery, at 8 and 20hr after surgery, respectively; Group S (single-dose): receiving parecoxib 40mg at 30min before the end of surgery and normal saline at the corresponding time points; Group C (control): receiving normal saline at the same three time points. The shoulder pain was evaluated, both at rest and with motion, at postoperative 6, 24 and 48hr. The impact of shoulder pain on patients' recovery (activity, mood, walking and sleep) was also evaluated. Meanwhile, rescue analgesics and complications were recorded. Results: The overall incidence of shoulder pain in group M (37.5%) was lower than that in group C (61.9%) (difference=-24.4%; 95% CI: 3.4 similar to 45.4%; P=0.023). Whereas, single-dose regimen (61.0%) showed no significant reduction (difference with control=-0.9%; 95% CI: -21.9 similar to 20.0%; P=0.931). Moreover, multiple-dose regimen reduced the maximal intensity of shoulder pain and the impact for activity and mood in comparison to the control. Multiple-dose of parecoxib decreased the consumption of rescue analgesics. The complications were similar among all groups and no severe complications were observed. Conclusions: Multiple-, but not single-, dose of parecoxib may attenuate the incidence and intensity of shoulder pain and thereby improve patients' quality of recovery following gynecologic laparoscopy

AB  - Aims: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a 5-in-6 double catheter (DC) technique during transradial complex PCI compared to a conventional buddy-wire or balloon-anchoring approach. Methods and results: One hundred and eighty-seven patients who failed in stent or balloon delivery after successful wiring of the target vessel were prospectively randomised to further treatment with a 5-in-6 DC technique (DC group, n=94) or by a conventional buddy-wire or balloon-anchoring approach (control group, n=93). Baseline clinical and lesion features were comparable between the two groups. The primary endpoint of technical success was significantly higher in the DC than in the control group (97.9% and 39.8%, p<0.001). Fifty-six patients (60.2%) in the control group with failure of the buddy-wire or balloon-anchoring approach achieved successful PCI with bailout use of a DC technique. Procedural x-ray time (58.2 +/- 23.1 min vs. 94.9 +/- 18.6 min, p<0.001), patient dose-area product (23,970 +/- 8,555 cGy.cm(2) vs. 44,475 +/- 10,573 cGy.cm(2), p<0.001) and contrast consumption (177 +/- 33 ml vs. 27 +/- 170 ml, p<0.001) were significantly reduced in the DC group. One-year major adverse cardiac event-free survival did not differ between the two groups (89.4% vs. 84.9%, p=0.36). Conclusions: The use of a 5-in-6 DC technique, especially as a bailout strategy, is a more effective back-up support of the guiding system, subsequently facilitating the success of transradial PCI for complex coronary lesions, than a conventional buddy-wire or balloon-anchoring approach

The aim of this study is to encapsulate melatonin into poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres (PLGA-MEL-MS) and create a melatonin sustained release system, then to evaluate its effect on the osteogenesis of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) in vitro. PLGA-MEL-MS were prepared by single emulsion solvent evaporation technique. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated the incorporation of melatonin did not disturb the conventional generation of PLGA microspheres in size and morphology. In vitro drug release assay showed that PLGA-MEL-MS exhibited a biphasic drug release pattern: a low initial burst release effect with approximately 40% drug release at the first 3 days and a relatively retarded and continuous release with about 85% drug release over the 25 days. Cell proliferation assay demonstrated that PLGA-MEL-MS had no apparent effect on proliferation of human MSCs. In an osteogenesis assay, PLGA-MEL-MS obviously enhanced alkaline phosphatase (ALP) mRNA expression and increased ALP activity compared to that in the control group. Meanwhile, several markers of osteoblast differentiation were also significantly upregulated, including runx2, osteopontin, and osteocalcin. Furthermore, quantificational alizarin red-based assay demonstrated that PLGA-MEL-MS significantly enhanced calcium deposit of hMSCs compared to the controls. Therefore, this simple melatonin sustained release system can control released melatonin to generate a microenvironment with a relatively stable concentration of melatonin for a period of time to support osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs in vitro. This suggests that this system may be used as bone growth stimulator in bone healing in vivo

AB  - A new and one-pot protocol for mass-producable synthesis of the poly(ethylene oxide propylphosphonamidate) (PEOPPA) hydrogel bearing multi-amine and multi-amino groups with excellent swellability and flexibility has been described. The structural characterization of the formed gel was well analyzed by infrared, solid state P-31-NMR and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies, and scanning electron microscopy. Rheological properties and swellability are carefully measured and discussed as well. The PEOPPA hydrogels have been used as a template and reducing agent for the synthesis of a series of noble metal nanoparticles (MNPs) (Au, Ag, Pd, Pt and Ru NPs) in the absence of any other reducing agents and stabilizers. In situ formed MNPs were uniformly impregnated inside the hydrogel without secession, efficiently avoiding aggregation-induced loss of catalytic activity. The MNP-impregnated hydrogels were employed for the reduction of various nitroaromatics in the presence of sodium borohydride in aqueous media, showing very high catalytic activity. These systems exhibit excellent recyclability in an easy way. The catalytic activity in enhancing the conversion rate increases in accordance with a series: PEOPPA hydrogel supported (HS) Ru NP < HS Ag NP < HS Au NP < HS Pt NP < HS Pd NP. The reaction rate constants at 10, 30 and 50 degrees C and the activation energies with other activation parameters were estimated. The activation energies for the reduction of 2,6-dinitrophenol, 2,4-dinitrophenol, 4-nitrophenol and 2,4,6-trinitrophenol catalyzed by the HS Au NP are 35.13, 29.08, 22.03 and 32.01 kJ mol(-1), respectively

AB  - Contamination of natural water with heavy metals (especially lead ions) is a problem of major concern and thus great demand of effective adsorbents for removal of toxic ions is increasing. Due to the task-specific properties of amino groups, core-shell nanostructures of Fe3O4@SiO2-NH2 have been extensively investigated as advanced adsorbents; however, most studies on surface modification of Fe3O4@SiO2 substances were of environmentally inefficient grafting methods. Herein, we demonstrated that mono-dispersed and spherical Fe3O4@SiO2-NH2 nanomaterials can be facilely prepared by co-condensation of TEOS with APTMS employing a green sol-gel process. The as-prepared Fe3O4@SiO2-NH2 magnetic nano-particles (MNPs) prepared under optimum conditions possessing uniform core-shell structure (similar to 200 nm in diameter), relatively high loading of amino-functionality (similar to 5.45 wt%), easy recovery by external magnet and effective removal of Pb(II)(q(m) = 243.9 mg/g, 25 degrees C). The adsorption was shown to be effective and a higher temperature was more favorable for the adsorption. The adsorption equilibrium data obeyed the Langmuir model and the kinetic data were well fitted to the pseudo-second-order model. Thermodynamic studies revealed the feasibility and endothermic nature of the system. These results demonstrated that the sol-gel produced Fe3O4@SiO2-NH2, due to its easy synthesis and recovery and eco-friendliness, can be a potential adsorbent for Pb(II) removal.

AB  - Delivery of neuropeptides into the central and/or peripheral nervous systems supports development of novel neurotherapeutics for the treatment of pain, epilepsy and other neurological diseases. Our previous work showed that the combination of lipidization and cationization applied to anticonvulsant neuropeptides galanin (GAL) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) improved their penetration across the blood-brain barrier yielding potent antiepileptic lead compounds, such as Gal-B2 (NAX 5055) or NPY-B2. To dissect peripheral and central actions of anticonvulsant neuropeptides, we rationally designed, synthesized and characterized GAL and NPY analogues containing monodisperse (discrete) oligoethyleneglycol-lysine (dPEG-Lys). The dPEGylated analogues Gal-B2-dPEG(24), Gal-R2-dPEG(24) and NPY-dPEG(24) displayed analgesic activities following systemic administration, while avoiding penetration into the brain. Gal-B2-dPEG(24) was synthesized by a stepwise deprotection of orthogonal 4-methoxytrityl and allyloxycarbonyl groups, and subsequent on-resin conjugations of dPEG(24) and pahnitic acids, respectively. All the dPEGylated analogues exhibited substantially decreased hydrophobicity (expressed as logD values), increased in vitro serum stabilities and pronounced analgesia in the formalin and carrageenan inflammatory pain assays following systemic administration, while lacking apparent antiseizure activities. These results suggest that discrete PEGylation of neuropeptides offers an attractive strategy for developing neurotherapeutics with restricted penetration into the central nervous system

AB  - New oral granules of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid in 8:1 ratio have recently been developed and approved to conduct clinical trial in China. To date, there has been no report studying the pharmacokinetic characteristics of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid in man. Therefore, it is urgent to investigate the pharmacokinetic properties of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid in man. The aim of the study was to assess the pharmacokinetic properties of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid in 8:1 with different dosage in healthy volunteers and provide support for this drug to obtain marketing authorization in China. A liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method for determining the concentration of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid in human plasma was developed and applied to this open-label, single- and multiple-dose Pharmacokinetics study. Subjects were randomized to receive a single dose of 1, 2, and 4 pouches of the test granulation of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid in 8:1 ratio (amoxicillin is 250 mg and clavulanic acid is 31.25 mg per pouch). In the single-dose phase, blood samples were collected before dosing and at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 5, 8, 12, and 24 h after drug administration. In the multiple-dose phase, samples were obtained before drug administration on days 1, 2, 3, and 4 to determine the C-min of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid. In the 4th day, samples were collected from 0.25 to 24 h after drug administration. Profiles of the concentration-time curves of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid were best fitted to two-compartment model. In this group of healthy Chinese subjects, the pharmacokinetics of amoxicillin fitted the linear dynamic feature at doses of 250,500 and 1,000 mg, and not obviously about clavulanic acid at doses of 31.25, 62.5, and 125 mg. The t (1/2) of single dose and multidoses were (1.45 +/- A 0.12) and (1.44 +/- A 0.26) h of amoxicillin and (1.24 +/- A 0.23) and (1.24 +/- A 0.17) of clavulanic acid, respectively; The AUC(0-24) of single dose and multidoses were (27937.85 +/- A 4265.59) and (24569.80 +/- A 3663.63) ng h mL(-1) of amoxicillin and (891.45 +/- A 194.30) and (679.61 +/- A 284.05) ng h mL(-1) of clavulanic acid, respectively; The C-max of single dose and multidoses were (8414.58 +/- A 1416.78) and (7929.17 +/- A 1291.54) ng mL(-1) of amoxicillin and (349.00 +/- A 89.54) and (289.00 +/- A 67.36) ng h mL(-1) of clavulanic acid, respectively. t (1/2), AUC(0-24), and C-max were similar after multiple-dose administration and after single-dose administration, suggesting that amoxicillin and clavulanic acid do not accumulate with multiple-dose administration of 500 and 62.5 mg, respectively

AB  - Objectives This study assessed social and behavioural predictors for sexual risk taking and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including HIV among adolescent female sex workers (FSWs) from Kunming, China. Additionally, health services needs and use were assessed. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2010. Using snowball and convenience sampling, self-identified FSWs were recruited from four urban areas in Kunming. Women consenting to participate were administered a semi-structured questionnaire by trained interviewers identified from local peer-support organisations. Following interview, a gynaecological examination and biological sampling to identify potential STIs were undertaken. Descriptive and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed. Results Adolescent FSWs had a mean age of 18.2 years and reported numerous non-paying sexual partners with very low rate of consistent condom use (22.2%). Half (50.3%) the respondents had sex while feeling drunk at least once in the past week, of whom 56.4% did not use condom protection. STI prevalence was high overall (30.4%) among this group. Younger age, early sexual debut, being isolated from schools and family, short duration in sex work, and use of illicit drugs were found to be strong predictors for unprotected sex and presence of an STI. Conversely, having access to condom promotion, free HIV counselling and testing, and peer education were associated with less unprotected sex. The majority reported a need for health knowledge, free condoms and low-cost STI diagnosis and treatment. Conclusions There is an urgent need to improve coverage, accessibility and efficiency of existing interventions targeting adolescent FSWs

AB  - We disclose that [1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)methane]nickel(II) chloride [NiCl(2)(dppp)] is a highly active, universally applicable, cheap, and stable catalyst for Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions of aryl halides with a catalyst loading of lower than 1 mol%, and more notably, in the absence of extra supporting ligands. Under the optimized reaction conditions, a broad range of aryl bromides as well as the notoriously unreactive aryl chlorides, including activated, non-activated, deactivated, and heteroaromatic and sterically hindered substrates can be coupled smoothly with various boronic acids (47 examples, 48-98% yields). In addition, the transformation is tolerant of various functional groups such as ether, ester, ketone, aldehyde, cyano, and un-protected amino and hydroxy groups. Finally, the potential utilization of the methodology was further demonstrated by the gram-scale synthesis of several core structures of commercialized antihypertensive drugs and fungicides. Thus, the combination of high activity, broad applicability, cheapness, and high stability of NiCl(2)(dppp) presented in this work constitutes one of the few prominent catalysts which allow for practical and reliable construction of biaryls and heterobiaryls with structural diversity from readily available aryl halides and boronic acids

AB  - Three classes of nonfouling substances, poly[poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate] (POEM), poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate) (PSBMA), and perfluoroalkyl tagged poly(ethylene glycol) surfactants (fPEG) were covalently tethered onto the surface of Anopore(TM) membranes (nominal pore size 0.2 mu m) to form a series of organic-inorganic hybrid membranes. These membranes were then used for the microfiltration of cellulose acid hydrolysis mixtures. Flux recoveries of over 80% after three filtration cycles were observed for the hybrid membranes. Thus the fluxes of the three synthesized hybrid membranes could be largely recovered by washing with methanol and water after the microfiltration of cellulose hydrolysis mixtures. In contrast the bare membranes showed much lower flux recoveries. It was also shown that the grafted polymer layer improves the stability of the membranes in acidic environment. The synthesized membranes were also characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which were used to understand the morphology and chemical compositions of the membrane surfaces, and the results of these methods correlate with the microfiltration data presented. Mathematical modeling of the microfiltration data indicates that the pore constriction model best describes the fouling behavior of the bare Anopore(TM) membrane, while the cake filtration model fits the data most satisfactorily for the three groups of hybrid membranes. The current work presents an alternative approach to membrane design for biomass related separations. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved

AB  - Characterization and anti-tumor activity of chemical conjugation of doxorubicin (DOX) in polymeric micelles were investigated. Polymeric micelles with chemical conjugation of doxorubicin (DOX-P) were prepared. Succinic anhydride activated pluronic F68 was first synthesized and the primary amine group in doxorubicin was conjugated to the terminal carboxyl of pluronic F68 via a amide. The resulting polymeric micelles in aqueous solution were characterized by measurement of size, xi-potential, drug loading and critical micelle concentration. From characterization results, DOX-P micelles had superiorities over physically-loaded DOX micelles in loading efficiency, diameter and CMC value. From drug release experiment in vitro, DOX-P micelles reached a sustained release profile for DOX. The cytotoxic activity of the micelles against A549/DOX cells was greater than free DOX. Fluorescence microscope observation and flow cytometry analysis supported the enhanced cellular uptake of the micelles. From A549/DOX cells experiments, DOX-P micelles could enhance DOX anti-tumor activity and circumvent the multi-drug resistance (MDR) of A549/DOX cells. With low CMC value, high loading efficiency, nanometer diameter, good penetration ability and controlled release behaviour, DOX-P micelles might be developed as a new cancer targeted delivery system.

AB  - We have explored a novel dual-function stationary phase which combines both strong cation exchange (SCX) and hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) characteristics. The novel dual-function stationary phase is based on porous and spherical silica gel functionalized with ligand containing sulfonic and benzyl groups capable of electrostatic and hydrophobic interaction functionalities, which displays HIC character in a high salt concentration, and IEC character in a low salt concentration in mobile phase employed. As a result, it can be employed to separate proteins with SCX and HIC modes, respectively. The resolution and selectivity of the dual-function stationary phase were evaluated under both HIC and SCX modes with standard proteins and can be comparable to that of conventional IEC and HIC columns. More than 96% of mass and bioactivity recoveries of proteins can be achieved in both HIC and SCX modes, respectively. The results indicated that the novel dual-function column could replace two individual SCX and HIC columns for protein separation. Mixed retention mechanism of proteins on this dual-function column based on stoichiometric displacement theory (SOT) in LC was investigated to find the optimal balance of the magnitude of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between protein and the ligand on the silica surface in order to obtain high resolution and selectivity for protein separation. In addition, the effects of the hydrophobicity of the ligand of the dual-function packings and pH of the mobile phase used on protein separation were also investigated in detail. The results show that the ligand with suitable hydrophobicity to match the electrostatic interaction is very important to prepare the dual-function stationary phase, and a better resolution and selectivity can be obtained at pH 6.5 in SCX mode. Therefore, the dual-function column can replace two individual SCX and HIC columns for protein separation and be used to set up two-dimensional liquid chromatography with a single column (2DLC-1C), which can also be employed to separate three kinds of active proteins completely, such as lysozyme, ovotransferrin and ovalbumin from egg white. The result is very important not only to the development of new 2DLC technology with a single column for proteomics, but also to recombinant protein drug production for saving column expense and simplifying the process in biotechnology.

AB  - Objective: To understand the different patterns of cue-induced craving and physiological reactions among recently abstinent and long-abstinent heroin-dependent patients. Method: 26 healthy adult controls (HC), 29 long-abstinent (more than 1 year, LA), and 26 recently abstinent (less than 1 month, RA) heroin-dependent individuals were exposed to heroin-related and neutral video cues, one video per session, on different days in random order. Self-reported heroin craving by a 10-point visual analog scale (VAS), physiological reactions [skin conductance (SC), muscle electromyography (MEG), skin temperature (TEMP)] and cardiovascular arousal [heart rates (HR), systolic blood pressure (HBP) and diastolic blood pressure (LBP)] were assessed at baseline and after exposure. Results: Both heroin-abstinent groups showed increased heroin craving, SC, MEG, HR. SBP and LBP after exposure to heroin-related video, compared to the control group and compared to exposure to the neutral video. Except the RA group showed more HR changes, changes of heroin craving, SC, MEG, HR, SBP and LBP after exposure to the heroin cue video were not different between the LA and RA groups. Conclusions: Abstinent heroin-dependent patients had elevated craving and physiological reactions after exposure to videos containing heroin-related cues and the cue induced responses still occurred in long-abstinent patients. This phenomenon should be addressed in treatment and recovery services for heroin dependence. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved

AB  - Cancer comprehensive treatment has been fully recognized as it can provide an effective multi-modality approach for fighting cancers. This work evaluates the effects of a kind of novel solar-planet structured magnetic nanocomposites (MNCs) for magnetic thermochemotherapy. Amino silane coated magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) as agent of magnetic mediated hyperthermia (MMH) for cancer treatment were prepared by the chemical precipitation method. Docetaxel (an anticancer drug) loaded polymeric nanoparticles (DNPs) composed of carboxylic-terminated poly (D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) with Vitamin E TPGS as emulsifier for sustained drug release were prepared by a modified solvent extraction/evaporation technique. Furthermore, the MNPs modified with amino groups could be covalently attached to the surface of carboxylic terminated DNPs to form the so-called solar-planet structured MNCs by 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl aminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) crosslinking. The prepared solar-planet structure has been confirmed by fluorescent observation. Inductive heating property of the nanocomposite was evaluation by monitoring the temperature increase of the MNCs suspension under alternative magnetic field (AMF). Drug encapsulation efficacy and drug release of the magnetic nanocomposite were conducted by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In vitro evaluation of the novel nanocomposite as mediator for thermochemotherapy was conducted on the U251 human glioma cells and the synergistic effect between MMH and docetaxel chemotherapy was confirmed. All the observation supports that solar-planet structured MNC is a novel and effective mediator for magnetic thermochemotherapy. The MNCs can realize cancer comprehensive treatment thus has great potential in clinical application

AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a socially detrimental psychiatric disorder, contributing to increased healthcare expenditures and suicide rates. However, no empirical laboratory-based tests are available to support the diagnosis of MDD. In this study, a NMR-based plasma metabonomic method for the diagnosis of MDD was tested. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR) spectra of plasma sampled from first-episode drug-naive depressed patients (n = 58) and healthy controls (n = 42) were recorded and analyzed by orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). The OPLS-DA score plots of the spectra demonstrated that the depressed patient group was significantly distinguishable from the healthy control group. Moreover, the method accurately diagnosed blinded samples (n = 26) in an independent replication cohort with a sensitivity and specificity of 92.8% and 83.3%, respectively. Taken together, NMR-based plasma metabonomics may offer an accurate empirical laboratory-based method applicable to the diagnosis of MDD

AB  - Psychological constructs, such as negative affect and substance use cravings that closely predict relapse, show substantial intraindividual day-to-day variability. This intraindividual variability of relevant psychological states combined with the one day at a time nature of sustained abstinence warrant a day-to-day investigation of substance use recovery. This study examines day-to-day associations among substance use cravings, negative affect, and tobacco use among 30 college students in 12-step recovery from drug and alcohol addictions. To account for individual variability in day-to-day process, it applies an idiographic approach. The sample of 20 males and 10 females (mean age = 21) was drawn from members of a collegiate recovery community at a large university. Data were collected with end-of-day data collections taking place over an average of 26.7 days. First-order vector autoregression models were fit to each individual predicting daily levels of substance use cravings, negative affect, and tobacco use from the same 3 variables 1 day prior. Individual model results demonstrated substantial interindividual differences in intraindividual recovery process. Based on estimates from individual models, cluster analyses were used to group individuals into 2 homogeneous subgroups. Group comparisons demonstrate distinct patterns in the day-to-day associations among substance use cravings, negative affect, and tobacco use, suggesting the importance of idiographic approaches to recovery management and that the potential value of focusing on negative affect or tobacco use as prevention targets depends on idiosyncratic processes

AB  - One of the most important factors, affecting significantly the overall pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of a drug, is its binding to plasma protein (PPB). In the present study, we focus on a set of 132 diverse acidic drugs binding to plasma proteins to different extent and develop quantitative structure-plasma protein binding relationships (QSPPBR) to predict their unbound fraction in plasma (fu) using 178 molecular descriptors. QSPPBR models were derived after variable selection by genetic algorithm followed by stepwise regression and tested by cross- and external validation. The final model has r2 value of 0.771, q2 value of 0.737, and four outliers. It predicts 57% of the fu values with less than twofold error. According to the molecular descriptors selected as the most predictive for PPB, the lipophilicity of the drugs, the presence of aromatic rings, cyano groups, and H-bond donoracceptor pairs increase the PPB, whereas the presence of tertiary carbon atoms, four-member rings, and iodine atoms decrease PPB. These descriptors were summarized into a short seven-item checklist of criteria responsible for PPB. The checklist could be used as a guide for evaluation of PPB of acidic drug candidates, similarly to the Lipinski's rule of five used for evaluation of oral permeability of drugs.

AB  - TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-inducible 14 (Fn14) are a TNF superfamily ligand-receptor pair involved in many cellular processes including proliferation, migration, differentiation, inflammation, and angiogenesis. The Fn14 receptor is expressed at relatively low levels in normal tissues, but it is known to be dramatically elevated in a number of tumor types, including brain and breast tumors. Thus, it seems to be an excellent candidate for therapeutic intervention. We first analyzed Fn14 expression in human tumor cell lines. Fn14 was expressed in a variety of lines including breast, brain, bladder, skin, lung, ovarian, pancreatic, colon, prostate, and cervical cancer cell lines. We then developed an immunoconjugate containing a high-affinity anti-Fn14 monoclonal antibody (ITEM-4) conjugated to recombinant gelonin (rGel), a highly cytotoxic ribosome-inactivating N-glycosidase. Both ITEM-4 and the conjugate were found to bind to cells to an equivalent extent. Confocal microscopic analysis showed that ITEM4-rGel specifically and rapidly (within 2 hours) internalized into Fn14-positive T-24 bladder cancer cells but not into Fn14-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Cytotoxicity studies against 22 different tumor cell lines showed that ITEM4-rGel was highly cytotoxic to Fn14-expressing cells and was 8- to 8 x 10(4)-fold more potent than free rGel. ITEM4-rGel was found to kill cells by inducing apoptosis with high-mobility group box 1 protein release. Finally, ITEM4-rGel immunoconjugate administration promoted long-term tumor growth suppression in nude mice bearing T-24 human bladder cancer cell xenografts. Our data support the use of an antibody-drug conjugate approach to selectively target and inhibit the growth of Fn14-expressing tumors. Mol Cancer Ther; 10(7); 1276-88. (C) 2011 AACR

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Xiaoyaosan (XYS), composed of Radix Bupleuri, Radix Angelicae Sinensis, Radix Paeoniae Alba, Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae, Poria, Herba Menthae, Rhizoma Zingiberis Recens and Radix Glycyrrhizae, is a valuable traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) which is used for the treatment of depression in China. In the formula, Radix Bupleuri usually serves as the principal drug, Radix Angelicae Sinensis and Radix Paeoniae Alba serve as the ministerial drugs, Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae, Poria, Herba Menthae and Rhizoma Zingiberis Recens serve as adjunctive drugs, Radix Glycyrrhizae serves as messenger drug, they coordinate with each other and enhance the effect of the formula. In our previous experiments, the antidepressant effect of XYS was revealed. However, the antidepressant part (or component) of this prescription was still obscure. We divided the XYS into five different polar fractions, and explored the antidepressant activity of five different polar fractions to identify the active fraction. Materials and methods: Behavior research and metabonomics method based on (1)H NMR were used for efficacy study of different fractions in chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model of depression. Rats were divided into 8 groups and drugs were administered during the 21 days model building period. The urine samples of rats were collected overnight (12 h) on 21 day and the metabolic profiling of the urine was measured using NMR. Multivariate analysis was also utilized to evaluate the active fraction of XYS. Results: In the behavior research, there were significant difference between the lipophilic fraction group (XY-A) and the model group. In addition, with pattern recognition analysis of urinary metabolites, the results showed a clear separation of the model group and control group, while XY-A group was much closer to the control group in the OSC-PLS score plot. Seven endogenous metabolites contributing to the separation of the model group and control group were detected, while XY-A group regulated the 5 perturbed metabolites showing a tendency of recovering to control group. Conclusions: The present work suggested that petroleum ether fraction was the most effective fraction, implying that lipophilic components contribute to the antidepressant effect of XYS.

AB  - Background and purpose: Studies have shown that the administration of Taxol, an anticancer drug, inhibited scar formation, promoted axonal elongation and improved locomotor recovery in rats after spinal cord injury (SCI). We hypothesized that combining Taxol with another promising therapy, transplantation of human umbilical mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs), might further improve the degree of locomotor recovery. The present study examined whether Taxol combined with transplantation of hUCMSCs would produce synergistic effects on recovery and which mechanisms were involved in the effect. Methods: A total of 32 rats subjected to SCI procedures were assigned to one of the following four treatment groups: phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, control), hUCMSCs, Taxol, or Taxol+hUCMSCs. Immediately after injury, hUCMSCs were transplanted into the injury site and Taxol was administered intrathecally for 4 weeks. Locomotor recovery was evaluated using the Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan locomotor (BBB) rating scale. Survival of the transplanted human cells and the host glial reaction in the injured spinal cord were studied by immunohistochemistry. Results: Treatment with Taxol, hUCMSCs or Taxol+hUCMSCs reduced the extent of astrocytic activation, increased axonal preservation and decreased the number of caspase-3(+) and ED-1(+) cells, but these effects were more pronounced in the Taxol+hUCMSCs group. Behavioral analyses showed that rats in the Taxol+hUCMSCs group showed better motor performance than rats treated with hUCMSCs or Taxol only. Conclusions: The combination of Taxol and hUCMSCs produced beneficial effects in rats with regard to functional recovery following SCI through the enhancement of anti-inflammatory, anti-astrogliosis, anti-apoptotic and axonal preservation effects.

AB  - This work presented a new analytical methodology based on hydrophilic interaction ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry in multiple-reaction monitoring mode for analysis of 24 underivatized free amino acids (FAAs) in functional foods. The proposed method was first reported and validated by assessing the matrix effects, linearity, limit of detections and limit of quantifications, precision, repeatability, stability and recovery of all target compounds, and it was used to determine the nutritional substances of FAAs in ginkgo seeds and further elucidate the nutritional value of this functional food. The result showed that ginkgo seed turned out to be a good source of FAAs with high levels of several essential FAAs and to have a good nutritional value. Furthermore, the principal component analysis was performed to classify the ginkgo seed samples on the basis of 24 FAAs. As a result, the samples could be mainly clustered into three groups, which were similar to areas classification. Overall, the presented method would be useful for the investigation of amino acids in edible plants and agricultural products

Intraperitoneal (IP) administration of EEC, in all the tested dose levels (100 to 300 mg/kg), exhibited significant dose-related inhibition of acetic acid-induced writhing and formalin induced nociception, exhibited significant dose-related inhibition of carrageenin and serotonin induced paw oedema volumes when compared with the untreated (control) group, also exerted a significant reduction in granuloma weight in the cotton pellet induced granuloma model. Furthermore, EEC presented effective inhibitory effect on 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radicals, OH. radicals. The results described here are the first report of pharmacological studies of C. discoidea and indicate that this plant has antinociceptive, antiinflammatory, and antioxidant activities which support its folk medicine use

AB  - SCH-351448 is a 28-membered C2-symmetric macrocyclic metabolite isolated from the fermentation broth of a Micromonospora microorganism. This macrodiolide selectively activates transcription of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) promoter, which is important in the treatment of people with high cholesterol levels. The biological potential as well as the intriguing structure of this natural product prompted us to initiate synthetic studies towards its preparation. A convergent, enantioselective total synthesis of (+)-SCH 351448 was achieved. The tetrahydropyran ring systems in both fragments were constructed through our organosilane-based [4+2]-annulation methodology. Olefin cross metathesis was utilized in the union of two advanced fragments to generate the monomeric subunit. A metal-template directed macrodimerization strategy was examined but proved unsuccessful. Thus, the macrodiolide was assembled through a two-step sequence involving dioxinone ring-opening with concomitant esterification followed by DMC/DMAP mediated macrolactonization. Due to the prevalence of nitrogen-containing heterocycles in many natural products and pharmaceutical agents, the development of efficient methods for N -incorporation has remained at the forefront of synthetic research. Transition metal-catalyzed nitrene chemistry, an effective method to incorporate N-containing functionality into simple organic substrates, has become an attractive field for direct carbon-nitrogen bond formation. Of particular interest in this area is the metallonitrene/alkyne cycloaddition cascade reaction, a process in which nitrenes formed from sulfamate esters undergo addition to alkynes. In light of this, homopropargylic ethers, derived from chiral allenylsilanes in high yields and levels of diastereoselectivity, were converted into sulfamate esters bearing an internal alkyne. The generated sulfamate esters then underwent a metallonitrene cycloaddition and a subsequent highly stereoselective dearomative cyclopropanation, which resulted in unique tetracyclic norcaradiene-like products with two contiguous quaternary stereocenters. After subsequent opening of the sulfamate ester ring, the norcaradiene scaffold rearranged via a 6�_ electrocyclic ring opening process to form a fused tricyclic cycloheptatriene

AB  - Osteoporosis (OP) and osteoarthritis (OA) are major health problems in the increasing elderly population, particularly in postmenopausal women, but their relationship remains unclear. The present study investigated whether alendronate (ALN), a potent inhibitor of bone resorption, could protect articular cartilage from degeneration in a combined animal model of OP and OA induced by ovariectomy (OVX). Seventy-eight seven-month-old female Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned into five experimental groups: (1) sham-operated with vehicle treatment, (2) sham-operated with ALN treatment, (3) OVX with vehicle treatment, (4) ALN treatment starting at OVX, and (5) ALN treatment starting at eight weeks after OVX. Histological and micro-CT analyses, together with urine collagen degradation markers, indicated that early ALN treatment completely prevented both subchondral bone loss and cartilage surface erosion induced by OVX. Although late ALN treatment also inhibited subchondral bone loss and significantly reduced cartilage erosion in the OVX rats, these tissues did not completely recover even after 10-weeks of ALN treatment. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses showed that the protective effect of ALN correlated with increased ratio of OPG/RANKL in both subchondral bone and cartilage. Moreover, whereas OVX caused upregulation of expression of matrix metalloproteinases MMP-13 and MMP-9 in the articular cartilage and chondrocytes in the interface between the articular cartilage and subchondral bone, respectively, early ALN treatment blocked whereas late ALN treatment attenuated the upregulation of these catabolic enzymes in the corresponding tissues. Together, these data indicate that the subchondral bone loss plays an important role in OA pathogenesis in the combined OP and OA model and suggest that treatment timing is an important factor for the effectiveness of anti-resorptive drug therapy of combined OP and OA.

AB  - Objectives: To summarize the pathotyping and clinical manifestations of biliary cast syndrome in patients after an orthotopic liver transplant. Materials and Methods: The clinical manifestations, auxiliary examination, therapeutic regimen, and clinical efficacy of 103 biliary cast syndrome patients who underwent an orthotopic liver transplant were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into 6 groups from type 1 to type 6, according to the injury level of the biliary duct epithelium. Results: Many biliary cast syndrome patients showed symptoms including jaundice, dark urine, argillaceous stool, itchy skin, and fever. Serum levels of alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin were increased. In addition, total white cell counts in peripheral blood also were increased. T-tube cholangiography showed filling defects of various amounts. Optical fiber choledochoscope examination revealed that the biliary tract was filled with solid substances, and necrosis of the biliary tract epithelium was observed in some biliary cast syndrome patients. From type 1 to type 6 biliary cast syndrome patients, the probability of clinical symptoms and biliary tract stricture gradually increased, the time needed for supporting gradually prolonged after removal of the biliary cast, and T-tube cholangiography showed that the filling defects gradually expanded. Conclusions: Clinical manifestations and cholangiography presentations mainly depend on pathotyping

AB  - Granulocyte-colony-stimulating factors are helpful for the support of patients receiving autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, resulting in faster neutrophil recovery and lower incidence of febrile neutropenia (FN). Our aim was to evaluate the use of pegfilgrastim vs. filgrastim with regard to absolute neutrophil count (ANC) recovery, risk, and duration of FN and length of hospital stay. Mean difference was the summary effect for continuous data, and odds ratio for binary data, using random-effects modeling. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Registry of Randomized Controlled Trials were included in the search. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), case-control studies, and studies with historical control group for filgrastim were eligible. Of the initial 114 studies screened, 12 studies were analyzed (four were RCTs, including one phase III trial). The use of pegfilgrastim resulted in a one d gain in ANC recovery (mean difference -0.82, 95% CI -1.07 to -0.57, p < 0.001) and duration of FN (-0.67, 95% CI -1.28 to -0.06, p < 0.001) but had no effect on the risk of FN or length of stay. Pegfilgrastim was more expensive (baseline marginal cost (sic) 116.97, p < 0.001), which was largely determined by the treatment duration and pegfilgrastim cost. Non-randomized setting attenuated the effect on duration of FN whereas delayed onset of filgrastim injections (to pegfilgrastim) overestimated the protective effect on the risk of FN. Both drugs are at least equally effective, though methodology and disease stratification in published trials warrant further improvement

AB  - Dendrimers are highly branched macromolecules with the potential to be used for biomedical applications. Several dendrimers are toxic owing to their positively charged surfaces. However, this toxicity can be reduced by coating these peripheral cationic groups with carbohydrate residues. In this study, the toxicity of three types of 4th generation poly (propyleneimine) dendrimers were investigated in vivo; uncoated (PPI-g4) dendrimers, and dendrimers in which 25% or 100% of surface amino groups were coated with maltotriose (PPI-g4-25% m or PPI-g4-100% m), were administered to Wistar rats. Body weight, food and water consumption, and urine excretion were monitored daily. Blood was collected to investigate biochemical and hematological parameters, and the general condition and behavior of the animals were analyzed. Unmodified PPI dendrimers caused changes in the behavior of rats, a decrease in food and water consumption, and lower body weight gain. In the case of PPI-g4 and PPI-g4-25% m dendrimers, disturbances in urine and hematological and biochemical profiles returned to normal during the recovery period. PPI-g4-100% m was harmless to rats. The PPI dendrimers demonstrated dose-and sugar-modification-degree dependent toxicity. A higher dose of uncoated PPI dendrimers caused toxicity, but surface modification almost completely abolished this toxic effect. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Taliglucerase alfa (Protalix Biotherapeutics, Carmiel, Israel) is a novel plant cell-derived recombinant human beta-glucocerebrosidase for Gaucher disease. A phase 3, double-blind, randomized, parallelgroup, comparison-dose (30 vs 60 U/kg body weight/infusion) multinational clinical trial was undertaken. Institutional review board approvals were received. A 9-month, 20-infusion trial used inclusion/exclusion criteria in treatmentnaive adult patients with splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia. Safety end points were drug-related adverse events: Ab formation and hypersensitivity reactions. Primary efficacy end point was reduction in splenic volume measured by magnetic resonance imaging. Secondary end points were: changes in hemoglobin, hepatic volume, and platelet counts. Exploratory parameters included biomarkers and bone imaging. Twenty-nine patients (11 centers) completed the protocol. There were no serious adverse events; drug-related adverse events were mild/moderate and transient. Two patients (6%) developed non-neutralizing IgG Abs; 2 other patients (6%) developed hypersensitivity reactions. Statistically significant spleen reductionwas achieved at 9 months: 26.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: -31.9, -21.8) in the 30-unit dose group and 38.0% (95% CI: -43.4, -32.8) in the 60-unit dose group (both P < .0001); and in all secondary efficacy end point measures, except platelet counts at the lower dose. These results support safety and efficacy of taliglucerase alfa for Gaucher disease. This study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00376168. (Blood. 2011;118(22):5767-5773)

AB  - Rape is an established risk factor for mental health disorders, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive episodes (MDE), and substance use disorders. The majority of studies have not differentiated substance-involved rape or examined comorbid diagnoses among victims. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to estimate the prevalence of common trauma-related psychiatric disorders (and their comorbidity) in a national sample of women, with an emphasis on distinguishing between rape tactics. A secondary objective was to estimate the risk for psychiatric disorders among victims of variant rape tactics, in comparison to non-victims. A nationally representative population-based sample of 3,001 non-institutionalized, civilian, English or Spanish speaking women (aged 18-86 years) participated in a structured telephone interview assessing rape history and DSM-IV criteria for PTSD, MDE, alcohol abuse (AA), and drug abuse (DA). Descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regression analyses were employed. Women with rape histories involving both substance facilitation and forcible tactics reported the highest current prevalence of PTSD (36%), MDE (36%), and AA (20%). Multivariate models demonstrated that this victim group was also at highest risk for psychiatric disorders, after controlling for demographics and childhood and multiple victimization history. Women with substance-facilitated rapes reported higher prevalence of substance abuse in comparison to women with forcible rape histories. Comorbidity between PTSD and other psychiatric disorders was higher among rape victims in comparison to non-rape victims. Researchers and clinicians should assess substance-facilitated rape tactics and attend to comorbidity among rape victims. Empirically supported treatments are needed to address the complex presentations observed among women with variant rape histories

AB  - Oxidative stress causes profound alterations of various biological structures, including cellular membranes, lipids, proteins and nucleic acids, and it is involved in numerous malignancies. Reduced glutathione (GSH) is considered to be one of the most important scavengers of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and its ratio with oxidised glutathione (GSSG) may be used as a marker of oxidative stress. The main aim of this study was to determine GSH:GSSG ratio in the blood serum of paediatric cancer patients to use this ratio as a potential marker of oxidative stress. The whole procedure was optimised and the recoveries for both substances were greater than 80% under the optimised conditions. We analysed a group of paediatric patients (n=116) with various types of cancer, including neuroblastoma, anaplastic ependymoma, germ cell tumour, genital tract tumour, lymphadenopathy, rhabdomyosarcoma, nephroblastoma, Ewing's sarcoma, osteosarcoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, medulloblastoma and retinoblastoma. We simultaneously determined the levels of reduced and oxidised glutathione, and thus, its ratio in the blood serum of the patients. The highest ratio was observed in retinoblastoma patients and the lowest in anaplastic ependymoma. We were able to distinguish between the diagnoses based on the results of the obtained GSH:GSSG ratio

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cyclo-oxygenase 2 inhibitors can be used for pain treatment after colorectal surgery. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate whether the use of etoricoxib has negative effects on the perioperative outcome in colorectal surgery. DESIGN: Complication data from an advanced medical database system were sampled prospectively, and patient records were reviewed retrospectively. PATIENTS: All patients with elective colorectal surgery within an enhanced recovery after surgery protocol from 2008 to 2009 were selected. INTERVENTION: The nonrandomized use of perioperative etoricoxib treatment was compared with a control group. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measured was the number of patients with postoperative complications according to the Dindo-Clavien classification. RESULTS: One hundred one patients received etoricoxib treatment, whereas 104 did not. The patient groups were very comparable. We observed a significant increase in the number of patients with postoperative complications with etoricoxib treatment (43 vs 30 patients; 42.6% vs 28.8%, p = 0.041) due to an increase in patients with a major complication (Dindo-Clavien complication grade II-V: 22.8% vs 9.6%, p = 0.01). Patients with etoricoxib treatment and a complication needed a longer recovery period than patients with a complication in the control group (18 (17; 20) vs 14 (13; 15) days, p = 0.05). We observed an increased level of postoperative serum creatinine with etoricoxib treatment (105 (98; 112) vs 82 (78; 85), p = 0.003), which was more pronounced in patients with a complication (141 (127; 155) vs 91 (83; 98), p = 0.002; 25 vs 8 patients with serum creatinine >100 mu mol/L, p = 0.008). In multivariate analysis, etoricoxib was identified as an independent risk factor for experiencing a major complication with a risk increase of approximately 2.5-fold (p = 0.03). LIMITATIONS: This study was limited by the nonrandomized use of perioperative etoricoxib and the retrospective nature of its review of patient records. CONCLUSIONS: Etoricoxib increased the number of patients with postoperative complications and should be considered carefully in colorectal surgery

AB  - Background: Isoflurane-anesthetized rats subjected to traumatic brain injury (TBI) show a transient reduction in blood L-glutamate levels. Having previously observed that isoproterenol produces a sustained decrease in blood glutamate levels in naive rats, we investigated the possible effects of nonselective and selective beta 1 and beta 2 adrenergic agonists and antagonists both on blood glutamate levels and on the neurological outcomes of rats subjected to TBI. Methods: Rats received either 10mL/kg of isotonic saline 1 hour after TBI, 50 mu g/kg of isoproterenol pretreatment 30 minutes before TBI, 10mg/kg of propranolol pretreatment 60 minutes before TBI, 10mg/kg of metoprolol pretreatment 60 minutes before TBI, or 10mg/kg of butaxamine pretreatment 40 minutes before TBI and 10 minutes before pretreatment with 50 mu g/kg isoproterenol or 10 mg/kg of propranolol 60 minutes after TBI. A neurological severity score (NSS) was measured at 1, 24, and 48 hours after TBI. Blood glutamate, blood glucose, mean arterial blood pressure, and heart rate were measured at the time of drug injection, at the time of TBI, 60 minutes after TBI, and 90 minutes after TBI. Results: Blood glutamate levels decreased spontaneously by 60 minutes after TBI in the control group (P< 0.05), reverting to baseline levels by 90 minutes after TBI. A pretreatment with either 10mg/kg of metoprolol 60 minutes before TBI or with 50 mu g/kg of isoproterenol 30 minutes before TBI also reduced blood glutamate levels (P< 0.05) both at 90 minutes after TBI and improved the NSS measured 24 and 48 hours after TBI in comparison with the control saline-treated group. However, a 10-mg/kg butoxamine pretreatment 40 minutes before TBI and 10 minutes before pretreatment with 50 mu g/kg of isoproterenol or 10mg/kg of propranolol 60 minutes before TBI neither affected blood glutamate levels across time after TBI nor caused any significant change in the NSS measured 24 and 48 hours after TBI in comparison with the control saline-treated group. A strong correlation (r(2) = 0.73) was demonstrated between the percent decrease in blood glutamate levels at 90 minutes after TBI and the percent improvement of NSS measured 24 hours after TBI. Conclusions: The results suggest that the transient blood glutamate reduction seen after TBI is the result of a stress response and of the activation of the sympathetic nervous system through the beta 2 adrenergic receptors, causing an increase of the brain-to-blood efflux of glutamate observed with excess brain glutamate levels after a brain insult. This strongly correlates with the neurological improvement observed 24 hours after TBI

AB  - BACKGROUND: In this study, we evaluated the influence of propofol versus desflurane anesthesia in overweight patients on postoperative lung function and pulse oximetry values. METHODS: We prospectively studied 134 patients with body mass indices of 25 to 35 kg/m(2) undergoing minor peripheral surgery lasting 40 to 120 minutes. Patients were randomly assigned to receive propofol (total IV anesthesia) or desflurane anesthesia via a tracheal tube targeting bispectral index values of 40 to 60. Premedication, adjuvant drug usage, and ventilation were standardized. We measured oxyhemoglobin saturation and lung function preoperatively (baseline), and at 10 minutes, 0.5 hour, 2 hours, and 24 hours after tracheal extubation. All values were measured with the patient supine, in a 30 head-up position. Changes from preoperative baseline values were first analyzed for the impact of body mass index and type of anesthesia using univariate methods, followed by linear regression and multivariate analysis of variance. RESULTS: Within the first 2 hours after surgery, the propofol group displayed lower oxyhemoglobin saturation (at 2 hours, mean +/- SD, 93.8% +/- 2.0% vs 94.6% +/- 2.1%; P < 0.007) and lung function (forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume exhaled in 1 second [FEV(1)], peak expiratory flow, midexpiratory flow [MEF], forced inspiratory vital capacity, and peak inspiratory flow; between 11% and 20% larger reduction from baseline in the propofol group, all P < 0.001) compared with the desflurane group. Even 24 hours after surgery, FEV1, peak expiratory flow, MEF, forced inspiratory vital capacity, and peak inspiratory flow were reduced more in the propofol group (all P < 0.01). At 2 hours after extubation, increasing obesity was associated with decreasing FEV1 and MEF in patients anesthetized with propofol but not desflurane (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: We conclude that, for superficial surgical procedures of up to 120 minutes, maintenance of anesthesia with propofol impairs early postoperative lung function and pulse oximetry values more than with desflurane. Furthermore, increasing obesity decreases pulmonary function at 2 hours after propofol anesthesia but not after desflurane anesthesia. (Anesth Analg 2011;113:63-9)

AB  - Varre-Sai, the most recent Brazilian meteorite fall, on June 19th, 2010 at Varre-Sai, in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil (20A degrees 51'41aEuro(3)S; 41A degrees 44'.80aEuro(3)W). At least eight masses (total 3.5 kg) were recovered. Most are totally covered by fusion crust. The exposed interior is of light-grey colour with a few dark shock veins. Five thin polished and etched sections were prepared from a slice weighing 35 g on deposit at the National Museum/UFRJ. It consists mostly of chondrules ranging in size from 0.35 to 2.2 mm, and chondrule fragments enclosed in a crystalline matrix. The matrix consists of tiny isolated subhedral and anhedral crystals and opaque minerals that are intergrown with broken chondrules. The chondritic texture is poorly defined with chondrule textures that vary from non-porphyritic to porphyritic ones. The essential minerals are olivine (Fa(25 +/- 0.2)) and low-Ca pyroxene (Fa(21.66 +/- 0.2)Wo(1.4)). Accessory minerals are plagioclase, apatite, Fe-Ni metal phases, troilite, chromite and magnetite. Mossbauer spectroscopy analysis confirms that the mineral phases are olivine, pyroxene, troilite and kamacite/taenite. Chemical data indicate that Varre-Sai is a member of the low iron L chondrite group. The observed texture and mineral phases led us to classify Varre-Sai as an equilibrated petrologic type 5. The shock features of the minerals (undulatory extinction, planar structure and numerous cracks), as well as plagioclase partial or totally transformed to maskelynite, suggest a shock stage S4. Also, some post-impact metamorphic processes could be inferred from the meta-sulfide conjoint grains that show complex mixtures of kamacite-taenite-tetrataenite and troilite. The occurrence of veins crosscutting the studied sections indicates that Varre-Sai was affected by a late fracturing event. Sealing of these fractures must have been a fast process, as shown by troilite globule textures pointing towards rapid solidification. The meteorite name was approved by the Nomenclature Committee of the Meteoritical Society (Meteoritic Bulletin, no 99)

AB  - The "glutamate" theory of schizophrenia emerged from the observation that phencyclidine (PCP), an open channel antagonist of the NMDA subtype of glutamate receptor, induces schizophrenia-like behaviors in humans. PCP also induces a complex set of behaviors in animal models of this disorder. PCP also increases glutamate and dopamine release in the medial prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens, brain regions associated with expression of psychosis. Increased motor activation is among the PCP-induced behaviors that have been widely validated as models for the characterization of new antipsychotic drugs. The peptide transmitter N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) activates a group II metabotropic receptor, mGluR3. Polymorphisms in this receptor have been associated with schizophrenia. Inhibitors of glutamate carboxypeptidase II, an enzyme that inactivates NAAG following synaptic release, reduce several behaviors induced by PCP in animal models. This research tested the hypothesis that two structurally distinct NAAG peptidase inhibitors, ZJ43 and 2-(phosphonomethyl)-pentane- 1,5-dioic acid, would elevate levels of synaptically released NAAG and reduce PCP-induced increases in glutamate and dopamine levels in the medial prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens. NAAG-like immunoreactivity was found in neurons and presumptive synaptic endings in both regions. These peptidase inhibitors reduced the motor activation effects of PCP while elevating extracellular NAAG levels. They also blocked PCP-induced increases in glutamate but not dopamine or its metabolites. The mGluR2/3 antagonist LY341495 blocked these behavioral and neurochemical effects of the peptidase inhibitors. The data reported here provide a foundation for assessment of the neurochemical mechanism through which NAAG achieves its antipsychotic-like behavioral effects and support the conclusion NAAG peptidase inhibitors warrant further study as a novel antipsychotic therapy aimed at mGluR3

AB  - Background: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by high levels of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity that are present before the age of seven years, seen in a range of situations, inconsistent with the child's developmental level and causing social or academic impairment. Parent training programmes are psychosocial interventions aimed at training parents in techniques to enable them to manage their children's challenging behaviour.Objectives: To determine whether parent training interventions are effective in reducing ADHD symptoms and associated problems in children aged between five and eigtheen years with a diagnosis of ADHD, compared to controls with no parent training intervention.Search methods: We searched the following electronic databases (for all available years until September 2010): CENTRAL (2010, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1950 to 10 September 2010), EMBASE (1980 to 2010 Week 36), CINAHL (1937 to 13 September 2010), PsycINFO (1806 to September Week 1 2010), Dissertation Abstracts International (14 September 2010) and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (14 September 2010). We contacted experts in the field to ask for details of unpublished or ongoing research.Selection criteria: Randomised (including quasi-randomised) studies comparing parent training with no treatment, a waiting list or treatment as usual (adjunctive or otherwise). We included studies if ADHD was the main focus of the trial and participants were over five years old and had a clinical diagnosis of ADHD or hyperkinetic disorder that was made by a specialist using the operationalised diagnostic criteria of the DSM-III/DSM-IV or ICD-10. We only included trials that reported at least one child outcome.Data collection and analysis: Four authors were involved in screening abstracts and at least 2 authors looked independently at each one. We reviewed a total of 12,691 studies and assessed five as eligible for inclusion. We extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in the five included trials. Opportunities for meta-analysis were limited and most data that we have reported are based on single studies.Main results: We found five studies including 284 participants that met the inclusion criteria, all of which compared parent training with de facto treatment as usual (TAU). One study included a nondirective parent support group as a second control arm. �Four studies targeted children's behaviour problems and one assessed changes in parenting skills.�Of the four studies targeting children's behaviour, two focused on behaviour at home and two focused on behaviour at school. The two studies focusing on behaviour at home had different findings: one found no difference between parent training and treatment as usual, whilst the other reported statistically significant results for parent training versus control. The two studies of behaviour at school also had different findings: one study found no difference between groups, whilst the other reported positive results for parent training when ADHD was not comorbid with oppositional defiant disorder.�In this latter study, outcomes were better for girls and for children on medication.We assessed the risk of bias in most of the studies as unclear at best and often as high. Information on randomisation and allocation concealment did not appear in any study report. Inevitably, blinding of participants or personnel was impossible for this intervention; likewise, blinding of outcome assessors (who were most often the parents who had delivered the intervention) was impossible.We were only able to conduct meta-analysis for two outcomes: child 'externalising' behaviour (a measure of rulebreaking, oppositional behaviour or aggression) and child 'internalising' behaviour (for example, withdrawal and anxiety). Meta-analysis of three studies (n = 190) providing data on externalising behaviour produced results that fell short of statistical significance (SMD -0.32; 95% CI -0.83 to 0.18, I2 = 60%). A meta-analysis of two studies (n = 142) for internalising behaviour gave significant results in the parent training groups (SMD -0.48; 95% CI -0.84 to -0.13, I2 = 9%). Data from a third study likely to have contributed to this outcome were missing, and we have some concerns about selective outcome reporting bias.Individual study results for child behaviour outcomes were mixed. Positive results on an inventory of child behaviour problems were reported for one small study (n = 24) with the caveat that results were only positive when parent training was delivered to individuals and not groups. In another study (n = 62), positive effects (once results were adjusted for demographic and baseline data) were reported for the intervention group on a social skills measure.The study (n = 48) that assessed parenting skill changes compared parent training with a nondirective parent support group.�Statistically significant improvements were reported for the parent training group. Two studies (n = 142) provided data on parent stress indices that were suitable for combining in a meta-analysis. The results were significant for the 'child' domain (MD -10.52; 95% CI -20.55 to -0.48) but not the 'parent' domain (MD -7.54; 95% CI -24.38 to 9.30). Results for this outcome from a small study (n = 24) suggested a long-term benefit for mothers who received the intervention at an individual level; in contrast, fathers benefited from short-term group treatment. A fourth study reported change data for within group measures of parental stress and found significant benefits in only one of the two active parent training group arms (P ? 0.01).No study reported data for academic achievement, adverse events or parental understanding of ADHD.Authors' conclusions: Parent training may have a positive effect on the behaviour of children with ADHD. It may also reduce parental stress and enhance parental confidence.�However, the poor methodological quality of the included studies increases the risk of bias in the results. Data concerning ADHD-specific behaviour are ambiguous. For many important outcomes, including school achievement and adverse effects, data are lacking.Evidence from this review is not strong enough to form a basis for clinical practice guidelines. Future research should ensure better reporting of the study procedures and results

AB  - Introduction . There is little published literature on female sex traffickers in the United States. The purpose of this research was to explore the lived experiences of women sex traffickers. Method . This qualitative study primarily drew on in-depth, interpretive feminist methodology. Seven women offenders from three different prisons were interviewed twice for 90 minutes. Six of the women were sex offenders. Narratives were analyzed and themes constructed. Through ongoing dialogue, the researcher was able to find meaning in, and to describe the women's experiences. Although each woman's experience was unique, there were commonalities in their narratives. Findings . Four themes emerged from the data analysis: pathways to prison, prison culture and experience, views towards victims, and giving back. The co-offender typology was the primary theme that emerged from the analysis of the transcripts. Fearing abandonment, most of the participants felt pressured by male partners to traffic children and commit other sexual offenses, often against their own children. Conclusion . Grounded in participants' experiences, this study contributes to defining sex trafficking in a broader network and structure of oppression. The in-depth, descriptive findings of this research will hopefully expand anti-sex trafficking campaign prevention, and awareness knowledge

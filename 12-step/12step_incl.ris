AB  - The extent to which young women with substance use disorders (SUDs) affiliate with Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) or other 12-Step groups is currently unclear. This administrative data analysis examined 12-Step involvement and its impact on outcome during the first 6 months following treatment among a sample of young adults attending 12-step-based residential treatment. Young women were just as likely as similar-aged young men to attend 12-Step meetings and engage in prescribed 12-Step practices like getting a sponsor. Frequency of meeting attendance predicted abstinence status and number of drinking days at 6 months in women, whereas 12-Step experiences (e.g., getting a sponsor, considering oneself an AA member) predicted drinking days in men. The results contribute to knowledge of SUDs and their treatment among women in their late teens and early twenties, a population that has been quite understudied in the literature.

AB  - Purpose: Research has shown that those with co-occurring psychiatric and substance use disorders are less likely to stay clean and sober after treatment compared to those without cooccurring psychiatric disorders. Also, empirical evidence from heterogeneous populations shows that involvement in 12-step groups (e.g. meeting attendance, sponsorship, service and having a home group), significantly increases the odds of post treatment abstinence outcomes. This analysis examined whether psychiatric severity was associated with 12-step affiliation and whether 12-step affiliation at six months post baseline was associated with 12- month post baseline outcomes. Methods: A quasi-experimental, longitudinal California treatment sample (N=508 baseline) was analyzed. Aggregated and stratified data (Baseline ASI Psychiatric severity scores of no, < median and > median) were used. Results: Using logistic regression, aggregated outcomes showed no association between baseline ASI psychiatric severity and six month 12-step outcomes. Stratified analysis for the no psychiatric severity group (N=82) showed no relationship between multiple 12-step involvement measures at six months (overall involvement using the AAI, past 30 day meeting attendance, having a sponsor, having a home group and doing service) and 12 month abstinence outcomes. There were significant and positive relationships between these same 12-step involvement measures at six months and 12 month abstinence outcomes for those in the low psychiatric group (N=128) and the high psychiatric group (N=114). Conclusion: Twelve-step involvement is an important predictor of abstinence outcomes for those with psychiatric severity. Further, clinicians should consider 12-step involvement for their comorbid psychiatric and substance using clients to increase odds of abstinence outcomes

T1  - A longitudinal comparison of urban native american and non-hispanic white 12-step attendance and substance use

AB  - This study investigated the acceptability and effectiveness of 12-step programs for urban Native Americans (NA). The study had three aims: (1) compare 12-step attendance and engagement trajectories of NA and Non-Hispanic White (NHW) adults over nine-months, (2) compare patterns of 12-step disaffiliation of the NA and NHW adults, and (3) assess if participant racial status (NA vs. NHW) moderated the lagged relationship between 12-step attendance and reductions in substance use. The sample (N = 196) was formed by merging data from two prospective longitudinal studies investigating common and 12-step specific behavior change mechanisms (R21AA016974; R01AA014197) in community-based 12-step programs. Baseline differences in substance use and help-seeking between NA (n = 66) and NHW (n = 133) adults were modest although, as a group, NA participants reported higher alcohol dependence relative to the NHW participants. Using HLM, no between-group differences were found in trajectories of 12-step attendance and engagement in prescribed 12-step practices from baseline to nine-months, with most participants attending one 12-step meeting about every 4-5 days. A random-coefficient regression model was done to see if rates of 12-step attrition differed between NA and NHW adults. Findings showed that NHW (b = .59) were significantly more likely to discontinue 12-step attendance over time relative to the NA participants (b = .05), t (529) = -2.19, p < .029. Finally, we found that racial status did not moderate the positive effect of 12-step attendance on later increases in abstinence (PDA: b = .09, t (526) = 2.13, p < .034). In contrast, racial status did moderate the effectiveness of 12- step attendance to reduce later drinking intensity, (DPDD: t (524) = 2.79, p < .006). For the NHW participants, 12-step attendance was predictive of decreased DPDD, (b = -4.76), but among NA participants 12-step attendance was predictive of later increases in drinking intensity, (b = 2.81). Findings indicated that urban NA attended 12-step programs as readily as NHW adults and that, as a group, urban NA adults reported significantly lower 12-step drop out rates. While 12-step attendance was equally beneficial to NA and NHW participants in increasing abstinence future research is required to understand how, and to what extent, racial status moderates drinking intensity

T1  - Abstinence-based social networks of dually-diagnosed individuals in twelve-step facilitation

AB  - 12-step (TS) attendance predicts increased abstinence among alcohol dependent individuals (Emrick et al., 1993), and abstinence-based social support is a significant factor accounting for the salutary eects of TS programs (Bond et al., 2003; Kelly et al., 2011). Few studies have examined the eect of TS attendance in dually-diagnosed individuals (DD) or the specific benefit of social support for DD attending TS programs. This study examined whether DD assigned to TS facilitation treatment (TSF) had greater gains in abstinence-based support than did those assigned to treatment-asusual (TAU).We also examined whether type of diagnosis (bipolar, depression, or psychosis) interacted with treatment type to predict abstinence-based social support. Participants were 121 DD individuals with an alcohol use disorder and either bipolar disorder (n = 43), depression (n = 56), or psychotic disorder (n = 22). Individuals were not excluded for illicit drug use, and 73.3%reported using drugs on an average of 42.8 of the 90 days before baseline. Participants were randomized to TAU plus 12 weekly sessions of TSF (n = 83) or TAUalone (n = 38) and completed assessments at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-treatment. The Important People and Activities inventory (IPA; Longabaugh et al., 1993) measured social networks, and the Form 90 (Miller, 1996) measured alcohol use. Analyses of variance tested whether abstinence-based social support diered as a function of diagnosis and treatment type. Measures of abstinence-based support consisted of an average of responses on the IPA in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month assessments. Results showed that, relative to individuals in TAU, those in TSF had a greater proportion of friends in recovery and more support for coming to treatment. Participants with bipolar and depressive disorders reported more general social support and support for coming to treatment relative to those with psychotic disorders. Treatment type and diagnosis did not interact to predict overall abstinence-based social support. Post-hoc analyses showed that neither proportion of friends in recovery nor support for treatment were related to percent days abstinent (PDA) from alcohol at follow-up. However, general social support did correlate with greater PDA during follow-up. Results suggest that TSF may mobilize abstinence-based social supportmore than TAU for DD individuals, consistent with the literature on changemechanisms in non-dually diagnosed 12-step participants

AB  - Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is grounded in the basic behavior analytic research on derived stimulus relations. This empirical and theoretical framework suggests that the attempt to avoid private experience (thoughts, feelings, memories, bodily sensations) is ubiquitous, and also may serve as a pathogenic process. Many psychological models of substance abuse suggest that substance abusers use, in part, to reduce (i.e., escape or avoid) stress or anxiety. The present proposal argues that the development and maintenance of abstinence may be more likely if emotional avoidance itself can be changed. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is designed to accomplish this goal. The objectives of the proposed research are to compare ACT to Twelve Step Facilitation in the development and maintenance of polysubstance-abusing methadone clients in a 24-week randomized clinical trial with a six month follow up. The specific aims are to generate sufficient data to provide a basis for a power analysis, to test the acceptability of ACT in the treatment of opiate dependent individuals, to make a preliminary evaluation of the durability of the treatment effects generated by ACT, to assess the reliability of our measures of treatment adherence and competence, to assess the relationship between treatment adherence and competence and client outcome, and to develop data on the active mechanism of change in ACT as a route to matching hypotheses to be tested in a subsequent study. The purpose of the present proposal is to increase knowledge on treatment for an extremely costly and difficult client population, whose multiple and chronic addictions have numerous related social and health costs

However, evidence has emerged that indicates there is no significant difference between the completion rate of drug users and non-users. Perhaps the ability for drug users to complete the program lies within the Twelve steps that are intertwined in the Alabama program

AB  - The current project examined the psychometric properties of an understudied assessment tool related to twelve-step group affiliation. In the first study, 184 substance dependent individuals consecutively admitted to a sober house completed the TSPQ and several relevant questionnaires. Participants had an average age of 40 years, were fairly ethnically diverse (67% white), with the majority identifying as male (72%). The TSPQ data was analyzed with exploratory factor analyses with oblique rotation, with a 3-factor model providing the best fit (RMSEA = 0.03), accounting for 47% of the variance. The three factors reflected different degrees of affiliation (Active Engagement, Active Affiliation, and Passive Affiliation) and had different patterns of correlation to measures of lifetime substance use (CAGE-AID, ASUS-Involvement), consequences due to substance use (ASUS-Disruption), and motivation to change (ASUS-Motivation to change). Further, Active Engagement predicted successful discharge from a sober house (Wald = 5.09, p < 0.05, Exp(B) = 3.34). In the second study, 219 current or former members of AA were recruited online to complete the TSPQ and several different questionnaires to further validate the factors identified in study 1. The sample was equivalent on gender (55% female), with an average age of 40 years, and 82% of the sample self-identified as White. The three factors were varyingly correlated with each other. In addition, a series of multiple regression analyses suggested that the TSPQ subscales were differentially predictive of subjective sense of well being (SWLS), extent of alcohol abuse issues (MAST), and motivation to change (SOCRATES-Recognition and SOCRATES-Taking steps). Overall, the results suggest that the TSPQ is tapping three categories of twelve-step group activity, and that affiliation can be defined in terms of different types of involvement. It appears that individuals may demonstrate a variety of attitudes and behaviors, both active and passive, that are differentially associated with established correlates of substance use consequences, motivation for change, and successful treatment outcomes. It is hoped that the TSPQ can be used to gauge level of twelve-step affiliation among treatment clients and counselors can utilize this information strategically in treatment planning to more directly tailor services and referrals

AB  - The Recovery Management paradigm provides a conceptual framework for the examination of joint impact of a focal treatment and post-treatment service utilization on substance abuse treatment outcomes. We test this framework by examining the interactive effects of a treatment for comorbid PTSD and substance use, Seeking Safety, and post-treatment Twelve-Step Affiliation (TSA) on alcohol and cocaine use. Method Data from 353 women in a six-site, randomized controlled effectiveness trial within the NIDA Clinical Trials Network were analyzed under latent class pattern mixture modeling. LCPMM was used to model variation in Seeking Safety by TSA interaction effects on alcohol and cocaine use. Results Significant reductions in alcohol use among women in Seeking Safety (compared to health education) were observed; women in the Seeking Safety condition who followed up with TSA had the greatest reductions over time in alcohol use. Reductions in cocaine use over time were also observed but did not differ between treatment conditions nor were there interactions with post-treatment TSA. Conclusions Findings advance understanding of the complexities for treatment and continuing recovery processes for women with PTSD and SUDs, and further support the chronic disease model of addiction

AB  - AIMS: This study compares the hazard of death among opiate and amphetamine using clients who accessed drug treatment with individuals who had no specialist treatment contact between 1985 and 1998 DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: This was a retrospective cohort study of 4280 drug-using individuals (2887 opiate users, 1393 amphetamine users) admitted to Perth metropolitan hospitals or Perth psychiatric institutions between 1985 and 1998. Of these, 1469 attended Next Step Specialist Drug and Alcohol Services (928 received methadone and 541 attended counselling or support groups) and 2811 had no contact with this service METHODS: Data from two drug treatment programmes were linked with hospital morbidity, psychiatric services and the mortality database using record linkage FINDINGS: The results show that people who were currently in drug treatment had a lower hazard of death compared with non-clients and those who had ceased treatment. Those who had ceased treatment more than 6 months ago had 7.0 times the hazard of all-cause death and 8.4 times the hazard of drug-cause death. Opiate users were at 1.4 times the hazard of all-cause death and 2.4 times the hazard of drug-cause death compared with amphetamine users. Males were at 1.79 times the hazard of all-cause death and, unexpectedly, were found to be at 2.69 times the hazard of drug-cause death compared with females CONCLUSIONS: Treatment protected clients from premature death compared with people who did not receive treatment and also those who ceased treatment. While amphetamine users had a lower risk of mortality compared with opiate users, the full extent of the relationship between amphetamine use and mortality needs to be examined further

AB  - The use and benefits of substance-focused 12-step mutual-help groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous by patients with both substance use and psychiatric disorders has been a subject of debate. We examined dually diagnosed patients' participation in mutual-help groups (MHGs) and the extent to which more participation was associated with better alcohol and drug outcomes up to 2 years post-treatment. The sample was 304 dually diagnosed patients entering outpatient mental health treatment who were assessed at treatment entry and 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years post-treatment for MHG attendance and involvement (engagement in 12-step practices, e.g. obtaining a sponsor), need fulfillment from MHGs, and alcohol and drug use outcomes (using the Addiction Severity Index). At baseline, 11.1% of participants had alcohol use disorders only, 23.3% had drug use disorders only, and 65.5% had both alcohol and drug use disorders. Participants reported high rates of MHG attendance at each follow-up: about three-quarters had attended at least one meeting at 6 months, and about two-thirds had attended at least one meeting at 1 and 2 years since the previous follow-up assessment. At each follow-up, patients who had attended at least one MHG meeting during the follow-up period were significantly more likely to report past 30-day abstinence from both alcohol and drugs than were non-attendees. For example, at 2 years, 71.3% of patients who had attended a MHG meeting were abstinent, versus 53.8% of those who had not (AOR = 1.89, 95% CI = 1.06- 3.37). In addition, attending a greater number of MHG meetings during the initial follow-up period was associated with better alcohol and drug abstinence rates at 6 months (AOR=1.02, CI=1.01-1.03) and 2 years (AOR=1.02, CI=1.01-1.03). Higher levels of overall MHG involvement were associated with higher rates of abstinence from both alcohol and drugs at all follow-ups; in particular, aspects of involvement that predicted abstinence were having a sponsor and having a home group. Patients who worked more of the 12 steps by the 1-year follow-up were more likely to be abstinent at 1 year, and more need fulfillment from MHGs was related to better abstinence rates at 2 years. Our results indicate that dually diagnosed patients participate in MHGs at high rates and gain positive alcohol and drug outcomes from participation. Because these patients participate in and benefit from MHGs, treatment providers should facilitate their connections to local groups

AB  - A relatively new research strategy conceptualizes process as intermediate or "micro"-outcomes. These interim behavioral targets of specific components or phases of therapy serve a dual role-they are the behavioral goals or outcomes of therapy components and they are also the key ingredients of behavioral change responsible for more traditional outcome variables (e.g., drug use). This little-researched 'micro-outcomes' process research strategy was explored within the context of a clinical trial comparing methadone maintenance enhanced with Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) or Intensive Twelve-Step Facilitation (ITSF) to a control condition (methadone maintenance) among polysubstance-abusing methadone clients. The primary dependent variables were problematic opiate and other drug use, as established by urinalysis. A Processes of Change Measure (PCM) was developed specifically to measure client "micro-outcomes". Study hypotheses primarily focused on two goals-to identify the specific processes responsible for differences in drug use across conditions (e.g., both ACT and ITSF subjects showed significantly lower total drug use, as measured by urinalysis, than did the methadone only condition) and to evaluate the performance of the PCM, and by extension, the micro-outcomes methodology. Despite some notable shortcomings, the PCM performed as well or outperformed traditional measures in explaining differential performance in treatment outcome, and in a range of functions of assessment utility, including the ability to predict successful and non-successful subjects. Using descriptive behavioral processes (micro-outcomes), based on their face validity with important therapeutic processes, offers promise as a means of conducting process research. Significant time and financial resources were saved by not studying process through more traditional methods, such as coding important moments in videotaped sessions and correlating these with outcome. Despite differences in historical development and foundational theory of substance abuse, ACT and 12-Step were similar in several areas of process. Consequently, enhancing 12-Step treatment with compatible process components from ACT (i.e., psychological acceptance and believability) may improve the effectiveness of the 12-Step model. In addition, the theoretically built-up processes associated with ACT may provide 12-Step programs with a stronger link to the broad base of psychological knowledge and the scientific method.

AB  - An estimated 23 million people in the USA are currently struggling with chemical dependence or abuse. There are 7 million people active in the judicial system, 5 million of which committed a crime related to their use of drugs and alcohol. Mandates to 12-step programs are a key tool in the judicial system but there is a 40-80% drop out rate leading to increased criminal activity and incarceration. Research clearly demonstrates that mandated treatment and 12-step fellowships reduce recidivism and addiction rates. This research conducted 42 case study interviews in Buncombe County NC. 38 of the subjects were incarcerated in the county jail with a history of court mandate to attend Narcotics Anonymous (NA). 4 of the subjects were active in the local NA fellowship. Subjects were males between the ages of 18-66 with varied backgrounds as discussed in the results section. A total engagement score was assigned to each subject based on their involvement in the five core components of NA including sponsorship, literature reading, service work in NA, obtaining a homegroup and step-work. Engagement scores were compared to categorical and quantitative data to evaluate the strength of specific relationships between variables. The use of SAS validated the narrative outcomes indicting that treatment engagement, hope that recovery is possible, desire to quit using and positive expectations for NA. Outcomes indicate the need for a program specifically designed to increase hope, desire and expectations in a treatment environment. A program model has been recommended as a test pilot in the County of the research. Success at a local level will set the stage for a larger implementation of the program. Addiction is estimated to have a financial impact of $270 billion on America's economy

AB  - Since self-efficacy is a positive predictor of substance use treatment outcome, we investigated whether it is associated with spirituality within a religious 12-step program. This was a cross-sectional survey (N = 91) of 10 different Celebrate Recovery sites held at community churches. The mean spirituality score for those with high confidence was significantly greater than those with low confidence. Spirituality associated with greater confidence to resist substance use (OR = 1.09, 95% CI 1.02-1.17, P < 0.05). So every unit increase of measured spirituality increased the odds of being above the median in self-efficacy by 9%. We conclude that spirituality may be an important explanatory variable in outcomes of a faith-based 12-step recovery program

AB  - Despite a growing interest in how group membership can positively impact health, little research has addressed directly the role social identity processes can have on recovery from addiction. Drawing on social identity theory and self-categorization theory, the present study investigated how recovery group membership can introduce a new social identity associated with recovery, compared to the social identity associated with addiction. We hypothesized that two processes�_"evaluative differentiation and identity preference�_"would be linked with higher self-efficacy and positive health outcomes (i.e., reduced relapse, lower levels of appetitive behavior, and elevated feelings of social connectedness [Study 2]). Study 1 recruited members (N = 61) from United Kingdom based mutual aid groups of Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous. Study 2 recruited ex-smokers (N = 81) from online sources. In Study 1, evaluative differentiation was significantly related to lowered relapse and reduced appetitive behavior. Identity preference was related to higher levels of self-efficacy, which was related to months drug-free and reduced levels of appetitive behaviors. In Study 2, evaluative differentiation was related to identity preference. Identity preference was also related to higher self-efficacy, which in turn was related to lower relapse. Although exploratory, these results suggest that developing a social identity as a �_orecovering addict�__ or an �_oex-smoker�__ and subsequently highlighting the difference between such identities may be a useful strategy for reducing relapse among people with problems associated with addictive behaviors.

AB  - Background: Buprenorphine has been prescribed at Dartmouth almost exclusively through the Addiction Treatment Program's Buprenorphine clinic since July 2003. The program includes weekly visits and urine screens and attendance at a weekly support group run by Substance Abuse Fellows and/or Psychiatric Residents and supervised by an Addiction Psychiatrist/Bup provider. The presentation will be an update and progress report of a buprenorphine treatment program in which substance abuse fellows and second-year residents are the group therapists. (Initial data were presented at AAAP in 2004.) Objectives are to determine outcome of program participants including measures of success for patients and evaluations of the experience from the group leaders. We will also examine how the treatment delivery system has evolved. Methods: We will present outcome data for all participants (over 300 patients) who have participated in the program since its inception with criteria for successful outcome in the program, including drug screen results, employment, legal involvement, and pregnancy outcomesed on a review of all patient records since the inception of the program. Results: Outcome results will be based on percentage of negative urines, increase and/or continued employment, and patient perception of success determined by questionnaire. Conclusions and implications for the future will be presented

AB  - Background: The association between opiate addiction and psychiatric comorbidity has long been established. In the general population, buprenorphine-naloxone (bup-nx) has demonstrated efficacy in promoting abstinence from illicit opiate consumption among individuals with a history of misuse. In some investigations, patients with anxiety or depression previous to opiate addiction exhibited greater responses, relative to other patients, to programs that combined bup-nx pharmacotherapy with regular psychological counseling. Patients, themselves, have expressed a preference for office-based programs that enable them to continue normal daily activities during treatment for addiction. Despite this, a majority of investigations of bup-nx therapy to date that have included patients with psychiatric comorbidities have been conducted in hospital settings. This investigation will assess the effectiveness of bup-nx therapy for the office-based treatment of opiate addiction, exclusively among patients with psychiatric comorbidities. Objective: Assess the safety and effectiveness of outpatient maintenance with bup-nx, combined with psychological counseling, among patients with comorbid psychiatric diagnoses. Methods: Participants will be recruited from the Intensive Outpatient Program for dual-diagnosis patients at a psychiatric facility in Toms River, New Jersey. Recipients of bup-nx maintenance therapy will be required to attend regular counseling sessions with a psychiatrist, regular outpatient group sessions at the facility, and meetings of a 12-step program of their choosing. They will also be required to consent to random urine drug screenings for the duration of bup-nx therapy. Each recipient will be invited to participate in the investigation. Informed consent will be obtained from each participant prior to enrollment. Data will be collected from weekly questionnaires completed by the participants, as well as from in- and outpatient medical records maintained by the treatment facility. Admission data will also be collected from a comparator group of patients receiving inpatient opiate detoxification only. Outcomes: We will report symptoms of withdrawal, severity of craving, and the percent of patients with (-)UDS per each week of enrollment in the program. We will also report time between inpatient psychiatric admissions, relative to the comparator group, incidence of bup-nx interactions or adverse effects, and duration of retention in the Intensive Outpatient Program

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cocaine use remains a major problem within methadone maintenance programs. Disulfiram's efficacy in reducing cocaine use has been demonstrated in several trials, but its relative efficacy among individuals who use versus abstain from alcohol remains unclear. Treatment approaches which seek to enhance substance users' involvement in self-help activities (Twelve Step Facilitation, TSF) have been associated with better outcomes among alcohol and cocaine users, but have rarely been evaluated among methadone-maintained cocaine-opioid users METHODS: We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind (for medication condition), factorial (2x2) trial with 4 treatment conditions: Disulfiram plus TSF, disulfiram plus standard counseling only, placebo plus TSF, and placebo plus standard counseling in the context of a community-based methadone maintenance program. Participants (N=112) received either disulfiram (250 mg/d) or placebo in conjunction with daily methadone maintenance RESULTS: Assignment to TSF was associated with less cocaine use throughout treatment and a higher number of cocaine-negative urines. While there were no significant main effects of disulfiram versus placebo, individuals without an alcohol use disorder demonstrated greater reductions in cocaine use over time when assigned to disulfiram CONCLUSIONS: TSF appears feasible in this methadone maintenance program and was associated with modest reductions in cocaine use, an often intractable problem in this setting. Support for the efficacy of disulfiram was weaker, as it appeared effective only for those without a current alcohol use disorder for this sample. Copyright 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Background: Spirituality is considered an essential part of 12-Step treatment but there has been almost no research on this modality in youth. This is the first study using a standardized rating instrument to examine changes in spirituality during adolescent 12-Step oriented treatment. Methods: Seventeen patients, ages 14-22 admitted to a day hospital 12-week substance abuse program were administered the PESQ on admission to determine the severity of their drug use. In addition they were administered the ASPIRES, a standardized rating scale measuring various components of spirituality, on admission and at 12weeks at the completion of day treatment. Also a rating of treatment progress was done at treatment completion. Results: Results indicate significant changes in several ASPIRES scales (Prayer Fulfillment, Total Spiritual Transcendence, and Religious Involvement). Further changes in these scales were significantly related to therapists' rating of treatment success. Conclusions: This study supports the importance of the development of spirituality in adolescent/young adult 12-Step treatment and suggests strategies to make this meaningful for youth

AB  - Aims This study examines 12-Step attendance trajectories over 7 years, factors associated with the trajectories, and relationships between the trajectories and long-term substance use outcomes among adolescents entering out-patient substance use treatment in a private, non-profit integrated managed-care health plan. Design Longitudinal observational study. Setting Four Kaiser Permanente Northern California substance use treatment programs. Participants A total of 391 adolescents entering treatment between 2000 and 2002 who completed at least one follow-up interview in year 1, and at least one during years 3-7, after treatment entry. Measurements Alcohol and drug use, 12-Step meeting attendance and activity involvement and post-treatment medical service utilization. Findings Semiparametric group-based modeling identified three distinct 12-Step attendance trajectory groups over 7 years: low/no attendance (60%), early but not continued (26%) and continued (14%). There were lower proportions of males and of adolescents with prior substance use treatment experience in the low/no attendance group (P = 0.019 and P = 0.003, respectively). In addition, those in the low/no attendance group had lower perception on circumstances, motivation and readiness for treatment at baseline (P = 0.023). Multivariate logistic generalized estimating equation analyses found that those in the continued groupwere more likely to be abstinent from both alcohol and drugs during follow-ups than those in the low/no attendance group [ odds ratio (OR) = 2.40, P = 0.003 and OR = 1.96, P = 0.026, respectively]. However, no differences in long-term outcomes were found between those in the other two groups. Conclusion Robust connection with 12-Step groups appears to be associated with better long-termoutcomes among adolescents with substance use disorders

Although level of participation decreased over time for both groups, comorbid adolescents participated in 12-step groups at comparable or higher levels across time points. Results from mixed-effects logistic regression models indicated that for both groups, 12-step participation was associated with both alcohol and drug abstinence at follow-ups, increasing the likelihood of either by at least 3 times. Findings highlight the potential benefits of 12-step participation in maintaining long-term recovery for adolescents with and without psychiatric disorders

AB  - Examined the relationship among spiritual beliefs, locus of control, and disease concept beliefs and determined their direct effect on outcome and their indirect effect by facilitating engagement with Narcotics Anonymous (NA). 90% of 101 drug users in treatment were followed up after 6-mo of treatment. A modified version of the Opiate Treatment Index and a spirituality beliefs questionnaire were used at both baseline and follow-up. NA attendance was inversely related to drug use for Ss who had left residential care. Spiritual beliefs and disease concept beliefs were not prerequisites for attendance of NA, and spiritual beliefs were not found to cause external attributions for previous drug use or possible future lapse events. The most powerful predictors of nonattendance were positive attitudes to the use of alcohol. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In this study the factors or characteristics associated with self-help group attendance among persons who participated in a pharmacotherapy treatment study for substance dependence were identified using a comparative descriptive design. Secondary analyses were performed on this convenience sample of an existing data set of 232 alcohol-dependent subjects and 354 alcohol- and cocaine-dependent subjects who took part in one of four double-blind placebo-controlled pharmacotherapy clinical trials for substance dependence during the years 2000-2007. It was anticipated that individual participant characteristics and factors (i.e., self-identification of a religious preference, greater severity of substance dependence, and experience with treatment or self-help groups) would be associated with a greater likelihood of attendance at self-help groups. Furthermore, it was expected that those who attended self-help groups would demonstrate improved treatment outcomes as noted by fewer days of the following: substance use, employment problems, serious conflicts with family or unrelated people, and participation in illegal activities. Three core themes emerged from this nonrandomized convenience sample study: (a) demographics such as occupation, age, race, and education affected treatment outcomes; (b) greater severity of substance dependence at baseline positively determined self-help group attendance among persons who participated in a pharmacotherapy treatment study for their substance dependence; and (c) experience with alcohol treatments and outpatient days were the notable predictors of self-help group attendance for the alcohol- and cocaine-dependent group. In addition, religious affiliation was not associated with the decision to attend self-help groups for drug dependence, and self-help group attendance was a negative predictor of alcohol treatment outcomes. The sub-research question was created to determine whether participation in self-help groups in the alcohol-dependent and alcohol- and cocaine-dependent groups would result in fewer days of the following: substance use, employment problems, serious conflicts with family and non-family members, and participation in illegal activities. However, there was no evidence of any effect on those areas as a result of participation in self-help groups

AB  - The co-occurrence of substance use and mental health problems, often referred to as dual diagnosis (DD), is increasingly recognised as commonplace within substance abuse treatment programs. Two-hundred and thirty-four individuals from 9 Australian Salvation Army drug and alcohol rehabilitation programs completed a 3-month post-discharge telephone follow-up. Using a cut-off score from the Psychiatric Subscale of the Addiction Severity Index (5th ed.), 66.7% were classified as likely to have DD and 33.3% as substance use disorder only (SUD). Both groups reported comparable and decreased substance use levels at follow-up, yet DD individuals perceived less improvement in substance use problems. Comparable improvements were reported in the areas of: symptom distress and recovery from symptoms. This was despite greater scope for improvement in individuals with DD. Duration of treatment and access to post treatment services were also assessed. Understanding factors effecting treatment outcomes is imperative for the implementation of effective, evidence based treatment programs

AB  - Objective: This study examined the relation of process variables to the outcome of group drug counseling, a commonly used community treatment, for cocaine dependence. Method: Videotaped group drug counseling sessions from 440 adult patients (23% female, 41% minority) were rated for member alliance, group cohesion, participation, self-disclosure, as well as positive and non-positive feedback and advice during the 6-month treatment of cocaine dependence. Average, session-level, and slopes of process scores were evaluated. Primary outcomes were monthly cocaine use (days using out of 30), next session cocaine use, and duration of sustained abstinence from cocaine. Secondary outcomes were endorsement of 12-step philosophy and beliefs about substance abuse. Results: More positive alliances (with counselor) were associated with reductions in days using cocaine per month and next-session cocaine use and increases in endorsement of 12-step philosophy. Patient self-disclosure about the past and degree of participation in the group were generally not predictive of group drug counseling outcomes. More advice from counselor and other group members were consistently associated with poorer outcomes in all categories. Individual differences in changes in process variables over time (linear slopes) were generally not predictive of treatment outcomes. Conclusions: Some group behaviors widely believed to be associated with outcome, such as self-disclosure and participation, were not generally predictive of outcomes of group drug counseling, but alliance with the group counselor was positively associated, and advice giving was negatively associated, with the outcome of treatments for cocaine dependence.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Premature termination from treatment is a major factor associated with poorer drug and alcohol treatment outcomes. The present study investigated client-related baseline predictors of dropout at 3 months from a faith-based 12-step residential drug treatment program METHOD: Data were collected over a period of 14 months from eight residential drug and alcohol treatment programs run by The Australian Salvation Army. The final sample consisted of 618 participants, including 524 men (84.8%) and 94 women (15.2%). Predictor variables of interest were age, gender, primary drug of concern, criminal involvement, psychological distress, drug cravings, self-efficacy to abstain, spirituality, forgiveness of self and others, and life purpose. At 3 months, 264 participants (42.7%) remained in the treatment program, and 354 participants (57.3%) had dropped out RESULTS: Binary logistic regression revealed that individuals were more likely to drop out by the 3-month time frame if at intake their primary drug of concern was a drug other than alcohol or they reported greater forgiveness of self CONCLUSIONS: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to examine forgiveness as a predictor of dropout from a drug treatment program. Assessing patient's primary drug of concern and levels of forgiveness may be useful for residential drug treatment providers in constructing programs that provide differential treatment based on the results of these assessments

AB  - BACKGROUND: The treatment of alcohol and other drugs is now more commonly framed in terms of a chronic condition which requires ongoing monitoring. A model which includes continuing access to health care may optimize outcomes. Most studies of chronic care models have not included health care and have only examined short term effects METHODS: The sample (n = 783) included consecutive admissions in ten public and private alcohol and other drug (AOD) treatment programs followed over seven years. The outcome was remission which was defined as alcohol and drug abstinence or non-problem use RESULTS: In the private sample, receiving health care services predicted remission across the seven years; however this did not occur in the public sample. More patients in the public treatment sample received AOD treatment readmissions each year, while more of those in the private sector received psychiatric and general health visits. Except for drug problem severity, there were no other clinical differences between the samples. There were no differences in the proportions of patients in the two sectors who received the full spectrum of chronic care services. In the final models, 12-step participation was markedly significant for both samples CONCLUSIONS: Models of chronic care for substance use need to consider differences between private and public treatment and should take into account that individuals may not always have access, or avail themselves of services that may optimize long-term outcomes.

AB  - Participation in12-step mutual help organizations (MHOs) is often prescribed during treatment for young adults (i.e., ages 18-24 yrs) with substance use disorders (SUD) to foster continued remission. The Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) 2011 Membership Survey found, however, that the average age ofmembers was 49 yrs, with only 13%under age 30. Given that engagement in 12-stepMHOs is related to perceived similarities amongmembers, this older age composition may serve as a barrier to young adult participation. This study examined the relationships among age composition of 12-step groups, young adult participation, and alcohol/drug use outcome. Young adults (N = 296; 18-24 yrs) enrolled in a naturalistic study of residential treatment eectiveness were assessed at intake, 3, 6, and 12 months on 12-step attendance, age composition of attended 12-step groups (participants were asked to report the extent to which members of meetings they attended most often were about their age; response options were coded ordinally as: "none," "some," "about half," "most," or "all"; [Kelly et al., 2011]), and treatment outcome (Percent Days Abstinent [PDA]). Hierarchical linear models (HLM) tested the relation of age composition to PDA concurrently and in subsequent follow-ups, controlling for confounds. To determine if age composition conferred a unique recovery benefit beyond that of attendance, attendance and age composition were tested in the samemodel. The proportion attending AA meetings at intake, 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up were 6%, 38%, 33%, and 27%, respectively. At each follow-up, 34%, 30%, and 28%of patients, respectively, reported that at least "some" of the AA groupmembers were young adults. Results fromcontemporaneous and lagged HLM analyses found that more similar age composition at each time point was related to greater PDA (ps<0.05). HLMs testing the unique eect of age composition over and above attendance found that age composition was unrelated to PDA in contemporaneousmodels (b = 0.22, p = 0.09), but in laggedmodels it was (b = 0.41, p = 0.04); the age composition by time interaction was not significant (b = -0.51, p = 0.07). Among young adult AA attendees, age composition of attended meetings may be an important variable that confers additional recovery benefits independent of frequency of attendance. Age composition should be considered when prescribing participation in MHOs to young adults in order to maximize potential recovery benefis

AB  - Aims: The study evaluated the effectiveness of an 8-week combined group plus individual 12-step facilitative intervention on stimulant drug use and 12-step meeting attendance and service. Design: Multisite randomized controlled trial, with assessments at baseline, mid-treatment, end of treatment, and 3- and 6-month post-randomization follow-ups (FUs). Setting: Intensive outpatient substance treatment programs. Participants: Individuals with stimulant use disorders (n = 471) randomly assigned to treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU into which the Stimulant Abuser Groups to Engage in 12-Step (STAGE-12) intervention was integrated. Measurements: Urinalysis and self-reports of substance use and 12-step attendance and activities. Intervention: Group sessions focused on increasing acceptance of 12-step principles; individual sessions incorporated an intensive referral procedure connecting participants to 12-step volunteers. Findings: Compared with TAU, STAGE-12 participants had significantly greater odds of self-reported stimulant abstinence during the active 8-week treatment phase; however, among those who had not achieved abstinence during this period, STAGE-12 participants had more days of use. STAGE-12 participants had lower Addiction Severity Index Drug Composite scores at and a significant reduction from baseline to the 3-month FU, attended 12-step meetings on a greater number of days during the early phase of active treatment, engaged in more other types of 12-step activities throughout the active treatment phase and the entire FU period, and had more days of self-reported service at meetings from mid-treatment through the 6-month FU. Conclusions: The present findings are mixed with respect to the impact of integrating the STAGE-12 intervention into intensive outpatient drug treatment compared with TAU on stimulant drug use. However, the results more clearly indicate that individuals in STAGE-12 had higher rates of 12-step meeting attendance and were engaged in more related activities throughout both the active treatment phase and the entire 6-month FU period than did those in TAU.

AB  - Introduction: Substance abuse is one of the most common disorders that exert a high impact on the life of patients and their families. There are many treatment methods for Addiction. The purpose of the present study was to determine the effects of narcotics anonymous (NA) program on personality characters in substance abuse patients. Materials and Methods: This quasi experimental design was performed on 100 patients with substance abuse disorders that they had been randomly selected from those patients who were referred to psychiatric clinics and counseling centers in Esfehan in 2008. Then, the subjects were equally divided into two groups; experimental and control. All the patients carried out Eysenk test prior to any intervention and also a demographic questionnaire were filled out by all the subjects. Then, Eysenk test was performed on all the patients following the intervention. Changing in personality character in the experimental group (before and after the intervention) was compared with those of the control group. Results: The findings showed that narcotic program has significant effects on personality characters of experimental group to substance abuse in post test, but these effects are not significant in control group. Conclusion: According to the findings of this work, we suggest the effectiveness of NA program in changing personality characters of the patients with substance abuse

AB  - Background: Participation in mutual-help groups, such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA), during and following treatment has been found to confer recovery-related benefits among adults and adolescents, but little is known about emerging adults. This transitional life-stage is distinctive for its greater distress, higher density of psychopathology, and poorer treatment and continuing care compliance. Greater knowledge would inform the utility of treatment referrals to 12-step mutual-help organizations for this agegroup. Methods: Emerging adults (N=303; aged 18-24yrs; 26% female; 95% White; 51% comorbid [SCID-derived] axis I disorders) enrolled in a naturalistic study of residential treatment effectiveness were assessed at intake and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months later using standardized validated measures assessing AA/NA attendance and involvement (sponsorship), and outcome (Percent Days Abstinent [PDA]). Results: The proportion attending AA/NA prior to treatment (38%) rose sharply at 1m after treatment (91%) and remained high at 3- (85%), 6- (75%), and 12-month (71%) follow-ups. The proportion reporting having an AA/NA sponsor prior to treatment (14%) also rose substantially in the first month following discharge (42%) and remained high at 3- (51%), 6- (43%) and 12-month (38%) follow-ups. Controlling for baseline PDA, more frequent AA/NA attendance was strongly and consistently associated with greater PDA across follow-ups (ps <.0002 - <.0001). Regarding AA/NA involvement, having an AA/NA sponsor was also related to better outcomes and appeared to partially mediate the effect of attendance on outcome. Conclusions: Findings suggest emerging adults treated in 12-step oriented residential treatment attend AA/NA at high rates and many become engaged in the fellowship through obtaining an AA/NA sponsor. Such participation is associated with substantially improved alcohol/drug outcomes. These ubiquitous community resources appear to provide a supportive recovery context for this high-risk population at a developmental stage in which non-using/ sober peers are scarce

AB  - Purpose: Research on the benefits derived from 12-step mutual help participation among individuals with alcohol use disorder has increased substantially in quantity and quality during the past 15 years. This has been facilitated by a variety of measures that have emerged to assess 12-step experience. However, existing measures typically clump and summarize experiences from very different 12-step fellowships (e.g., Alcoholics Anonymous, Cocaine Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous) into a single metric and frequently succeed in capturing only a narrow range of 12-step-related experience. Here we report the results from the development and use of a comprehensive multidimensional measure of 12-step mutual-help group experience. Methods: Items were constructed using existing scientific literature, relevant expert consensus, and current 12-step participants, to develop items that captured the full range of 12-step experience. Two clinical samples of young adults and adolescents (n = 430) were administered the instrument at multiple time points prospectively. An additional one week testretest reliability check was conducted on a subsample. Results: Results indicated high content validity and excellent reliability across seven major dimensions of 12-step experience (meeting attendance, meeting participation, fellowship involvement, step work, mandated attendance, subjective affiliation, and safety) and the measure successfully discriminated between anticipated levels of 12-step involvement between samples. Conclusion: This measure may facilitate much greater insight into the dynamic nature and range of activities engaged in by individuals with alcohol use disorder across various 12-step organizations

AB  - Existing measures of 12-Step mutual-help activity typically capture only a narrow range of experiences and combine fellowships with explicitly different substance-specific emphases (e.g., Alcoholics vs. Narcotics Anonymous). To help expand our knowledge in this important area, the authors report on the development and use of a comprehensive multidimensional measure of 12-Step experiences in two clinical samples of young adults and adolescents (N = 430). One-week test-retest reliability was verified on a subsample. Results indicated high content validity and reliability across seven dimensions of experience (meeting attendance, meeting participation, fellowship involvement, step work, mandated attendance, affiliation, and safety), and the measure successfully discriminated between samples on anticipated activity levels. This measure provides rich data on mutual-help activities and deepens our understanding of individuals' experiences across different 12-Step organizations. Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC

AB  - Objective: Narcotics Anonymous (NA) is an abstinence-based fellowship with more than 58,000 groups worldwide. There has, however, been little research reported on its members. This study was designed to clarify the nature of the participants in NA who are primarily abstinent, long-term members. Method: A protocol was implemented to survey members at 10 NA group meetings in three different states, through the cooperation of the NA World Service Office. A 51-item self-administered questionnaire, addressing key aspects of substance use and recovery, was anonymously completed by 396 respondents. Results: Respondents were 71.5% male; the mean age was 38.1 years; 68.2% were White; and the principal drug problems comprised cocaine (28.5%), heroin (27.5%), other opiates (13.4%), methamphetamine (12.9%), alcohol (8.6%), marijuana (6.6%), and other stimulants (2.5%). Eighty-seven percent had prior treatment for a substance use disorder. On average respondents had first encountered NA at age 26.9, they had been abstinent an average of 5.7 years at the time they filled out the questionnaire, and 47.5% had served as sponsors. Ninety-four percent designated themselves as spiritual, and only 29.6% designated themselves as religious. Conclusions: NA offers support for long-term abstinence from diverse misuse of drugs among users of different backgrounds. (J. Stud.

AB  - Research on adolescent substance abuse treatment effectiveness has grown in quantity, as evidenced by several review articles (Deas & Thomas, 2001; Muck, Zempolich, Titus, Fishman, Godley, & Schwebel, 2001; Williams & Chang, 2000). The results have shown substance use dissipates during treatment, but relapse to substance use occurs at high rates following treatment discharge (Catalano, Hawkins, Wells, Miller, & Brewer, 1991; Godley, Godley, & Dennis, 2001). Despite the heterogeneity of post-treatment outcomes, the likelihood of post-treatment relapse is often dependent on a number of variables, including whether or not the adolescent participates in continuing care services, such as self-help groups. However, there remains a dearth of empirical studies examining the use and effectiveness of self-help groups among adolescent outpatients. Therefore, this research examined the effects of self-help group meeting attendance among adolescents during the three-month time period immediately following publicly funded outpatient substance abuse treatment. Factors postulated within social-cognitive theory, social learning theory, group theory and included in cognitive and behavioral relapse prevention models were assessed to determine how they are influenced by self-help group attendance and whether these effects can be used to help explain all or some of these observed relations. The following research hypothesis was examined: at the end of the three-month time period following treatment, there will be no differences between male and female adolescents who attended self-help groups during that three-month time period and those who do not attend regarding substance use frequency, severity of substance-related problems, cognitive and behavioral factors (motivation, coping, self-efficacy), and social-environmental factors (social support, environmental risk). In addition, the following research question was incorporated: while controlling for gender and attending a self-help group, can severity of substance-related problems, motivation, coping, self-efficacy, social support, and environmental risk be integrated to predict substance use frequency? To examine the hypothesis and research question, a secondary analysis was performed using data from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) Adolescent Treatment (AT) 2008 Outcome Dataset. The final dataset focused on adolescent outpatients and key questions from the original assessment that addressed the hypotheses and research question. Variables of interest were constructed, using items from scales and indices that were part of the assessment. The secondary data were analyzed using PASW Statistics (formerly SPSS) and AMOS 18.0 software. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed no differences in the mean scores between self-help group attendees and non-attendees at the end of the three-months following treatment on motivation, social support, substance use frequency, and environmental risk. However, differences existed for coping, self-efficacy, and severity of substance-related problems. In addition, gender differences were found when adolescents entered treatment, in that females presented for treatment with higher environmental risk and higher severity of substance-related problems. Path analysis was performed to test for the relationship of predictor variables in the model to the substance use frequency outcome variable. The findings revealed that higher severity of substance-related problems, higher coping, greater environmental risk, less self-efficacy, and no self-help group attendance during the first three-month period following treatment were the factors related to more substance use among adolescents in that period. In addition, environmental risk followed by severity of substance-related problems had the greatest total effects on substance use frequenc�_� (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Despite the heterogeneity of posttreatment outcomes, the likelihood of relapse is often dependent on several factors, including participation in continuing care services such as self-help groups. However, few studies have examined the use of self-help groups among adolescent outpatients. Therefore, in this study, investigators examined self-help group attendance among male and female adolescents during the three-month time period immediately following outpatient substance abuse treatment. Gender differences were found in regard to self-efficacy, coping, and severity of substance- related problems. A path model indicated that environmental risk provided the greatest total effect on substance-use frequency. Implications for research and practice are reviewed.

AB  - AIMS: This study investigates the relationship between frequency of attendance at Narcotics Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous (NA/AA) meetings and substance use outcomes after residential treatment of drug dependence. It was predicted that post-treatment NA/AA attendance would be related to improved substance use outcomes METHODS: Using a longitudinal, prospective cohort design, interviews were conducted with drug-dependent clients (n = 142) at intake to residential treatment, and at 1 year, 2 years and 4-5 years follow-up. Data were collected by structured interviews. All follow-up interviews were carried out by independent professional interviewers FINDINGS: Abstinence from opiates was increased throughout the 5-year follow-up period compared to pre-treatment levels. Clients who attended NA/AA after treatment were more likely to be abstinent from opiates at follow-up. Abstinence from stimulants increased at follow-up but (except at 1-year follow-up) no additional benefit was found for NA/AA attendance. There was no overall change in alcohol abstinence after treatment but clients who attended NA/AA were more likely to be abstinent from alcohol at all follow-up points. More frequent NA/AA attenders were more likely to be abstinent from opiates and alcohol when compared both to non-attenders and to infrequent (less than weekly) attenders CONCLUSIONS: NA/AA can support and supplement residential addiction treatment as an aftercare resource. In view of the generally poor alcohol use outcomes achieved by drug-dependent patients after treatment, the improved alcohol outcomes of NA/AA attenders suggests that the effectiveness of existing treatment services may be improved by initiatives that lead to increased involvement and engagement with such groups

AB  - BACKGROUND: We previously published findings from our clinical trial comparing treatment outcomes for substance-dependent veterans with co-occurring depression who received Integrated Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (ICBT) or Twelve-Step Facilitation (TSF) Therapy OBJECTIVES: This study is a secondary analysis that examined whether neuropsychological functioning at baseline moderated substance use and depression outcomes in ICBT relative to TSF METHODS: This study was a randomized clinical trial in which 164 veterans with major depressive disorder and comorbid alcohol, cannabinol, and/or stimulant dependence were randomly assigned to either ICBT or TSF group therapy. A comprehensive neuropsychological test battery was administered at baseline RESULTS: Contrary to our hypothesis, participants with poor neuropsychological functioning had better substance use outcome in ICBT than in TSF, whereas participants with good neuropsychological functioning had comparable substance use outcomes in TSF and ICBT by 18-month follow-up. Depression outcomes, in contrast, were not moderated by neuropsychological functioning by 18-month follow-up CONCLUSIONS AND SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: The substance use outcomes may suggest that substance-dependent depressed adults with poorer neuropsychological functioning should be offered ICBT over TSF. These individuals may be less able to develop and use novel coping skills for managing substance use and depressive symptoms on their own without formal structured training in cognitive and behavioral skills provided in ICBT

AB  - Rationale: A growing body of research has revealed disparities with respect to drug use patterns within Latino subgroups. However, the extent to which these potential disparities enable different Latino subgroups to respond favorably to treatment is unclear. Methods: This study analyzed a subset of multicross-sectional data (2006-2009) on Latinos collected from publicly funded facilities in Los Angeles County, CA (N = 12,871). We used multilevel logistic regressions to examine individual and service-level factors associated with treatment completion among subgroups of first-time Latino treatment clients. Results: Univariate analysis showed that Cubans and Puerto Ricans were less likely to complete treatment than Mexicans and other Latinos. Cubans and Puerto Ricans entered treatment at an older age and with higher formal education than Mexicans, yet they were more likely to report mental health issues and use of cocaine and heroin as primary drugs of choice respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that age, having mental health issues, reporting high use of drugs at intake, and use of methamphetamines and marijuana were associated with decreased odds of completing treatment among all Latino subgroups. In contrast, age at first drug use, treatment duration, and referral monitoring by the criminal system increased the odds of completing treatment for all members. Conclusion: These findings have implications for targeting interventions for members of different Latinos groups during their first treatment episode. Promising individual and service factors associated with treatment completion can inform the design of culturally specific recovery models that can be evaluated in small-scale randomized pilot studies.

AB  - This article presents the findings from an evaluation of the care provided at treatment units for drug abusers in Swedish prisons. A total of 741 inmates who were placed in prison treatment units in 2006 are compared with individuals with whom they were matched on the basis of their statistical risk for reoffending, and who served prison terms during the years 2001�_"2002. Half of the inmates in the treatment group were placed in units working with a 12-step programme, while the remainder were placed in treatment units employing cognitive programmes. The study shows positive results with respect to reoffending. The greatest differences were found in the following subgroups: males, inmates who were at least 30 years of age, those who completed their stay in a treatment unit, and those who had spent at least 4.5 months in a treatment unit.

AB  - Background: Approximately 50% of all adolescents treated for alcohol and other drug use disorders in the United States are referred by the criminal justice system (JS). A substantial number of these JS involved youth are mandated to attend treatment (JSI-M). However, little is known about the characteristics of mandated patients and how they fare during treatment and in the longer-term compared to non-mandated, justice-system-involved (JSI) patients and patients not involved in the justice system (No JSI). Greater knowledge in this arena would inform the utility of youth justice system treatment mandates. Method: Adolescents (N=127; M age 16.7; 24% female; 87% White) enrolled in a study of outpatient treatment effectiveness were assessed at intake and 3, 6, and 12 months later using validated assessments. Outcomes were modeled using controlled Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE). Results: Patients fell into three groups: JSI-M (n= 24; 19%), JSI (n=40; 31.5%), and No JSI (n=63; 50%). At intake, compared to JSI-M and No JSI patients, JSI patients were more likely to be expelled, suspended, or to have quit high school (p=.001), but both JS groups reported significantly more motivation to not use drugs (p=.001) and reported greater lifetime 12-step meeting attendance (p=.05) than the No JSI group. There were no differences between groups on during-treatment change on important clinical indices, and all three groups showed similar positive change with regard to increased abstinence. GEE results revealed this treatment benefit disappeared following treatment for the JSI-M group who exhibited a greater decline in abstinent days compared to the No JSI group. Conclusions: Compared to No JSI patients, JS patients entering outpatient treatment may be more motivated for abstinence and, in keeping with the notion that treatment does not have to be self-initiated to be effective, show a similar magnitude positive treatment response. Despite early treatment gains, however, JSI-M adolescents may deteriorate more quickly following treatment. Consistent with recovery management models of addiction care, longer term monitoring, linkage, and support may be necessary to increase the chances of ongoing recovery in this high risk group

AB  - Purpose: Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA) have proven to be costeffective recovery resources for adults and also appear helpful for youth. However, anecdotal concerns about adolescents' safety at meetings have dampened enthusiasm regarding youth AA/NA participation among some programs and clinicians. Unfortunately, little information exists to evaluate such concerns. To this end, the current study sought examine issues of safety at AA and NA meetings among adolescents treated in an outpatient setting for substance use disorder. Method: Outpatients (n = 127; 24% female) were assessed at intake, and 3, 6, and 12 months regarding perceived safety at AA/NA, experience of negative incidents, reasons for liking or disliking AA/NA, and reasons for nonattendance/discontinuation. Results: By 12-month follow-up, 57.5% reported some AA/NA attendance with a combined lifetime exposure of 5,340 meetings. Of these, 21.9% reported at least one negative experience, which was more common among NA than AA attendees. Overall, youth reported feeling very safe at meetings and ratings did not differ by age or gender. Reasons for discontinuation or nonattendance were unrelated to safety or negative incidents. Conclusions: Weighing risks against documented benefits, these preliminary findings suggest referral to AA/NA should not be discouraged, but, similar to adults, youth experiences at meetings should be monitored

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Religious practices among adults are associated with more 12-step participation which, in turn, is linked to better treatment outcomes. Despite recommendations for adolescents to participate in mutual-help groups, little is known about how religious practices influence youth 12-step engagement and outcomes. This study examined the relationships among lifetime religiosity, during-treatment 12-step participation, and outcomes among adolescents, and tested whether any observed beneficial relation between higher religiosity and outcome could be explained by increased 12-step participation METHOD: Adolescents (n = 195; 52% female, ages 14-18) court-referred to a 2-month residential treatment were assessed at intake and discharge. Lifetime religiosity was assessed with the Religious Background and Behaviors Questionnaire; 12-step assessments measured meeting attendance, step work (General Alcoholics Anonymous Tools of Recovery), and Alcoholics Anonymous (AA)/Narcotics Anonymous (NA)-related helping. Substance-related outcomes and psychosocial outcomes were assessed with toxicology screens, the Adolescent-Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale, the Children's Global Assessment Scale, and the Narcissistic Personality Inventory RESULTS: Greater lifetime formal religious practices at intake were associated with increased step work and AA/NA-related helping during treatment, which in turn were linked to improved substance outcomes, global functioning, and reduced narcissistic entitlement. Increased step work mediated the effect of religious practices on increased abstinence, whereas AA/NA-related helping mediated the effect of religiosity on reduced craving and entitlement CONCLUSIONS: Findings extend the evidence for the protective effects of lifetime religious behaviors to an improved treatment response among adolescents and provide preliminary support for the 12-step proposition that helping others in recovery may lead to better outcomes. Youth with low or no lifetime religious practices may assimilate less well into 12-step-oriented treatment and may need additional 12-step facilitation, or a different approach, to enhance treatment response

AB  - Background: Young adulthood represents a key developmental period for the onset of substance use disorder (SUD). While the number of young adults entering treatment has increased, little is known about the mechanisms of change and early recovery processes in this important clinical population. This study investigated during-treatment change in key therapeutic processes (psychological distress, motivation, self-efficacy, coping skills, and commitment to AA/NA), and tested their relation to outcome at 3 months post-treatment. Methods: Young adults undergoing residential treatment (N = 303; age 18-24; 26% female; 95% Caucasian) were enrolled in a naturalistic prospective study and assessed at intake, mid-treatment, discharge, and 3 months following discharge. Repeated-measures and regression analyses modeled during-treatment change in process variables and impact on outcome. Results: Statistically significant medium to large effect sizes were observed for changes in most processes during treatment, with the exception of motivation, which was high at treatment intake and underwent smaller, but still significant, change. In turn, these during-treatment changes all individually predicted 3-month abstinence to varying degrees, with self-efficacy emerging as the sole predictor in a simultaneous regression. Conclusions: Findings help to clarify the mechanisms through which treatment confers recovery-related benefit among young adults. At treatment intake, high levels of abstinence motivation but lower coping, self-efficacy, and commitment to AA/NA, suggests many entering treatment may be "ready and willing" to change, but "unable" to do so without help. Treatment appears to work, in part, by helping to maintain motivation while conferring greater ability and confidence to enact such change. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved

AB  - Background: A large proportion of people attending residential alcohol and other substance abuse treatment have a co-occurring mental illness. Empirical evidence suggests that it is important to treat both the substance abuse problem and co-occurring mental illness concurrently and in an integrated fashion. However, the majority of residential alcohol and other substance abuse services do not address mental illness in a systematic way. It is likely that computer delivered interventions could improve the ability of substance abuse services to address co-occurring mental illness. This protocol describes a study in which we will assess the effectiveness of adding a computer delivered depression and substance abuse intervention for people who are attending residential alcohol and other substance abuse treatment. Methods/Design: Participants will be recruited from residential rehabilitation programs operated by the Australian Salvation Army. All participants who satisfy the diagnostic criteria for an alcohol or other substance dependence disorder will be asked to participate in the study. After completion of a baseline assessment, participants will be randomly assigned to either a computer delivered substance abuse and depression intervention (treatment condition) or to a computer-delivered typing tutorial (active control condition). All participants will continue to complete The Salvation Army residential program, a predominantly 12-step based treatment facility. Randomisation will be stratified by gender (Male, Female), length of time the participant has been in the program at the commencement of the study (4 weeks or less, 4 weeks or more), and use of anti-depressant medication (currently prescribed medication, not prescribed medication). Participants in both conditions will complete computer sessions twice per week, over a five-week period. Research staff blind to treatment allocation will complete the assessments at baseline, and then 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post intervention. Participants will also complete weekly self-report measures during the treatment period. Discussion: This study will provide comprehensive data on the effect of introducing a computer delivered, cognitive behavioral therapy based co-morbidity treatment program within a residential substance abuse setting. If shown to be effective, this intervention can be disseminated within other residential substance abuse programs

AB  - Background: Participation in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA) during and following treatment has been found to confer recovery-related benefit among adults and adolescents, but little is known about emerging adults (18�_"24 years). This transitional life-stage is distinctive for greater distress, higher density of psychopathology, and poorer treatment and continuing care compliance. Greater knowledge would inform the utility of treatment referrals to 12-step organizations for this age-group. Methods: Emerging adults (N = 303; 18�_"24 years; 26% female; 95% White; 51% comorbid [SCID-derived] axis I disorders) enrolled in a naturalistic study of residential treatment effectiveness assessed at intake, 3, 6, and 12 months on 12-step attendance and involvement and treatment outcomes (percent days abstinent [PDA]; percent days heavy drinking [PDHD]). Lagged hierarchical linear models (HLMs) tested whether attendance and involvement conferred recovery benefits, controlling for a variety of confounds. Results: The percentage attending 12-step meetings prior to treatment (36%) rose sharply at 3 months (89%), was maintained at 6 months (82%), but declined at 12 months (76%). Average attendance peaked at about 3 times per week at 3 months dropping to just over once per week at 12 months. Initially high, but similarly diminishing, levels of active 12-step involvement were also observed. Lagged HLMs found beneficial effects for attendance, but stronger effects, which increased over time, for active involvement. Several active 12-step involvement indices were associated individually with outcome benefits. Conclusions: Ubiquitous 12-step organizations may provide a supportive recovery context for this high-risk population at a developmental stage where non-using/sober peers are at a premium.

AB  - Objective: Research on instruments designed to measure endorsement of 12 step beliefs and practices among individuals with substance use disorders is virtually nonexistent. The goal of this study was to examine the psychometric properties of a novel instrument called the 12 Step Affiliation and Practices Scale (TSAPS) using a sample of young adults receiving 12 step-based residential treatment for alcohol and drug dependence. Method: As part of a naturalistic treatment outcome study, 300 young adults receiving residential treatment completed the TSAPS and several other assessments during and after treatment. Analyses of the TSAPS examined its factor structure, internal consistency, sensitivity to change over time, and convergent and predictive validity. Results: A maximum likelihood estimation factor analysis using oblique rotation produced 4 factors accounting for 61.16% of the variance. Internal consistency was very high and scores on the TSAPS significantly increased across the course of treatment. Convergent validity was demonstrated by relationships with scales of treatment attitudes, twelve step expectancies and commitment to sobriety. Predictive validity was also found, as evidenced by a relationship between total TSAPS score at 3 months post-treatment and percent of abstinent days at 6 months post-treatment. Conclusions: The TSAPS shows promise as a psychometrically sound, internally reliable measure of 12 step affiliation and practices among individuals with substance dependence. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This dissertation study sought to compare the personality characteristics of cocaine addicts and opiate addicts and to assess the effects of 12-Step participation on personality characteristics using the Millon Clinical Mutiaxial Inventory III (MCMI-III). All subjects were volunteers from the Chicago Region's South Suburban Area of Narcotics Anonymous (NA) of which 30 were male (68.2%) and 14 female (31.8%), 39 Caucasian, and 5 African American. Three groups of addicts based on drug of choice comprised the study: 20 cocaine addicts, 8 opiate addicts, and 16 with other or no drug of choice. Each subject was administered the MCMI-III and brief demographic questionnaire that included the 12-Step Participation Questionnaire. Descriptive statistics and the correlational analysis between drug of choice and 12-Step participation and the personality scale scores were run to determine whether the assumptions of the ANOVA had been met. To determine whether the independent variables differed significantly upon the dependent variables, ANOVAs were used to compare the identified mean values of the independent variables. Further Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) tests were used to compare the effects of gender. A two-tailed alpha level of .05 served as the criterion for statistical significance. There was a significant difference between Histrionic and Narcissistic Clinical Personality Patterns and the addicts' drug of choice. Histrionic scores for opioid addicts (M= 69.25) were significantly higher than cocaine addicts (M= 45.50) and Narcissistic scores for opioid addicts (M= 75.88) were significantly higher than cocaine addicts (M=49.70). There was not a significant difference between Antisocial Clinical Personality Patterns and the addicts Drug of Choice. There was a significant difference between levels of 12-Step Participation and Antisocial Clinical Personality Patterns scores but not with the Narcissistic and Histrionic Personality Pattern scores, Antisocial Clinical Personality Pattern score for High 12-Step Participation group (M= 67.71) was significantly lower than Low 12-Step Participation group (M= 84.14), and lower, although not significantly lower, than the other groups. The results of this study suggest that opioid addicts are more narcissistic and histrionic than cocaine addicts are and increased 12-Step participation is associated with fewer antisocial personality traits.

AB  - This study compares 41 Black and 124 White adolescents at intake and discharge from a residential treatment program for substance-use disorders. Study data were obtained as part of a larger study (N = 195) that sought to assess the relationship of helping behavior and addiction recovery. This post-hoc analysis aims to identify cultural strengths that may be associated with recovery from substance-use disorders among Black adolescents. Using regression analyses and controlling for the severity of substance use and background variables that distinguish racial groups, religious practices and behaviors at intake were examined. Specifically, Black youth and White youth were compared on treatment outcomes, including alcohol or drug use during treatment, drug craving, 12-Step work, and 12-Step helping. The burden of health and socioeconomic disparities at intake did not disproportionately disfavor Black adolescents. Outcomes related to 12-Step measures were similar between Black and White youth. White adolescents reported higher craving scores at discharge, and Black adolescents were more likely to use drugs during treatment. High levels of religiousness at treatment intake were linked to greater 12-Step work and greater 12-Step helping at discharge. High levels of religiousness at intake were not related to drug use during treatment or to craving scores at discharge. The relationship between intake levels of religiousness and treatment-related outcomes did not differ by race. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB  - BACKGROUND: Common factors are important for the therapy outcome and also mediate the specific factors of therapy. As one of the common factors, client's expectations towards treatment have been understudied AIMS: The aim was to examine the pre-treatment expectations of outpatient substance abuse treatment clients (N=327, 111 females, 216 males) and its impact on retention, effectiveness and satisfaction at 6-month follow-up METHOD: Dependent variables included the clients' attitudes towards the twelve-step principles and participation, medical treatment and therapists' role RESULTS: An emphasis on the importance of medical treatment at baseline predicted dropping out. Similarly, it predicted a lower percent days abstinent (PDA6) at 6 months follow-up in comparison to those who did not consider medical treatment important for recovery. Percent days abstinent increased with a more positive attitude to mutual support. At follow-up, those who had assessed the therapist's role in recovery to be most important at the baseline were most satisfied with the treatment CONCLUSIONS: The client's pre-treatment expectations have an impact on treatment retention and effectiveness. Further effort should be made to study how clients' image of treatment could be improved and also how the commitment of the clients with multiple problems could be improved.

AB  - We conducted a randomized controlled trial to evaluate whether dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), a treatment that synthesizes behavioral change with radical acceptance strategies, would be more effective for heroin-dependent women with borderline personality disorder (N = 23) than Comprehensive Validation Therapy with 12-Step (CVT + 12S), a manualized approach that provided the major acceptance-based strategies used in DBT in combination with participation in 12-Step programs. In addition to psychosocial treatment, subjects also received concurrent opiate agonist therapy with adequate doses of LAAM (thrice weekly; modal dose 90/90/130 mg). Treatment lasted for 12 months. Drug use outcomes were measured via thrice-weekly urinalyses and self-report. Three major findings emerged. First, results of urinalyses indicated that both treatment conditions were effective in reducing opiate use relative to baseline. At 16 months post-randomization (4 months post-treatment), all participants had a low proportion of opiate-positive urinalyses (27% in DBT; 33% in CVT + 12S). With regard to between-condition differences, participants assigned to DBT maintained reductions in mean opiate use through 12 months of active treatment while those assigned to CVT + 12S significantly increased opiate use during the last 4 months of treatment. Second, CVT + 12S retained all 12 participants for the entire year of treatment, compared to a 64% retention rate in DBT. Third, at both post-treatment and at the 16-month follow-up assessment, subjects in both treatment conditions showed significant overall reductions in level of psychopathology relative to baseline. A noteworthy secondary finding was that DBT participants were significantly more accurate in their self-report of opiate use than were those assigned to CVT + 12S.

AB  - Introduction: With a sample of adolescents who entered substance use treatment in a private, non-profit integrated health care delivery system, this study examined patterns of primary care (PC) and substance use treatment services as they relate to outcomes over 7 years, and developed a model of continuing care. Methods: Study subjects were 419 adolescents, aged 13-18, recruited at four Kaiser Permanente Northern California substance use treatment programs between 2000 and 2002. Follow-up interviews were conducted at 6 months, 1, 3, 5, and 7 years after treatment entry. Measures at follow-ups included alcohol and drug use, twelve-step participation, and posttreatment service utilization. Results: The final sample was 34% female, 49% white, with mean age of 16.1 years at treatment entry. A total of 305 (73%) started substance use treatment. Only 30%, 19% and 15% had additional substance use treatment services during years 1-3, 3-5, and 5-7, respectively. Mixed-effects logistic random intercept models indicated that having substance use treatment based on need and having routine PC visits were associated with better outcomes over time. Compared with those who had no treatment need and received no substance use treatment, adolescents who had treatment need but did not receive it were 72% less likely, whereas those who had treatment need and did receive it were 14% more likely, to be abstinent from drugs at follow-ups (ORs=0.28 and 1.14, respectively). Similarly, there was a significant interaction between treatment need and receiving substance use treatment on risky drinking over time. Furthermore, having PC visits was associated with drug abstinence over time (OR=1.83, p=0.0185). Twelve-step participation was associated with higher odds of being abstinent from alcohol and drugs, and lower odds of risky drinking, across time points (ORs=3.70, 3.74 and 0.46, respectively; all p<0.01). We developed a measure of "continuing care" at each time point that takes into account receiving routine PC, substance use treatment based on need and twelve-step participation, and found significant associations between receiving continuing care and better substance use outcomes over 7 years. Conclusion: Continuing care that includes collaborative PC and specialty care management to support ongoing monitoring, self-care and treatment as needed is important for long-term recovery of adolescent substance use patients

AB  - The authors compared longitudinal treatment outcomes for depressed substance-dependent veterans (N = 206) assigned to integrated cognitive-behavioral therapy plus standard pharmacotherapy (ICBT + P) or 12-step facilitation therapy plus standard pharmacotherapy (TSF + P). Drug and alcohol involvement and depressive symptomology were measured at intake and at 3-month intervals during treatment and up to 1 year posttreatment. Participants in both treatment conditions showed decreased depression and substance use from intake. ICBT + P participants maintained improvements in substance involvement over time, whereas TSF + P participants had more rapid increases in use in the months following treatment. Decreases in depressive symptoms were more pronounced for TSF + P than ICBT + P in the 6 months posttreatment. Within both treatment groups, higher attendance was associated with improved substance use and depression outcomes over time. Initial levels of depressive symptomology had a complex predictive relationship with long-term depression outcomes. Early treatment response predicted long-term substance use outcomes for a portion of the sample. Although both treatments were associated with improvements in substance use and depression, ICBT + P may lead to more stable substance use reductions compared with TSF + P

The sample consisted of 8 men and 4 women ages ranging from 25 to 48 years (M = 35). Qualitative data collection included 8 semi-structured interview questions about drug use, spiritual awakening, recovery, and cognitive functioning. Quantitative data were collected using 2 direct measures of executive functioning and 3 self-report questionnaires measuring executive functioning in daily life, factors involved in maintaining abstinence, and spiritual transcendence. A finding of interest was that many of the participants reported no longer having cravings, and some reported that cravings had gone away instantaneously following their spiritual awakening experience. Because cue-induced craving is both implicated in relapse and known to persist years after use, this finding is of special interest to both the field of transpersonal psychology and the field of addiction. Qualitative data revealed similar themes to those found in prior research done on alcoholism and spiritual awakening. Themes included hitting bottom, surrendering, and an awareness of the presence of a compassionate higher power. Executive functioning measures were found to be in the normal range. No correlations were found between measures of spiritual transcendence and self-report measures of executive functioning and factors involved in maintaining abstinence. All participants had at least 1 year of abstinence, and thus prolonged abstinence may have been a contributing factor. The findings of this study support transpersonal theories of addiction suggesting that the drive behind addiction is the desire for Divine union and that spiritual awakening can indeed be a powerful and instrumental part of one's recovery from methamphetamine addiction. Further study using brain-imaging technology to research this phenomenon is proposed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - A longitudinal analysis was conducted among a U.S. national sample of persons affiliated with Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous living in self-run recovery homes (Oxford Houses). Categorical involvement in a set of 12-step activities (i.e., having a sponsor, reading 12-step literature, doing service mirk, and calling other members for help) and averaged summary scores of involvement were examined in relation to abstinence and sell-efficacy for abstinence. Participants who were categorically involved in all 12-step activities reported significantly higher levels of abstinence and self-efficacy for abstinence at 1 year compared with those who were less involved, whereas averaged summary scores of involvement were not a significant predictor of abstinence. Participants' number of days in Oxford Houses, but not rates of 12-step meeting attendance, was significantly related to increased abstinence. Findings suggest that categorical involvement in a number of 12-step activities equip persons with substance use disorders with resources for ongoing recovery. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The present study examined 12-step involvement categorically and its relation to coping strategies and self-efficacy for abstinence among 42 members of Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous and 42 recovering addicts/alcoholics residing in democratically operated recovery homes (Oxford Houses). Participants who were categorically involved in a set of 12-step activities reported significantly lower levels of emotion-focused coping strategies and significantly higher levels of social-support coping strategies and self-efficacy for abstinence compared with those who were less involved. Twelve-step meeting attendance was not significantly related to outcomes. Findings suggest that categorical involvement in 12-step activities equips recovering alcoholics/addicts with active coping strategies for their ongoing recovery. Implications for future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study examined stability of remission in patients who were abstainers and non-problem users at 1-year after entering private, outpatient alcohol and drug treatment. We examined: (a) How does risk of relapse change over time? (b) What was the risk of relapse for non-problem users versus abstainers? (c) What individual, treatment, and extra-treatment characteristics predicted time to relapse, and did these differ by non-problem use versus abstinence? METHODS: The sample consisted of 684 adults in remission (i.e., abstainers or non-problem users) 1 year following treatment intake. Participants were interviewed at intake, and 1, 5, 7, 9, and 11 years after intake. We used discrete-time survival analysis to examine when relapse is most likely to occur and predictors of relapse RESULTS: Relapse was most likely at 5-year, and least likely at 11-year follow-up. Non-problem users had twice the odds of relapse compared to abstainers. Younger individuals and those with fewer 12-step meetings and shorter index treatment had higher odds of relapse than others. We found no significant interactions between non-problem use and the other covariates suggesting that significant predictors of outcome did not differ for non-problem users CONCLUSIONS: Non-problem use is not an optimal 1-year outcome for those in an abstinence-oriented, heterogeneous substance use treatment program. Future research should examine whether these results are found in harm reduction treatment and self-help models, or in those with less severe problems. Results suggest treatment retention and 12-step participation are prognostic markers of long-term positive outcomes for those achieving remission at 1 year. Copyright 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The present study describes a sample of veterans residing in self-governed recovery homes METHODS: A subsample of 24 veterans within a large national study were examined using demographic data and psychiatric and substance abuse measures. Participants were evaluated at baseline and at a one-year follow-up RESULTS: Abstinence rates for the veteran subsample were high. Additionally, results suggested that participants experienced a reduction in anxiety and depression over time CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The psychiatric and substance use improvements of this veteran subsample provide incentive for further research of this at-risk population as residents of self-governed recovery homes

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adolescents who attend 12-step groups following alcohol and other drug (AOD) treatment are more likely to remain abstinent and to avoid relapse post-treatment. We examined whether 12-step attendance is also associated with a corresponding reduction in health care use and costs METHODS: We used difference-in-difference analysis to compare changes in seven-year follow-up health care use and costs by changes in 12-step participation. Four Kaiser Permanente Northern California AOD treatment programs enrolled 403 adolescents, 13-18-years old, into a longitudinal cohort study upon AOD treatment entry. Participants self-reported 12-step meeting attendance at six-month, one-year, three-year, and five-year follow-up. Outcomes included counts of hospital inpatient days, emergency room (ER) visits, primary care visits, psychiatric visits, AOD treatment costs and total medical care costs RESULTS: Each additional 12-step meeting attended was associated with an incremental medical cost reduction of 4.7% during seven-year follow-up. The medical cost offset was largely due to reductions in hospital inpatient days, psychiatric visits, and AOD treatment costs. We estimate total medical use cost savings at $145 per year (in 2010 U.S. dollars) per additional 12-step meeting attended CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that 12-step participation conveys medical cost offsets for youth who undergo AOD treatment. Reduced costs may be related to improved AOD outcomes due to 12-step participation, improved general health due to changes in social network following 12-step participation, or better compliance to both AOD treatment and 12-step meetings.

AB  - The goal of this study was to determine the extent to which use of 12-step mutual-help groups (MHGs) by patients dually diagnosed with substance use and either bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder was associated with substance use and depression outcomes. Patients entering treatment were followed at 6 months and 1 year. Diagnostic groups were based on standardized clinical interviews. We conducted logistic regressions at each follow-up to predict past 30-day abstinence from alcohol and/or drugs from (1) involvement in mutual-help groups (a count of 14 practices, such as reading 12-step literature, socializing with group peers), (2) need fulfillment in groups (6 summed items with higher scores indicating more fulfillment), and (3) psychiatric diagnosis (BD, n=48; or MDD, n=32). We also conducted regressions to predict past 30-day depressive symptoms from the same variables. More MHG involvement, more need fulfillment in MHGs, and having a major depression rather than a bipolar diagnosis significantly predicted a higher likelihood of abstinence from both alcohol and drugs at the 6-month and 1-year follow-ups. More specifically, at each follow-up, patients with bipolar disorder were significantly less likely to be abstinent from drugs than patients with major depression, but groups did not differ on abstinence from alcohol. Patients with bipolar disorder improved less on depressive symptoms at each follow-up than did patients with major depression. Supplementary analyses found that patients with bipolar disorder were less likely than patients with major depression to report having participated in MHGs at each follow-up; however, within the bipolar, but not within the major depression, group, need fulfillment in MHGs predicted a significant reduction in depressive symptoms. These results suggest that involvement and need fulfillment in 12-step mutual-help groups may be associated with increased abstinence from alcohol in patients with bipolar disorder, similar to that in patients with major depressive disorder, but not with abstinence from other drugs. These results support theoretical frameworks suggesting that substance use by patients with bipolar disorder may be an attempt to alleviate depressive symptoms and are associated with faster cycling from depressive to manic episodes

T1  - Neurocognitive impairment interacts with 12-step affiliation and depression to predict future drinking in depressed, substancedependent veterans

AB  - Many patients with an alcohol or substance use disorder (ASUD) enter treatment with neurocognitive impairment (NCI). Direct links between NCI and substance use have been inconsistent, but some studies show indirect effects through self-efficacy. Level of NCI has also moderated effects of self-efficacy and 12-step affiliation on substance use. Patients with comorbid major depression (MDD) are prevalent and may have relatively greater levels of NCI that interact with other correlates of drinking (e.g., depressive symptoms). In patients with ASUD and MDD, we examined if self-efficacy, 12-step affiliation, and depression mediated the effects of NCI, and whether NCI moderated relations with future drinking. Veterans (N=208) meeting DSM-IV criteria for alcohol (89%), cannabis (29%), or stimulant dependence (54%) and MDD received group Twelve-Step Facilitation or Integrated Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. In 6 months of treatment and 12 months of follow-up these variables were collected every 3 months: twelve-step affiliation (TSA), depressive symptoms (DEP), self-efficacy, and percent days drinking (PDD). An intake NCI score (0-8) summed domains in which patients were severely impaired. Hierarchical linear models (HLMs) tested effects of NCI on mediators and PDD, and cross-level interactions between NCI and lagged (i.e., prior time-point) process variables tested moderation, controlling for session attendance, race, sex, age, and years of education, and baseline level of outcome. Most patients (63.5%) were impaired on >=1 domain. The effects of intake NCI on future drinking were mediated by self-efficacy, as greater NCI predicted lower self-efficacy (p<.01), and lower self-efficacy predicted greater future PDD (p<.001). Intake NCI did not moderate effects of self-efficacy on PDD, but NCI did moderate effects of TSA on future PDD (p<.01), with stronger effects of TSA for impaired individuals. However, this was qualified by a significant 3-way interaction between NCI, lagged TSA, and lagged DEP (p<.05), such that greater TSA predicted lower future PDD to a greater extent for impaired patients, but only when depression was high. For patients with comorbid ASUD-MDD, greater neurocognitive impairment may impact alcohol use primarily by inhibiting self-efficacy for abstinence. The benefits of 12-step affiliation are increasingly important for cognitively impaired patients during periods of elevated depression, possibly due to lacking alternative methods of coping

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the value of 12-step meetings, few studies have examined factors associated with attendance among those living with HIV/AIDS, such as the impact of HIV disease severity and demographics OBJECTIVE: This study examines predisposing characteristics, enabling resources and need on attendance at Alcoholic Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA) meetings among those living with HIV/AIDS and alcohol problems METHODS: Secondary analysis of prospective data from the HIV-Longitudinal Interrelationships of Viruses and Ethanol study, a cohort of 400 adults living with HIV/AIDS and alcohol problems. Factors associated with AA/NA attendance were identified using the Anderson model for vulnerable populations. Generalized estimating equation logistic regression models were fit to identify factors associated with self-reported AA/NA attendance RESULTS: At study entry, subjects were 75% male, 12% met diagnostic criteria for alcohol dependence, 43% had drug dependence and 56% reported attending one or more AA/NA meetings (past 6 months). In the adjusted model, female gender negatively associated with attendance, as were social support systems that use alcohol and/or drugs, while presence of HCV antibody, drug dependence diagnosis, and homelessness associated with higher odds of attendance CONCLUSIONS: Non-substance abuse related barriers to AA/NA group attendance exist for those living with HIV/AIDS, including females and social support systems that use alcohol and/or drugs. Positive associations of homelessness, HCV infection and current drug dependence were identified. These findings provide implications for policy makers and treatment professionals who wish to encourage attendance at 12-step meetings for those living with HIV/AIDS and alcohol or other substance use problems.

AB  - This study explores the correlates of probationers' participation in 12-step programs, voluntary treatment, and mandated treatment, with respect to the geographic location of where the services are being provided as the primary covariate of interest. Data were derived from face-to-face interviews with rural and urban probationers (N = 1,464). Results of the three logistic regression models suggested that even when all the covariates are taken into account, urban probationers were significantly more likely to have been involved in 12-step programs, voluntary treatment, and mandated treatment over their lifespan. Despite high levels of self-reported substance use among all participants, treatment services were underused by rural probationers. These data suggest that individuals residing in rural communities may face additional barriers to receiving treatment services and that criminal involvement is associated with participation in peer recovery support groups and treatment. Future studies can investigate criminal involvement as an avenue to enhance recovery and how to overcome treatment barriers in rural areas.

AB  - This study aimed to identify factors that influenced retention in the National Institute on Drug Abuse-funded Women and Trauma Study, conducted within the Clinical Trials Network (CTN). Women (N=346) were recruited from and received treatment in 6 CTN-affiliated sites. Log-linear and logistic models were used to explore factors associated with retention. The mean number of treatment sessions attended was 6.8 (SD=3.9). Women with more education, higher attendance at 12-step meetings, and strong therapeutic alliance between facilitator and participant had better retention rates. Significant site differences were found; the site with the highest retention rate provided child care and had the lowest average monthly intake. To retain women with histories of trauma and substance abuse in "real world" psychiatric settings, emphasis on regulating individual-level and site-related modifiable variables are crucial. 2011 American Orthopsychiatric Association

AB  - Purpose: Evidence indicates 12-step mutual-help organizations (MHOs), such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA), can play an important role in extending and potentiating the recovery benefits of professionally-delivered addiction treatment among young adults with substance use disorders (SUD). However, concerns have lingered regarding the suitability of 12-step organizations for certain clinical subgroups, such as those with dual diagnosis (DD). This study examined the influence of diagnostic status (DD vs. SUD-only) on both attendance and active involvement (e.g., having a sponsor, verbal participation during meetings) in, and derived benefits from, 12-step MHOs following residential treatment. Methods: Young adults (N = 296; 18-24 yrs; 26% female; 95% Caucasian; 47% DD [based on SCID assessment]), enrolled in a prospective naturalistic study of SUD treatment effectiveness, were assessed at intake, and 3, 6, and 12 months after discharge on 12-step attendance/active involvement and percent days abstinent (PDA). Independent t- and chi<sup>2</sup> tests were used to assess for baseline clinical differences between DD and SUD-only groups. Hierarchical linear models (HLM) examined whether DD and SUD-only patients showed differential rates of attendance/active involvement over time. To investigate the primary question, lagged HLMs examined the extent to which diagnostic status uniquely influenced the simultaneous effects of 3-month and 6-month 12-step attendance/active involvement on 6-month and 12-month PDA. Results: At baseline, DD patients had significantly greater psychiatric and dependence symptomatology, substance use consequences, and recognition that their substance use had become problematic. For DD and SUD-only patients, post-treatment attendance and involvement in 12-step organizations was similarly high. Overall, DD patients had significantly lower PDA relative to their SUD-only counterparts. All patients appeared to benefit significantly from attendance and active involvement, with DD patients deriving somewhat greater benefit from high involvement (p = .056) resulting in outcomes similar to SUD-only patients. Conclusion: Despite concerns regarding the clinical utility of 12-step MHOs for DD patients, findings indicate that DD young adults participate as much as SUD-only patients. Further, higher levels of active 12-step involvement may help offset the additional recovery burden of a comorbid mental illness on substance use outcomes

AB  - Relapse rates remain high among people with opioid dependence. Identifying psychosocial factors associated with outcomes is important for informing behavioral treatments. This study examined religious coping, opioid use, and 12-step participation among 45 participants receiving inpatient opioid detoxification at baseline and follow-up. At baseline, higher positive coping was related to less frequent opioid use pre-admission (beta = -.44, p < .001) and history of 12-step participation (OR = 2.33, p < .05). Decreases in negative coping after discharge predicted less opioid use (beta = .55, p < .001), and increases in positive coping predicted more frequent 12-step program participation (beta = .42, p < .05). Positive religious coping may be protective, while negative religious coping may be a barrier to treatment

AB  - The aim of this research project is to provide basic information regarding the use of substances and its behavioral consequences such as health problems and criminal offences. It is the first survey in Greece in the field of self-help groups. The main research instrument was a 55-item questionnaire that was administered to members of NA and AA in the Greek cities of Athens, Thessaloniki, Series, Nafplio, Iraklio, and Katerini. This article presents an analysis of the answers given by the respondents to 12 of the 55 items of the questionnaire. It also includes a comparison of the relevant findings with data provided by the central organizations of AA and NA as well as by official therapeutic programs in Greece and by other researchers who have studied the same subject. More specifically, this article presents, examines and analyzes data which focuses on: (a) the age at which a substance was first used, (b) the time it took the individual respondents to acknowledge such use as a problem, (c) the main substance abused at the onset, (d) the main substance in use when the individuals approached the self-help group, (e) the existence or not of another individual with a substance abuse disorder in the immediate family, (f) possible health problems and (g) the entanglement or not with the penal justice system

AB  - Although much empirical work has examined the salutary impact of 12-step involvement on substance-related outcomes, far less is known about how 12-step involvement might impact other meaningful psychosocial outcomes. The current study examined correlates of six facets of psychological well-being (e.g., purpose in life) among Narcotics Anonymous (NA) members. NA is an international 12-step organization modeled after Alcoholics Anonymous. Members often report problematic use of alcohol and other drugs. We examined whether duration of abstinence and prescribed 12-step practices (e.g., 12-step work) predicted psychological wellbeing, over and above demographics and other covariates (e.g., neuroticism). NA members (N = 134) from over 25 US states completed an online survey assessing a broad array of recovery practices and psychosocial outcomes. Participants were required to have at least one year of continuous abstinence, which ranged from 1 to 33 years (M = 11.94, SD = 8.03). Six hierarchical regression models were estimated-one for each facet of psychological wellbeing. Age and sex were entered on the first predictor block; other covariates (e.g., neuroticism) were entered on the second predictor block; and twelve recovery-related predictors (e.g., time in recovery, 12-step work) were entered on the third block. The six models accounted for between 35% (autonomy) and 60% (environmental mastery) of outcome variance (M = 48, SD = 8). The set of recovery-related predictors accounted for significant incremental variance in purpose in life (17%), personal growth (14%), and positive relations with others (13%). The strongest individual predictor across all models was neuroticism, which was consistently associated with lower levels of psychological well-being. Time in recovery was positively associated with purpose in life, autonomy, and positive relations with others. Comfort at one's home group was positively associated with self acceptance, purpose in life, personal growth, and positive relations with others. Interestingly, time in recovery emerged as a more relevant developmental marker for psychological well-being than chronological age. In addition to stable personal characteristics (neuroticism) and time in recovery, other recovery experiences (e.g., comfort at hone's home group) were associated with psychological wellbeing. Although accruing time in recovery cannot be hastened, finding the right home group can occur relatively early on in recovery

AB  - Veterans have been found to be twice as likely to die of suicide compared to nonveterans in the general population. Veterans with comorbid alcohol/substance use disorders (ASUD) and depression may be at greater risk for suicide than veterans without these disorders. This study examined the temporal relationship between severity of suicidal ideation (SI) and alcohol and other substance use (ASU) over an 18-month clinical trial, utilizing dynamic latent difference score (LDS) modeling. The trial used Integrative Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and 12-Step Facilitation Therapy and consisted of 6 months of group psychotherapy and an additional 12-month follow-up phase. Interviews occurred at pretreatment and quarterly thereafter (approximately every 3 months). Three repeated measures of SI (Beck Depression Inventory question #9, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale question #22, and the Addiction Severity Index question #P8) served as observed indicator variables for the latent SI variable. A binary ASU variable (0=no use, 1=use) was developed for each 3-month assessment period using the Timeline Follow Back. The sample consisted of 236 predominantly male (88%) veterans (mean age 49) meeting DSM-IV criteria for alcohol, cannabis, and/or stimulant dependence and major depressive disorder. Univariate LDS structural equation models established a longitudinal change model of SI. A nonlinear change model, with a negative linear slope and a slightly positive quadratic slope, provided good fit to the data, v2(25, n = 222) = 37.02; CFI = 0.97; RMSEA = 0.05. This model of change suggests that individuals initially show a greater decrease in SI severity relative to the later time points. This suggests that change in SI severity is more pronounced during treatment and plateaus during follow-up. Next, the ASU variable was added as a time-varying predictor of longitudinal change in SI. This model also fit the data adequately, v2(60, n = 223) = 100.94; CFI = 0.89; RMSEA = 0.06. Results suggest that individuals with any alcohol and other substance use within the assessment period have a significant increase (b = 0.243, p < 0.05) in SI severity within that period. Findings suggest that among individuals with comorbid ASUD and depression, across time, any substance use increases SI severity. Consequently, it may be beneficial for clinicians to monitor and manage (i.e. safety planning) SI among patients with comorbid ASUD and depression who relapse to prevent escalation of SI and self-harm behaviors

AB  - This article describes the stigma women perceive as drug addicts and the strategies used to confront that stigma once they become members of a mutual support group, Narcotics Anonymous (NA). Stigma is heavily associated with being a drug addict and even more pronounced for the female drug addict. Public policy and media continue to focus on women's reproductive roles, igniting and perpetuating the stigmata associated with being female and addicted. The heavy emphasis on women's reproductive roles contributes to a double standard that women perceive it as unique to them as compared with their male counterparts. This study surveys a sample of women in NA that represents a potentially highly stigmatized group by race and class and uncovers the extent to which women perceive stigma both in their active addiction and once in recovery. Unexpectedly, women from a more socially disadvantaged background do not necessarily experience more stigma than their more privileged White, middle-class counterparts. Not surprisingly, women who have been involved in NA for longer periods of time and have completed the 12 steps perceive the least amount of stigma.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cocaine abuse among women of child-bearing years is a significant public health problem. This study evaluated the efficacy of contingency management (CM), the community reinforcement approach (CRA), and twelve-step facilitation (TSF) for cocaine-dependent pregnant women or women with young children METHODS: Using a 2x2 study design, 145 cocaine dependent women were randomized to 24 weeks of CRA or TSF and to monetary vouchers provided contingent on cocaine-negative urine tests (CM) or non-contingently but yoked in value (voucher control, VC). Primary outcome measures included the longest consecutive period of documented abstinence, proportion of cocaine-negative urine tests (obtained twice-weekly), and percent days using cocaine (PDC) during treatment. Documented cocaine abstinence at baseline and 3, 6, 9 and 12 months following randomization was a secondary outcome FINDINGS: CM was associated with significantly greater duration of cocaine abstinence (p<.01), higher proportion of cocaine-negative urine tests (p<0.01), and higher proportion of documented abstinence across the 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-month assessments (p<0.05), compared to VC. The differences between CRA and TSF were not significant for any of these measures (all p values >=0.75). PDC decreased significantly from baseline during treatment in all four groups (p<0.001) but did not differ significantly between CM and VC (p=0.10) or between TSF and CRA (p=0.23) INTERPRETATION: The study findings support the efficacy of CM for cocaine dependent pregnant women and women with young children but do not support greater efficacy of CRA compared to TSF or differential efficacy of CM when paired with either CRA or TSF.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between experiential avoidance, self-efficacy, powerlessness, and control over the future between two different self-help groups: Twelve-step and LifeRing. The hypotheses tested were: Hypothesis 1. Individuals attending Twelve-step will rate higher on experiential avoidance, measured by The Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (AAQ I) than individuals attending LifeRing groups. Hypothesis 2. Individuals attending LifeRing will score higher on factor 1 (Self-esteem-self-efficacy) on the Empowerment Scale than individuals attending Twelve-step. Hypothesis 3. Individuals attending Twelve-step will score higher on factor 2 (Power-powerlessness) on the Empowerment Scale than individuals attending LifeRing. Hypothesis 4. Individuals attending LifeRing will score higher on Factor 4 (Optimism and control over the future) measured by the Empowerment Scale than those attending Twelve-step. One-way analysis of variance and multivariate analysis of variance were used in order to determine whether a difference existed between groups on the dependent variables. The instruments for this study were The Making Decisions Questionnaire (Rogers, Chamberline, Ellison, & Crean, 1997), and the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire- AAQ (Hayes et al., 2004). Individuals were also asked to complete a demographics survey. Although the survey requested that participants identify one self-help group, some participants wrote that they identified with more than one (Twelve-step: 55, 49%; LifeRing: 40, 36%; Both Twelve-step and LifeRing: 16, 14.4%). Included in the LifeRing group were 22 individuals who had switched from Twelve-step to LifeRing for various reasons. Sample demographics were as follows: male, 51.4% ( n = 57); Caucasian, 67.6% (n = 75); single, 46.8%, (n = 52); and living in independent housing, 79.3% (n = 88). The present study found no significant differences between the two self-help groups for the variables measured: experiential avoidance, self-efficacy, powerlessness, and control over the future. This suggests that LifeRing is equally effective as Twelve-step, which has been in existence for over 70 years. The present findings suggest various clinical and policy implications

AB  - Background: The aim of this study is to make an evaluation of the effectiveness of long-term outpatient treatment for addiction on the basis of abstinence, cognitive functions, and changes in personality structure. Methods: This is a prospective cohort study of 259 patients with registration of the German core data set "addiction", a 12-month follow-up and neuropsychological testing (personality inventory, intelligence and cognitive functions). Results: One year after the end of the long-term treatment we see an abstinence rate (DGSS4) of 57.5%. The most substantial factors in abstinence are the participation in a self-help-group (beta=0.734, p < 0.0001). Known negative predictors such as unemployment (beta=-0.093, p < 0.01) and problematic debts over 15,000$ (beta = -0.104, p <0.01 just show a small negative correlation with abstinence. The results seems to indicate that patients have better overall performance and achieve better results in the neuropsychological testing at the end of the rehabilitation. The ideal and self-image may be changed positively. We see also unspecific changes classified by a reduction of the psychological test values regarding conversion symptoms, depressive mood, psychasthenia and social isolation. At the end of the long-term treatment the patients show significantly better cognitive functions and an improvement in their ideals and self-images. Conversion symptoms, depressive mood and reduced values for psychasthenia and social isolation can be decreased. Discussion: These results of a psycho-dynamic outpatient treatment of addiction seem to show its high effectiveness in terms of abstinence and processing of drug structures. The cognitive functions could increase. This could be determinate of a condition for the conservation and restoration of working capacity. Further studies should differentiate the effect of insight into the dependency structure from the abstinence as an specific or unspecific effect

AB  - A recent trial (n = 508) of "Making Alcoholics Anonymous Easier" (MAAEZ), a group-format 12-step facilitation program, showed that MAAEZ participants had increased odds of abstinence (OR = 1.58; p = 0.063). Effects were especially marked in several subgroups, including those with more prior AA/NA/CA exposure, and those with severe psychiatric problems. This paper examines whether the effects of MAAEZ were explained by higher engagement in particular Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and other 12-step organization activities. Mediation analyses were performed, estimating MAAEZ effects attributable to AA/NA/CA meeting attendance, overall AA/NA/CA involvement, having a sponsor, and engaging in 12-step service. The only variable that appeared to mediate MAAEZ effects in the sample overall was doing service at either 6 months or at both 6 and 12 months. Among those with high prior AA/NA/CA attendance, both having a sponsor and doing service emerged as mediators, with having a sponsor explaining approximately 25% of the MAAEZ effect. Doing service also partially explained the MAAEZ effect among those with high psychiatric severity. Results highlight the value of studying specific AA/NA/CA activities as mediators of treatment effects, and demonstrate the importance of exploring subgroups when trying to understand treatment mechanisms. Findings also suggest that treatment programs should emphasize specific activities for particular clients. For example, individuals may have attended many AA/NA/CA meetings, but never known how to ask for a sponsor or get involved in service; doing service may represent a non-threatening way of connecting with 12-step members for clients with psychiatric problems such as social anxiety.

AB  - Background and Objective. The basis of substance use disorders (SUD) is formed with regard to biopsychosocial aspects. By following the SUD biological model exclusively, the effectiveness of treatment is limited since all the formation aspects of SUD are not taken into account. By using the psychosocial model, however, the understanding and treatment of a substance use illness becomes enhanced and is more effective. A key role in this model is played by self-help groups and psychotherapy. The aim of this study was to determine the viewpoint of patients with substance use disorders in terms of the number of visits, duration of treatment, efficacy of self-help groups, and individual and group psychotherapy in different treatment methods. Material and Methods. The participants were approached by researchers at two drug and alcohol services in Latvia. In total, 587 patients received questionnaires developed by the authors of the study. Results. All the 587 questionnaires of both outpatient respondents (n=200, 34.1%) and inpatient respondents (n=387, 65.9%) were analyzed. Of all the outpatient department respondents, 41.5% (n=83) attended self-help groups, 28.5% (n=57) individual psychotherapy, and 14.5% (n=29) group psychotherapy; the inpatient department respondents were 2 to 4 times less often involved in the measures. Conclusions. The outpatient respondents were more frequently employed. They attended self-help groups and psychotherapy and obtained longer remission comparing with inpatient respondents. This study has shown that patients had a greater success rate in staying in remission, maintaining outpatient care and shedding the need of inpatient care

AB  - Low attendance in addiction treatment, particularly in cases of comorbidity, has been identified as a pervasive challenge. We examine predictors of treatment retention in a sample of veterans (N = 253) participating in a clinical trial comparing two types of psychotherapy for co-occurring depression and substance use disorders. The study protocol included 24 weeks of outpatient group psychotherapy in either a newly developed Integrated Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (ICBT) or Twelve-Step Facilitation Therapy (TSF). Using a model of treatment utilization developed by Aday and Anderson, we analyzed predictors categorized into predisposing factors, enabling resources, need for treatment, and type of treatment received. Outcome included total number of sessions attended (maximum of 36 sessions). Treatment retention did not differ between the two study interventions. Bivariate analyses indicated that predisposing factors were most predictive, with older participants, Caucasians, and those using only alcohol in the month before treatment attending more sessions, and individuals who had recently experienced a health event remained in treatment longer Importantly, several factors were not related to treatment retention: marital status, education, neuropsychological functioning, financial stress, chronic health problems, treatment motivation, and psychiatric severity In the combined model of predisposing, enabling and need factors, age and ethnicity were the only significant predictors.

AB  - This study tracked graduates of a community-based substance abuse treatment program for homeless men in Houston, Texas. A standardized assessment instrument was developed to determine what characteristics were associated with a more favorable outcome. The authors found that abstinence was strongly predicted by employment, 12-Step work with Alcoholics Anonymous sponsors, and service with others in sobriety. In contrast to expectations, abstinence was not predicted by the programmatic goals of affiliation with a home church and/or identification of a mentor. Results support continued use of evidence-based outcome determinants for the Open Door Mission and other community-based substance abuse treatment programs. 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study implemented and evaluated procedures to help clinicians effectively refer dually diagnosed (substance use and psychiatric disorders) patients to dual-focused mutual-help groups (DFGs) METHODS: Using a cohort cyclical turnover design, individuals with dual diagnoses beginning a new outpatient mental health treatment episode (N=287) entered a standard- or an intensive-referral condition. Participants provided self-reports of 12-step mutual-help (DFG and substance-focused group [SFG]) attendance and involvement and substance use and psychiatric symptoms at baseline and six-month follow-up. The intensive referral intervention focused on encouraging patients to attend DFG meetings RESULTS: Compared to patients in the standard condition, those in the intensive referral intervention were more likely to attend and be involved in DFGs and SFGs, and had less drug use and better psychiatric outcomes at follow-up. Attending more intensive-referral sessions was associated with more DFG and SFG meeting attendance. More need fulfillment in DFGs, and more readiness to participate in SFGs, were associated with better alcohol and psychiatric outcomes at six months. However, only 23% of patients in the intensive-referral group attended a DFG meeting during the six-month follow-up period CONCLUSIONS: The intensive referral intervention enhanced participation in both DFGs and SFGs and was associated with better six-month outcomes. The findings suggest that intensive referral to mutual-help groups focus on its key components (e.g., linking patients to 12-step volunteers) rather than type of group.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study was to advance understanding of the efficacy of 12-step programs by determining the temporal relationships between alcohol and illicit drug use among 12- step program affiliates METHOD: A total of 253 early 12-step affiliates without extensive histories of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) attendance were recruited from substance use treatment and community-based AA. A majority of the sample met criteria for a diagnosis of alcohol dependence, reported lifetime use of illicit drugs, and reported illicit drug use in the 90-day period before recruitment. After informed consent, participants were interviewed at intake and in 3-month increments for 1 year RESULTS: Preliminary analyses indicated that 12-step attendance was predictive of reductions in substance use and that such reductions were not moderated by illicit substance use disorder diagnosis or alcohol problem severity. Lagged hierarchical linear models indicated that illicit drug use was a robust predictor of later use of alcohol, although the frequency and intensity of drinking were contingent on whether participants sustained 12-step program affiliation. Alcohol use did not predict later illicit drug use among participants who sustained 12-step program participation CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that 12-step participation may serve as a protective factor after substance use occurs. Although our results suggest that the initiation of illicit drug use may undermine efforts to achieve and sustain abstinence from alcohol, our findings do not suggest that alcohol use necessarily mobilizes relapse across different substances among 12-step program affiliates

AB  - This study examines the relationship among 4 treatment stages (i.e., engagement, persuasion, active treatment, relapse prevention) and the composition, social support, and structural characteristics of personal networks. The study sample includes 242 women diagnosed with substance dependence who were interviewed within their first month of intensive outpatient treatment. Using EgoNet software, the women reported on their 25 alter personal networks and the characteristics of each alter. With one exception, few differences were found in the network compositions at different stages of substance abuse treatment. The exception was the network composition of women in the active treatment stage, which included more network members from treatment programs or 12-Step meetings. Although neither the type nor amount of social support differed across treatment stages, reciprocity differed between women in active treatment and those in the engagement stage. Networks of women in active treatment were less connected, as indicated by a higher number of components, whereas networks of women in the persuasion stage had a higher degree of centralization, as indicated by networks dominated by people with the most ties. Overall, we find social network structural variables to relate to the stage of treatment, whereas network composition, type of social support, and sociodemographic variables (with a few exceptions) do not relate to treatment stage. Results suggest that social context, particularly how social contacts are arranged around clients, should be incorporated into treatment programs, regardless of demographic background.

AB  - Background: From a health services perspective, peer-based resources merit special attention. Participation in self-help fellowships, like the Twelve Step Groups (TSGs), have been shown to improve outcomes of patients with substance use disorder (SUD) and they represent a valuable adjunct to the SUD treatment system. This study investigated the relationship between patient perceptions of TSGs and the intent to participate in TSGs after receiving detoxification treatment. Methods: We included 139 patients that entered a detoxification unit (detox) in Kristiansand, Norway. We analyzed factors associated with the intention to participate in TSGs post-discharge with contingency tables and ordinal regression analysis. Results: Forty-eight percent of patients had participated in TSGs before entering detox. Respondents saw more advantages than disadvantages in TSG participation, but only 40% of patients showed high intentions of participating in TSGs post-discharge. A high intention to participate in TSGs was most strongly correlated with the notion that participation in TSGs could instill the courage to change. In a multivariate analysis, the perception that TSGs were beneficial was the strongest factor related to a high intention of TSG participation after treatment. Conclusions: Our findings increased the understanding of factors most likely to influence decisions to attend TSGs in SUD treatment contexts with uncommon TSG participation. Our results suggested that the majority of patients may be sufficiently influenced by highlighting the potential gains of TSG participation. Treatment programs that do not focus on self-help group attendance during and after treatment should consider implementing facilitative measures to enhance utilization of these fellowships

AB  - This study grouped treatment-seeking individuals (n = 1825) by common patterns of 12-step attendance using 5 waves of data (75% interviewed Year 9) to isolate unique characteristics and use-related outcomes distinguishing each class profile. The "high" class reported the highest attendance and abstention. The "descending" class reported high baseline alcohol severity, long treatment episodes, and high initial attendance and abstinence, but by Year 5, their attendance and abstinence dropped. The "early-drop" class, which started with high attendance and abstinence but with low problem severity, reported no attendance after Year 1. The "rising" class, with fairly high alcohol and psychiatric severity throughout, reported initially low attendance, followed by increasing attendance paralleling their abstention. Last, the "low" and "no" classes, which reported low problem severity and very low/no attendance, had the lowest abstention. Female gender and high alcohol severity predicted attendance all years. Consistent with a sustained benefit for 12-step exposure, abstinence patterns aligned much like attendance profiles. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved

AB  - This study examined the longitudinal association between substance use and depressive symptoms in veterans receiving outpatient treatment for comorbid substance use disorder and major depression. Veterans (N = 237, mean age = 48.2 years, 90% male, 70% Caucasian) received either 6 months of group integrated cognitive�_"behavioral therapy or twelve-step facilitation. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores and percent days using any substance were assessed every 3 months up to 1 year posttreatment. Greater substance use predicted time-varying elevations in depression above individual patterns of change in depression. Moreover, change in depressive symptoms was associated with change in both the likelihood of any substance use and the frequency of use during the treatment and follow-up periods. Changes in these symptoms appear to be linked, such that individuals with greater reductions in substance use have greater reductions in depressive symptoms (and vice versa).

AB  - Among substance-dependent individuals, comorbid major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with greater severity and poorer treatment outcomes, but little research has examined mediators of posttreatment substance use outcomes within this population. Using latent growth curve models, the authors tested relationships between individual rates of change in 12-step involvement and substance use, utilizing posttreatment follow-up data from a trial of group Twelve-Step Facilitation (TSF) and integrated cognitive-behavioral therapy (ICBT) for veterans with substance dependence and MDD. Although TSF patients were higher on 12-step affiliation and meeting attendance at end-of-treatment as compared with ICBT, they also experienced significantly greater reductions in these variables during the year following treatment, ending at similar levels as ICBT. Veterans in TSF also had significantly greater increases in drinking frequency during follow-up, and this group difference was mediated by their greater reductions in 12-step affiliation and meeting attendance. Patients with comorbid depression appear to have difficulty sustaining high levels of 12-step involvement after the conclusion of formal 12-step interventions, which predicts poorer drinking outcomes over time. Modifications to TSF and other formal 12-step protocols or continued therapeutic contact may be necessary to sustain 12-step involvement and reduced drinking for patients with substance dependence and MDD

AB  - Individuals with comorbid internalizing psychological symptoms and substance abuse issues often have more negative outcomes and evidence a relative disparity in treatment gains compared to those with only substance abuse issues. The present study examined social mechanisms over time for individuals living in self-governed recovery homes (Oxford Houses) such as 12-step group activities and social support, which likely influence both abstinence and psychological outcomes. Participants (n = 567) from a national US sample of Oxford Houses completed baseline and multiple follow-up self-report assessments over a one-year period. A structural equation model was utilized to evaluate predicted relationships among baseline symptoms, 12-step activities, social support, and outcome variables. Results indicated that internalizing symptoms were associated with subsequent mutual-help activities, but not directly with social support. Living in an Oxford House for six months and number of 12-step meetings attended were partially mediated by social support variables in predicting abstinence outcomes, but not psychological outcomes. Environments such as Oxford Houses may be viable options for recovering individuals with comorbid internalizing psychological problems, although social support mechanisms primarily promote abstinence. Implications for future research and for Oxford House policies are discussed. �� 2013 Taylor & Francis

AB  - Observations of 780 third-grade classrooms described classroom activities, child-teacher interactions, and dimensions of the global classroom environment, which were examined in relation to structural aspects of the classroom and child behavior. 1 child per classroom was targeted for observation in relation to classroom quality and teacher and child behavior. These children were enrolled in the ongoing NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development: 80% of the sample was Caucasian, 22% had a family income-to-needs ratio of 2.0 or less, and 26% of mothers had a high school education or less. Classrooms were observed for a minimum of eight, 30-minute cycles over the course of the day, beginning at the start of the school day, with an intention of observing during academic instruction time. Time samplings of activities, teacher behaviors, and child behaviors as well as global ratings of the classroom environment were obtained. The most frequently observed forms of activity were whole-group instruction or individual seatwork. As expected, the largest portion of time was allocated to literacy-related activities. By a ratio of nearly 11:1, instructional activities (across any content area) were basic-skill-focused versus focused on analysis/inference or synthesis of information. There was wide variation in the frequency of most activities across classrooms. Global ratings also demonstrated significant variability across classrooms. Global and time-sampled codes of teacher behavior and classroom climate were only slightly related to a range of structural factors, such as class size, child-teacher ratio, or teacher experience. Students' engagement in academic activities was higher when classrooms provided more instructional and emotional support. From first to third grade, global aspects of the classroom, such as positive climate or teacher sensitivity, had significant but low stability; time devoted to literacy or math activities was uncorrelated across the two grade levels. These findings suggest that third grade is a highly variable context for children in the United States with a strong emphasis on learning basic skills and that structural factors, such as class size and teacher education and experience, show little relation to the experiences of children in classrooms.

AB  - Inclusion has been a central educational issue for well over a quarter of a century, with continuing emphasis worldwide on initiatives by governments, Higher Education Institutions and schools that respond to the needs of children and young people with learning difficulties, disabilities or other disadvantage. This paper reports how Northern Ireland head teachers interpret inclusion in the nursery, primary, post-primary and special sectors. Those in mainstream schools showed whole-hearted commitment to the philosophy and practice of inclusion, and could critically examine what they have achieved so far. However, they recognized persistent and varied constraints both within and beyond their schools. Head teachers in the special sector perceived their schools to have a multiple role in providing for pupils with the greatest need, reintegrating those on placement into their regular schools, and offering outreach support to mainstream colleagues. The implications for all aspects of teacher education were identified, for beginning teachers, for more experienced practitioners and for the head teachers themselves. A number of key factors were suggested to make inclusion work. (Contains 1 table.)

AB  - Surveyed and observed 45 preschools (parent cooperative, traditional proprietary, church-controlled, Montessori, drop-in center, and college laboratory) in Michigan to determine whether programs and physical facilities existed in the area that could be recommended to parents of handicapped children. Data on the physical plant design, adult-child ratio, availability of learning materials, toys and cots, and the management style of the teachers were obtained during a 2-hr observation period and from staff responses to questionnaire. Most of the preschool directors and teachers included in the study revealed a positive attitude toward integrating handicapped and developmentally delayed children into their programs, indicative of changing beliefs and values regarding the handicapped.

AB  - Investigated (a) the course of developmental trajectories toward violence over middle childhood, (b) whether and how the course of these trajectories differed by demographic subgroups of children, and (c) how responsive these trajectories were to a universal, school-based preventive intervention. Four waves of data on features of children's social-emotional development known to forecast aggression/violence were collected over 2 yrs for a highly representative sample of 1st to 6th grade children from New York City public elementary schools (N=11,160). Using hierarchical linear modeling techniques, synthetic growth curves were estimated for the entire sample and were conditioned on child demographic characteristics (gender, family economic resources, race/ethnicity) and amount of exposure to components of the preventive intervention. Three patterns of growth--positive linear, late acceleration, and gradual deceleration--characterized the children's trajectories, and these trajectories varied meaningfully by child demographic characteristics. Children whose teachers taught a high number of lessons in the conflict resolution curriculum demonstrated positive changes in their social-emotional developmental trajectories and deflections from a path toward future aggression and violence.

AB  - PURPOSE: In children with spinal dysraphism such as myelomeningocele the relation between muscle mass and body composition varies considerably. Therefore, it is difficult to evaluate the relevance of renal function assessments done with serum creatinine. Since serum cystatin C has been suggested to be independent of body size and composition, this evaluation was compared to chromium(51) edetic acid clearance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Simultaneous measurements of cystatin C and chromium(51) edetic acid clearance were performed prospectively in 65 patients 2 to 19 years old with spinal dysraphism. RESULTS: Cystatin C values were within the normal range in all patients, while chromium(51) edetic acid clearance was reduced in 10. A significant relation was seen. CONCLUSIONS: Using chromium(51) edetic acid clearance as a gold standard, children with spinal dysraphism and slightly to moderately reduced renal function may remain undiagnosed if cystatin C is used for evaluation.

AB  - Assessed 72 normal and 61 retarded children's use of color, number, length, and continuous quantity as attributes of identity by presenting the Ss with contrived changes in these properties. Mean Binet MAs were 6.3 for normals and 6.2 for retardates. Surprise to the change of color occurred at lower MAs than surprise to all quantitative properties among normals and to continuous quantity and (nonsignificantly) to length among retardates. More retardates than MA-matched normals were surprised at the change of quantity (p = .058), but there were no other significant group differences. Study II employed 64 normal children (mean MA = 5.2). Significant relations between surprise and both recognition and reconstruction memory were found for color and number. Surprise and correct memory responses for color preceded those to number, which preceded logical verbal responses to a conventional number-conservation task. (15 ref.)

AB  - This article presents practical tools for evidence-based assessment of students’ behavioral/emotional/social difficulties and strengths in culturally sensitive ways. The assessment instruments obtain teacher, parent, and student ratings, plus observations in classrooms and other group settings, in interviews, and in testing sessions. To document differences in students’ functioning in school and other contexts, plus differences between teacher, parent, and student perspectives, users can display cross-informant comparisons of ratings of specific difficulties items. Users can also display cross-informant comparisons between bar graphs of scores on empirically derived syndromes, DSM-oriented scales, Internalizing, Externalizing, and Total Problems. Scale scores are standardized according to norms for students’ gender and age, type of informant (teacher, parent, student), and multicultural norms. Multicultural norms are based on teacher, parent, and student ratings of population samples of students in many societies. The ratings were used to construct gender-, age-, and informant-specific norms for societies having relatively low difficulties scores, medium scores, or high scores. The assessment instruments can be used to identify students who need help and to tailor interventions to students’ needs. The same instruments can be used to measure changes by comparing pre- versus post-intervention scores. Brief instruments assess progress over short periods.

AB  - As poverty, dysfunctional families, and special needs continue to affect students, educators seek improved ways to start children in formal education. One such approach is to lower the teacher-to-pupil ratios, and recent research shows that this method positively influences pupil achievement. How the process works is not well understood. To fill this gap in knowledge, an examination of how teachers teach in these classrooms is provided in this report. The study describes life in a primary-grade classroom (with a low teacher-pupil ratio) in a fully Chapter 1-eligible school. Procedures for the research included interviews, structured classroom observations, informal classroom visitations, and the comparison of project school processes with research, other small-class settings, and"regular" or non-small settings. The focus was on first grade results, with comparisons offered for kindergarten and second grade. Findings show that comparisons of the pre- and post-observations of teachers indicated few observed changes in their behaviors following inservice activities. However, teachers in small classes demonstrated high levels of individualized instruction and minimal discipline problems. Factors such as space and materials facilitated instruction, and pretests and posttests indicated that students' performance in the small classes (n=14) were significantly better than those in the larger (n=23) classes.

AB  - Most research about transition in educational settings describes how children enter into new contexts, especially transition from preschool to school. However, the overall research focus in this article is to gain knowledge about how the transition process can be characterized at the end of the preschool period prior to the actual transition. The data reported in this article was generated through visits to preschool class which have the intention to prepare children prior to the transition. The results support the conclusion that the transition process can be characterized as circular rather than linear, or maybe a spiral process that loops back and forth. The children in this study engage in a number of border encounters and border crossings between preschool and preschool class during the spring semester prior to the actual entering. After each border crossing they return to preschool and seem to reconstruct their experiences and expectations of preschool class. This looping movement highlights the identity deconstructions as a social learning process over time. It is shown that children enter the transitions process long before they actually (physically) enter or visit school. The results also propose that the transition is a period when the constructing of identities as ex preschool children may be important. In this process, the teachers in preschool have an important role in order to facilitate the children’s disengagement from preschool. The study also implies the need for teacher collaboration in order to make the transition transparent and explicit for the children.

AB  - Föreliggande studie fokuserar på hur barns övergångar till och från förskoleklass organiseras på olika skolor. Via en webbaserad enkät söks skolledares argument för denna organisering. I analysen nyttjas ett ramfaktorteoretiskt tänkande som kompletteras med teorier om praktiskt förnuft samt kontinuitetsbegreppet. Resultaten visar att barn tenderar att göra fler övergångar mellan barngrupper och sociala gemenskaper ju yngre de är. Fördelningen av skolledarnas svar visar att majoriteten, på grund av yttre villkor, delar förskolegrupperna till nya klasser i övergången till förskoleklass. Däremot indikeras inte samma rörlighet i övergången till årskurs 1. Resultaten visar hur arbetet med att organisera övergångarna utgör en komplex väv av yttre faktiska villkor som barnantal och upptagningsområdets storlek, av inre logiker och föreställningar om vad som är det bästa för barnen och det bästa för det fortsatta lärandet samt av skolans tradition av att organisera för arbetet med övergångar.

AB  - This study presents an innovative field experiment exploring ethnic discrimination in contacts between local public officials and members of Swedish society. Using a correspondence study design, fictitious individuals with Arabic-and Swedish-sounding names contacted Swedish municipalities via email, asking questions about access to preschools. The findings indicate disadvantageous treatment of individuals with Arabic-sounding names in terms of the informal tone of the replies, as Swedish-sounding names were replied to in a friendlier, more welcoming way. Regarding the more formal aspects of the emails - i.e., whether they were replied to at all and the questions posed were directly answered - no statistically significant signs of discrimination emerge (although differences were of some substantial size, to the disadvantage of Arabic-sounding names). Still, informal disadvantageous treatment is sufficient cause for concern and noteworthy in the case of Sweden, considering its reputation as being egalitarian, immigration friendly and democratically well functioning.

AB  - Introduction: The complexity of the Child and Youth version of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, the ICF-CY, is a challenge for occupational therapists and other professionals in clinical work. Code sets including only essential categories help to make it more user-friendly. Thus far, code sets have been developed to reflect functioning for children in different developmental periods. However, there are no code sets that support screening of participation in everyday life situations and can be used across diagnoses. This exploratory study is the first attempt to develop code sets for preschoolers’ (age 0-6 years) everyday life situations. Method: Using sequential Delphi processes with expert panels consisting of 35 professionals in five interdisciplinary early intervention teams and six parents of children, the study identified content in three code sets: Sleeping, Mealtimes and Play. Results: A limited number of relevant categories were identified for three code sets: Sleeping (12), Mealtimes (21) and Play (30). Findings suggested a professional focus on Environmental factors compared with a parental focus on Body functions. Conclusion: It is important to consider the opinions of all involved when developing code sets to provide a common framework for screening of children’s everyday functioning.

AB  - BackgroundA curriculum was planned using modern concepts based on the “old” principles to test if such an educational intervention provided pupils with good mental health and a solid basis for good reading and writing skills, as well as generated a positive attitude to learn. These “old” principles were based on previous knowledge derived from school psychiatry (which in Sweden was a branch of child and adolescent psychiatry 1915–1970), educational psychology and the educational approach from the differentiating Swedish School system of 1946–1970 (itself based on the principles of curative education “Heilpädagogie”, which was later renamed mental health care).MethodsAll six available schools in the small Swedish city of Sävsjö participated in the study. In these six schools there were eight preschool classes that included every 6-year old child living in the city. In total there were 184 families with 186 children (including 2 pairs of twins) who belonged to these preschool classes and were invited to take part in the study. One family moved just before school-start and 8 decided not to participate, thus 177 children (84 boys and 93 girls, aged 5.6–6.6 years) entered the study. The preschool classes were randomized into an experimental group with four preschool classes and a comparison group with four preschool classes. The experimental group followed a teaching program from the start of the preschool year until the end of grade 3 that was tailored to each student’s individual capacity based on the concepts of school maturation and curative education used in the Swedish schools during the period 1946–1970. The comparison group followed today’s average Swedish school curriculum. The project was planned as an intervention study covering the preschool year and the first 3 years of elementary school, which was to form a basis for a follow-up when the pupils had left senior high, the 12th year in Swedish public school. The outcome and the achievements were measured at end of grade 3 using standardized tests on reading, writing and mathematical skills. Behavior was assessed at school start and at end of grade 3 using the Child Behavior Check List (CBCL-scales) in addition to a questionnaire on Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (AD/HD) with criteria from DSM-IV. The children made a self-evaluation of their attitude towards learning.ResultsAt the end of school year 3, the children in the experimental group had an improved reading capacity (p = 0.002, effect size(es) = 4.35) and reading comprehension (p = 0.03, es = 0.04). They evaluated their own reading (p = 0.02, es = 0.23), writing (p = 0.007, es = 0.35) and mathematical skills (p = 0.003, es = 0.48) as going “very well” when compared to comparison group. Differences regarding intelligence quotas between the groups at the start of school had disappeared by the end of grade 3. No differences referring to CBCL were found at end of grade 3. One child in the comparison group fulfilled criteria for AD/HD, according to parents and teachers.ConclusionsThe alternative curriculum covering the preschool year through the first 3 years of elementary school based on the old principles from curative education (“Heilpädagogie”), educational psychology and school psychiatry gave the children in the experimental group a better reading capacity and reading comprehension.Trial registration The study started in 1998. The data were collected longitudinally and prospectively but have not been analyzed until now, with the children having left senior high. A retrospective registration in the ISRCTN is pending.

AB  - Pre-school education prepares students for next stages. Therefore, parents consider certain factors before choosing schools for their children. A trend to prefer private schools than government schools for children has grown up rapidly in Bahawalpur. This has attracted researchers to study the factors behind the success of private in comparison to government schools. The present study aims to analyze the current position of pre-school education in government and private schools of Bahawalpur. This study was completed by a survey method. Questionnaire for teachers and a checklist for school heads were the tools of this study. The sample of this study was 298 school heads and 298 pre-school teachers teaching to the nursery, prep and Kindergarten classes. The results of the study indicated that all schools had not an ideal situation for quality pre-school education. Teacher-student ratio was not appropriate in government and private schools according to the requirements of effective pre-school education. Classrooms were overcrowded in both government and private schools. Majority of schools had more than 25 students in a section. A maximum number of students observed in a section was 50 in private and 70 in government schools. Results indicated that government schools had more qualified teachers in comparison to private schools. But these schools were found weak in comparison to private schools about classroom out/look, parents' involvement, planning, monitoring, pedagogical techniques applied in schools, co-curricular activities and motivation of teachers. A major weakness in private schools was observed that majority of teachers had no training in teaching. So, this study has suggested the authorities to take actions to improve the pre-school level education.

AB  - This study examined the day caring methods among the civil servants of reproductive age with children between three months to four years in Lagos State Nigeria. The research design employed for this study was a descriptive research design. A total number of 212 teachers and 128 ministry workers making a total of 340 reproductive age mothers were purposively selected from the State. A self-structured questionnaire was used to collect information from the respondents. Accidental sampling technique was adapted to survey the respondents for this study. Data were analyzed using frequency distribution, simple percentages and inferential statistic of t-test analysis. The results of the study revealed that 30 (8.8%) teachers and 33 (9.7%) ministry workers agreed that they kept their child/children in crèche. The study showed that 188 (55.3%) teachers and 92 (27%) ministry workers agreed that they wanted to have time to care for themselves, while 204 (60%) teachers and 38 (11.2%) ministry workers agreed that they liked to get back to their work and be efficient. It was also revealed that a reasonable proportion of the teachers agreed that there were adequate personnel and adequate rooms for learning, while the ministry workers disagreed. The results further showed that many of the day care workers were not well educated. Based on the findings, it is recommended that the civil servants should be educated on the need to adopt the modern and educative methods of day care.

AB  - Early Childhood Education (ECE) comprises essential programmes and activities which are critical to holistic development, academic success and future achievements of children. ECE is recognised by the federal government of Nigeria as a foundational and essential programme that Nigerian children must experience. This is why the government has given highly rated attention to it through various interventions that include formulation of policy documents and network of relationships among different sectors. Unfortunately, various challenges are facing the implementation of ECE in Nigeria. This paper examines the challenges that are militating against this important early education in pre-primary schools. Some practical ways to overcome the challenges are provided.

AB  - Writing often begins during the very early years of childhood; however, some children first learn writing when they begin attending school. Teachers’ beliefs about early writing development can influence when and how children learn to write. The purpose of this study was to determine kindergarten teachers’ beliefs about the development of children’s emergent writing in Qatari preschool settings. A 30-item questionnaire was completed by 93 kindergarten teachers with a range of qualifications, years of teaching experience, areas of specialisation, and preschool teaching level. They were selected from private and government-funded schools in Doha. The questionnaire consisted of four components: mechanisms of writing, concepts of writing, conventions of writing, and composing. The questionnaire responses indicated that teachers hold positive beliefs regarding most emergent writing components, with concepts of writing receiving the highest mean score, followed by mechanisms of writing. The results also revealed statistically significant differences among teachers due to a number of study variables. Based on these findings, the researchers offered a number of suggestions and recommendations aimed at promoting children’s emergent writing in Qatari preschool settings and similar contexts.

AB  - PROBLEM: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of the kindergarten performance in the UNICEF expansion project between 1990 and 1994. METHOD: The sample of the study included 65 schools out of the project's 103 kindergartens. Questionnaires and structured interviews were developed; a special team was formed and trained in data collection techniques. RESULTS: The results of the descriptive statistics showed that teachers' performances were lower than expected in relation to their experiences, training, and teacher–child ratio. Also, the teachers were found to be unable to design curricula relevant to their work, or to use educational media properly. Regarding buildings and facilities, it was found that only 21% of the kindergartens had independent buildings of their own. In addition, kindergartens lacked proper space, heating, and ventilation. The results also revealed that the level of parental involvement in kindergarten activities was rather low. Finally, there seems to be no evaluation system nor instruments in use to assess performance. Twelve recommendations were suggested to improve kindergarten functioning.

AB  - This study highlights teachers’ experiences with transition from Swedish preschool to preschool class, i. e. from the daycare centre to the formal school. One assumption was that transition activities, to favour continuity in the long-term, need to focus on children’s learning within the target areas that the policy documents specify for preschool. Empirical data were collected through a combination of a questionnaire and interviews. The study shows that transition activities occur between institutions. These are in place to allow for a safe transition for children rather than to allow for continuous and long-term learning in the target areas in the curriculum. Care for children and beliefs about the types of school activities have an impact on the activities and standpoints in the transition processes. Professional assessment of children’s learning and the need for greater consensus within various types of schools in terms of the learning of the individual child in different fields are discussed.

AB  - The purpose of the dissertation is to study, describe and analyses which comparative measurement activities preschool children construct and use, and how they solve problems and communicate when they use the comparative measurement activities whilst playing with Lego (“the Lego play”). The measurement activities chosen are length/height, quantity and time. The empirical material is based on data from two preschool classes with children aged 2 – 5 year, It was collected through participant observation (video captures) of the children’s Lego play. The theoretical starting points in this study are grounded in childhood sociology and the sociocultural perspective. The study assumes the childhood sociology perspective by viewing the children as competent and active in creating meaning as well as controlling and influencing their own and others’ social environment. The sociocultural perspective gives prominence to development and learning, and its related tools and concepts are used to analyses the results of the study. That is, the Lego play is studied in a social context from the child’s perspective, and the sociocultural perspective describes and analyses the child’s use of mathematics and the acquisition of knowledge in the Lego play in a sociocultural context. The results show that children measuring length/height and quantity explored a store of measurement tools in order to make comparisons, and adapted these to the context in question. These were own body, other body, artefacts, numbers and counting. The measurements were used individually and with others, and the solving of the own or shared problems constituted a large share of the time spent constructing models during Lego play. By contrast, the time concept was used mainly as a tool when the children played with their finished Lego models. Thus, a time perspective was added to the child’s finished model, which inspired thoughts and reflections about time used in the Lego play. The children used the time concepts of the present, the past and the future, and also considered the concept of velocity in the context of the timescale. The children’s communication had a large impact on the Lego play, and they expressed their ideas verbally, physically and through action. The children’s use of mathematics was prominent and meaningful during the Lego play.

AB  - Researchers observed pre-kindergarten through second-grade public school classrooms, specifically noting child-centered and teacher-directed pedagogical approaches, by simultaneously examining: (a) student behavior and activities, (b) teacher instructional orientation and rationale, and (c) overall classroom environment. Dissimilar to previous studies, researchers noted the nature of activity structure and various student demographic variables. Additionally, unlike prior classroom observation studies that included an overwhelming percentage of white students, the current study was comprised of a large percentage of Hispanic and African American students. The findings revealed: little to no variation existed in the activities in which young children were engaged in their classrooms, nor in the instructional practices utilized by their early childhood teachers; however, three statistically significant findings showed: (a) students taught by teachers rated as having a higher developmentally appropriate instructional practices (DAIP) scores were more likely to be on-task and less likely to be off-task; (b) students taught by teachers with a higher DAIP score were more likely to be working kinesthetically, answering teacher-posed questions, and freely exploring; and (c) students taught by teachers with a lower DAIP score were more likely to be distracted and/or not engaging in activity. The findings are important, since young children continue to be taught in a direct instructional manner that focuses on students' test performance--despite research showing the unfavorable effects that highly teacher-centered, scripted classrooms have on young students' engagement and learning outcomes.

AB  - Overview: A recent evaluation of children who had participated in the Parent-Child Home Program (PCHP) as toddlers found that at kindergarten age, these children were performing at levels expected for their age, despite the fact that they had multiple factors putting them at risk for school failure. The Study: In the winter and spring of 2002, 135 kindergartners in five Long Island school districts received a battery of tests focusing on 2 interrelated areas of school readiness: "social-emotional skills" such as the ability to follow teachers' directions and "early literacy" skills such as knowledge about books and about the alphabet. In addition, keeping in mind the recommendation of the National Education Goals Panel with regard to school readiness, parents were interviewed about their participation in and "support of children's learning" at home and at school. Children who had participated in PCHP at ages 2 and 3 were compared, at kindergarten age, with classmates who had not been in the program. Preliminary analyses revealed that PCHP graduates were different from their classmates on a number of variables, however. Specifically, children who participated in PCHP were more likely to have parents who were less educated, more likely to be Latino, and more likely to have parents who worked less hours per week for pay. While there were areas in which the two groups were similar--such as family size, likelihood of parents being married, and parents' age--the areas in which the groups were different each represent risk factors for school failure. Low parental education, immigrant status, and poverty are additive risk factors with regard to children's school readiness, such that children who have all three characteristics are at greater risk than children who have two or one. Further, while these are risks that we have defined, they are likely to be concomitant risks that we haven't defined, such as substandard housing and less health care. The Result: The fact that PCHP children, as a group, exhibit more risk factors than their classmates means that PCHP is effectively targeting those in the community most in need of their services. It also means that PCHP children should be performing worse than children who do not enter school with these risk factors. They are, essentially, entering school with strikes against them. The data indicated, however, that PCHP children are performing at the level expected for their age on virtually all measures. These are summarized in greater detail below. With regard to "social-emotional skills", the study found no differences between the intervention and comparison group on several measures. Teachers and parents were given questionnaires about children's behavior, and the evaluators who tested the children rated their behavior. In addition, children were tested on a variable called "inhibitory control" which measures the capacity to suppress a desired behavior. This sort of skill is required in the classroom all the time as the child is expected to suppress the desire to get out of his or her seat or speak out of turn, for example. On all of these measures, covering multiple methods and multiple sources, no differences were found between the two groups. The lack of difference between the intervention and comparison groups on measures of social-emotional competence is a key finding for two reasons: 1) the PCHP group has a much greater likelihood of being unprepared, behaviorally, for school, but instead is as well-behaved as more privileged children. This suggests that a gap has been closed in terms of behavioral readiness for school and that PCHP children are indistinguishable from their peers in terms of classroom behavior, not only in the eyes of parents and researchers, but in the eyes of their teachers, who spend a great deal of time with them (and are less biased than parents). 2) Research indicates that social-emotional competence in the early school years is predictive of both academic and interpersonal success throughout a child's school career. With regard to "early literacy skills", PCHP children are again indistinguishable from comparison group children on a number of measures. Teachers' reports of early literacy indicated no difference between the groups. There were also no differences between the groups on additional tests involving knowledge about books and basic story comprehension. No differences were present in early literacy skills such as rhyming and basic spelling, either. Differences were apparent on two standardized tests of verbal and literacy skills, however. The intervention group was, as noted, more likely to be Latino, and Latino children as a group tend to perform worse on standardized tests than Caucasian children. Since these were tests that often involved vocabulary, having parents who speak English as a second language is likely to have presented a hurdle that children of predominantly English-speaking parents did not face. Most importantly, despite their relatively lower scores, PCHP graduates still performed in the range expected for their age on these tests. They did not, as a group, exhibit delays in their skills, despite the challenges they confront. The early literacy results are important because they tell us that teachers do not see differences in the literacy skills of children who come to school with multiple risk factors and those who are more privileged. This is crucial, because teachers make decisions about children's placement in supplemental programs, as well as more "micro" decisions in the way they respond to children, and have an enormous influence on children's school careers. "Parents' support for children's learning" was examined through questionnaires given to parents over the telephone. Analyses of these data revealed that PCHP parents were as likely as comparison parents to meet with their children's teachers and other school personnel. This is particularly remarkable given that PCHP parents are less likely to speak English as a first language and are less educated--both of which represent factors that contribute to less involvement in children's schooling. PCHP parents were, however, less likely to participate in school activities such as volunteering in the classroom and attending field trips. This is to be expected for parents with limited English abilities. PCHP parents also reported less home-based activities for children's learning, such as working with them on letters and numbers, but this last finding was based on a measure on which no validity data has been obtained, meaning that any inferences we draw should be made with caution. The parent involvement findings tell us that while PCHP parents are as willing as comparison parents--who are more likely to be English proficient--to attend school meetings regarding their children, they are less likely to volunteer in the classrooms. This is consistent with data on parents with lower levels of education and English language proficiency. It is worth noting that the dissimilarity between the two groups in this study not only made the study more conservative--that is, presented a greater challenge to demonstrating success of PCHP--but also made it more valid from the point of view of those who work with the children, specifically teachers. That is, teachers do not generally make evaluations of their students by considering variables such as parents' educational status, but do so based on children's behavior. A typical teacher does not say, "Junior is performing similarly to other free lunch children in my class," or "Junior is performing similarly to other children whose mothers did not graduate from high school," but simply, "Junior is performing similarly to others in my class." On most of the tests and questionnaires given, PCHP children were performing similarly to others in their classrooms--not other poor children, not other immigrant children, but other, more advantaged children in their communities--the children with whom they will be compared.

AB  - This study evaluated the extent to which first-grade class size predicted child outcomes and observed classroom processes for 651 children (in separate classrooms). Analyses examined observed child-adult ratios and teacher-reported class sizes. Smaller classrooms showed higher quality instructional and emotional support, although children were somewhat less likely to be engaged. Teachers in smaller classes rated typical children in those classes as more socially skilled and as showing less externalizing behavior and reported more closeness toward them. Children in smaller classes performed better on literacy skills. Larger classrooms showed more group activities directed by the teacher, teachers and children interacted more often, and children were more often engaged. Lower class sizes were not of more benefit (or harm) as a function of the child's family income. First-grade class size in the range typical of present-day classrooms in the United States predicts classroom social and instructional processes as well as relative changes in social and literacy outcomes from kindergarten to first grade.

AB  - Aim. The aim of this presentation is to describe: - the process that we adopted in order to develop an instrument to observe play and social interaction recorded in natural preschool settings; - the contents of the instrument.The instrument will be used in a peer-mediated intervention based on Play Time/Social Time (Odom et al. 1997), where we need a reliable and valid measure of children’s play behaviour and social skill, which would make the external observers able to detect possible changes after the intervention and as a complement to other instruments, as teachers’ impressions ratings (TIS) and structured classroom observations (ICP).Background. The program PTST was translated to Swedish. The contents of the interventions were discussed with students and practitioners and tested in small scale studies, showing a good social validity (Siljehag &amp; Allodi, 2017). A pilot study was conducted in four preschools. The analysis of data from the trial is currently ongoing.Procedure. We obtained an observation instrument that has been used in previous research on friendship for children with autism, the Friendship Observation Scale (FOS) (Bauminger, Aviezer &amp; Rogers, 2004). Its contents matched fairly well our interventions’ contents. We made a translation and adaptation. The contents of Social Participation Observation in Play (SPOP) were discussed with an expert educator from our team who tested it in field observations in preschool. After her feedback we reduced the number of behaviours to observe, retaining behaviours that were more likely to happen with young children, and that were targeted by the program. Simple Video Coder (Barto, Bird, Hamilton et al., 2017) or other available software will be used to code the videorecorded interactions. It will be used in the study: Social Interaction in play time and language activities (2018-00018) funded by Skolforskningsinstitutet /Swedish Institute for Educational Research.

AB  - The Swedish preschool curriculum stipulates that all children independent of support needs should attend mainstream preschool groups, with equal opportunities for learning and engagement. Preschool teachers are responsible for paying attention to children in need of special support to achieve this. How support is provided for children in need of special support due to behavior difficulties in Swedish preschools varies, however. Some children, often formally identified as in need of special support, are supported by preschool staff supervised by external services. Other children receive support initiated and implemented by preschool staff, without supervision from external services. A further number of children receive no support for behavior difficulties, on top of what is provided to all children. This study investigated associations between support format (i.e. supervised support, staff-initiated support or no additional support), support content (i.e. implementation of support), behavior difficulties, socio-demographics and engagement. A mixed methods approach was used with a sample of 232 preschool children 15 to 71 months with assessed behavior difficulties. Preschool staff reported on the children's engagement, behavior difficulties, socio-demographics and support provision. Logistic regression models were used to analyze the probability of children receiving either support format. Content analysis was used to categorize the support content, reported by preschool staff through open-ended questions. Point-biserial correlations were used to test associations between support content, behavior, socio-demographics and engagement. All children receiving supervised support for behavior difficulties were formally identified by external services as in need of special support. Supervised support was also more common if children disturbed the free play in the preschool group, with the most frequent support being collaboration with external teams. Staff-initiated support was most commonly given to children with high engagement, and for children who are not early second language learners. These children were most frequently supported by staff paying attention to negative behavior. Children who were not perceived as a burden to the group were less likely to receive any form of additional support. Ways of managing the preschool group seem to guide support strategies for children with behavior difficulties, rather than child-focused strategies emphasizing engagement in everyday activities.

AB  - The study aims to develop knowledge concerning how children and parents reflect on and make meaning of pedagogical documentation gathered in Reggio-inspired preschool projects. From a pedagogical documentation perspective, children are understood to be knowledge creators, it is therefore important to make children's voices visible (Dahlberg, Moss &amp; Pence, 2001) However,questions have been raised about (a) if and how children are given opportunities to participate in the production of pedagogical documentation (Lenz Taguchi, 2012, Lindgren, 2012), and (b) the ethics of representing children in the documentation (Lindgren2016). Our theoretical framework is based on Biesta's (2006) concept of the rational community and the community-without-community. The study data was gathered through focus groups with eight children and their parents. The children and parents were askedto review samples of pedagogical documentation from the child's time in preschool. The documentation was also used as stimulus material during the interview. Finally, the parents were also asked to discuss with their children their memories regarding how it felt to be documented. Interview transcripts were subjected to narrative analyses. Informed consent was obtained from all study participants. Three themes emerged concerning the experience of working with and being a part of the practice of pedagogical documentation: a sense of context, the sense of participation and the sense of a way to explore life. Our analysis highlights that the children had opportunities to participate in the practice of documentation in a project and therefore their voices were supported in "breaking into the world"

AB  - The SOFIA-study is a prospective longitudinal study of approximately 2,000 children in a mid-sized Swedish community. SOFIA is the acronym of Social and Physical Development, Interventions and Adaptation in Swedish, and the main focus of the study is on understanding developmen-tal trajectories of norm breaking, criminal behavior, and the risk and pro-tective factors for the various trajectories. The aim is to answer question such as Which risk factors are the most important in the development of norm breaking behavior? What protects children from a negative devel-opment? Which interventions are given to children with difficulties? The study was initiated in 2010 by professors H. Andershed and A-K. Ander-shed, and has since then assessed the participants in four data collection waves, in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2015. At base-line, the children were 3-5 years old, attending public preschools in the community. Questionnaires have been completed by caregivers, preschool and elementary school teachers, as well as principals and headmasters. The purpose has been to collect information both on the children – their behaviors and charac-teristics, the families – parent-child relationships, caregiver attributes, as well as preschool/school relationships, environment, and conditions. The papers presented in this panel are examples of papers using data from the SOFIA-study.

AB  - This is a study of 49 children from three kindergartens. "Integrative behavior is defined as a phenomenon of growth in which the individual responds voluntarily and without coercion to differences in other persons… . Dominative behavior is defined as a technique of responding to others by which a person resists differences, resists change, resists growth." Cross-pairings of sexes as well as own-sex pairings were studied. Younger kindergarten children were also compared with older ones. The domination-integration ratio of teachers' contacts with individual children showed that domination contacts exceeded integration contacts. In the main the findings were essentially the same as those reported in a previous study on preschool children. 11 references are given. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This thesis investigates twenty bilingual and twenty monolingual 6-year-old preschool children's discourse strategies and narrative styles. It is theoretically based on an interdiciplinary framework combining theories of narration with discourse theories. Methodologically, the study draws on micro-analyses of children's spontaneous sharing time narrations, on the one hand, and elicited retellings of a fable, on the other. A new method was developed for analysing Labovian story points from a collaborative perspective: differentiating between child contributions, teacher contributions, and joint contributions. Moreover, all children were interviewed about their literary repertoires and about narrative practices at home. It was found that children's vocabulary was closely linked to their literary repertoires and cultural habits. By calculating the repair:error ratio, the present study shows that there is a linear development in children's repair work, instead of an inverted U-curve as previously suggested. Language repairs were rare in both groups. The children primarily focused on meaning, not on linguistic form. However, there were more language errors in the bilingual group. Moreover, the bilingual group had a more restricted vocabulary. Yet, the findings reveal that narrative coherence was comparable in the monolingual and bilingual groups. In an analysis of participation during sharing time sessions, it was found that peer comments and child initiatives were more frequent in the monolingual group, and in specific preschool settings. Collaboration was investigated both in terms of teacher support, co-narration, and in terms of indirect ways of collaborating, like the employment of communication strategies and self-repairs. It was found that bilingual children received more collaborative support and employed more communication strategies than their monolingual peers.

AB  - In 1995, a disease control and intervention project was initiated in Malmöhus county in southern Sweden to limit the spread of penicillin-resistant pneumococci. Since most of the carriers of pneumococci are preschool children, and since most of the spread is believed to take place in day-care, a mathematical model, in the form of a stochastic process, for the spread in a day-care group was constructed. Effects of seasonal variation and size of the day-care group were particularly considered. The model was then used for comparing results from computer simulations without and with intervention. Results indicate that intervention is highly effective in day-care groups with more than ten children during the second half of the year.

AB  - Cities exhibit a rich and complex heterogeneity in people and activities. This poses a sizable challenge for planners when planning new neighbourhoods or the reconstruction of old ones as well as when considering the allocation of supply of and demand for amenities, e.g. kindergartens or health facilities. However, individual preferences may also exhibit common denominators that may provide structure to this heterogeneity. One such denominator is age. In this paper we introduce the concept of neighbourhood age, defined as the mean age of people living in exogenously defined squares of 1km2 in a city. We use highly disaggregated geocoded data to map how the spatial distribution of neighbourhood age changes over a 20-year period from 1991 to 2011 in the city of Stockholm, Sweden. We then test the correlation between neighbourhood age and two categories of urban amenities: supply of local consumption amenities and distance to the city's central business district (CBD). The paper presents three main findings: First, neighbourhood age changes and polarizes significantly over the observed period, suggesting that different age groups are concentrating in different parts of the city. Second, there is a rejuvenation in the central parts of the city but also in more distant clusters of amenities. Third, over a long-term perspective, the results suggest that local clusters of consumption amenities outside the inner city may become increasingly attractive to younger people. Our conclusion is that neighbourhood age and age-related patterns over time provides a tool for planners to better understand the spatial distribution of age-related demand.

AB  - This study examines preservice preschool teachers’ university science education experience.The empirical data are from a research and intervention project conducted on teacher education programs at two Swedish universities. We analyzed one of the assignments completed by 111 students within a science course as well as their conversations about the assignment at a number of seminars. We combined culture contrast and thematic analysis to examine the data. The results showed a tension between the preschool culture and the university science culture. We described this tension between the boundary lines of the two cultures as a chafing borderland. These cultures do not merge, and the defined boundaries cause chafing with each other. We discuss ways of diminishing this chafing of borderlands, potential border crossings such as caring and children as boundary objects and equalizing power imbalances.

AB  - Research aims: This study aims to contribute knowledge about how preschool teachers engage with tensions stemming from cultural value differences among teachers, caregivers, and children.Relationship to previous research works: Motivating this work is current socio-cultural circumstances in Sweden in which preschool teachers are negotiating divergent curricular demands that simultaneously promote cultural diversity and a common tradition. Consequently, teachers are experiencing an increased burden to address societal expectations concerning cultural diversity without appropriate communicative and conceptual tools (Björk Willén et. al, 2013; Lunneblad, 2006).Theoretical and conceptual framework: We draw on Biesta’s (2006) – via Lingis (1994) - conception of the rational community (RC) and the community-without-community (CwC) as an interpretive framework.Paradigm, methodology and methods: Project data was gathered through a series of focus group interviews with teachers in two preschools in Sweden, using stimulus materials designed to elicit discussion about value conflicts and cultural diversity.Ethical Considerations: Informed consent was obtained from all study participants.Main finding or discussion: Teacher engagement with questions of culture and values were organized around discussions of actual and imagined disagreements between teachers and caregivers about activities with preschool children. Analysis through the lens of RC and CwC revealed that teachers on the one hand, reinforced societal values and avoided conflict through invocation of the language of the rational community; on the other hand, from a CWC perspective, they developed insights about the value of conflict as means of gaining insight into the perspectives and cultures of the caregivers, as well as about their professional development.Implications, practice or policy: Project findings have implications for the development of pedagogical and policy tools related intercultural processes in preschool education practice and research.

AB  - Objective: This study tested whether social cognitions from the reasoned action approach (RAA) can be reliably measured in a sample of primary school children (aged 4–6 years) and whether these RAA measures are predictive of physical activity.Design: Longitudinal observational study with repeated measures over six months. Measures: RAA variables were measured using a novel choice paradigm between physically active and sedentary pastimes. Relative reinforcing value, covariates (sex, age, deprivation and BMI) and physical activity by accelerometry (primary outcome) were also measured. Results: RAA cognitions could be measured with acceptable retest reliability and discriminant validity and social norms regarding parents and teachers (but not friends) were correlated with physical activity and change in physical activity when relative reinforcing value and other covariates were controlled for. Conclusions: RAA cognitions can be reliably measured in primary school children aged 4–6 and RRA measures appear useful in understanding children’s activity choices and may potentially inform future interventions.

AB  - A soft neurological signs (SNS) test battery (the Quick Neurological Screening Test; Mutti, Sterling, & Spalding, 1978) was individually administered to 233 normal children, ages 5 to 12 years. The participants' characteristics were balanced according to (a) age (5–6 years, 7–8 years, 9–10 years, and 11–12 years); (b) socioeconomic status (SES; high and low); and (c) gender (boys and girls), yielding a 4 x 2 x 2 analysis of variance design with an average of 15 participants in each cell. In addition, an Academic Achievement Questionnaire was presented to the children's teachers. Normative data are presented. It was observed that (a) SNS decreased in frequency with age; (b) there were important individual differences in their frequency; (c) a significantly higher frequency of SNS was present in low-SES than in high-SES children, although these differences tended to decrease with age and schooling; (d) correlations between SNS and academic performance were in general low, but at least for some of these correlations, statistically significant; and (e) some SNS may be more informative about nervous system maturation level than others.

AB  - This study explores if and how teachers combine practices of science and of preschool (children 1–5 years old) into preschool science practice. Views of knowing may differ between science practices, traditionally associated with masculinity and rationality, and preschool practices, traditionally associated with femininity and caring. Recognising this, wehave chosen to focus on how teachers’ talk constructs and relates to possible ways of gaining knowledge and reaching explanations of phenomena in preschool science. The analysis buildson two concept pairs often associated with gender as well as knowing: objective-subjective and logical-intuitive. The analysed material consists of 11 group interviews where preschool teachers talk about activities concerning science content. Our results show that several ways of knowing are possible in work with science content in preschool. These include ways of knowing more associated with subjectivity, such as ‘individual liking’ and ‘whole-body perception’, as well as more associated with objectivity, such as ‘noticing differences and similarities’. Furthermore, the results show that the teachers’ talk moves readily between possibilities associated with femininity (subjective and intuitive) and masculinity (objective and logical). This indicates that the teachers in this study have found ways to handle science in preschool that goes against presumed tensions between science and preschool practices. The results contribute to more nuanced ways of describing and thinking about science in preschool and pave the way for further development of science education in early childhood education.

AB  - This thesis describes an investigation into experiences connected to the implementation of educational behavior-analytic interventions (ABA) for children with autism in kindergartens. The research questions and the methodological choices in this investigation evolved based on new experiences over the course of the research project. Three sub-studies were conducted: a single case study on the implementation of ABA teaching programs specifically targeting joint attention skills for children with autism in kindergartens (Study 1); a questionnaire survey on the experiences of ABA supervisors in implementing ABA in kindergartens (Study 2); and an interview study on the experiences of ABA teachers in implementing ABA in kindergartens (Study 3). During Study 1, it appeared that the teaching intensity of the targeted ABA teaching programs varied largely from what was initially planned for all four of the participating children. Under those conditions, the learning outcomes of the children also varied. With regard to Study 2, the survey data obtained from 29 ABA supervisors indicated that many children with autism who receive ABA in Norwegian kindergartens do not receive the number of teaching hours being planned for them. There also seems to be quite a large number of kindergartens that lack teaching teams and who receive supervision less than what is generally recommended to obtain the optimal outcome from ABA. With regard to Study 3, the interview data obtained from 10 ABA teachers illustrated how implementation factors such as compatibility, complexity, client responsiveness, and supervision can be manifested when ABA is implemented in the kindergarten. A main finding was that in some cases there seem to be conflicting opinions within the kindergarten about whether ABA is right for the child, something that was interpreted to reflect a conflict between the categorical and the relational perspectives of special education.

AB  - This case study is focused on a small group of novice teachers of French as a second language (FSL) in the Canadian K–12 context. More specifically, it presents the perceptions and ideas that inform new teachers’ views toward the suitability of French as a second language and toward exemption and/or exclusion for two populations: students who are English language learners (ELLs) and students with learning difficulties and other special needs. The data from the current study are drawn from semi-structured interviews implemented over the first four years of a larger five-year study. The findings reveal that there was general openness to the idea of including students who are ELLs and who have learning difficulties in FSL programs. However, in some instances the participants viewed exemption as a reasonable path for the student population when, in isolated ways, the program was considered as unsuitable for their needs.

AB  - In this thesis 14 gender pedagogues’ stories about power and control are described and analysed. Here the term gender pedagogue refers to educators who have participated in further training in gender and gender equality studies. The training programme was the result of an initiative taken by the former Social Democratic government. The intention of the government was that those who participated in the training programme would then work as resource persons in the work for gender equality in preschools and schools (Frånberg, 2010; Regeringen, 2001a, 2001b; Wahlgren, 2009). The purpose of this study is to describe and analyse the gender pedagogues’ access to power and control in work for change. The theoretical framework chosen for the study consists of Basil Bernsteins concepts classification and framing (Bernstein, 1977, 2000) and Hildur Ve’s (1999a, 1999b) use of the concepts technical limited rationality and care work rationality. The empirical evidence is based on observations in a seminar series on gender issues and semi-structured interviews. The results of the interviews are presented as stories which have been created in the interplay between the gender pedagogues and the interviewer. One conclusion that can be drawn from the stories is that power relations and gender patterns on many different levels influenced the possibilities of the gender pedagogues for power and control. Power and control in the relation between technical limited rationality and care work rationality is expressed in different ways. It is seen in the possibilities and descriptions of resistance and difficulties. Resistance and difficulties depended, according to the gender pedagogues, on the differences between their own view of knowledge and that of others. If gender and gender equality was not considered to be an important area of knowledge, possibilities for power and control decreased.

AB  - Eighty (80) private nursery schools were randomly selected in Ogun State, Nigeria, out of 196 available in the state government's education handbook. Two questionnaires, namely Student Teachers Questionnaire on Nursery School Facilities (STQNSF), and Nursery School Resources Questionnaire for Head teachers (NSRQH) were used to gather data concerning human resources and facilities available in the nursery schools. Based on the federal government's Guidelines on Minimum Standards in Schools nationwide, the adequacy or otherwise of the human resources and facilities were determined using simple percentages. The three research questions designed for the study are: How suitably located are private pre-primary schools in Ogun State Nigeria? How adequate are the teaching staff and head teachers of private pre-primary schools in Ogun State Nigeria? How adequate are the facilities provided in pre-primary schools in Ogun State Nigeria? It was found that most of the private nursery schools were located in conducive environment, but most were accommodated in substandard buildings. Pupil-teacher ratio in the schools was adequate, head teachers' qualifications were adequate but teaching staff qualifications were generally inadequate. Most of the schools had inadequate facilities. Over-all, only 44.37% of the schools' facilities were included in the study. It is recommended that an independent Pre-primary School Commission, separate from the State Ministry of Education, be put in place by each state in Nigeria, to solely see to the actualization of national standards in all private pre-primary schools. This is to ensure adequate provision of teaching staff and facilities and educational standards therein.

AB  - Technology is a field with strong connections to the female/male dichotomy and children's gender stereotyping starts as early as the age of two (Berner, 2004; Nisbet, Pendergast &amp; Reynolds, 1998; Turja, Endepohls-Ulpe &amp; Chatoney, 2009). According to the Swedish Curriculum for the Preschool, the preschool should strive to ensure that children ”develop their ability to identify technology in everyday life, and explore how simple technology works” (Lpfö98/2010, p. 10). The preschool also has a goal to actively counteract traditional gender roles and patterns (Lpfö98/2010, p. 4). An important part of children's activities in preschool relates to picture books. A government investigation states that the preschool, through its activities (among them ”reading aloud”) is an arena where societal norms can either be preserved or challenged (SOU 2006:75). Books about cars, airplanes, boats etc. often serve as an introduction to human applications of technology. Based on these, children start to identify and categorize the technologies they encounter in everyday life. The aim of this study is consequently to investigate the technological content from a gender perspective in a selection of picture books, more specifically; how do the books content preserve or challenge preschool children's view of technology and gender? Preschools use books from libraries in their daily activities, therefore the empirical material in this study is derived from the library section ”facts for youngsters”. A thematic analysis was employed to discover the dominant themes within the books. The result of the study shows that there is a focus on how separate artefacts function but no detailed explanation on how these artefacts are connected or what kind of implications they have in a societal context. There also seems to be an emphasis on traditionally masculine coded technology. This study will serve as a basis for a comparative study between two preschools, one where gender and technology is a prioritised goal and one where it is not.

AB  - A large number of studies carried out on pupils aged 8-14 have shown that teachable agent (TA) based games are beneficial for learning. The present pioneering study aimed to initiate research looking at whether TA based games can be used as far down as preschool age. Around the age of four, theory of mind (ToM) is under development and it is not unlikely that a fully developed ToM is necessary to benefit from a TA’s socially engaging characteristics. 10 preschool children participated in an experiment of playing a mathematics game. The participants playing a TA-version of the game engaged socially with the TA and were not disturbed by his presence. Thus, this study unveils exciting possibilities for further research of the hypothesised educational benefits in store for preschoolers with regard to play-and-learn games employing TAs.

AB  - Entrepreneurship has during the last decades gained an immense interest in academia, politics and practice. It is argued from politics that more entrepreneurs are necessary for the economic development. In addition, nowadays entrepreneurship is also perceived as a solution to social and societal challenges. This drives a need for entrepreneurial people everywhere in society who can cope with the inconstant and uncertain world of today. As a consequence, there are around the world numerous educational initiatives trying to inspire and fuel an entrepreneurial mind-set. Here, educations of all kind become relevant contexts since they provide an opportunity to affect children, youth’s and adult’s interest and attitudes towards entrepreneurship, and as such give a possibility to reach a vast number of people.Sweden is no exception, and in 2009 the Swedish Government launched a ‘Strategy for entrepreneurship in the field of education’ in which entrepreneurship is said to run like a common thread throughout education. The main focus is that self-employment is to become as natural as being an employee. As such the Government took an active stand for implementing entrepreneurship in the school setting on a broad front, from preschool to adult education.This development can be seen as part of New Public Management; a development where concepts from the private sector are lent and transferred to the public sector. Thus, when introducing entrepreneurship in the Swedish educational system, this at the same time means introducing a traditional business concept in a public setting. Therefore, the overall aim of this thesis is to increase knowledge of and insights on how a business concept – entrepreneurship – is operationalised and constructed in a public setting.When placing entrepreneurship in new societal contexts other questions arise and complexity intensifies. In this qualitative research, the empirical context in focus are schools. It investigates how entrepreneurship is constructed among teachers in their work. But also how this business concept is included in a non-business setting by studying how the entrepreneurship strategy is operationalised in educational practice.As such the thesis and its findings contribute to the scientific discussions on societal entrepreneurship and entrepreneurship education, as well as on strategy and strategising in a public context. The research also aspire to serve inspiration, insights and food for thoughts on discussions and reflections on entrepreneurship within the school practice. This compilation thesis include five papers. To be able to fulfil the aim this research use a broad theoretical base and multiple qualitative research methods. The combination of methods include semi-structured interviews, in-depth interview using the stimulated recall method, focus group interviews, participative meetings, observations, document studies, digital questionnaires, written inquiries, analysing texts and critical incidents questionnaires.

AB  - Background: The newly formed discipline of engineering education is addressing the need to (a) enhance STEM education for precollege students and (b) identify optimum ways to introduce engineering content starting, perhaps, from the early ages. Introducing engineering at the Prekindergarten through 12th grade (PreK-12) education level requires significant changes in teacher preparation and support. It highlights the need for developing developmentally appropriate content knowledge and pedagogical methods, thus revealing the challenges of preparing teachers to incorporate this type of knowledge base into their practice. Although professional development offered by universities, school districts, and other educational entities provides the primary source of formal learning tools for teachers, an increasing number of teachers also utilize other informal web-based resources regularly. This paper examines available PreK-12 engineering web resources offered by entities formally related to education in seven different languages, namely Arabic, Chinese (Mandarin), English, French, Greek, Korean, and Spanish. Results: Findings showed how different educational systems designated different attention to the entry level ages when introducing engineering content. Differences in the terminology used to identify STEM resources for introducing these topics also became apparent. Similarities suggest that a large number of resources available on the web were originating in all researched languages. However, the developmental appropriateness and content validity of many of these resources remained questionable in many cases. In general, there was a plethora of isolated activities and lesson plans but significantly fewer complete engineering curricula available to teachers on the web. Conclusions: This study presents a comparative analysis of the international landscape of PreK-12 engineering education and provides guidelines and samples of state-of-the art resources in each language for teachers interested in introducing their students to engineering as a reliable starting point towards PreK-12 engineering information gathering.

AB  - This study focuses on an issue of recent policy significance--the need to aid teachers in successfully identifying why children struggle to acquire literacy. This study (a) asked K-1 teachers to nominate students that they believed to be at risk for literacy difficulties and to provide reasons for their concern, (b) examined how these reasons relate to teachers' broader conceptions of literacy, and (c) investigated whether teachers' initial reasons and checklist-guided ratings align with concurrently administered standardized assessments. Results revealed that teachers have a wide array of initial concerns for students. There was some discordance between teachers' specific reasons for concern and their broader conceptions of early literacy. Comparison of student performance on standardized measures with teacher rationale also revealed discordance. Specific guidelines to teachers on use of a literacy checklist increased concordance between subsequent teacher ratings and standardized measures in some reading-related skills but not others. Implications for the use of multiple sources of evidence for student performance, as well as professional development, are discussed.

AB  - Originating from progressive educators who saw the need for student-centered educational designs rather than the traditional, single-age classroom design based on Henry Ford’s assembly line, the multiage classroom design is returning as a viable alternative to the single-age classroom. The authors explored the perceptions of parents and teachers impacted during the transition of two elementary schools away from single-age classrooms to a multiage classroom design. This study specifically focused on kindergarten through fifth grade and examined the overall effect of the multiage design on these two groups and on the elements that were important to the administration. Results indicate that parents support the transition to a multiage design. Although they demonstrated support, teachers were significantly more neutral than the parents in several areas, such as family–school relationships, class size stability, teacher assignment stability, and overall ability of students to do well in the multiage classroom. The findings of this research will assist districts transitioning to a multiage design in identifying what elements of the design are likely to be supported by parents and teachers.

AB  - This article characterizes the development of a deep and connected body of mathematical knowledge categorized by Ball and Bass' (2003b) model of Mathematical Knowledge for Teaching (MKT), as Specialized Content Knowledge for Teaching (SCK) in algebraic reasoning and number sense. The research employed multiple cases across three years from two content courses designed for elementary and middle-level mathematics specialists. Qualitative data were collected and a grounded theory approach to data analysis was employed. The resulting framework characterizes developmental levels of deep and connected mathematical content knowledge for teaching algebraic reasoning and number theory content. The framework consists of four intertwined components related to a teacher's ability to (1) solve problems and justify his/her reasoning, (2) use multiple representations, (3) recognize, use, and generalize conceptually similar tasks, and (4) pose problems. Implications for mathematics teacher education programs are discussed as well as directions for further research. (Contains 7 figures.)

AB  - This article examines the impact of the World Bank’s Safe Motherhood Project (SMP) on health outcomes for Indonesia’s poor. Provincial data from 1990 to 2005 was analyzed combining a difference-in-differences approach in multivariate regression analysis with matching of intervention (SMP) and control group provinces and adjusting for possible confounders. Our results indicated that, after taking into account the impact of two other concurrent development projects, SMP was statistically significantly associated with a net beneficial change in under-five mortality, but not with infant mortality, total fertility rate, teenage pregnancy, unmet contraceptive need or percentage of deliveries overseen by trained health personnel. Unemployment and the pupil-teacher ratio were statistically significantly associated with infant mortality and percentage deliveries overseen by trained personnel, while pupil-teacher ratio and female education level were statistically significantly associated with under-five mortality. Clinically relevant changes (52-68% increase in the percentage of deliveries overseen by trained personnel, 25-33% decrease in infant mortality rate, and 8-14% decrease in under-five mortality rate) were found in both the intervention (SMP) and control groups.

AB  - The purpose of this phenomenological study was to obtain an in-depth understanding of kindergarten teachers' instructional time allocations and the factors that influenced their decisions. A maximum variation sample of six kindergarten teachers was chosen representing variations in gender, socioeconomic status of the school where they taught, and years of experience. All of the teachers were interviewed using an open-ended script and observed in their classrooms. Data were analyzed using the Stevick-Colaizzi-Keen method. Participants in this study listed reading, math, and core curriculum as curricular priorities. The findings suggest that factors that influenced curricular priorities included teachers' college educations, personal and teaching experiences, systematic constraints (e.g. mandated textbooks, class size, policies), and others (e.g. principals, parents). Differences between novice and veteran teachers also emerged. (Contains 1 table.)

AB  - Classroom management is a challenge for beginning teachers. To address this challenge, a model to provide support for beginning teachers was developed, consisting of a one-day workshop on classroom management, followed with online support extending over eight weeks. Specific classroom management strategies included (a) developing a foundation based on relationships; (b) preventing disruptions with procedures and routines; (c) responding to disruptions and rule violations; (d) providing inclusion for students with special needs; and (e) resolving extreme or continuing conflicts. Participants in the study were beginning teachers at both the elementary and secondary levels. After completing the classroom management workshop, teachers reviewed online video clips of strategies they had learned, applied the strategies in their respective classrooms, and engaged in online discussions of the results obtained. Researchers conducted a qualitative assessment of the discussion entries posted by the new teachers to determine the strategies employed, emerging themes, and the results obtained. Participants successfully employed classroom management strategies and reported generally positive results. Additional research is needed with a larger number of participating teachers.

AB  - Background: School-based interventions involving teacher and/or child training have been shown to benefit teacher practices and to prevent conduct problems and improve children's social and emotional competence in developed countries; however, we are aware of no reports from a developing country. We conducted a pilot study of the Incredible Years Teacher Training programme and a curriculum unit on social and emotional skills based on concepts and activities drawn from the Incredible Years Dina Dinosaur Classroom Curriculum to determine if this approach is appropriate for use with Jamaican pre-school teachers and children. Methods: Five pre-schools in Kingston, Jamaica were randomly assigned to an intervention (3 pre-schools with 15 classrooms) or control (2 pre-schools with 12 classrooms) condition. Intervention involved seven whole-day teacher workshops using the Incredible Years Teacher Training programme supplemented by 14 child lessons in each class. The project was evaluated through structured observations of four categories of teacher behaviour and four observer ratings: two rating scales of child behaviour and two rating scales of classroom atmosphere. Results: Significant intervention benefits were found to teachers' behaviour with increased positive behaviour [b = 7.9; 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.5, 12.3], reduced negative behaviour (b =−3.5; 95% CI: −6.6, −0.2) and increases in the extent to which teachers promoted children's social and emotional skills (b = 46.4; 95% CI: 11.0, 81.7). The number of teacher commands was not significantly reduced (b =−2.71; 95% CI: −6.01, 0.59). Significant intervention benefits were found to ratings of child behaviour with an increase in children's appropriate behaviour (b = 5.7, 95% CI: 1.0, 10.8) and in children's interest and enthusiasm (b = 7.2, 95% CI: 0.9, 13.5). Intervention also benefited classroom atmosphere with increases in opportunities provided for children to share and help each other (b = 1.3, 95% CI: 0.5, 2.1) and in teacher warmth (b = 1.3, 95% CI: 0.9, 1.8). Conclusion: This is a promising approach for improving the emotional climate of Jamaican pre-school classrooms and for improving child behaviour and participation.

AB  - Early childhood teachers have a variety of health and safety resources to draw upon, including information about and educational programs dealing with such issues as fire safety, obesity, and dental hygiene. However, teachers may face a number of challenges when attempting to incorporate health and safety resources into the curriculum. In some cases, the resources may not be age-appropriate or may not meet the needs and interests of children in a particular classroom. Consequently, teachers need guidelines to help them select and develop health and safety educational activities for their classroom. In this article, the authors discuss three guidelines: (1) defining health and safety concepts; (2) establishing a rationale for a health and safety curriculum; and (3) identifying theoretical perspectives to guide a health and safety curriculum, that they followed in developing and implementing a preschool health and safety curriculum and has been used by early childhood trainers and teachers across three states in the southeastern United States. They also present six developmentally appropriate practice (DAP) principles that further guide the development of health and safety curriculum. (Contains 3 tables.)

AB  - Studied the differences between the settings of day care centers vs nursery schools and the effects of these settings on children's behavior. Human Ss: 55 normal French preschool children (aged 2–3 yrs) (at 4 day care centers for at least 3 mo). 119 normal French preschool children (aged 2–3 yrs) (students at 4 nursery schools for at least 3 mo). The staffing, staff training, group size, adult–child ratio, and activity organization at each of the 8 settings were assessed. All Ss were observed during free play, and their social interactions were characterized as aggressive or friendly. The socioemotional behavior of 5 Ss in each setting was analyzed with questionnaires, and their attention span was assessed.

AB  - For many years teachers have been planning cross-curricular lessons to develop children's knowledge and understanding in two or more subjects at the same time, with the aim of showing children how to transfer skills from one subject to another and give greater purpose to their learning. However, following the revisions to the National Curriculum in England (DfE, 2013a), with its significantly raised expectations in English and mathematics, much of teachers' time and energy has been spent ensuring coverage and depth in the planning of these two discrete subjects. In order to fit more science lessons into a limited number of hours, teachers need to teach truly cross-curricular lessons. In this article, Ruth Barber explains how teachers at Wallace Fields Infant School and Nursery in Surrey took initial inspiration in their cross-curricular planning from a Hamilton Trust lesson plan, which suggested that year 1 children (ages 5-6) rewrite the popular children's song "Heads, Shoulders, Knees and Toes" to include other parts of the human body.

AB  - Steven Barnett and Clive Belfield examine the effects of preschool education on social mobility in the United States. They note that under current policy three- and four-year-old children from economically and educationally disadvantaged families have higher preschool attendance rates than other children. But current programs fail to enroll even half of poor three- and four year- olds. Hispanics and children of mothers who drop out of school also participate at relatively low rates. The programs also do little to improve learning and development. The most effective programs, they explain, are intensive interventions such as the model Abecedarian and Perry Preschool programs, which feature highly qualified teachers and small group sizes. State preschool programs with the highest standards rank next, followed by Head Start and the average state program, which produce effects ranging from one-tenth to one-quarter of those of the best programs. Typical child care and family support programs rank last. Barnett and Belfield point out that preschool programs raise academic skills on average, but do not appear to have notably different effects for different groups of children, and so do not strongly enhance social mobility. In such areas as crime, welfare, and teen parenting, however, preschool seems more able to break links between parental behaviors and child outcomes. Increased investment in preschool, conclude Barnett and Belfield, could raise social mobility. Program expansions targeted to disadvantaged children would help them move up the ladder, as would a more universal set of policies from which disadvantaged children gained disproportionately. Increasing the educational effectiveness of early childhood programs would provide for greater gains in social mobility than increasing participation rates alone. The authors observe that if future expansions of preschool programs end up serving all children, not just the poorest, society as a whole would gain. Benefits would exceed costs and there would be more economic growth, but relative gains for disadvantaged children would be smaller than absolute gains because there would be some (smaller) benefits to other children.

AB  - An experimental study was conducted comparing the effects of dual language, or two-way immersion (TWI) and monolingual English immersion (EI) preschool education programs on children's learning. Three-and four-year old children were randomly assigned by lottery to either a newly established TWI Spanish/English program or a monolingual English program in the same district. Children in the study were from both Spanish and English home language backgrounds. All classrooms in the study used the High/Scope curriculum, and all met high standards for teacher qualifications, ratio, and class size. The TWI program alternated between English and Spanish weekly by rotating children between two classrooms (and teachers) each week. Programs were compared on measures of children's growth in language, emergent literacy, and mathematics. Children in both types of classrooms experienced substantial gains in language, literacy, and mathematics. No significant differences between treatment groups were found on English language measures. Among the native Spanish speakers, the TWI program produced large gains in Spanish vocabulary compared to the EI program. Both TWI and EI approaches boosted the learning and development of children including ELL students, as judged by standard score gains. TWI also improved the Spanish language development of English language learners (ELL) and native English speaking children without losses in English language learning.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to describe the quality of toddler child care classrooms in the district of Porto, in the north of Portugal. One hundred and sixty classrooms for children between 1 and 3 years of age participated in this study. Results suggested the existence of poor average quality and absence of good-quality classrooms. Child-adult ratio was a statistically significant predictor of overall child care quality (with lower ratios associated with higher quality). The results of this study provide information on the applicability of ITERS-R to a new cultural and linguistic context, suggesting the need to enhance the quality of Portuguese programs serving toddlers.

AB  - This thesis is about the socialisation of schoolchildren and how normality is learned and managed in two Swedish school classes. The Swedish school is, according to the ""Curriculum for the compulsory school system, the pre-school class and the leisure-time centre"", the Lpo94, based on democratic values and respect for the individual. In accordance with these values socialisation of the pupil is, as the thesis argues, accomplished through “benevolent government” by the teachers. To enable this governmentality, the pupil needs to learn how to be him or her “self” according to norms about how the “self” is to be expressed. The pupil also needs to learn how to balance multiple relations in school and the different aspects that constitutes the social person. Benevolent government is here used as a description of a certain kind of teacher-hood dependent on a certain kind of pupil. The pupil-subject that is constructed is a subordinated, self inspecting, positive, empathic person who will approve of being governed by the teachers through the governing of them selves. The study is based on fieldwork with one pre-school class and one fifth grade class in the Swedish compulsory school during the period from August 1999 to June 2002.

AB  - This is about the socialization of school children and how normality is learned and managed in one pre-school class and one fifth grade class in the Swedish compulsory school. The Swedish school is, according to the National Curriculum based on democratic values and respect for the individual. In accordance with these values socialization of the pupil is, as the thesis argues, accomplished through 'benevolent government' by the teachers. To enable this, the pupil needs to learn how to be him or her 'self' according to norms about how the 'self' is to be expressed. The pupil also needs to learn how to balance multiple relations in school and the different aspects that constitutes the social person. Benevolent government is here used as a description of a certain kind of 'teacherhood' dependent on a certain kind of pupil. The pupil-subject that is constructed is a subordinated, self-inspecting, positive, empathic person who will approve of being governed by the teachers through the governing of themselves. The study is based on anthropological fieldwork during two years in these classes.

AB  - In recent years, unequal access to high-quality preschool has emerged as a growing public policy concern. Because of data limitations, it is notoriously difficult to measure disparities in access to early learning opportunities across communities and particularly challenging to quantify gaps in access to "high-quality" programs. Research Findings: Using unique data from Georgia's universal prekindergarten program, this study provides empirical evidence of the relationship between community characteristics and the availability of high-quality preschool opportunities. We show that in Georgia, a national leader with respect to preschool access as well as quality, there are still meaningful differences in quality across communities. Low-income and high-minority communities offer state preschool classrooms that are rated significantly lower on a widely used and validated measure of classroom process quality. Practice or Policy: This process quality gap is troubling given the positive relationship between our process quality measure and children's learning. Note that we do not see similar gaps in "structural" measures of quality, which are the aspects of quality more often regulated but are also weaker, inconsistent predictors of children's learning. Implications for policy are discussed.

AB  - This study examines whether parents' overall satisfaction with their child's early childhood education (ECE) program is correlated with a broad set of program characteristics, including (a) observational assessments of teacher-child interactions; (b) structural features of the program, such as teacher education and class size; (c) practical and convenience factors (e.g., hours, cost); and (d) a measure of average classroom learning gains. It then describes associations between parents' evaluation of specific program characteristics and externally collected measures of those features. Leveraging rich data from a sample of low-income parents whose 4-year-olds attend publicly funded ECE programs, we find little correspondence between parents' evaluations of program characteristics and any external measures of those same characteristics. We discuss policy implications, especially in light of recent federal and state informational initiatives, which aim to help families make informed ECE choices.

AB  - This paper investigates the role of preschool quality for children's school performance at the end of primary school. We construct five structural quality indicators based on unique Danish administrative register data. 30,444 children finishing primary school's 9th grade in 2008 and who attended a formal preschool institution in 1998 are used in the analyses. OLS analyses show that three out of five quality indicators, a higher staff-per-child ratio, a higher share of male staff, and a higher share of staff with formal preschool teacher training are associated with significant improvements in children's test results in Danish. Boys benefit more from preschool quality than girls. Ethnic minority children benefit from higher staff stability.

AB  - This study used an ethnographic approach to explore the complex roles teachers play, rationales that guide their roles, and how student teachers learn these roles within the context of an early childhood art classroom that emphasizes the teacher's role as a guide. Participants in this study were 6 teachers in an early childhood art classroom of 4 and 5-year-olds. The primary methods used in data collection for this study were participant observations and open-ended interviews. The fieldwork took place for two school semesters. The head teacher, student teachers, and graduate teaching assistants were interviewed individually to gain better understanding of the meanings ascribed to teachers' roles in art education. Findings indicated that teachers plan activities in the preschool/kindergarten classroom considering a balance between freedom and structure. Art activities for children included sketchbook drawing time, large-group time, and art projects. Teachers have important roles in facilitating children's artistic development. Teachers' beliefs about their roles in art education and the context of learning influence their roles. Teachers in this study agree that children spend more time at the art table and sustain their interest in the art activity when teachers stay with children and have conversations related to the their artwork. At the same time, the teachers believe that merely providing art materials in early childhood classrooms is not a sufficient condition for enhancing children's artistic growth. Teachers need to guide children's artistic development. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess motor and sensory functions in a population-based series of 88 mentally retarded children with epilepsy. A new standardized physiotherapy protocol was developed for the heterogeneous population of children with epilepsy; the Cailler-Azusa scale was also found to be useful. For children with cerebral palsy, the gross motor function measure was used. Sensorimotor impairments, resulting in disabilities and handicap, were found to be very common but often overlooked and neglected. Sensorimotor dysfunctions need to be identified in order to provide rational training, understanding and care to children with epilepsy and mental retardation.

AB  - The Preschool Behavior Questionnaire was developed as a screening instrument for use by preschool teachers, providing norms for 3–6 yr old children. During the 34-mo period since its publication in 1974, the scale has been used to a considerable extent in the screening of young children. Those who have used the scale evaluate it highly. However, the variations in the application of the scale indicate that additional normative data are needed, as well as additional research in the area of the relationship between behavior rating scales and behavior observation techniques.

AB  - Studies in rodents indicate that phthalates can function as adjuvants, increasing the potency of allergens. Meanwhile, epidemiological studies have produced inconsistent findings regarding relationships between phthalate exposures and allergic disease in humans. The present study examined phthalate exposure and allergic sensitization in a large group of 3-5 year old children: 300 random controls and 200 cases with asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis or atopic dermatitis as reported in questionnaires. The children were clinically examined to confirm their health status. Blood samples were analyzed for IgE sensitization to 20 allergens. Adjusted logistic regressions were used to look for associations between phthalate exposure indicators (mass fractions in dust from children's homes and daycares, metabolites in urine, and estimated daily indoor intakes from dust ingestion, inhalation and dermal absorption) and sensitization and allergic disease. No direct associations were found between phthalate exposures and asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis or atopic dermatitis. However, among children with these diseases, there were significant associations between non-dietary exposures to DnBP, BBzP and DEHP in the indoor environment (mass fractions in dust or daily indoor intakes from dust ingestion, inhalation and dermal absorption) and allergic sensitization. Some exposure pathways were more strongly associated with sensitization than others, although the results are not conclusive and require confirmation. A number of the associations depended on accounting for a child's exposure in more than one environment (i.e., daycare facility as well as home). Significant associations were not observed between phthalate metabolites in urine, which reflected exposure from diet as well as indoor pathways, and allergic sensitization. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Reported are conclusions from the continuation of an investigation into cross-cultural aspects of education of children of 3-8 years of age. Discussion focuses on educational practices in Australia, Austria, India, Russia, and Zimbabwe. Topics include teacher actions and verbalizations, and school organization and administration. Teacher actions are discussed in terms of behavior toward individuals, small groups, large groups or whole classes, and teacher demonstrations of lesson content. The material on teacher verbalization focuses on such behavior as contributing bodily presence, responding to requests of children, elaborating on information already given, asking children to respond, and intervening to help students give the desired response. Concluding discussion includes notes on organization and administration, specifically pupil-teacher ratio, teacher and in-service training, and financial support. (RH) Reported are conclusions from the continuation of an investigation into cross-cultural aspects of education of children of 3-8 years of age. Discussion focuses on educational practices in Australia, Austria, India, Russia, and Zimbabwe. Topics include teacher actions and verbalizations, and school organization and administration. Teacher actions are discussed in terms of behavior toward individuals, small groups, large groups or whole classes, and teacher demonstrations of lesson content.

AB  - Most future teachers are familiar with number patterns that represent an arithmetic sequence, and most are able to determine the general representation of the "n"th number in the pattern. However, when they are given a visual representation instead of the numbers in the pattern, it is not always easy for them to make the connection between the visual and symbolic representation of the pattern. By exploring a variety of number patterns in a visual context, students gain a deeper understanding of arithmetic sequences by learning how to relate the illustration to the general symbolic representation of these patterns. Providing opportunities for students that promote problem solving, reasoning, communication, connections, and designing and analyzing representations is a theme that is present throughout the "Curriculum Focal Points for Prekindergarten through Grade 8 Mathematics" (NCTM 2006). However, being able to bring together these ideas into one lesson can be challenging. In this article, the author describes one activity that combined these ideas. The activity was completed with preservice elementary school and middle school teachers in a methods course. The purpose of the activity was to help preservice teachers understand how the symbolic form of an arithmetic sequence can be formed from its geometric representation.

AB  - Childhood obesity affects approximately 20% of U.S. preschool children. Early prevention is needed to reduce young children’s risks for obesity, especially among Hispanic preschool children who have one of the highest rates of obesity. Vida Saludable was an early childhood obesity intervention designed to be culturally appropriate for low-income Hispanic mothers with preschool children to improve maternal physical activity and reduce children’s sugar-sweetened beverage consumption. It was conducted at a large southwestern United States urban health center. Presented here are the methods and rationale employed to develop and culturally adapt Vida Saludable, followed by scoring and ranking of the intervention’s cultural adaptations. An empowered community helped design the customized, culturally relevant program via a collaborative partnership between two academic research institutions, a community health center, and stakeholders. Improved health behaviors in the participants may be attributed in part to this community-engagement approach. The intervention’s cultural adaptations were scored and received a high comprehensive rank. Postprogram evaluation of the intervention indicated participant satisfaction. The information presented provides investigators with guidelines, a template, and a scoring tool for developing, implementing, and evaluating culturally adapted interventions for ethnically diverse populations.

AB  - This discussion of curriculum issues in national policy making is based on the findings of thematic reviews of early childhood education and care, carried out by expert teams in twenty OECD countries. Much consensus is found across the countries reviewed in terms of curricular principles and aspirations, and with regard to official content, Differences emerge, however, in the practice of curriculum, especially with respect to the emphasis placed on broad developmental goals or on focused cognitive skills. From this and other characteristic differences, two broad approaches to curriculum and pedagogy can be discerned: the approach adopted in the social pedagogy tradition and the traditional pre-primary school approach. The broad features of each system are described, but a caveat is raised about excessive contrasts being drawn as exceptions to the rule are found in each tradition. Major obstacles to curriculum quality and implementation met commonly across countries are structural failings (lack of financing, unfavourable child/staff ratios, poorly qualified and poorly remunerated staff...) and inadequate pedagogical theory and practice. Against this background, three emerging issues are discussed: accountability and the new learning standards; the expansion of literacy practices and the re-positioning of educators in the early childhood field. Some options for progress are proposed for consideration. (Contains 1 table and 13 footnotes.)

AB  - To describe the development of words and sentences in Swedish children 16-28 months old, 900 parental reports on 336 children were analyzed. Subjects were randomly selected from the national birth register, and there was a response rate of 88%. The assessments were made using the Swedish Early Communicative Development Inventory-words and sentences (SECDI-w&amp;s). Age-based norms for productive vocabulary, pragmatic skills, grammar skills, and maximum length of utterance (MaxLU) were determined. We describe the development of feedback morphemes, semantic categories, and single words and tasks. Correlation across measures was significant, and especially strong between vocabulary size and grammar skills. Optimized positive predictive values were high for 25 to 28 month predictions (71%-88%), and vocabulary scores were found to be of particular predictive importance. No significant gender differences were detected. The clinical relevance of the instrument is discussed.

AB  - Community noise is a widespread environmental problem in Sweden and is the form of disturbance that affects the highest number of both children and adults. Twelve-year-olds are disturbed by the same noise sources as adults, but, for children, loud music is the most annoying source, whereas road-traffic noise is most annoying source for adults. One child in every seven is annoyed by noise in or near the home and one in four is annoyed by noise in or near the school/kindergarten. One in every five report that after listening to loud music or other loud sounds. They experience ringing, squeaking, howling or buzzing in their ears, this being slightly more frequent among boys than girls. Just over one in ten report that their hearing is sometimes worse after listening to loud music. Children are exposed to hearing-impairing noise to a larger extent than in the past. Sound levels measured in kindergartens and schools exceed the limit for when ear protectors must be worn according to legislation governing health and safety at work. It is important that children’s noise exposures in kindergartens, schools and leisure environments are reduced as well as children's exposure to excessively loud music.

AB  - This paper illustrates a project about digital didactical designs in one-to-one (1:1) computing classrooms in Sweden. The study focuses on schools in four municipalities with 1:1 media tablet (iPads) programs. In Sweden, there have been two major changes that have led to new situations and new challenges for schools. A new school reform started in 2011, at the same time there was a boom using mobile web-enabled technologies in teaching and learning. With the new national curriculum LGR 11 the main changes involves stronger guidance what teachers teaching should involve at the subject level, a new grading system and specific knowledge's students should achieve in school year 3, 6 and 9. The boom of mobile technologies highlights a shift away from separating Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and education (e.g. computer labs) (Henderson &amp; Yeow, 2012) into co-located settings (De Chiara, Di Matteo, Manno, &amp; Scarano, 2007). Mobile technology becomes part of classrooms; both merged into new spaces for learning – we call them co-expanded spaces. In general, we assume these new situations affect the designs of teaching and learning in different aspects. Results from our previous studies in Denmark indicate a shift in students' learning culture from consumption of content into production of content (Jahnke &amp; Kumar, 2014) similar to what Hatch (2013) addresses as the maker movement culture. In this study, we explore how teachers meet the new challenges by studying the pedagogical communication. Specifically, from a Digital Didactics approach, we explore how the new situation affects didactical designs in such new settings where physical teaching and learning spaces are expanded by mobile technologies.AimThe aim of this study is to understand the teaching and learning designs-in-practice, especially the facets of such designs in co-expanded spaces. By studying the innovative teachers' didactical designs in media tablet classrooms, a particular focus is on the social relationship as a function of the teacher-student interaction and communication.Research questions1. How can the teacher-student relationships be described and understood in relation to tablet mediated learning classroom practice?2. How can teachers' communication about tablet mediated teaching and learning be described and understood in relation to tablet mediated classroom practice?3. How can the forms of teachers’ digital didactical designs be described and understood in relation to the curriculum?Theoretical frameworkFor understanding the designs of media tablet classroom practices, we used two sets of theories. Firstly, Jahnke, Norqvist, &amp; Olsson's (2014) approach of digital didactical design that is based on learning intentions, learning activities, assessment, and the social relations was applied for framing the analysis. In this paper the social relations constitute the teacher-student communication, which mirrors the teachers' didactical design. For understanding the teacher-student communication, Bernstein’s (2000) theory of classification and framing was applied. The concepts of classification and framing are translated into power and control relations. Classification highlights the relation between different categories. What turns a category into a unique category is its unique relationship to other categories. The uniqueness of a category is based on its specialisation e.g. teacher or student. The degree of specialisation creates boarders and a space between the categories as either strong or weak. The outcome of the classification analysis indicates practices of media tablet classrooms. These practices are further analysed through the relative concept of framing as either strong or weak. The concept of framing contributes to the understanding of the locus of control in the teacher-student relationship. The locus of control relates to several issues in the teacher student relationship, which reflects Bernstein’s concepts of selection, sequence, pacing and evaluation.Methodology, Methods, Research Instruments or Sources UsedThe methodology in this research project has been pre-tested in a pilot study in Denmark in 2012 to 2014. The qualitative method has been conducted to explore the teachers' designs in Swedish classrooms ranging from preschool to upper secondary school. Applying a purposeful sampling (Patton, 1990), schools were selected where teachers and pupils have been using media tablets longer than six months, preferably within a one-to-one computing program in which the pupils can also use the iPads at home. We focused on innovative teachers and early adopters (Rogers, 2003). In total we studied schools in four municipalities in Sweden in six clusters: one preschool, one preschool class (children at age 6), and classes in school years 1-3, 4-6, 7-9, and 10-12. The schools have been visited two times during the school year 2014/2015. In total we have conducted 20 classroom observations and teacher interviews. Data collection The classroom observations were conducted of 2-3 observers. The field notes were developed, as close as possible to the observation, into thick descriptions (Kullberg, 2004) that are described as narrative, describing, analysing and interpreted. After the observations the thick descriptions were discussed until an agreement was reached among the researchers. During the observations the observer take notes, photos, short video recordings. Each lesson lasted between 40-60 minutes. The subjects range from Native Language, Math, Science, English, Spanish and Social studies. The class sizes were around 20 to 25 students in each class. The observations were followed up with teacher interviews. For the teacher interviews, a half-structured interview guide were used that is divided into five themes with sub-questions: (1) background (age, gender, years as teacher, teaching subjects; first "thought" when implementing iPads); (2) the teachers teaching; (3) Learning (4) Assessment (5) magic wizard offers three wishes (what would teacher wish). The interviews were conducted by at least two researchers; audio-recorded and transcribed. Each interview lasted for about 60 minutes. Conclusions, Expected Outcomes or FindingsFindings from the innovative media tablet classrooms indicate two sets of didactical designs. The first set of didactical design demonstrates a majority of blurred boarders between categories, ranging from teachers' organisation of desks in the classroom to the software applications used in teaching and learning. The second set of didactical designs illustrates designs based on clear boarders between categories, which indicates strong power relationships. These two sets of relationship between categories create two kinds of social relationship in the classroom. Media tablet classrooms based on weak classification indicates a pedagogical practice that involves students' decision making to a greater extent than in classrooms based on strong classification. The weak classification between categories in the classrooms becomes the underpinning framework for didactical designs where the media tablets are integrated for making products. The making of products demonstrates students' influence regarding the selection and sequence of content, for example when making films. With regard to the learning intentions in the curriculum, in students' creative work, the teachers' support student learning by using explicit and implicit criteria for keeping the right track in students' learning. An important issue concerns the sociological notion of sharing resources involving signs of changed communication and interaction patterns in the classrooms.

AB  - Although research has shown psychopathic traits to be moderately to highly stable in late childhood and adolescence, little is known about stability in early childhood, specifically in preschool age. The current study was designed to fill this knowledge gap by assessing stability of psychopathic traits in a large community sample (n = 2,121) of three- to five-year-olds (47% girls) across a two-year time span. The sample displayed stable levels of Grandiose-Deceitful (GD), Callous-Unemotional (CU) and Impulsivity, Need for Stimulation (INS) traits. However, the degree of stability varieda cross these three traits dimensions, and by level of analysis, age, and gender. Rank-order stability ranged from low to very high, but effect sizes indicated less stability than on the mean level, where changes were detected but with small effect sizes, thus demonstrating high stability. This trend emerged for both genders, across development, and age. At an individual level, the great majority of the sample displayed stable levels of psychopathic traits to a large extent, with small gender and age differences. The current study is one of the first that investigates stability in children as young as three years old, and it highlights the possibility of measuring psychopathic traits in early childhood.

AB  - Studied 72 2-5 yr. Olds in preschool settings and classified interactions according to P. Jackson and B. Wolfson's 7 varieties of constraints and a taxonomy of 14 adaptations. The constraints conformed to P. Schoggen's (see R. Barker, pa, vol. 38:4049) definition of conflict environmental force units (conflict efu). 2 middle-class nursery schools and 2 head start programs were studied. These environments enabled the effects of several ecological variables structure of the daily program, spaciousness of the schoolroom, and teacher-children ratio and several personal variables age, sex, and social class on the incidence of conflict efu and adaptations to be determined. Differential linkages of the adaptations with varieties of conflict efu were also examined. The environmental variable which differentiated preschool settings was the program structure, and significant effects for age, sex, and social class were also found. (34 ref.)

AB  - The primary caregiving model provides for teachers to have primary daily responsibility for the same small group of toddlers or infants. The system allows for creation of strong bonds between teacher and child and provides parents with a trusted care partnership. Challenges to the system include large child-to- caregiver ratios, matching teachers to children, and a supportive staff environment. (LBT)

AB  - Biesta (2006) argues that within the past two decades there has been a rise in the concept of “learning” and a decline in the concept of “education”. He calls this the “learnification” of education: “the translation of all there is to say about education in terms of learning and learners” (Biesta, 2009, p. 5). He argues that this is problematic in part because learning is basically an individual concept referring to what people as individuals do, versus education, which implies a relationship. The field of early childhood education and care is uniquely situated to respond to “learnification”. In this paper we challenge the view that teachers teach children in preschools, in an effort to replace it with the view that preschool children and their teachers are engaged in reciprocal learning and development. We do so by analyzing that ways that teacher participation in a pedagogical practice consisting of adult-child joint play, called playworld (Lindqvist, 1995), can support the development of teachers’ relational competence. Relational competence is “the skill of entering into and building relationships” (Aspelin, 2015, p. 35). Aspelin (2015) writes that “Questions about what teachers’ relational competence means, how it promotes students’ learning and how it can be developed in teacher education, further education of teachers and in pedagogical practices is largely unexplored.” In playworlds (Lindqvist, 1995) adults actively enter into the fantasy play of young children as a means of promoting the development and quality of life of both adults and children. Thus, in this paper we begin from a relational pedagogical perspective (Aspelin &amp; Persson, 2011) where the concepts of co-existence and co-operation, in addition to “attitude to relationships” and “attitude in relationships” are foci. This conceptual framework is applied in the analysis of transcripts and field notes from a case study of three preschool teachers implementing the playworld pedagogy for the first time in their classroom. This case study consists of observations from a two-year ethnographic research project that took place in three preschools, all of which followed a pedagogy of listening and exploratory learning approach originated from the municipal preschools of Reggio Emilia. The research project was originally designed to examine if and how the teachers in these three preschools adopted and adapted into their own practices the Vygotskian-inspired playworld play pedagogy. The research study data was In Event: Putting the Teacher in the Picture: Perspectives From Early Childhood Education in Japan, Sweden, Finland, and Brooklyn gathered through participant observation using a variety of documentation methods, e. g.: interview, field notes, audio recorded reflection- and planning meetings and teachers pedagogical documentation. Findings include the following: Relational competence developed through the fostering of trust and authentic/honest communication, but this communication was often difficult for teachers, pushing them to challenge each other in ways that made them uncomfortable; Relational Competence developed through co-existence, in which “attitude in relationships” had a potential to emerge; “attitude in relationships” occur in playworlds, in which teachers encounter each other and the children in ways that go beyond the “rational” and encourage ethical steps in the development of subjectivity.

AB  - This study examined the applicability of Watts' Human Interaction Scale to day care settings, and was also concerned at a more general level with the question of whether it is possible for day care settings to approximate good homes. Six 2-year-olds in each of two day care centers were each videotaped for a total of 45 minutes in a variety of behavioral settings. Results indicated that: (1) the scale can be used in group settings with the addition of a distinction between adult/individual interaction and adult/group interaction; (2) interaction involving activities and interaction techniques which Watts found associated with high competence development occurs most frequently in structured activities and to some extent in free play settings. Also discussed: other results involving differences in the two day care centers; the adult/group mode of interaction; behavior setting sampling; adult responsiveness; adult/child ratios; quality versus quantity of interaction; and assessment of the direct impact of day care environments on the development of competence. It is concluded that day care can provide experiences comparable to good homes.

AB  - We report on the first representative sample survey of Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) program quality to be conducted in South Africa ( n = 242 ECCE centers). The Early Childhood Environmental Rating Scale—Revised (ECERS-R) and Infant–Toddler Environmental Rating Scale—Revised (ITERS-R) were used to assess ECCE quality. A Center Management Quality measure based on South African center licensing requirements was constructed and administered to center supervisors. We found that classes for both younger and older children fall just above the ‘minimal’ quality level on both measures. Regression analyses were conducted to establish determinants of center quality. Predictors included: licensing and subsidy status, teacher information (age, highest qualification and years in ECCE), presence of a Reception Year class in the center, teacher–child ratio, weekly fees, management quality, center support and parent involvement. Outcome measures were ITERS-R and ECERS-R total scale scores. Fees charged and center management capacity were predicted the quality of the care and learning environment. The relationship between level of child deprivation in the community (as an indicator of child poverty) and ITERS-R and ECERS-R total scores was examined separately. A significant negative relationship was observed between program quality and the level of child deprivation in the area served by the center. Implications for improving center quality for disadvantaged children in South Africa are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

AB  - This doctoral dissertation investigates the challenges “foreign teachers” experience in the encounter with the Swedish school and the possibilities they have to manage challenges and to establish their legitimacy. The participants of this study were newly employed in the pre-school, the primary school and the secondary school. The material includes interviews with 21 teachers and complementing observations at the workplaces of five of these teachers. Principals and colleagues have also been interviewed as well as administrators and teacher educators of supplementary teacher training programs. The shift of language of instruction was reported as causing challenges and demanded time and energy from the teachers in preparing the lessons. Here the teachers mentioned knowledge and correct use of the subject specific vocabulary and the ability to use everyday language in the process of building a bridge to the language of the subjects. Difficulties in the interaction with colleagues and parents were reported; when being positioned as less competent due to their second language speaker status. Some examples also reveal that everyday interaction demands knowledge of social practices that are not always familiar to these teachers. The value of individual assets (e.g. professional experience, profound subject knowledge and multilingualism) is enhanced when school principals recognize the resources of these teachers and make use of them in the communities of practice at school. In using activity theory, difficulties in the interaction with students or problems with questioning parents could be analyzed with regard to communities of practice, rule systems or division of labor in the activities of the school. This thesis emphasizes the importance of a critical discussion of existing norms, values and hierarchies in local school contexts if schools in Sweden in general are to be seen as learning and working contexts for teachers as well as students of all backgrounds.

AB  - This study seeks to determine whether center-based and family-based child care services differ with respect to process quality, as measured by the Educative Quality Observation Scales ( EQOS, Bourgon and Lavallée 2004a, b, c), for groups of children 18 months old and younger. It also seeks to identify structural variables associated with process quality in these settings. The study included two types of regulated child care settings located in the greater Montreal area (center-based: N = 53 and family-based: N = 36). Results indicate that process quality was lower in family-based child care than in center-based child care for the majority of elements measured by the EQOS. Hierarchical regression analyses indicate that higher levels of process quality were associated with structural variables, including a lower adult-child ratio, the presence of more staff with specialized early childhood education training, and center-based care. The discussion focuses on strategies to improve these types of child care services. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

AB  - This paper aims to describe the quality of play as offered by early childhood educators working with four-year-olds within an educational childcare service. It also aims to identify the correlation between the quality of play support and a child's cognitive, language and socio-emotional development. Finally, it focuses on the factors associated with the quality of play support provided by educational childcare centres and the characteristics of the educators involved. The sample included 170 educators working with four-year-olds. Results show that higher quality of play are linked with higher cognitive and language development. Other factors with a positive impact on play include: group of eight children, higher educator-to-child ratios, groups with male educators and groups whose personnel have followed more than 24 hours of in-service training and who express positive feelings towards their work. The discussion addresses the significance of these findings in childcare services.

AB  - The psychometric properties of the Infant–Toddler Environment Rating Scale-Revised Edition (ITERS-R) were examined using 153 classrooms from child-care centers where resources were tied to center performance. An exploratory factor analysis revealed that the scale measures one global aspect of quality. To decrease redundancy, subsets of items were selected randomly and by experts who rated items according to ease of administration and importance to quality. The shorter subsets demonstrated good discriminant validity, adequate to good psychometric properties, and high associations to the full ITERS-R score. They also demonstrated similar associations to staff education and staff-to-child ratio, as the full instrument. The best assessment of quality was demonstrated by the shortened subset that included items that assess both structural and process features of quality. Multilevel-analyses indicated that classrooms from the same providers score more similarly on ITERS-R than classrooms from other providers. The implications for using the ITERS-R in high-stakes contexts are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

AB  - This article reports a study of educators differentiating aspects of mathematical knowledge for teaching in preschool as part of a further-education programme. Eight Swedish preschool educators participated in focus group discussions about documentations from their own practice during a school year, to enhance their awareness of their mathematics education practice. The object of learning for the participants is more specifically how numbers and counting are made content for learning in preschool practice. The educators' authentic documentations are reflected upon in focus group meetings and further analysed by the researchers to find out what aspects the educators differentiate during the programme. Results show that educators' learning about content for children's learning in preschool is a complex process. This process involves several aspects necessary to discern for a professional development to occur, but the collaborative approach seems prosperous in that new aspects are brought to the fore, influencing their reflective practice.

AB  - The focus of this article is on mathematics teaching in a play-based and goal-oriented practice, such as preschool, and on how different lines of actions may impact children's learning opportunities. Video recordings of authentic play activities involving children and nine teachers from different preschools were analyzed qualitatively to answer the following research questions: (1) What lines of action do teachers use when they teach mathematics in play? and (2) What implications may different ways of teaching have for children's learning opportunities? The analysis revealed four different categories: confirming direction of interest; providing strategies; situating known concepts; and challenging concept meaning. As these differ regarding both the mathematics content focused on and the kind of knowledge emphasized, they have implications for children's learning opportunities.

AB  - In this paper we describe the empirical and theoretical meaning behind how finger patterns are taught to facilitate the development of preschool children’s perception of the first ten natural numbers. An intervention programme, informed by Variation theory of learning, included 65 five-year-olds and teachers at seven preschool departments in Sweden. The programme aimed at developing teaching activities and artefacts to promote children discerning necessary aspects of the first ten numbers. The design of the programme is significant to describe and evaluate as basis for forthcoming analyses of the learning outcomes, as a pedagogical approach that stands in contrast to common preschool teaching practice in Sweden is adopted.

AB  - The idea of using fingers as a key component in arithmetic development has received a great deal of support, much of which is based on neuroscientific evidence. However, this body of work pays limited attention to how fingers are used and possible different outcomes in arithmetic problem solving. The aim of our paper, based on an analysis of 126 observations of 4–5-year-olds solving a simple subtraction task, is to discuss different ways of using fingers, with some of the ways appearing more, and others less, powerful. The analysis suggests there is much more complexity to children’s finger-related strategies than prior research has indicated. Empirical findings in our study point to the decisive effects of different ways of using fingers, and in particular for either keeping track of counted units or for presenting a structured awareness of number. Three ways of using fingers emerge in the analysis, which are discussed in relation to their rate of success in solving the subtraction task and with attention to why the differences matter for the success rate. Through this discussion we suggest that the complexity of how fingers are used must be considered.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore the quality of toddler childcare in Norway using the Infant Toddler Environment Rating Scale-Revised Edition (ITERS-R; [Harms, Thelma, Debby Cryer, and Richard M. Clifford. 2006. "Infant/Toddler Environment Rating Scales Revised Edition." New York: Teachers College Press.]), drawing on a sample of 206 toddler groups. Possible associations between quality (as assessed using ITERS-R) and selected structural features in toddler classrooms were investigated. Those features are as follows: ownership, the presence of qualified teachers, the staff-to-child ratio and group organization. According to the results, Norwegian toddler care scored at the minimal level of quality. The presence of qualified teachers, high staff-to-child ratios and small and stable groups all seemed to have positively impacted quality. Detailed analyses revealed that Norwegian toddler classrooms did not fulfil the ITERS-R requirements for hygiene, safety and access to play materials. Because of the good reputation Norwegian childcare enjoys, these results were unexpected and suggest the need to enhance the quality of Norwegian toddler care.

AB  - Data from the Cost, Quality, and Outcomes Study (S. W. Helburn, 1995) are used to examine the effects of group size, staff–child ratio, and teacher qualifications on the quality of child care provided in day care centers (for infants and toddlers). The Cost, Quality, and Outcomes data are from a representative 4-state sample of day care centers with a design that makes it possible to control for unobserved differences across centers that could cause biased estimates of the effects of interest. The empirical results indicate that group size has small and statistically insignificant effects on child-care quality. A higher staff-child ratio appears to have beneficial effects on child-care quality when unobserved differences across centers are not accounted for. These effects become much smaller when unobserved differences are accounted for. The effects of teacher education and training are also generally not robust, but some measures of education and training have quantitatively and statistically significant effects even accounting for unobserved differences across centers. The implications of the results for future research on the determinants of child-care quality and for public policy are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Center-based child care has been struggling with poor health and high turnover rates of child care staff and their adverse impact on care quality for decades. Yet little is known about personal and structural antecedents of job resources and job demands that are valid predictors of health and turnover in the child care workforce. Research Findings: This study investigated job resources and job demands among child care staff of different education levels (491 lead teachers and 310 assistant teachers) from Switzerland. Results from t-tests and hierarchical regression analyses indicated slightly higher job resources and job demands for lead teachers than for assistant teachers but similar antecedents of job resources and job demands. Overall, center characteristics shaped job resources and job demands more strongly than staff characteristics. More specifically, job resources were predicted by structural characteristics associated with professionalism in child care work, whereas job demands were primarily dependent on adequate staffing. Practice or Policy: The findings suggest that center characteristics (e.g., work environment and staffing levels) should be targeted in order to increase job resources and reduce job demands, which would in turn promote health and lower turnover rates among child care staff.

AB  - It has been claimed that the childhood behavioral factors "hyperactivity" and "conduct disorder" are highly correlated. The fact that hyperactive symptoms load heavily on the conduct disorder factor has also been used to support the notion that hyperactivity is not an independent behavioral dimension. The present study employed 683 psychiatric and normal children (aged 4–15 yrs) to demonstrate that both of these observations are artifacts of methodological technique. When factor score coefficients were used to interpret factors, the hyperactive symptoms did not load on the conduct disorder factor. If factor scores were defined by the use of unit weights, then the intercorrelation between the hyperactive and conduct disorder factors was high. The use of factor score coefficients to define factors, on the other hand, produced uncorrelated factors. Results support the idea that hyperactivity and conduct disorder are independent behavioral dimensions. (French abstract) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The study explored in-service teachers' efficacy beliefs in pupil engagement. The sample size was 299 kindergarten teachers selected from both public and private kindergarten schools in the Kumasi metropolis of Ghana. The study adopted and used pupil engagement subscale of the Ohio State Teacher Efficacy Scale (OSTES) developed by Tschannen-Moran and Woolf Hoy (2001) as survey instrument. Results of the study revealed that kindergarten teachers in the Kumasi metropolis of Ghana have high efficacy beliefs in pupils' engagement. No statistically significant difference was found in the efficacy beliefs in pupil engagement of trained and untrained kindergarten teachers. The results also show that efficacy beliefs in pupil engagement among public and private kindergarten school teachers did not differ significantly. It is argued that the training background of the teachers (i.e. whether they were trained or untrained) and their institutional placement (i.e. whether they taught in a public or private school) are not essential influential factors in teachers' efficacy beliefs in pupil engagement. Implications of the findings for research and practice are discussed.

AB  - Self-regulation involves to the ability to both control one's impulses and engage in a particular behavior on demand. It is a skill used not just in social interactions (emotional self-regulation) but in thinking (cognitive self-regulation) as well. Research shows that children's self-regulation behaviors in the early years predict their school achievement in reading and mathematics better than IQ scores. The authors suggest a number of ways kindergarten teachers can promote children's development of this important skill.

AB  - Studied the relation of age, socioeconomic status, child care history, maternal educational level and story comprehension in 107 male and female children (aged 4.0-5.5 yrs) in France. Data on sociodemographic variables were obtained by questionnaire. Ss listened to a story read by their normal teacher and then were asked to retell the story, while turning the pages of the story book, to an unknown teacher without any structuring prompts. Ss were also asked to respond to 4 comprehension questions about the story. The results indicate that maternal educational level is the most important factor related to story comprehension in young children. Implications for the further study of factors associated with reading comprehension are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Health outcomes vary between schools and it is theorised that this may be partly attributable to variation in the school environment. Existing systematic reviews have not drawn authoritative conclusions because of methodological limitations in the review or studies available. We identified 42 multi-level studies, ten of which were judged of sufficient quality to narratively synthesize. There was consistent evidence that schools with higher attainment and attendance than would be expected from student intake had lower rates of substance use. Findings on the influence of smoking/alcohol policies were mixed. Three studies examined the health effects variously associated with school campus area and observability, year structure, school size and pupil-to-teacher ratio with mixed findings. The studies reviewed support the potential influence of the school environment on student health. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

AB  - 311 Greek children's drawings of classroom life were employed to investigate the diagnostic validity of this measure in identifying teachers' pedagogic style. The sample was divided into three age groups, 6-, 8-, and 10-yr. olds, who were asked to draw pictures of themselves and their teachers in their classroom. Drawings were scored using as criteria the four graphic indicators (ratings of size, detailing, centrality, and social distance) proposed by Aronsson and Anderson in 1996. Analysis showed three out of the four indicators discriminated teacher-centered vs student-centered pedagogic style. More specifically, in the teacher-centered setting children drew the teacher of dominant size, in a central position, and as remote, while in the student- centered setting the teacher was depicted closer to the student, in a less central position, and less emphasized relative to the student. The findings are discussed with respect to the absence of age-related effects and the possibility of using children's drawings of classroom life as a measure for tapping into children's representations of pedagogic style.

AB  - The present study investigates the effects of teachers (background qualifications, attitudes and beliefs, and instructional practices) on student achievement in mathematics, reading, and spelling in 1st grade. Its theoretical framework and methodology are based on recent work by Palardy and Rumberger (2008). Data from the SiBO Project, a longitudinal study in Flemish primary education, were analyzed for the present study using 2-level regression analysis. The results showed that teacher background had the largest effect on mathematics achievement, whereas instructional practices had the largest effects on both reading and spelling achievement. Moreover, the size of teacher effects depended upon the specific learning domain: Larger teacher effects were found for mathematics than for spelling and reading. Overall, the results suggest that teachers had a modest to strong effect on student achievement in first grade.

AB  - Although environmental and sustainability education in early years is on the rise, it has been noted that the field is slow to engage in sustainability issues (Davis, 2005, 2009; Elliott &amp; Davis, 2009; Pramling Samuelsson, 2011). Evidence from a number of longitudinal studies indicates that high quality preschool education has positive effects on children’s well-being, health, intellectual and social behavioral development (Siraj-Blatchford et al., 2008; The Abecedarian Project, 2012). Researchers also stress that environmental and sustainability issues should feature in early childhood education, because children develop their attitudes, conceptions, behavioral and intellectual potential during this time (Cutter-Mackenzie &amp; Edwards, 2013; Flogaitis et al., 2005; Siraj-Blatchford, 2009). However, questions such as in what way and how sustainability challenges should be integrated in early childhood education have received little attention (Hagglund &amp; Samuelsson, 2009).Defined as “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs” (Brundtland, 1987, p. 43), the concept of sustainability was introduced in the end of the 1980's as a critical global issue. Later on, the United Nations General Assembly declared the Decade of Education for Sustainability (2005-2014) for promoting education for sustainability within all areas of education and learning (UNESCO, 2005). As the Decade recently came to an end, a literature review would be useful to provide an overview of what has been done academically in the field of early childhood education since the concept of sustainability was introduced. A review can also help to avoid ‘re-inventing the wheel’ and to build on the findings of other studies (Badger et al., 2000). Evidence from empirical studies can assist in improving educational practices and to facilitate evidence-based policy-making (Broekkamp &amp; van Hout-Wolters, 2007).The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the current empirical evidence in the field of environmental and sustainability education in early childhood, which is based on information provided by preschool children, their parents or teachers. Its objectives have been:to identify articles reporting empirical studies about early childhood education concerning environmental or sustainability issues, which are based on data provided by preschool children, their parents or teachers, and are published between 1987 and 2015;to synthesize the key findings; andto identify research needs suggested in the studies.Early childhood refers to a period until eight years of age (Britto, Yoshikawa, &amp; Boller, 2011). Preschools refer to any type of child institutional care, for example, a day-care center, a nursery or a kindergarten, where children are taken care of while their guardians work. They include government, non-government, private, international and combined-type of institutions for young children. This review does not address any similarities or differences in conceptions of environmental and sustainability education. It does not attempt to define any terms, rather, it reports what has been done in both fields regarding early childhood education.Methodology, Methods, Research Instruments or Sources Used Although some elements of a systematic review were followed, variations in objective, study design and outcome of the included studies do not allow for a meaningful evaluation of the quality of the evidence. The methodology included establishing inclusion and exclusion criteria, identifying and grouping relevant search terms, searching articles in selected databases, screening and selecting articles, and extracting data according to preselected categories. A priori inclusion and exclusion criteria were developed for the review. The inclusion criteria included peer-reviewed journal articles reporting empirical studies published 1987 or later. The author(s) of the articles should explicitly connect early childhood education to the concept of environmental or sustainability education. Articles were searched in three databases on 31 January 2015 by combining two groups of search terms. The first group of search terms was concerned with preschool settings and the second group was concerned with environmental and sustainability education. Within each group search terms were combined by the Boolean operator OR, and the two groups of search terms were combined using the Boolean operator AND. A hit was generated if any one term in the first group and any one term in the second group both appeared in the topic or abstract of an article. Searches were performed in the following databases: Academic Search Elite, ERIC, and GreenFILE. The databases were chosen considering their coverage of educational resources related to environmental and sustainability issues. No restrictions in language or geographical areas were set and no special search limiters were chosen. American and British spelling differences were noted and both were searched for. The total number of hits in the three databases was 217. Titles and abstracts of these primary records were screened. Duplicates and articles not meeting the inclusion criteria or meeting the exclusion criteria were omitted. Based on a review of titles, abstracts and elimination of duplicates, 157 articles were excluded. Sixty articles were selected for full text review. Eligible articles will be selected for inclusion. Using a form comprising pre-determined categories, data will be extracted from the selected articles. In terms of methodological limitations, a systematic search and review may have gaps in the searching procedure (Borg et al., 2014). Some relevant studies may have been excluded if they were not on electronic databases. Therefore, traditional methods of hand searching, information from individuals and searching references will be carried out. Conclusions, Expected Outcomes or Findings The study is in progress and will be completed by the end of May. Data categories include: Author, Year, Objective, Study design, Country, Participants, Theoretical framework, Aspects of sustainability (environmental, social or economic), Findings and Recommendations. The categories will be collapsed into broader areas while summarizing the data. A brief summary on what has been done in the field of early childhood education since the concept of sustainability was introduced in 1987 will be provided, as well as an outline of identified research needs. This review is intended to provide researchers and practitioners with an overview of the current evidence base and research needs to offer support and guidance for future practices, strategies, policies and priorities.

AB  - Since 1953, Norwegian national standards regulate ratios of children to staff, training requirements, group sizes, leadership and subsidies. Both national and local subsidies support the management and quality level of day care centers. In Norway a current viewpoint on quality in day care is to stimulate innovation in day care activities by rewarding local initiative and creativity. Outdoor activities and giving the children freedom to learn are highly valued. Preschool teacher education, which is three years at college, shares a common frame of a governmental curricular guideline as well as a nationwide curriculum for day care. A responsive and warm interaction between staff, children and parents is a definite moral value of the preschool teacher profession. Current issues of quality are related to the shortage of highly qualified directors and leaders in public day care as well as the expansion of private centers with questionable quality. Quality control of day care centers is now discussed as a necessary surveillance system of the quality of contexts and interactions in children's daily life.

AB  - This study investigated the techniques which 10 teachers used with 48 children in one private and one public nursery school during the noon luncheon period. Wide differences among the teachers and marked variations for each teacher from day to day as well as certain trends were noted. The greatest number of teachers' activities dealt with motivating the children to eat, and the second greatest dealt with serving of food. Reminders and suggestions were used most frequently; positive forms of motivation other than praise were next in order, followed by praise. Negative forms of motivation were used comparatively infrequently, usually as a last resort, and almost never by experienced teachers. Teachers who used negative motivation most tended also to use praise most. All teachers tended to base specific instructions of eating standards on the specific child behavior in the situation at hand. Commands constituted 27% of all speech activities of the teachers. There were more indirect than direct commands given. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Departing from previous theoretical and empirical studies on sustainable supply-chain management, we investigate organizational commitment (drivers and motivations) and capabilities (resources, structures, and policy instruments) in sustainable procurement of “noncore” products. By focusing on chemicals in textiles, the article explores the activi-ties of differently sized organizations and discusses the potentials and limitations of sustainable procurement measures. The study is based on a qualitative and comparative approach, with empirical findings from 26 case stud-ies of Swedish public and private procurement organizations. These organizations operate in the sectors of hotels/ conference venues, transport, cinema, interior design, and hospitals/daycare. While this work demonstrates major challenges for buyers to take into account peripheral items in sustainable procurement, it also identifies constructive measures for moving forward. A general sustainability/environmental focus can, as an effect, spill over to areas per-ceived as peripheral. © 2014 Boström et al.

AB  - With a number of disparities present in the diagnosis and treatment of children with autism spectrum disorders, the education system plays a crucial role in the provision of both these service elements. Based on school and federal census data, this article examines one state's public school autism enrollment and possible predictors of enrollment within each jurisdiction. The authors' analyses found that actual prevalence is inconsistent with expectations across jurisdictions, with socioeconomic status indicators, race, geographic location, and racial diagnostic discrepancies in special education significantly predicting enrollment. This report exemplifies how secondary analysis of educational data can allow states to better allocate funding, begin to address issues pertaining to lags and unmet standards, and find model systems within their states.

AB  - ClassWide Peer Tutoring (CWPT) is an evidence-based instructional strategy effective with students with and without disabilities. The evidence for efficacy is strong with respect to students in elementary schools learning basic academic skills in classrooms with large teacher-pupil ratios, and relatively less strong for students in secondary schools learning academic content skills in general education classrooms. Largely unknown, however, is the efficacy of CWPT with secondary level students with emotional and behavioral disorders (E/BD) in alternative schools with small teacher-pupil ratios. Known challenges to the efficacy of CWPT in these settings are the smaller class sizes with smaller peer groups, the high number of students in class with significant behavioral issues, and the absence of typically developing peers. Collectively, these challenges may obviate the operation of some components of CWPT contributing to its efficacy, such as novelty in weekly peer tutors or ability of peers to praise and provide response feedback. The purpose of the present investigation was to make an initial examination of CWPT used in these conditions. In two alternative school classrooms, students and teachers participated in an ABAB single-subject design comparing the current instruction (conventional) with CWPT. Results based on students' weekly biology test scores were not superior with CWPT in one classroom, and only slightly improved in the second. Based on these findings, Class-Wide Self-Management (CWSM) was added to CWPT and compared to conventional instruction in a third classroom (spelling) using an alternating treatment design. Similar test results for these students indicated sizable improvements in most, but not all, weeks of the study. Students in all three classrooms improved in the amount of time spent on-task in CWPT compared to conventional instruction. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

AB  - This study uses data from a comprehensive database of U.S. early childhood education program evaluations published between 1960 and 2007 to evaluate the relationship between class size, child–teacher ratio, and program effect sizes for cognitive, achievement, and socioemotional outcomes. Both class size and child–teacher ratio showed nonlinear relationships with cognitive and achievement effect sizes. For child–teacher ratios 7.5:1 and lower, the reduction of this ratio by one child per teacher predicted an effect size of 0.22 standard deviations greater. For class sizes 15 and smaller, one child fewer predicted an effect size of 0.10 standard deviations larger. No discernible relationship was found for larger class sizes and child–teacher ratios. Results were less clear for socioemotional outcomes due to a small sample. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

AB  - Social disorganization theory suggests that certain school-level indictors of disorder may be important predictors of bullying-related attitudes and behaviors. Multilevel analyses were conducted on bullying-related attitudes and experiences among 22,178 students in 95 elementary and middle schools. The intraclass correlation coefficients indicated that 0.6–2% of the variance in victimization, 5–10% of the variance in retaliatory attitudes, 5–6% of the variance in perceptions of safety, and 0.9% of the variance in perpetration of bullying was associated with the clustering of students within schools. Although the specific associations varied somewhat for elementary schools as compared to middle schools, the hierarchical linear modeling analyses generally suggested that school-level indicators of disorder (e.g., student–teacher ratio, concentration of student poverty, suspension rate, and student mobility) were significant predictors of bullying-related attitudes and experiences. Student-level characteristics (i.e., sex, ethnicity, status in school) were also relevant to students’ retaliatory attitudes, perceptions of safety, and involvement in bullying. Implications for school-based research and violence prevention are provided. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

AB  - Studied school environmental factors associated with the promotion or inhibition of specific patterns of child–child interactions in a preschool setting. Human Ss: 18 normal male and female Brazilian preschool children (aged 4 yrs 8 mo–5 yrs 9 mo). One male Brazilian school-age child (aged 10 yrs) (multiple handicaps). Ss were videotaped during normal preschool activities. The tapes were segmented into units for interaction analysis and evaluated according to number and type of teacher activities promoting or suppressing cultural canalization, the content or significance of teacher's activities referring to child–child interactions, and teacher verbalizations referring to norms of social values related to social interactions. Statistical tests were used. (English abstract) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - A subset of families who separate and divorce become embroiled in conflict and demand a disproportionate amount of court resources both during and after their legal divorce process. The court system has responded by establishing parenting coordination (PC) programs to assist parents in resolving conflict without utilizing court resources to do so. In spite of widespread implementation, empirical research into the effects of PC programs is ‘‘practically nonexistent’’ (Henry, Fieldstone, & Bohac, 2009). The present study is a pilot study of a PC program in one jurisdiction to investigate the use of a methodology not previously used within the parenting coordination literature to test the effectiveness of PC programs. Variables relating to the amount of judicial, court personnel, outside agency, and parental time that was spent on each case were coded from legal divorce files. Results indicate that the PC program reduced the number of: motions filed by parents, documents processed by court personnel, judicial hearings, and changes in agreements ordered by judges for this small sample. The methodology pilot tested was successful and provided a comprehensive analysis. While a small pilot, the overall conclusion reached is this PC program is promising for in easing the burden on court personnel, reducing the number of agencies involved with the family and in assisting parents in making longer-lasting parenting decisions. Important next steps are to cross validate these findings using a larger sample and a control group with similar characteristics who were not assigned parenting coordinators.

AB  - This article examines the relationship between preschool quality and children's early development in a sample of over 7900 children enrolled in 578 preschools in rural Indonesia. Quality was measured by: (1) classroom observations using the Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale-Revised (ECERS-R); (2) teacher characteristics; and (3) structural characteristics of preschools. Children's development was measured using the Early Development Instrument (EDI). The article proposes two methodological improvements to preschool quality studies. First, an instrumental variable approach is used to correct for measurement error. Second, ECERS-R is adjusted to the local context by contrasting items with Indonesia's national preschool standards. Results show that observed classroom quality is a significant and meaningful positive predictor of children's development once models correct for measurement error and apply a locally-adapted measure of classroom quality. In contrast, teacher characteristics and structural characteristics are not significant predictors of child development, while holding observed classroom quality constant.

AB  - Despite the long tradition in the social welfare field the number of children in Sweden who do not feel well has increased. This statement is based on reports from preschool teachers and includes young children (1-5 years old). The purpose of this article is to stress the present situation and what can be done to better work to raise healthy and secure children who also feel well. The aim is to discuss how the quality in preschool affects children’s wellbeing? Quality does not only mean happy children and satisfied parents but also competent staff with positive attitudes and systematic quality work. It appears from research that enough time for pedagogical planning and follow-up, small child groups, high teacher density and low staff turnover are also essential. The results also show that the most critical aspects for supporting children’s health and development are quality improvements based on equality, an efficient value system, a useful curriculum, scientifically based teacher training and a school/preschool for all.

AB  - There is today an increasing global interest in early childhood education, especially with regard to curriculum and quality work. The aim of this article is to study preschool teachers' and child care workers' views on the revised national curriculum for preschool in Sweden (Lpfö 98, rev. 2010), and if the educators perceive that they can conduct quality work based on the curriculum. This article is based on a web-based questionnaire distributed to all municipal preschool teachers and child care workers (in this study called educators) employed in a small municipality (n = 111). The questionnaire consisted of eight questions with 54 sub-items with five reply alternatives, including "don't know". The reply frequency was 58.6% (n = 65). Data were compiled and processed in a computer based program. The results showed that the preschool educators were positive to the curriculum and regarded it as a tool for improving the quality in preschool. The most important factors for increasing the quality were, according to the results, the educators' attitudes, the number of children in the group and the teacher-to-child ratio.

AB  - Background. Today, most children born preterm survive without major impairments. But high frequencies of cognitive and behavioural difficulties arise. Studies on dental behavioural management problems (DBMP) in these children are lacking. In addition, studies on caries prevalence are few and inconclusive. Aim. This study aims to compare the frequency of behavioural problems and poor compliance with dental treatment in preschool children born preterm with those born full-term. The prevalence of caries was also studied. Methods. The study group included 187 children born between 23 and 32 weeks of gestation. The control group constituted full-term children matched by age, sex, immigrant background, and dental operator. DBMP, number of dental visits, missed appointments, and caries between ages 3 and 6 were noted. Results. At age 3, but not at age 6, the prevalence of DBMP at clinical examinations was significantly higher in preterm children compared with the control group. Of the children who received dental treatments during preschool years, preterm children displayed significantly more DBMP. No significant difference in dental visits or in caries prevalence was found. Preterm children, however, missed significantly more dental appointments. Conclusion. Children born preterm display a higher prevalence of DBMP at dental examinations and treatments during preschool years.

Although research operationalizing direct supervision in family interactional terms has supported this hypothesis, research using structural proxies for direct supervision (i.e., family size, broken home, and employed mother) has tended to show negligible effects. This research tests the direct supervision hypothesis using a more parsimonious structural proxy--the ratio of adults to children in a household. It is hypothesized that this ratio will be negatively related to delinquency, and that it will be a stronger predictor of delinquency than more common structural measures. Using data from the 1986 wave of the Monitoring the Future survey (Bachman, Johnston, and O'Malley, 1986), bivariate and multivariate ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models reveal that none of the structural variables, including the ratio of adults to children, are good predictors of delinquency. These results support Wells and Rankin's (1958) contention that family structural proxies are inadequate for testing the specific family functional processes on which direct supervision hinges.

AB  - Observed 115 children (aged 5 years) with disabilities (42 with Down syndrome, 37 with motor impairment, and 36 with developmental delays) in a total of 115 classrooms. Categories for coding children's behaviors in mastery tasks, social activities with peers, and compliance with teachers were recorded by trained observers, blind to the study hypotheses using a modified time sampling procedure. Composite scores representing (1) engagement and skill in completing mastery tasks, (2) engagement and skill in social interaction with peers, and (3) compliance with teachers were constructed from the observation categories. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that specific classroom characteristics (i.e., class size, inclusiveness of class enrollment, teacher-child ratio, and percentage of time spent in one-on-one instruction) predicted performance on these behaviors above and beyond children's cognitive performance.

AB  - Since 1989, the U.S. Bureau of the Census has conducted the biennial Private School Universe Survey (PSS) for the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). The PSS is designed to generate biennial data on the total number of private schools, students, and teachers, and to build a universe of private schools in the 50 states and the District of Columbia to serve as a sampling frame of private schools for NCES sample surveys. The target population for the PSS is all schools in the 50 states and the District of Columbia that are not supported primarily by public funds, provide classroom instruction for one or more of grades kindergarten through 12 (or comparable ungraded levels), and have one or more teachers. Organizations or institutions that provide support for home schooling, but do not provide classroom instruction, are not included. The 2007-08 PSS data were collected between October 2007 and May 2008. All data are for the 2007-08 school year except the high school graduate data, which are for the 2006-07 school year. Due to first-time inclusion of both traditional and k-terminal schools, estimates in this report are not directly comparable to the estimates in the main tables sections of previous PSS release reports. The tables in this report contain totals and percentages generated from bivariate cross-tabulation procedures. All results are weighted. Comparisons drawn have been tested for statistical significance at the .05 level using Student t statistics. Many of the variables examined are related to one another, and complex interactions and relationships have not been explored. Characteristics such as school size, school level, religious orientation, association membership, geographic region, community type, and program emphasis are reported. Reported findings are descriptive in nature, are not meant to imply causality, and were selected to demonstrate the range of information available from the 2007-08 PSS rather than discuss all of the observed differences, emphasize any particular issue, or make comparisons over time. In the fall of 2007, there were 33,740 private elementary and secondary schools with 5,072,451 students and 456,266 full-time equivalent (FTE) teachers in the United States. Three appendices are included: (1) Glossary; (2) Technical Notes; and (3) Standard Error Tables. (Contains 1 footnote and 31 tables.)

AB  - In 1988, the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) introduced a proposal to develop a private school data collection that would improve on the sporadic collection of private school data dating back to 1890 and improve on commercially available private school sampling frames. Since 1989, the U.S. Bureau of the Census has conducted the biennial Private School Universe Survey (PSS) for NCES. The PSS is designed to generate biennial data on the total number of private schools, students, and teachers, and to build a universe of private schools to serve as a sampling frame of private schools for NCES sample surveys. For more information about the methodology and design of the PSS, please see the Technical Notes in appendix B of this report. The target population for the PSS is all schools in the 50 states and the District of Columbia that are not supported primarily by public funds, provide classroom instruction for one or more of grades kindergarten through 12 (or comparable ungraded levels), and have one or more teachers. Organizations or institutions that provide support for home schooling, but do not provide classroom instruction, are not included. The 2009-10 PSS data were collected between September 2009 and May 2010. All data are for the 2009-10 school year except the high school graduate data, which are for the 2008-09 school year. Because the purpose of this report is to introduce new NCES survey data through the presentation of tables containing descriptive information, only selected findings are listed. These findings are purely descriptive in nature and are not meant to imply causality. These findings have been chosen to demonstrate the range of information available from the 2009-10 PSS rather than to discuss all of the observed differences, emphasize any particular issue, or make comparisons over time. The tables in this report contain totals and percentages generated from bivariate crosstabulation procedures. All of the results are weighted. Comparisons drawn in the bullets have been tested for statistical significance at the 0.05 level using Student's statistics to insure that the differences are larger than those that might be expected due to sampling variation. Many of the variables examined are related to one another, and complex interactions and relationships have not been explored. Appendices include: (1) Glossary; (2) Technical Notes; and (3) Standard Error Tables. (Contains 31 tables and 1 footnote.)

AB  - In 1988, the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) developed a private school data collection that improved on the sporadic collection of private school data dating back to 1890 by developing an alternative to commercially available private school sampling frames. Since 1989, the U.S. Bureau of the Census has conducted the biennial Private School Universe Survey (PSS) for NCES. The PSS is designed to generate biennial data on the total number of private schools, students, and teachers, and to build a universe of private schools to serve as a sampling frame of private schools for NCES sample surveys. The target population for the PSS is all schools in the 50 states and the District of Columbia that are not supported primarily by public funds, provide classroom instruction for one or more of grades kindergarten through 12 (or comparable ungraded levels), and have one or more teachers. Organizations or institutions that provide support for home schooling, but do not provide classroom instruction, are not included. The 2011-12 PSS data were collected between September 2011 and May 2012. All data are for the 2011-12 school year except the high school graduate data, which are for the 2010-11 school year. Because the purpose of this report is to introduce new NCES survey data through the presentation of tables containing descriptive information, only selected findings are listed. These findings are purely descriptive in nature and are not meant to imply causality. These findings have been chosen to demonstrate the range of information available from the 2011-12 PSS rather than to discuss all of the observed differences, emphasize any particular issue, or make comparisons over time. The tables in this report contain counts and percentages demonstrating bivariate relationships. All of the results have been weighted to reflect the sample design and to account for nonresponse and other adjustments. Comparisons drawn in the selected findings have been tested for statistical significance at the 0.05 level using Student's t statistics to ensure that the differences are larger than those that might be expected due to sampling variation. No adjustments were made for multiple comparisons. Many of the variables examined are related to one another, and complex interactions and relationships have not been explored. Statistical Analysis Software (SAS 9.2) and SUDAAN (10.0) were used to compute the statistics for this report. Appended are: (1) Glossary; (2) Technical Notes; and (3) Standard Error Tables. (Contains 31 tables and 2 footnotes.)

AB  - In 1988, the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) developed a private school data collection that improved on the sporadic collection of private school data dating back to 1890 and at the same time developed an alternative to commercially available private school sampling frames. Since 1989, the U.S. Bureau of the Census has conducted the biennial Private School Universe Survey (PSS) for NCES. The PSS is designed to generate biennial data on the total number of private schools, students, and teachers, and to build a universe of private schools to serve as a sampling frame of private schools for NCES sample surveys. The target population for the PSS is all schools in the 50 states and the District of Columbia that are not supported primarily by public funds, provide classroom instruction for one or more of grades kindergarten through 12 (or comparable ungraded levels), and have one or more teachers. Organizations or institutions that provide support for home schooling, but do not provide classroom instruction, are not included. The 2013-14 PSS data were collected between September 2013 and September 2014. All data are for the 2013-14 school year except the high school graduate data, which are for the 2012-13 school year. Because the purpose of this report is to introduce new NCES survey data through the presentation of tables containing descriptive information, only selected findings are listed. These findings are purely descriptive in nature and are not meant to imply causality. These findings have been chosen to demonstrate the range of information available from the 2013-14 PSS rather than to discuss all of the observed differences, emphasize any particular issue, or make comparisons over time. The tables in this report contain counts and percentages demonstrating bivariate relationships. All of the results have been weighted to reflect the sample design and to account for nonresponse and other adjustments. Comparisons drawn in the selected findings have been tested for statistical significance at the 0.05 level using Student's "t" statistics to ensure that the differences are larger than those that might be expected due to sampling variation. No adjustments were made for multiple comparisons. Many of the variables examined are related to one another, and complex interactions and relationships have not been explored. Statistical Analysis Software (SAS 9.2) and SUDAAN (10.0) were used to compute the statistics for this report.

AB  - Examined parental satisfaction with emergency department (ED) services provided at a pediatric hospital. Parents of children with non-life-threatening illnesses completed a questionnaire that addressed their level of satisfaction with ED services. Results showed that the majority of parents were satisfied with the services provided in the ED. Parents who were less satisfied reported the following: longer wait in receiving medical attention, insufficient number of staff to provide assistance, and staff not attending to children's needs quickly enough. 29% of parents reported being unaware of the requirements for ongoing care for their children. Based on the these results, EDs must give attention to the above issues to address the concerns of less satisfied parents and to improve continuing care for children discharged from EDs.

AB  - Three studies examined the effects of relative group size on the development of children's intergroup attitudes. The studies employed a novel group paradigm in which elementary school children (5-11 yrs old) attending a summer school program were assigned to larger (i.e., majority) or smaller (i.e., minority) novel groups in their classroom (denoted by colored tee-shirts). In each study, relative group size was situated within a different classroom context. Study 1 ( n=95) examined the effects of relative group size when teachers made functional use of the novel groups and were themselves members of the novel groups. Study 2 ( n=60) examined the effects of relative group size in the absence of functional use. Study 3 ( n=74) examined the effects of relative group size when the classroom environment contained implicit messages about group status. In each study, children's intergroup attitudes (e.g., trait ratings, group evaluations) were assessed following several weeks in the classroom. The effect of relative group size on in-group bias was complex, varying as a function of (1) the relative size and salience of groups, (2) the measure used to assess intergroup attitudes, (3) group status (higher or lower), and (4) children's age.

AB  - This study of nine preschool children with disabilities in an inclusive program with typical peers examined the types of play and social interactions in which they engaged in their chosen learning/activity centers. The following learning centers were used in this study: art (paints and drawing materials); creative expression (making teacher-directed products using cutting); writing (typewriter, letter writing, and printing materials); housekeeping/dress-up (kitchen setup, various apparel); computer (software programs); woodworking (hammers, wood blocks, and foam blocks); Lego® (multi-colored blocks); and science (nature materials). Findings indicated differences among the children in the amount of time they spent in various centers, the number of different types of play in which they engaged, and in the amount of time spent in play of various types. The children also differed in the number of observed segments in which peers (typical and atypical) were present, number/type of peer interaction events, number of segments in which teachers were present, and number I type of teacher interaction events. Children with various types of disabilities had different patterns of play, and case study examples describe some of these differences. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Few studies investigating the impacts of teacher characteristics and beliefs about the importance of early skill learning have included measures of children's learning outcomes. This study investigated how teachers' educational attainment, experience, and beliefs impact the development of letter identification and number concepts (enumeration, cardinality, and numeral identification). One hundred thirty-eight 4-year-old children from low-income homes attending public preschool programs were the focus of a study based on findings that early learning is impacted by family characteristics and teachers' perceptions of children's eagerness to learn (West, Denton, & Germino Hausken, 2000). Children's skills were assessed fall and spring, with more change found in spring measures of letter identification than in measures of number concept skills. Teachers' educational attainment was found to strongly influence development of letter identification, with teacher experience a weaker influence. For number concepts, teacher education and experience were equivalent influences. Teachers' beliefs about literacy and mathematics were weakly related to children's learning outcomes, but added to the variance accounted for beyond the influence of teacher education and experience in the development of numeral recognition. More information is needed from studies focusing on children learning across the school year on how structural and process features influence young children's learning. (Contains 6 tables.)

AB  - I denne utredningen analyserer vi lønnsomheten i private barnehager i Norge, og hvordan lønnsomheten kan bli påvirket av Stortingets nylig vedtatte bemanningsnorm. Hver private barnehage får tilskudd per barn tilsvarende kostnadene per barn i kommunale barnehager i samme kommune som den private barnehagen er lokalisert. Det er stor variasjon i antall barn hver barnehage har, og hvor store tilskudd barnehagen får per barn. Vi tar utgangspunkt i offentlig tilgjengelige årsregnskap og årsmeldinger for norske barnehager, innsamlet av Utdanningsdirektoratet. Våre analyser er basert på et utvalg av 8 532 observasjoner, fordelt på 3 906 forskjellige private ordinære barnehager i perioden 2013 til 2016. Vi har delt utvalget langs to dimensjoner, basert på barnehagens gjennomsnittlig antall heltidsplasser og gjennomsnittlig mottatt tilskudd per heltidsplass. Vi deler datasettet i tre like store deler langs begge dimensjonene. Med denne målemetoden får vi en klassifisering av hver barnehage som reflekterer størrelsen på barnehagen og størrelsen på tilskuddene barnehagen mottar. Gitt denne inndelingen måler vi driftsmarginer, kostnader per barn, og barn per ansatt for små, mellomstore og store barnehager, med henholdsvis lavt, middels eller høyt tilskuddsnivå. Måltallene gir uttrykk for lønnsomheten, kostnadene og kvaliteten i barnehagene. Vi finner stor variasjon i disse tre måltallene for barnehager med forskjellig størrelse og tilskuddsnivå. Små barnehager med lavt tilskudd har i gjennomsnitt driftsmargin på 1,4 prosent, mens store barnehager med høyt tilskudd i gjennomsnitt har driftsmargin på 7,5 prosent. Differansen utgjør 6,1 prosentpoeng. Vi har videre sammenlignet driftsmarginene i enkeltstående barnehager og barnehager organisert i konsern. Vi finner at konsernbarnehager har gjennomsnittlige driftsmarginer på 5,7 prosent, som er 2,6 prosentpoeng høyere enn driftsmarginene i enkeltstående barnehager. Lønnsomheten, kostnadene og kvaliteten i både konsern og enkeltstående barnehager, påvirkes av størrelsen på barnehagen og tilskuddsnivået barnehagen mottar. Stortinget har nylig vedtatt en bemanningsnorm for barnehager, og vi finner at 60 prosent av observasjonene i utvalget vårt har hatt lavere bemanning enn denne legger opp til. Blant konsernbarnehagene er andelen 80 prosent, mens den blant enkeltstående barnehager er 50 prosent. Vi har analysert hvordan bransjen ville blitt påvirket dersom Stortingets nye bemanningsnorm hadde blitt innført i 2013. Dersom alle barnehagene i utvalget vårt hadde fulgt normen, ville kostnadene økt med 500 millioner i året. Barnehagene med høyere bemanning enn normen krever kunne spart omtrent 275 millioner i året, mens barnehagene med lavere bemanning ville økt kostnadene med omtrent 770 millioner i året.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of an early numeracy intervention delivered by kindergarten teachers to students identified as having mathematics difficulties. A multigroup growth-modeling-with-random-assignment-to-intervention-condition design was employed. Thirty-two teachers were randomly assigned to the treatment or comparison condition. A total of 71 students participated in the study, 47 in the treatment group and 24 in the comparison group. Results indicated that the treatment condition students outperformed comparison students (g* = 0.99) and demonstrated statistically significantly higher scores on all proximal measures of early numeracy. Also, about 80% to 100% of the variance was accounted for at the student level. Performance on distal measures was less impressive, with no significant differences between groups; the effect size was 0.44. Teachers rated components of the intervention highly, reflecting strong teacher satisfaction.

AB  - Our understanding and treatment of children with autism have changed dramatically since Leo Kanner first formally documented the disorder in 1943. With reference to the historical context, this paper reviews recent research addressing 4 major issues: early detection, intervention, education, and psychopharmacological management of children with autism and related spectrum disorders. We conclude from our review of the evidence that, in the absence of additional, more compelling data, the clinical usefulness of existing screening instruments remains questionable. Although many questions remain (notably, What are the critical therapeutic components? For whom? For what domains of development? For what level of intensity and duration?), interventions shown to be effective are all carefully planned, engineered, monitored, and designed to target specific skill domains. Including children with autism in regular classes within the public school system poses several challenges, the most pressing of which is the large number of school personnel who need to be trained in evidence-based teaching and behavioural management practices. Finally, psychotropic drugs may help to reduce some symptoms, but they are neither curative nor a substitute for other forms of support and intervention.

AB  - Contends that quality (i.e., proper class size, good staff, administrative leadership, and parent participation) and child initiative are essential in delivering effective early childhood education. The use of computers in the classroom in support of curriculum goals is viewed as a technological enhancement to quality education. It is suggested that computers inspire practice of important skills, stimulate thinking, and help children use symbols. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The early childhood sector in Singapore has witnessed vast changes in the past two decades. One of the key policy aims is to improve classroom quality. To ensure a rigorous evaluation of the quality of early childhood environments in Singapore, it is important to determine whether commonly used assessments of quality are valid indicators across different national and community contexts. This study investigated the validity of the Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale-Revised (ECERS-R) in Singapore focused on three major aspects: response process, structural, and criterion validity. Data were collected from 108 classrooms of the main providers of kindergarten programs in Singapore. Initial analyses showed that the quality indicators in most of the ECERS-R items were disordered, which indicated problems with the hypothesized response process underlying the standard ECERS-R scoring system in which high-level indicators are only rated if low-level indicators are met (stop-scoring). To deal with the problem of the "stop-scoring" method, we used the data from a full-scoring method (in which every indicator on every item was rated) in subsequent factor analyses to investigate the internal structure of the ECERS-R. Twenty-two of the 34 items were retained and found to load on two factors, one relating to activities/materials and the other related to language/interactions. Both of the identified subscales and the combined scale showed good internal consistency. The factor score on the combined scale mirrored the ECERS-R full score and could discriminate between classrooms in the top and bottom quartiles of quality scores. Findings on the relationship between the identified factors to the teacher-child ratio and to an alternative measure of classroom quality provided further evidence for criterion validity of the ECERS-R. Implications for the future development and use of the ECERS-R are discussed.

AB  - Examined how quality of center-based child care related to early cognitive and language development from 6 to 36 months among 89 African American children. Found that higher quality care was related to higher measures of cognitive, language, and communication development, even after adjusting for selected child and family characteristics. Child:adult ratios and teacher education were related to some measures. (Author/KB)

AB  - This study of 553 infant, toddler, and preschool-center classrooms examined the association between classroom quality and both the highest level of the caregiver's formal education and whether the caregiver had attended training workshops at the center, in the community, or at professional meetings. Child care centers were randomly selected from 4 states, and 2 classrooms from each recruited center were selected for observation. Measures were taken of structural characteristics, caregiver training, process quality, and child outcomes. Results indicate that caregivers with formal education in early childhood or who attended workshops were rated as more sensitive in interactions with children and as providing higher quality care than other caregivers, even after adjusting for the caregivers' experience and differences related to state, adult-child ratios, and type of classroom. Furthermore, children in those caregivers' classes had more advanced language skills if caregivers reported either formal or informal training. The authors argue that these results are encouraging because informal training is a common mechanism used to promote better quality child care, although findings must be interpreted cautiously because they are based on caregivers' report of training.

AB  - Discusses the implementation of legislation providing incentives to states to educate infants and young children (Public Law 99-457) that has created expectations in parents and professionals for significantly improving the chances of young handicapped children/infants to develop normally. Teacher trainers are encouraged to confront the major policy issues of personnel shortage, certification standards, program content, and inservice training to meet the demand for necessary personnel. It is noted that at times of personnel shortage, state education departments and local school systems tend to lower or waive requirements for teaching in early special education.

AB  - The current study examined factors that affect assessment scores of public elementary and middle school students. It was hypothesized that non-instructional district-level variables would significantly predict state accountability test (SACT) results for these schools. Data for Michigan school districts were gathered on several district-level variables including free or reduced breakfast and/or lunch (FRL), pupil/teacher ratio (PTR), and foundation allowance per pupil (FA). These variables were compared to scores from the Michigan Educational Assessment Program (MEAP) for mathematics, reading, and writing tests for grades 4 through 8 in each Michigan school district. Results of this study suggested that the FRL was the only significant predictor of statewide achievement scores. Potential implications and suggestions for future research are included.

AB  - Circle time is a near universally used preschool activity; however, little research has explored its nature, content, and quality. This study examined activity types, teacher and child talk, child engagement, and classroom quality in a sample of public preschool classrooms in an urban, high-poverty school district. Results demonstrated that teacher talk was twice as prevalent as child talk, and there was a lack of back-and-forth exchanges and open-ended questions. Quality of instruction was low on all dimensions of the Classroom Assessment Scoring System, and child engagement dropped to low levels in about 40% of classrooms. Finally, classroom quality predicted child-to-teacher talk ratio and child engagement. Evidence calls into question the richness and quality of circle time and suggests that even modest improvements in quality and an increased focus on child participation could ensure that educators are not squandering valuable learning time and depleting children’s behavioral self-regulation during the first activity of the day.

AB  - We hypothesize that mild mental impairment (MMI) represents the low extreme of the same quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that operate throughout the distribution of intelligence. To detect QTLs of small effect size, we employed a direct association strategy by genotyping 432 presumably functional nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) identified from public databases on DMA pools of 288 cases and 1,025 controls. In total, 288 MMI cases were identified by in-home administration of McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities to 836 twin pairs selected from a community sample of more than 14,000 children previously screened for nonverbal cognitive delay using parentally administered tests. Controls were selected from the community sample representing the full range of nonverbal intelligence. SNPs showing at least 7% allele frequency differences between case and control DNA pools were tested for their association with the full range of nonverbal intelligence using five DNA subpools, each representing quintiles of the normal quantitative trait scores from the 1025 controls. SNPs showing linear associations in the expected direction across quintiles using pooled DNA were individually genotyped for the 288 cases and 1,025 controls and analyzed using standard statistical methods. One SNP (rs1136141) in HSPA8 met these criteria, yielding a significant (P=0.036) allelic frequency difference between cases and controls for individual genotyping and a significant (P=0.013) correlation within the control group that accounts for 0.5% of the variance. The present SNP strategy combined with DNA pooling and large samples represents a step towards identifying QTLs of small effect size associated with complex traits in the postgenomic era when all functional polymorphisms will be known.

AB  - This study examined strategies teachers reported using to support friendships among young children in inclusive early childhood classrooms. The teachers included 25 general early childhood educators from 9 child care centers and 20 early childhood special educators from 9 specialized programs. The Playmates and Friends Questionnaire for Teachers documented the number and nature of children's friendships and teachers' reported use of 11 different strategies to support individual friendships. Overall, the friendship strategies that teachers reported using most frequently included providing sufficient free choice time, allowing children to form their own friendships, and commenting on the play between friends. The majority of teachers reported rarely using two strategies: arranging for children to play together outside of the classroom and allowing two friends to exclude other children from their play. Teachers reported using more active friendship strategies to support dyads in which one or both children had special needs. Implications of these findings to support friendship formation in inclusive early childhood settings and directions for future research are presented.

AB  - We conducted behavior-genetic analyses of kindergarten reading, spelling, phonological awareness, rapid naming, and spoken sentence processing in 172 pairs of monozygotic and 153 pairs of same-sex dizygotic twin kindergarten children sampled in the United States and Australia. We also modeled progress from preschool to kindergarten in literacy-related variables, with larger numbers of twins contributing to the preschool phase. Reading, phonological awareness, and rapid naming at kindergarten showed substantial effects of genes and modest effects of shared environment, spelling was influenced by genes and environment equally, and sentence processing was affected primarily by shared environment. Longitudinal analyses indicated that the same genes affect phonological awareness in preschool and kinder garten but that a new genetic factor comes into play in rapid naming as letters and digits are introduced in kindergarten. At preschool, print knowledge and phonological awareness share one source of genetic influence, which in turn affects reading and spelling in kindergarten. Phonological awareness is subject to a second genetic factor, but only the one it shares with print also influences kindergarten reading and spelling. In contrast to the genetic effects, a single source of shared environment affects preschool print knowledge and phonological awareness and kindergarten reading. The results are discussed in the context of theoretical and practical issues in literacy development. Copyright © 2005, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.

AB  - Infants and toddlers the youngest and most vulnerable members of our society are more likely to experience abuse and neglect than children from any other age group. Among myriad other negative developmental outcomes, the experience of maltreatment places children at an increased risk of developing an internal working model of relationships that reflects an insecure, or a disordered attachment relationship pattern. It has been well established that maltreated children are able to develop secure attachment relationships with alternative caregivers (e.g., foster parents, family-members) and that preschool-aged maltreated children are able to develop secure attachment relationships with their childcare teachers. It has also been well established that childcare environments characterized by high levels of caregiver sensitivity, involvement, and positive emotional climate as well as low teacher-child ratios promote the development of secure attachment relationships between teachers and children. However, given the lack of early intervention in the form of therapeutic childcare services for our youngest survivors of maltreatment, the development of secure attachment relationships between maltreated infants and toddlers and their childcare teachers has yet to be investigated. Therefore, this case study of a therapeutic childcare agency for maltreated children documents attachment relationship development between maltreated infants and toddlers and their primary childcare teachers over time and describes the therapeutic childcare context in terms of structural and process quality as well as supports available to teachers. Findings support prior research that suggests that maltreated infants and toddlers, like their non-maltreated counterparts, can develop attachment relationships with their childcare teachers in the context of a childcare program characterized by teacher sensitivity, involvement, and low teacher-child ratios. Distinct trends in teacher-child attachment behavior as well as relationship patterns emerged over time. Further research is required to determine if these trends and patterns can be replicated with a larger and more diverse sample.

AB  - I denne artikkelen gis en teoretisk drøfting av forholdet mellom sosiale prestasjonsforskjeller i skolen og kognitive forskjeller. Det tas utgangspunkt i en sosiokulturell forståelse av kognitiv utvikling som fremholder at utvikling har et sosialt grunnlag. Ulike sosiale settinger skaper ulike utgangspunkt for kognitiv utvikling, og dermed også for møter med utdanningssystemet, som forutsetter bestemte kognitive ferdigheter. Forskjeller knyttet til de ulike lærings- og utviklingsarenaer unge mennesker møter bidrar slik sett til å produsere og opprettholde systematiske prestasjonsforskjeller mellom ulike grupper av elever. Tema drøftes med utgangspunkt i sosiokulturelle perspektiver, Vygotskys kulturhistoriske aktivitetsteori og Bourdieus begrep om habitus.

AB  - The purpose of the thesis is to study how mathematics is experienced and used in preschool children’s activities and how preschool teachers frame their teaching of mathematical content. The studies include analyses of children’s actions in different activities from a mathematical perspective and preschool teachers’ intentions with and their teaching of mathematics. Preschool teachers’ understanding of the knowledge required in this area is also scrutinised. The theoretical points of departure are variation theory and sociocultural theory. With variation theory the focus is directed towards how mathematical content is dealt with in teaching situations where preschool teachers have chosen the learning objects. The sociocultural perspective has been chosen because children’s mathematical learning in play often takes place in interactions with others and in the encounter with culturally mediated concepts. The theoretical framework also includes didactical points of departure. The study is qualitative, with videography and phenomenography as metholological research approaches. In the study, video observations and interviews with preschool teachers have been used as data collection methods. The results show that in children’s play mathematics consists of volume, geometrical shapes, gravity, quantity and positioning. The situations also include size, patterns, proportions, counting and the creation of pairs. The preschool teachers’ intentions, planning and staging of their goal-oriented work are that all children should be given the opportunity to discern a mathematical content. This also includes making learning objects visible in here-and-now-situations. Variation and a clear focus on the mathematical content are important in this context. One of the study’s knowledge contributions concerns the didactics of mathematics in the preschool. This relates to the teaching of mathematics and includes the knowledge that preschool teachers regard as essential for their teaching. This includes theoretical and practical knowledge about children and children’s learning and didactical issues and strategies. The conclusion is that preschool teachers need to have a basic knowledge of mathematics and the didactics of mathematics.

AB  - The aim with this paper is to discuss play as an arena for mathematical learning and children’s everyday mathematics in preschool. The study focuses on what the children are doing in the play activities and how they express their everyday mathematics. Play can be a mathematical activity (Bishop, 1992) and children’s mathematical formation in play shows their everyday mathematics (Ginsburg, 2006). This paper discusses play and everyday mathematics from a sociocultural perspective (Vygotskij, 1990) and in relation to curriculum (National Agency, 2010, 2012). The empirical data is drawn from a larger study in Sweden (Bäckman, 2015) and video observation is used as a method to explore 4 year old children’s play and everyday mathematics. The examples used in this paper were chosen because they are common play situations in the participating preschools. The ethical considerations follow the rules from The Swedish Research Council (2011). The parents have given permission for the video observations and research to be conducted. The results of the analysis of children’s mathematical formation show two main categories: Exploring mathematics through play and children comparing mathematical experiences. Exploring mathematics through play consists of five sub-categories: experiencing volume, exploring geometrical shapes, discerning weight, discerning quantity and acting for positioning. The category children comparing mathematical experiences consists of four sub-categories: experiencing and comparing size, creating and comparing patterns, comparing proportions and counting and pair production. Implications for practice is that the preschool teachers should have knowledge to design a learning environment that support children’s mathematical exploring and learning through play.

AB  - Aim and objective: To identify the influence of the culture in Canadian long‐term care facilities on the awareness of impending death and initiation of a palliative approach to care for residents aged 85 years and older. Background: Many long‐term care residents die after long, dwindling dying trajectories, yet palliative care is often not provided until within a few hours or days of death. Design: Focused ethnography. Methods Data were collected in three long‐term care facilities in south‐central Ontario, Canada, through interviews with residents, family members and staff members, observation, artefact review and a focus group. Data were analysed using a constant comparative technique. Results: Four cultural influences on the awareness of impending death and consequent initiation of a palliative approach to care were identified: (i) the care demands in long‐term care facilities and the resources available to meet these demands; (ii) the belief that long‐term care facilities are for living; (iii) the belief that no one should die in pain; and (iv) the belief that no one should die alone. Conclusions: Commonly held beliefs about the role of long‐term care facilities and what is viewed as acceptable care in them mediated the acknowledgement of dying. Late initiation of palliative care was the consequence. In addition, the contextual factors of a low staff‐to‐resident ratio and reduced staff preparation for palliative care were also influential for a delayed response to dying. Implications for practice: Because strongly held long‐term care cultural beliefs underlie care, more timely palliative care for long‐term care residents is likely to require the development of an understanding that living and dying are not dichotomous, but rather unfold together from admission until death. Enhanced staff‐to‐resident ratios and staff training on palliative care will also be necessary to permit long‐term care facility staff to focus beyond the currently expected day‐to‐day care of living residents to provide high‐quality end‐of‐life care throughout the often protracted decline to death for residents of long‐term care facilities.

AB  - In order to help children gain a more robust understanding of place value, teachers must understand the connections and relationships among the related concepts as well as possess knowledge of how children learn early number concepts. Unfortunately, teachers’ familiarity with the base-ten number system and/or lack of an understanding of multidigit whole numbers leads to instruction that encourages a superficial understanding of the concepts of our base-ten system rather than instruction that pushes students to go beyond recitation of the value of the digit in the ten's place. This study highlights the attempts of three mathematics educators in reconceptualizing and impacting teachers’ understanding of place value concepts.

AB  - The widely adopted Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM) are designed to deepen instruction of number sense and will demand that elementary school teachers have a strong understanding of number. These changes arrive at a time when it is still understood that teachers and the curriculum in the United States have not been fundamentally driven by number sense connections. Teachers, therefore, are faced with the need to reflect on their own instructional choices and to make changes in their classrooms--changes that encourage the development of number sense in their students in keeping with the demands of the CCSSM and that go beyond what they have formerly thought about number. For teachers of young students, the critical components of number sense are quantity, magnitude, numeration, different forms of a number, equality, and the language used to describe them. In this article, the authors discuss concepts that connect to the curriculum and process goals of the CCSSM and also tie directly to the Number and Operations Focal Points for prekindergartners (who should understand that number words refer to quantity) and for kindergartners (who should use numbers, including written numerals, to represent quantities). To help children understand the concrete concept that an abstract orthographic symbol represents, the authors suggest that teachers apply the same strategies they use for teaching background knowledge in reading.

AB  - The transition to school, marked by significant moves towards print literacy, is a crucial school-life milestone that can be both exhilarating and daunting. This case study, extracted from an international, quasi-ecological examination of thriving kindergarten children in transition to school films participants, their families, schools and communities during one "day in their lives". We monitored one Canadian child's transaction with her interlocutors as she negotiated a "day in her life" from arising to bedtime. All literacy-related interchanges were identified, and three exemplary exchanges were selected, analysed and contextualised, applying Cameron and Pinto's [(2009). Day in the life: Secure interludes with joint book reading. "Journal of Research in Childhood Education," 23(4), 437-449. doi:10.1080/02568540909594672] taxonomy to: one child/school-teacher, one child/music instructor and one child/parent joint text-reading transaction. Capturing her engagement in meaning-making as she experienced different expectations and interaction styles we examined the continuities/discontinuities supporting her negotiation of those experiences.

AB  - Objective: To conduct as systematic and quantitative review of research on the effects of school reentry interventions for children with chronic health conditions. Methods: This analysis examined 2 primary outcomes: increasing illness- or injury-specific knowledge among teachers or healthy peers and enhancing positive attitudinal change toward an ill or injured child. A secondary analysis examined any change in the ill or injured child's global self-worth following the intervention. A random-effects model was used in all analyses, and effect sizes were analyzed using heterogeneity tests. Results: Larger effect sizes were found for increases in knowledge than for enhancing positive attitudinal changes (i.e., mean ES for knowledge: 0.84-0.88; mean ES for positive attitudinal change: 0.68), and larger effect sizes were found for teachers than for healthy peers in both analyses. Significant heterogeneity was found between groups (i.e., teachers vs. healthy peers) and within groups in both analyses. Results of the secondary analysis indicated a medium effect for improvements in global self-worth (i.e., mean ES = 0.24). Conclusions: This analysis provides support for the effectiveness of school reentry interventions and highlights the critical need for more empirical work in this area.

AB  - This paper provides new estimates of the medium and long-term impacts of Head Start on the health and behavioral problems of its participants. We identify these impacts using discontinuities in the probability of participation induced by program eligibility rules. Our strategy allows us to identify the effect of Head Start for the set of individuals in the neighborhoods of multiple discontinuities, which vary with family size, state and year (as opposed to a smaller set of individuals neighboring a single discontinuity). Participation in the program reduces the incidence of behavioral problems, serious health problems and obesity of male children at ages 12 and 13. It also lowers depression and obesity among adolescents, and reduces engagement in criminal activities for young adults.

AB  - Forty Italian gay father families formed by surrogacy were compared with 40 Italian lesbian mother families formed by donor insemination, all with a child aged 3 to 9 years. Standardized interview, observational, and questionnaire measures of parenting quality, parent–child relationships, stigmatization, and children’s adjustment were administered to parents, children, teachers, and a child psychiatrist. The only differences across family types indicated higher levels of stigmatization as reported by gay fathers. Externalizing and internalizing problems in both groups scored within the normal range. When family structure and processes were entered together as predictors of child adjustment, a hierarchical linear model analysis showed that factors associated with children’s externalizing problems were the child’s male gender, high stigmatization, and negative parenting; children’s internalizing problems were higher in lesbian mother families and were predicted by stigmatization. Of note, neither gay fathers nor lesbian mothers tended to underestimate their children’s adjustment problems relative to teachers. Finally, for children of gay fathers, comparison between teacher SDQ ratings and teacher SDQ normative data on Italian children in a similar age range showed that teachers reported children of gay fathers to show significantly fewer internalizing problems than the normative sample. No differences in children’s externalizing problems emerged. A bootstrapping simulation confirmed all results, except the effect of stigmatization on child internalizing problems. Findings suggest that the practice of surrogacy by gay men has no adverse effects on child health outcomes. Implications for our theoretical understanding of child socialization and development, and law and social policy, are discussed.

AB  - Purpose: This article presents a rationale for specialized services personnel to use fluid models of service delivery and explains how specialized services personnel make decisions about the blend of service delivery methods that will best serve a child. Method: The literature on occupational therapy, physical therapy, and speech-language pathology service delivery in early childhood programs is reviewed, synthesized, and applied to current practice. The literature explains that direct and consultative services provide unique benefits to children and should be flexibly scheduled based on each child's current priorities. Flexible service delivery models allow therapists to meet the evolving needs of children within dynamic environments. Conclusion: To establish fluid service delivery models, therapists need to (a) plan collaboratively with teachers so that the model selected meets the teacher's preferences, (b) design flexible scheduling systems that emphasize inclusive practice, and (c) maintain precise documentation about when and how services are provided.

AB  - Examined 12 child caregivers' ability to articulate their beliefs concerning teacher practice, and personal and professional influences related to those beliefs. Found that 33 percent of teachers' rationales focused on children's socio-emotional development, 10 percent on cognitive development, and 6 percent on language development. Teachers with 4-year degrees provided twice as many cognitively-focused rationales as teachers with less education. (Author/KB)

AB  - Research Findings: The current study examined the differences in global quality between classrooms with African American teachers and European American teachers. The study included 1,687 classrooms (802 with African American teachers and 885 with European American teachers). Initial analyses revealed significant differences in overall global quality as well as on 2 factor scores: Language/Interactions and Activities/Materials. However, when an analysis of covariance was conducted controlling for numerous structural variables (i.e., level of education, years of experience in early childhood, total number of teachers in the classroom, teacher–child ratio, proportion of children on subsidy, proportion of African American children in the class, and ethnicity of the observer), no differences by race were found. Practice or Policy: Findings are discussed with regard to the contextual constraints experienced by African American teachers in preschool classrooms to create high-quality learning environments. Policy implications of classroom inequities by racial/ethnic background are examined. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

AB  - A10-yr-old male and a 13.1 yr old female with tumours of the inferior temporal (IT) cortex of the brain were studied post-surgically for their abilities to carry out a short-term memory test to assess visual and auditory short-term and procedural memory abilities. The tests involved differences in colour, number, and shape of small plastic objects; differences in receptacles where these objects should be placed and in ways in which this placement should be done; and a procedural task involving differences either in colour or in size of wooden rings employed in the task. Ss' performances were compared with those of 6 patients (aged 5.9–15.5 yrs) with vermal or hemisphere tumours and with normal controls. Ss with IT tumours spent a significantly greater amount of time than normal Ss of their age in carrying out the procedural task involving differences in colour. One of the Ss with IT tumors also spent a significantly greater amount of time in the procedural task involving size differences. Unilateral damage to IT cortex in either of the inferior temporal lobes of the brain in humans appears to produce significant deficits in procedural learning tasks involving differences in color of objects.

AB  - A study examined issues of quality in corporate-sponsored child care centers for children up to the age of 6. The study used a combination of methods, including a literature review, telephone interviews with corporations sponsoring child care centers, and visits to 12 corporate-sponsored child care centers. The findings came under the four headings of issues related to quality, discussion with experts in the field, characteristics of corporate-sponsored programs, and case studies of six corporate-sponsored programs. The study determined that the quality of a center depends largely on the staff who provide the care. Specific indicators of quality include: (1) staffing patterns--the ratio of adults to children, group sizes, staff schedules, and staff turnover; (2) staff credentials--educational background, experience, ongoing training; (3) wages and benefits for staff, which influence recruitment and retention of highly qualified staff; and (4) existence of an educational plan or philosophy that provides a framework for the teachers. Additional criteria that reflect a center's commitment to these quality indicators include licensing and accreditation, auspice (financial and legal ownership), and the operating budget allocation for staff. Contains 26 references. (TJQ) A study examined issues of quality in corporate-sponsored child care centers for children up to the age of 6.

AB  - The present study investigates how laughter features in the everyday lives of 3-5-year old children in Swedish preschools. It examines and discusses typical laughter patterns and their functions with a particular focus on childrens and intergenerational (child-adult/educator) laughter in early education context. The research questions concern: who laughs with whom; how do adults respond to childrens laughter, and what characterizes the social situations in which laughter is used and reciprocated. Theoretically, the study answers the call for sociocultural approaches that contextualize childrens everyday social interaction, e.g., in different institutions or homes, to study the diverse conditions society forms for learning, sociality, and socialization and development of shared norms. Methodologically, the study makes use of mixed methods: it uses descriptive statistics that identify prevalent patterns in laughter practices and, on the basis of these results, examines social-interactional situations of childrens laughter in detail. It was found that childrens laughter tended to be directed to children and adults laughter tended to be directed to adults. Eighty seven percent of childrens laughter was directed to other children, and adults directed their laughter to other adults 2.7 times as often as to children. The qualitative interaction analysis shows that children and adults exhibited different patterns of laughter. Children primarily sought and received affiliation through laughter in the peer group, and the adults were often focused on the institutional and educational goals of the preschool. Overall, the study shows that intergenerational reciprocal laughter was a rare occurrence and suggests that laughter between generations is interesting in that it can be seen as indicative of how children and adults handle alterity in their everyday life. By deploying multiple methods, the present study points to the importance of viewing emotion and normsharedness in social interaction not just as a matter of communicating an emotion from one person to another, but as an intricate process of inviting the others into or negotiating the common emotional and experiential ground.

AB  - Despite its current popularity in Congress, budgetary constraints dictate that future Head Start appropriations will inevitably fall short of the amount needed to provide increased access to the program and sufficient improvement of its services. Several essential questions are addressed in resolving the competing policy options as they pertain to the quantity vs quality dilemma. These are (1) Who should be served? (2) For how long? and (3) Are there threats to the quality of the program? Recommendations include increasing salary and benefits to reduce staff turnover, allocating funds to train caregivers, targeting money to guarantee that programs comply with acceptable staff–child ratios and class sizes, and providing funding to phase the Child and Family Resource Program into Head Start.

AB  - This paper reports the results of a study concerning the expectations for the transition from kindergarten to primary school amongst teachers, parents and children in Hong Kong. It probes the expectations that teachers and parents have about children's competence in five specific areas of child development thought to be essential for a smooth such transition, as well as children's competence in these different developmental areas and their performance upon the transition to primary school. The study's data were obtained through questionnaires, semi-structured interviews and classroom observations, and its results will serve as a reference for evaluation of existing transitional practices and the design of effective transition programmes in the local context. Children's voices and their observed performance during the transition period indicate that they have varied expectations of the transition. Parents, in contrast, have high expectations for their children's academic ability and self-discipline. Both primary school teachers and the parents of kindergartners rank pre-academic skills as the most important developmental area, whereas kindergarten teachers rank them as the least important. Most of the adult respondents in this study agree that a stronger connection amongst kindergartens, primary schools and parents would facilitate a smoother transition to primary school.

AB  - Identified structural features and caregivers' (CGs') characteristics associated with quality child care, based on the type of care arrangement. At age 6 mo, 576 infants were observed during 2 half-days in 5 types of nonmaternal child care (centers, child care homes, in-home sitters, grandparents, and fathers). CGs' interactions with infants were also observed. CGs provided more positive caregiving when group size and adult–child ratio (ACR) were smaller, and when CGs held nonauthoritarian child-rearing beliefs. ACR and group size were largest in centers and smallest in informal in-home care; specialized training was highest in centers. Small group size; low ACR; CGs' nonauthoritarian child-rearing belief; and a safe, clean, and stimulating physical environment were consistently associated with positive CG behaviors within each of these different types of settings.

AB  - This study estimated reading achievement gaps in different ethnic, gender, and socioeconomic groups of 1st graders in the U.S. compared with specific reference groups and identified statistically significant correlates and moderators of early reading achievement. A subset of 2,296 students nested in 184 schools from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS) kindergarten to 1st-grade cohort were analyzed with hierarchical linear models. With child-level background differences controlled, significant 1st-grade reading differentials were found in African American children (-0.51 SD units below Whites), boys (-0.31 SD units below girls), and children from high-poverty households (-0.61 to -1.0 SD units below well-to-do children). In all 3 comparisons, the size of the reading gaps increased from kindergarten entry to 1st grade. Reading level at kindergarten entry was a significant child-level correlate, related to poverty status. At the school level, class size and elementary teacher certification rate were significant reading correlates in 1st grade. Cross-level interactions indicated reading achievement in African American children was moderated by the schools students attended, with attendance rates and reading time at home explaining the variance.

AB  - The main purpose of this study was to investigate structural quality and process quality in child cares for low-income children in Pingtung County. In addition, research focus was to explore whether significant difference existed among different structural quality variables, and which structural quality variables were significantly related to the process quality. Structural quality included student/teacher ratio, group size, teachers' education level, teachers' professional training, and teachers' salary and fringe benefits. Process quality included two main parts: (1) caring and learning process quality of child cares' facilities evaluated by'-ECERS-R/FDCRS scale, including basic personal care, language quality, learning activity quality, social interaction quality, and characters needed for adulthood; (2) quality of teacher-children interaction evaluated by Arnett Scale, including positive interaction, punitiveness, tolerance, and permissiveness. Researchers used stratified random sampling technique to choose child care facilities in which low-income children enrolled from 33 towns in Pingtung County. A total of 115 child cares facilities participated in this study. Researchers used ECERS-R/FDCRS and Arnett Scale to measure child cares' process quality, and structural questionnaire to gather structural quality data. ANOVA was conducted to analyze data. The results show: (a) teachers' salary and benefits haves the strongest relationship with the process quality. The higher the teachers' level of salary and benefits, the better the process quality is; (b) teachers' welfare and educational level have an interactive effect, which has significant influences on the process quality. Discussions and suggestions related to above findings in childcare were included as well. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This report presents findings on the numbers of public school students and staff in the United States and other jurisdictions in school year 2009-10, using data from the State Nonfiscal Survey of Public Elementary/Secondary Education of the Common Core of Data (CCD) survey system. The CCD is an annual collection of data that are reported by state education agencies (SEAs) to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) through the U.S. Department of Education's ED"Facts" data collection system. Selected findings include: (1) Public elementary and secondary schools had 49.4 million students in membership in school year 2009-10 (table 1); (2) Summing across grades, there were 34.5 million students enrolled in prekindergarten through grade 8 and ungraded classes; there were 14.9 million students enrolled in grades 9-12 in the 2009-10 school year (derived from table 1); (3) When examining students for whom race/ethnicity was reported in the 2009-10 school year, 54 percent were White; 22 percent were Hispanic; 17 percent were Black; 5 percent were Asian/Pacific Islander; and 1 percent were American Indian/Alaska Native (table 2); (4) In school year 2009-10, public elementary and secondary schools and local education agencies employed a total of 6.4 million full-time-equivalent (FTE) staff (table 3); (5) Of the FTE staff in the 2009-10 school year, 51 percent were teachers; 15 percent were instructional aides, instructional coordinators and supervisors, guidance counselors/directors, or librarians; and 24 percent were student and other support staff. School or district administrators comprised 4 percent of staff, and administrative support staff comprised the remaining 7 percent (derived from table 3); (6) The student/teacher ratio in public schools in school year 2009-10 was 15.4 (i.e., there were about 15 students for every FTE teacher employed) (table 4). The ratio ranged from a high of 22.9 in Utah to a low of 10.6 in Vermont. The elementary student/teacher ratio was 19.1, while the secondary student/teacher ratio was 12.1; and (7) The category of other instructional and student support includes instructional aides, instructional coordinators and supervisors, librarians, library support, and student support services staff. In the 2009-10 school year, there were about 42.2 students for every instructional and student support staff member (table 4). Appendices include: (1) Methodology and Technical Notes; and (2) Common Core of Data Glossary. (Contains 4 tables and 4 footnotes.)

AB  - Historically, in the United States, early childhood teacher education has been a discursive space dominated by White, English-monolingual, middle class perspectives. By and large, this space has remained unexamined even as the field acknowledges the need for more early childhood teachers of color. This study seeks to gain insights into the perspectives of pre-service teachers of color as they navigate this Eurocentric space. To do so, it addresses the following question: In what ways does early childhood teacher education shape the experiences of pre-service teachers of color? By looking closely at the perspectives of four pre-service teachers of color in predominantly White private institutions of higher education in large urban centers, this study seeks to address the pressing need to illuminate the experiences of students of color in early childhood pre-service teacher education programs, especially regarding the ways in which they negotiate becoming teachers in such a normed space while battling both socially-imposed and self-internalized deficit conceptions of their own identities as individuals and developing teachers.

AB  - The digitalization of Danish daycare institutions is not only affecting the ways staff is documenting and reporting on its pedagogical work. It also appears to be redefining what pedagogical work itself is about, given the drastic increase in deployment of digital (mobile) media devices in the intergenerational interaction with as well as the intragenerational interaction among daycare children. To some extent, digital media usage, foremost of tablet computers, has seen a discursive and material normalization across a number Danish daycare institutions before at all clarifying how it could be rendered meaningful for the respective pedagogical practice. Against this background, the presentation will in particular explore what this digitalization process may entail for the aim of promoting reciprocal intergenerational communication and practice. It draws on recent work in childhood geography as well as on situated sociomaterial approaches to critical psychological practice research in order to inquire into possible specificities of digital media device usage: How is this usage similar to and different from interacting via other material-communicative devices in a pedagogical practice? How do digital media devices affect the relational spatiality of situated intergenerational communication and practice? The presentation will build on preliminary findings from an ethnographically inspired empirical pilot study in a daycare institution. It aims at prototyping a conceptual framework which assists in purposefully tackling the above questions through implementing reciprocal intergenerational communication and practice as a tool of collaborative inquiry and analysis.

AB  - Soon the author will have a new child in her classroom. Jingsong, four years old, arrived here in the United States from China only two weeks ago. Jingsong's father does not speak fluent English, Jingsong does not speak any English, and his mother lives in China. The author will be this child's first teacher in his new country, and she does not know where to start. An increasing number of teachers encounter situations like this today. Gonzalez-Mena points out that "a program can't educate or care for the child without taking the family into consideration." Furthermore, according to a national parent survey, "parents who are single, separated, or divorced are more likely than others to identify input from professionals as a major influence on parenting." It is important for teachers to support families that do not live together, no matter what the reason. This article focuses on transnational families--those from another country, with some family members living in the United States while other family members remain in the homeland--and shares practical ideas for early childhood teachers.

AB  - Background: Continuity of care (CoC) is a widely endorsed theory-based practice in center-based early childhood programs. Despite its widespread endorsement, however, there are few empirical studies of CoC or children's actual experience of care stability in infant and toddler group settings. Objective: This descriptive study investigated (1) the national percentage of EHS programs with centers implementing CoC, (2) potential differences between EHS programs with all or none of their operating centers implementing CoC, (3) the number of teacher changes children experienced during two consecutive years in EHS, as an indicator of early care stability, and (4) child and family characteristics of children having different levels of care stability during their EHS programs. Methods: Using the recently released Early Head Start Family and Child Experiences Study (Baby FACES) dataset, secondary analyses were conducted using descriptive statistics, mean difference tests, and Chi-square tests with sampling weights applied. Results: Results showed that 29% of EHS programs reported no centers implementing CoC practices within their programs, and 57% of programs reported all of their centers implemented CoC. The 57% of EHS programs implementing CoC had greater stability of their administrative staff. Results further showed that during EHS, 29 and 34% of children experienced no or one teacher change, respectively, while 37% of children experienced two to six teacher changes. Child and family characteristics were generally not associated with children's stability of care in EHS. Conclusions: CoC is not uniformly implemented across EHS programs, and many children experience multiple teacher changes in center-based EHS programs.

AB  - Schools run by Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) play a pivotal role in providing early childhood education to young children belonging to marginalized sections of Delhi. However, literature review reveals that low learning outcomes are common among children attending these schools. Low levels of learning are often associated with poor quality educational programmes. The present study was therefore undertaken in nursery, grade I and grade II of 36 randomly selected MCD schools to investigate their structural and process quality. Structural quality included infrastructure facilities like availability of drinking water and toilets, safety and cleanliness of the physical setting among others. Process quality included the experiences of the children in the school. Findings revealed that while many MCD schools had an average score on components related to structural quality, the process quality scores of the schools were below average. Significant differences were also observed in overall quality scores of grade II, grade I and nursery, with nursery scores being the highest. The decline in quality scores from nursery to grade II is a sign of decreasing quality and prevents a smooth transition of children from pre-primary to primary.

AB  - Teacher–child interactions with exceptional (i.e., mildly disabled), at-risk, and typical learners were observed in 3 inclusive K–2nd grade classrooms. Both the frequency and type of teacher and student initiations and responses were examined. Observations were conducted at the beginning, middle, and end of one entire school year and based on naturally occurring teacher–child interaction. Behaviors included teacher initiations, student initiations, and teacher responses to student initiations. Although the number of interactions between teachers and children did not change over the year, the type of interactions did change during the year in relation to child group membership. Teachers initiated more task-related interactions with exceptional children and gave them more negative feedback compared to at-risk and typical learners, but only at the beginning of the year. In the middle of the year, teachers gave significantly more negative responses to the task-related and off-task initiations of students at risk than to children with disabilities or typical learners. By the end of the year, there were no significant differences in the number or type of initiations to any of the children. Implications are discussed for the practice of including children with special needs in the general education classroom. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This paper maintains that the two basic dimensions of developmentally appropriate practice are age appropriateness and individual appropriateness. For the latter dimension, individuals' patterns of growth, personality, families, and culture are believed to be important. Teachers who use developmentally appropriate practices believe that young children learn by doing; that play is valuable in allowing the child to develop in a natural way; and that young children's methods of learning should govern the ways in which one teaches, and not vice versa. Differences between programs using developmentally appropriate practices and those using more traditional practices are discussed. In developmentally appropriate practices: (1) the learner is viewed as having developing abilities; (2) learning is viewed as a creative activity; (3) classrooms are child-centered and often use volunteers and parents to obtain low adult-student ratios; and (4) discipline usually takes the form of guidance, redirection, or prevention. In a traditional program, the learner is viewed as having measurable abilities; learning is governed by a set of principles and consists of the acquisition of a set of skills; and classrooms are teacher-centered and directed. Briefly described is a developmentally appropriate kindergarten program designed by a rural public school system in Arkansas that worked in conjunction with a local university.

AB  - Debatten om normeringer i børnehaven har bølget frem og tilbage i de seneste år. For hvor mange – eller hvor få – voksne skal der være i børnehave for at hjælpe vores børn godt på vej? Denne rapport handler om, hvordan man opgør normeringer i børnehaver – altså metoder til at bestemme forholdet mellem antal børn og voksne i børnehaver. Rapporten er en forskningsoversigt der beskriver, hvordan man har opgjort normeringen i en række forskningsprojekter om 3-6-åriges udvikling og trivsel. Undersøgelsen viser, at der er stor forskel på, hvordan man opgør normeringen: Er normeringen eksempelvis bestemt ud fra antal indskrevne børn, via et spørgeskema til forældre og ledere, eller på baggrund af observationer på en stue? Tæller studerende med i normeringen? Er der taget højde for fravær blandt personale og børn? Forskerne konkluderer derfor, at man skal være meget opmærksom, når man vælger metode til at beskrive normeringen i en børnehave. De påpeger også, at det kan være vanskeligt at sammenligne normeringer på tværs af undersøgelser. Undersøgelsen er bestilt og finansieret af Social-, Børne- og Integrationsministeriet.

AB  - Belastninger af børn og voksne viser sig bl.a. ved udskillelse af noradrenalin og især adrenalin. En svensk undersøgelse udnyttede dette faktum og kunne vise, at der skete en reduktion af børnenes stress, når man øgede antallet af voksne i børnegruppen, uden at børnetallet blev øget. Ved forskellige metoder kan man direkte måle det fysiologiske stressniveau hos et individ blandt andet gennem udsondringen af hormonerne adrenalin og noradrenalin i spyt og i urinen. I 1974 var det første gang, stressniveau på denne måde blev målt hos børn. Dette blev foretaget blandt 3-årige børnehavebørn som led i et forsøg, hvor normeringerne blev ændret eksperimentelt ved et randomiseret forsøg i en svensk børnehave (Cederblad & Höök, 1980). Undersøgelserne af børnenes adrenalinudskillelse baserede sig på omkring 6.000 urinprøver taget over 30-40 forskellige dage. Den første prøve blev taget efter middagssøvnen og ved den efterfølgende legeperiode. I forsøget blev også kontrolleret for en række andre forhold, som måtte kunne antages at have indflydelse på børnenes trivsel og udvikling. I analyserne inddrages disse faktorer blandt andet for at undersøge, om de fundne sammenhænge mellem personaletætheden (normeringen) og børnenes stressbelastninger var robuste, når man inddrog andre faktorer som fx gruppestørrelse, belastninger i hjemmet og personalets indbyrdes relationer.

Attitudes changed toward favorable agreement with the following proposals: (a) Modification of class routines is necessary to accommodate integration. (b) Similar instructional competencies are effective with both normal and exceptional children. (c) All exceptional children in a particular category will not necessarily respond in concert to a particular educational methodology. (d) Staff insight will not necessarily enable a child to respond with the parameters of normalcy. (e) Physically impaired children are not necessarily easier to accommodate than mentally impaired children. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Ninety children from South Korea and 119 children from the United States were observed in early childhood programs, and differences in classroom environments and teachers' and children's behavior in the two countries were identified. In both countries, there was evidence that preschool education is guided by ideas about "developmentally appropriate practice". However, in Korea, education was also influenced by Asian values. In line with developmentally appropriate practice, in the U.S. child-teacher ratios were lower, teachers were more personally involved with individual children, more opportunities for peer interaction were provided, there were more varied materials for gross motor activities and sociodramatic play, and children were judged to be more socially competent and to have fewer emotional and behavior problems. In Korea, teachers expressed more traditional attitudes toward educational practices, children spent more time in skills and drills, there were more varied materials for math and music, children exhibited greater self-reliance and sustained attention, and the classroom climate was more harmonious.

AB  - Nonprofit child care centers are frequently observed to produce child care which is, on average, of higher quality than care provided in commercial child care centers. In part, this nonprofit advantage is due to different input choices made by nonprofit centers—lower child-staff ratios, better-educated staff and directors, higher rates of professional development for staff. Nonprofit centers may have an additional productivity advantage, due to unmeasured staff motivation and abilities or to better management of the production of good-quality child care. However, where nonprofit and for-profit child care firms compete in the same local markets, we speculate that this extra advantage should only appear where demand is sufficiently "thick" to permit a quality differentiation strategy to be financially viable for nonprofits. We estimate the effect of nonprofit status on quality, controlling for differences in financial resources available to the center, differences in the clientele served, and differences in staff and center inputs. In this conventional examination, nonprofit status has a moderately positive impact on quality. However, when we account for the unobserved heterogeneity and separate markets into "thick" and "thin," a particularly strong nonprofit advantage is found in thick markets, but no productivity advantage for nonprofits is found in thin markets. This finding suggests a clear role for nonprofit organizations in improving the cost-quality trade-off faced by parents, but also identifies the market conditions that affect the ability of nonprofit managers to employ this advantage.

AB  - States have accumulated considerable experience in operating publicly sponsored pre-kindergarten programs. In spite of this extensive experience, only fragmentary accounts exist of how these pre-kindergarten (pre-k) programs handle issues such as program intensity, location, staffing, and population served. These issues are addressed by the National Center for Early Development and Learning's Multi-State Study of Pre-Kindergarten, which collected data from 240 programs. Data were weighted to represent the 4 states (Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Ohio) and each of the 2 regions in California and New York from which they were drawn. Using these weighted data, we estimate that slightly more than half of these school-related programs were part-day and slightly more than half were located outside of school buildings. Although these programs varied in process quality, on average, they met National Association for the Education of Young Children recommended standards for class size, adult:child ratios, and teacher certification. The programs served an ethnically, linguistically, and economically diverse population of children, although about half of pre-k children were from low-income backgrounds. African American, Asian, and Latino children were more likely than White children to attend a pre-k class with a high proportion of children from low-income backgrounds. Issues of process quality were highlighted in the study. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

AB  - The objective of the study was to investigate kindergarten teachers' efficacy beliefs in classroom management. The sample size was 299 teachers drawn from both public and private kindergarten schools in the Kumasi Metropolis of Ghana. The efficacy beliefs of the teachers with respect to their classroom management practices were measured on a six-point Likert agreement survey questionnaire. Findings from the study indicated that kindergarten teachers in the study area had high efficacy beliefs in classroom management practices. No statistically significant difference was found in the efficacy beliefs in classroom management practices of trained and untrained kindergarten teachers, and of public and private kindergarten teachers. The study drew the conclusion that the professional status of the teachers (i.e. whether they were trained or untrained) and their institutional placement (i.e. whether they taught in a public or private school) were not important influential factors in the teachers' efficacy beliefs in classroom management. Recommendations for early childhood teacher education programme and research are made.

AB  - Reviews the book, An Introduction to Child Study by Ruth Strang (1930). The author's difficulty in finding a non-technical, accurate, and readable book for persons interested in child study led her to publish this one--"a panorama of childhood from birth through adolescence" which aims to serve both as a handbook for parents and parent-study clubs and as a text for an orientation course in child study, whether for advanced high-school or college students, nursery-school teachers, normal schools, or nurses' training schools. Other books on child study, however excellent, have failed to meet all the needs of these individuals in ways which Strang avoids by organizing her material around stages of development rather than topics; by omitting technical or theoretical discussion; by treating the entire period of childhood; by supplying specific details and concrete illustrative situations; and by emphasizing the process of normal development and not problems and the problem child. Throughout the book discussions, even when briefly and pointedly given, are nowhere seriously inadequate. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Numerous evacuation models are now able to represent populations with different movement abilities. However, this representation is not always supported by empirical data; i.e. the functionality can occasionally overreach the empirical support for it. The goals of this work are: (1) to provide data that adds to the understanding and quantification of vulnerable population’s evacuation performance, and (2) to provide sufficiently detailed and transparent data-sets for model configuration and validation. Data was collected during five evacuations from the same school, conducted between 2011 and 2014. Children from 4 to 16years old were involved in these drills. Four of the evacuations were unannounced, while one was semi-announced (i.e. staff were aware that the drill would be conducted on a particular day). In addition to the initial scenario conditions (e.g. the building geometry, population, procedures employed, etc.), a number of different performance data-sets were collected: pre-evacuation times, travel speeds, route use and evacuation arrival curves. Through the provision of detailed architectural diagrams and other initial conditions and raw data/analysis describing evacuee performance it is hoped that this data-set will be used in the development of evacuation models and their application. The limitations in the data collection and analysis process are outlined allowing the modeler to identify where issues might arise and take corrective actions where possible.

AB  - Background: There is growing evidence that linguistic and non-linguistic factors may contribute to the problems associated with specific language impairment (SLI). One factor that has been implicated is executive functioning (EF). Most studies investigating EF in children with SLI use performance based tasks. Significant group differences in children with SLI are reported on the following components of EF: inhibition, working memory, planning and fluency, although not on the ‘shifting’ component. Correlations between performance based measurements of EF and ratings of everyday EF behaviours are often low. It is possible that standardised tests are not sufficiently sensitive to the multidimensional nature of EF. Therefore it is suggested that information on EF should be collected in different contexts and from different sources using behavioural ratings, like the Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) for children. Methods and procedures: A clinical sample of 237 school aged children, aged 5–12 years, (157 boys, 80 girls) with SLI participated in this study. Behavioural and cognitive measures of EF were administered: the BRIEF-questionnaire, assessing everyday EF behaviour in a home and school setting and two EF tasks: Digit span (WISC-III-NL) and Creature Counting (TEA-Ch). Outcomes and results: Compared to the normative sample the prevalence of EF problems in school in children with SLI is much higher than in the normal population. Teachers reported significantly more problems on almost all EF domains (i.e. Inhibition, Shifting, Emotional control, Initiate, Working memory, Plan/organise, and Monitor), except organisation of materials. Working memory and Initiate are the most impaired, since more than one third of the children had scores in the clinical range on these scales. Compared to the normative sample parents scored significantly more working memory problems. MANOVA-analyses showed developmental and gender differences on EF behaviour in school. Overall, older children had less problems in EF behaviours than younger children and boys showed more problems than girls. Like others we found low correlations between behavioural and cognitive measures ( r = 0.20). Conclusions: School aged children with SLI show substantial impairments in everyday EF behaviour in a classroom setting. Almost one third of the children scored in the clinical range on the Metacognition Index. Our findings replicate low correlations between performance based and behavioural based measures on EF. These findings indicate the importance of expanding EF assessment with behavioural measures in clinical practice for children with SLI.

AB  - The quality of classroom interactions has typically been studied using aggregates of ratings over time. However, within-day ratings may contain important variability. This study investigated within-day variability using the NICHD Study of Early Childcare and Youth Development's observational data during grades 3 and 5. The first question examined the stability of classroom interaction quality within a day, and the second question examined the extent to which time of day, activity setting, numbers of adults and children, and instructional grouping predicted the quality of classroom interactions within a day. Results indicated that classroom interactions were most stable within emotional support dimensions and least stable within instructional support dimensions. Results also indicated that the start of the day and transitions were associated with lower-quality classroom interactions. Academic activities, more teachers, fewer students, and group instruction were associated with higher quality. Implications are discussed in terms of understanding students' experiences and conducting classroom observations. (Contains 1 figure, 5 tables, and 1 note.)

AB  - Discusses the current provision and effectiveness of day care services for people with dementia. Dementia-focused daycare centers developed in response to local initiatives from the voluntary sector. The main aim of these centers is the provision of social care, stimulation and company to attenders and support and respite to carers. These centers were found to be run only 1 or 2 days a week in unsuitable premises borrowed from other organizations. Staff did not have formal qualifications relevant to their work, although staff training was normally provided. Caring for dementia is a complex process having determinants which include social and economic characteristics of the caregiver, nature and magnitude of the care required, role strains including interpersonal conflict, coping style and social support. These day care centers improve mood and well being and reduce the risk of other psychiatric morbidity associated with dementia. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Reports that 14 20-50 yr old institutional aides' perceptions of the attractiveness, likability, and mental level of 37 5-15 yr old retarded residents were related to the affective tone, content, and frequency of aide-resident interactions. Residents who were seen favorably on these attitudinal dimensions tended to receive more positive, more social, and more overall interactions with aides, as measured by reliable behavioral observations on the ward. Suggestions for research on contingency training and staff-patient ratios, as well as implications for inservice programs, are discussed.

Økonomisk velstående kommuner har typisk lidt højere personalenormeringer. Mens det ser ud til, at normeringen i institutionerne er nogenlunde den samme i kommuner med mange sårbare børn som i kommuner med få sårbare børn.

AB  - Studied the judgments of Dutch preschool teachers about the desirable basic vocabulary of children before, during, and after preschool, and determined the reliability and validity of these assessments. Ss included 80 normal Dutch adults (preschool teachers). Ss ranked the individual words in a list of 2,585 Dutch words according to the time by which a preschool child should have mastered the understanding and use of the word. Results were analyzed to determine the consistency of the responses. Convergent validity with an existing list of desirable vocabulary for preschoolers and with the results of a study of the actual vocabulary of preschoolers was determined.

AB  - In this paper, we synthesize two bodies of work related to students' representational activities: the notions of meta-representational competence and representation as a form of practice. We report on video analyses of kindergarten and first-grade students as they create representations of pollination in a science classroom, as well as summarize results from interviews regarding the design choices that they made. Analysis of the semistructured pre- and postinterviews reveals that students attend to the content domain, local activity, and their personal preferences when evaluating representations. Analysis of video case studies that followed the students as they created their representations further reveals several key mediators of the students' representational activities, including other students, task constraints, the teacher, and local norms for what constituted a "good representation." In addition, the data show that these norms shifted over time as new content was covered in the class, and were appropriated in interaction with other students. Finally, both sets of analyses reveal that students often face competing constraints when creating their representations, and resolve these constraints through a complex set of negotiations.

AB  - The perinatal and neonatal mortality rates in South Africa are inappropriately high. In order to support an improvement in the standard of neonatal care in the hospitals in Area 2 KZN a Neonatal Experiential Learning Site (NELS) was created. Run by a full time coordinator, it consists of a centralized two week learning block and an outreach support and teaching programme. Thus far there has been improved staff morale, increasing awareness by hospitals of the need to improve neonatal care, improved communication and collaboration between doctors and nurses and improved quality of care. Unfortunately numbers accessing NELS training are inconsistent often including junior staff unable to implement change without senior support. Rapid turnover of staff limits sustainability of change. Ongoing poor staff patient ratios decrease the effectiveness of outreach visits and the ability of staff to implement quality improvement. Ongoing support is imperative to ensure sustainable change. It is crucial for a senior nurse/doctor permanently employed in neonatal care to drive the quality improvement process in each hospital. Support from management is vital. Close liaison with Provincial departments will ensure standardization. Accreditation of neonatal units will encourage compliance with the norms and standards set.

AB  - The overarching interest of this licentiate thesis is directed towards values as they are discursively constructed in systematic quality work in preschool. The aim of the study is to contribute with knowledge about the values discursively expressed in systematic quality work in preschool and how these can, in turn, be understood in relation to current quality work contexts. Values, as understood in the study, are assumptions about something good, desirable and worth aiming at and are seen as socially constructed in a specific societal, cultural and historical context. Discourse can be interpreted as a certain way of talking about and understanding values where language represents a specific meaning context.Fairclough’s critical discourse analysis has been applied to critically examine and make visible what values and discourses are expressed in the systematic quality work in preschool, as well as their mutual relations. In addition, Ball’s performativity concept has been used. The empirical material consists of 17 preschools’ documented systematic quality work in the form of evaluations conducted during the 2014-2015 school year.The value practice emerging from the analysis of the evaluations carries a complexity in that values appear to overlap and may thus be hard to separate. Values are both explicitly and implicitly expressed. What is highlighted as desirable can be categorized within five areas: competence, democracy, ethics, disciplination and efficiency.The result shows that a goal rational, a market-oriented, a relational, a morally oriented and a development psychology discourse are included in the order of discourse that exercises power over the values that are expressible and over the way this is done. The analysis clearly demonstrates the predominance of the goal rational discourse, while the influence of the development psychology discourse seems to be limited with regard to what is considered desirable in the organization. It also emerges that there is a power structure where the goal rational and the market-oriented discourses seem to include and articulate the other discourses within the order of discourse.In a long-time perspective, preschool activities appear to have passed from development psychology rationality to goal rationality. For preschool children this transformation may have entailed that currently the strongly emphasized welfare aspect of the organization tends towards a strong emphasis on competence. These values stand out in the evaluations as two opposite poles, which may indicate a swing of the pendulum from one side to the other.

AB  - Four popular child care (CHC) settings are family day care homes, care centers, relative care, and in-home care by nonrelatives. Quality indicators in CHC include curriculum that features child-centered developmental activities; responsive, sensitive, and affectionate caregivers; limited group size; low adult–child ratio; staff training and stability; parent involvement; and comprehensive social services such as health and nutrition. Children from low-income families who have received CHC have shown short-term cognitive effects; long-term cognitive effects; and social-emotional effects. Research indicates that CHC may enhance social and intellectual development for middle class children as well as disadvantaged children. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Customer loyalty programs are largely present in the private sector and have been elaborately studied. Applications from the private sector have found resonance in a public setting, however, simply extrapolating research results is not acceptable, as their rationale inherently differs. This study focuses on data from a loyalty program issued by the city of Antwerp (Belgium). The aim of the loyalty card entails large citizen participation, however, an active user base of only 20% is reached. Predictive techniques are employed to increase this number. Using spatial behavioral user information, a Naive Bayes classifier and a Support Vector Machine are used which result in models capable of predicting whether a user will actively use its card, whether a user will defect in the near future and which locations a user will visit. Also, a projection of spatial behavioral data onto even more fine-grained spatio-temporal data is performed. The results are promising: the best model achieves an AUC value of 92.5%, 85.5% and 88.12% (averaged over five locations) for the predictions, respectively. Moreover, as behavior is modeled in more detail, better predictions are made. Two main contributions are made in this study. First, as a theoretical contribution, fine-grained behavioral data contributes to a more sound decision-making process. Second, as a practical contribution, the city of Antwerp can now make tailored strategic decisions to increase its active user base.

AB  - This study investigated the quantity of audible and intelligible ('near and clear') educator talk directly experienced by under-two-year-old infants attending early childhood education and care (ECEC) programmes and examined whether the quantity of educator talk was related to characteristics of quality in their ECEC room. Participants were 57 infants attending separate infant rooms in and around the Sydney metropolitan area, Australia. Each infant was observed for 3 h, wearing a small, custom-designed digital language processor (DLP) which digitally recorded and generated measures of 'near and clear' adult talk, unclear talk and infant vocalisations. Structural quality indicators include educator qualification, group size and educator-infant ratios, and Interaction Quality was assessed using the ITERS-R Interaction and Listening and Talking subscales. Infants' experience with 'near and clear' talk was predicted by Interaction Quality, the presence of a degree-qualified teacher and group size. 'Near and clear' talk was also significantly and positively related to the quantity of infant vocalisation and, negatively, to their level of exposure to unclear talk. Findings are discussed in terms of conceptualisations of quality in infant ECEC rooms, as well as the potentials and limitations of the 'near and clear' talk measure for use in future studies of language development in this context.

AB  - Although "top-down" indicators, such as the ratio of adults to children in classrooms and program rankings based on standardized test scores, can predict some of the future impact of children's education, "bottom-up" factors, such as whether children feel welcome and whether they find the learning activities to be meaningful and engaging, may have a greater effect on children's long-term development. Yet little is known about children's perceptions of their schools and how their views may differ depending on the type and quality of schools they attend. In the present study, three methods--interview, autophotography, and picture selection--were employed to learn about children's perceptions of their schools and whether their perspectives differed depending on whether they attended schools labeled "successful" or "unsuccessful." The 156 participants in kindergarten to fifth grade (ages 5 to 11) were interviewed about their school experiences. In the context of making books about their schools, children took photographs that they felt would show others what the schools were like. They also selected photographs from a standardized set of other photographs--one they thought "best showed" their school and one that showed what was "most important" to them. The following were among the results: (1) Participants at the unsuccessful school were more likely to identify school as being about academics and evaluation/tests and less about play/fun, especially in the early grades. (2) The importance of friendships was more evident among children at the successful school than among children at the unsuccessful school. (3) Among participants from both schools, the pictures that children selected that "best showed" their school usually differed from what was "most important" to them.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to comparatively examine the student-teacher relationships of preschool children with and without special needs (SN) and to identify the variables which predict student-teacher relationships. In order to collect data from 40 preschool teachers regarding 54 students with and 54 students without SN, the Student and Teacher Information Form (developed by the researchers), the Student-Teacher Relationship Scale, and the Preschool and Kindergarten Behavior Scale (for the validity and reliability studies) were used. The student-teacher relationships of students in the two groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney U-test, and the variables predicting student-teacher relationships were analyzed using stepwise regression. The results showed that students with SN had more conflict (U = 1034.50; p = 0.009) and less closeness (U = 982.50; p = 0.003) with their teachers than their peers without SN, however, there was not a significant difference between the two groups in terms of dependency (U = 1362.50; p = 0.556). It was found that social skills predicted closeness with teachers, conflictual student-teacher relationships were predicted by problem behaviors, and dependent student-teacher relationships were predicted by teacher experience and classroom size. The findings of this study are discussed in line with the national and international literature.

AB  - Examined the concepts employed by 100 normal children in kindergarten-Grade 4 (Study 1), and by 48 retarded vs 48 normal children matched for mental ages ranging from 5 to 11 yrs (Study 2). Ss were required to select pairs of pictures from a large array of pictures depicting common objects and to explain the basis for their pairing responses. Factor analysis of the conceptual responses of normal Ss revealed factors for abstraction (nominal and functional concepts as opposed to perceptible concepts) and complimentarity ("go together" responses as opposed to similarity responses). Retarded Ss differed from normals primarily in their use of more complimentary and fewer similarity concepts. The developmental course of concept utilization for normals was characterized as a change from perceptible to nominal and functional concepts, while that for retarded Ss was characterized as a change from complimentary to similarity concepts.

AB  - Investigated whether patterns of cortisol production in preschool-aged children in group care were influenced by characteristics such as group size, adult:child ratio, separation from family/parents, and quality of attention and stimulation from the childcare provider. Data were obtained from 21 preschoolers aged 40–69 mo attending home-based childcare. Cortisol levels were sampled at home and at childcare. Parents and teachers assessed the Ss' temperament. At childcare, Ss were observed using the Observational Ratings of the Caregiving Environment. Childcare characteristics were independent of family or child characteristics. In home-based childcare, Ss cortisol patterns over the day correlated significantly with the amount of attention and stimulation provided by the childcare provider. At home Ss' exhibited the expected decrease in cortisol from morning to afternoon. Patterns of cortisol production at childcare were also correlated with child temperament with larger increases from morning to afternoon for more emotionally negative children and those with less self-control. Finally, cortisol production in home-based childcare was compared to data from children in center-based childcare and children not enrolled in full-day childcare.

AB  - Describes 2 questionnaires and their validation-a childhood personality scale, an instrument for reporting on a child's general personality and competence; and a parent's report, an instrument designed to measure a parent's perception of his or her own parental style in relation to a particular child. The measures were developed in the context of an epidemiological survey of personality development in twin children during the 1st 6 yrs of life. Test-retest and validity data from parents of 20 sets of twins, parents of 20 singleton children, parents of twins followed in the longitudinal study for whom other data were available, 5 nursery-school teachers, parents of 60 normal and behaviorally disturbed pediatric inpatients, and parents of over 400 sets of twins in the epidemiological survey are presented for both the parent report and the children's personality scale. The uses of these instruments in various research settings are noted. (26 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study developed a typology of recommended teacher practices related to whole-group instruction in preschool classrooms and examined the relationship between teachers’ use of the practices and children’s attentiveness. Thirty-nine classrooms in 31 schools (15 public and 16 private) were observed during regularly scheduled whole-group instruction sessions. Bivariate correlations indicated a positive relationship between children’s attentiveness and number of practices that teachers used, but not between attentiveness and length of activity. Regression analyses suggested a set of eight specific practices that are related, with length of activity, to children’s attentiveness.

AB  - Compared the learning of 16 male and 16 female kindergartners and 16 male and 16 female 2nd graders under 2 conditions of discrimination transfer. Each S learned 3 consecutive discrimination problems. The same stimuli, which varied in size and brightness, were employed in all problems. 1 dimension was relevant and the other was irrelevant and variable within trials on each problem. Problem 2 was an extradimensional shift from Problem 1, and Problem 3 was another extradimensional shift from Problem 2. Problem 3 was either the same as or a reversal of Problem 1. Kindergartners learned faster under the same than under the reversal condition. Condition differences were absent for 2nd graders. Results suggest that kindergartners extinguish mediating responses faster than instrumental choice responses, while the reverse probably holds with 2nd graders.

AB  - Proponents of class size reductions (CSRs) draw heavily on the results from Project Student/Teacher Achievement Ratio to support their initiatives. Adding to the political appeal of these initiative are reports that minority and economically disadvantaged students received the largest benefits from smaller classes. We extend this research in two directions. First, to address correlated outcomes from the same class size treatment, we account for the over-rejection of the Null hypotheses by using multiple inference procedures. Second, we conduct a more detailed examination of the heterogeneous impacts of CSRs on measures of cognitive and non-cognitive achievement using more flexible models. We find that students with higher test scores received greater benefits from CSRs. Furthermore, we present evidence that the main effects of the small class treatment are robust to corrections for the multiple hypotheses being tested. However, these same corrections lead the differential impacts of smaller classes by race and free-lunch status to become statistically insignificant. (Contains 25 notes, 7 tables, and 2 figures.)

AB  - Reports an error in "Neural correlates of spontaneous deception: A functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) study" by Xiao Pan Ding, Xiaoqing Gao, Genyue Fu and Kang Lee ( Neuropsychologia, 2013[Mar], Vol 51[4], 704-712). In the original article, there was an error in the the affiliation of one of the authors. The corrected affiliation of the author is present in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2013-09212-015). Deception is commonly seen in everyday social interactions. However, most of the knowledge about the underlying neural mechanism of deception comes from studies where participants were instructed when and how to lie. To study spontaneous deception, we designed a guessing game modeled after Greene and Paxton (2009) " Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 106(30), 12506–12511", in which lying is the only way to achieve the performance level needed to end the game. We recorded neural responses during the game using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). We found that when compared to truth-telling, spontaneous deception, like instructed deception, engenders greater involvement of such prefrontal regions as the left superior frontal gyrus. We also found that the correct-truth trials produced greater neural activities in the left middle frontal gyrus and right superior frontal gyrus than the incorrect-truth trials, suggesting the involvement of the reward system. Furthermore, the present study confirmed the feasibility of using NIRS to study spontaneous deception. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Discusses the importance of emotional reciprocity-the child's ability to give of himself unselfishly-in successful family relationships. Children lacking this ability are emotionally draining, and incur rejection. They require institutional care in which a number of staff members interact with them. Reciprocity should be the treatment goal, and reinforced, but behavioral conformity may be the only goal possible with severely damaged children. Children who develop reciprocity may be placed in foster or group homes, and those who do not may be successfully placed in situations where conformity is sufficient, such as the military.

AB  - Discusses individual, contextual, organizational, and psychological factors associated with burnout among day care and nursery school teachers. Among organizational factors associated with burnout are role ambiguity, role conflict, the amount and complexity of required work, excessive hours of work, number of children per teacher, the absence of breaks, the absence of feedback, the centralization of authority, work conditions, and lack of decision-making power. Contextual factors include direct contact with children, the socioeconomic status (SES) of the child and his or her parents, the teacher's salary, and high performance standards. Individual factors include sociodemographic variables, personality traits, psychological dispositions (such as locus of control and motivation), and coping strategies. A model relating these factors to psychological stress and burnout is presented. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This randomized intervention trial examined the effects of yearly Family Check-Ups (FCUs) and tailored parent management training on parent report of problem behavior from age 2 to 5 years and teacher report of oppositional behavior at age 7.5. A multiethnic risk sample of 731 families in 3 distinct geographical settings who were receiving assistance from the Women, Infants, and Children Nutritional Supplement (WIC) program were randomly assigned to a yearly FCU. Intention to treat (ITT) analyses were used to examine overall intervention effects, and complier average causal effect (CACE) modeling was used to examine the effects of annual intervention engagement in the FCU on parent reports of child problem behavior from age 2 to 5 and teacher reports of problem behavior at age 7.5. ITT intervention effects were found regarding parent report at ages 2 to 5 and teacher report at age 7.5, indicating less growth in problem behavior for children in the intervention group than for those in the control group. CACE modeling of intervention engagement revealed that the effect sizes on parent- and teacher-reported problem behavior increased as a function of the number of yearly FCUs caregivers participated in. Findings suggest that embedding yearly FCU services within the context of social, health, and educational services in early childhood can potentially prevent early-onset trajectories of antisocial behavior. The increases in effect size with successive FCU engagement underscores the importance of a motivational approach to parenting support among high-risk families.

AB  - Group size and treatment intensity are understudied topics in mathematics intervention research. This study examined whether the treatment intensity and overall intervention effects of an empirically validated Tier 2 mathematics intervention varied between intervention groups with 2:1 and 5:1 student-teacher ratios. Student practice opportunities and the quality of explicit instruction served as treatment intensity metrics. A total of 465 kindergarten students with mathematics difficulties from 136 intervention groups participated. Results suggested comparable performances between the 2:1 and 5:1 intervention groups on six outcome measures. Observation data indicated that student practice differed by group size. Students in the 5:1 groups received more opportunities to practice with their peers, while students in the 2:1 groups participated in more frequent and higher quality individualized practice opportunities. Implications in terms of delivering Tier 2 interventions in small-group formats and engaging at-risk learners in meaningful practice opportunities are discussed.

AB  - Examined the association between kindergarten-level child care quality and legislated requirements regarding staff-to-child ratio and staff training, across eight Canadian provinces. Found that classrooms in provinces with the highest requirements for staff education levels had the highest quality ratings. Association between staff to child ratio and regulatory requirements was not as consistent. (JPB)

AB  - This article is a summary of the research carried out in relation to the experiences of asylum-seeking and refugee families regarding access and participation in local childcare services. Focus groups and interviews were carried out with 16 refugee and asylum-seeking parents, five childcare practitioners, and two support and development staff in a small, mainly rural county, in the northwest of Ireland. Following a review of the literature in relation to social networks, social capital and social support, the research was designed to establish the perceptions of service users as well as service providers. The findings showed that levels of isolation experienced by both refugee and asylum-seeking families, largely because of current policy provisions, had a significant impact on their ability to develop informal supports networks in their host community. Families found that the formal and informal networks provided through childcare services were sources of valuable support. Both service users and staff identified a number of challenges in meeting various needs and in providing culturally responsive services. Challenges identified by service users came from their living experiences in the direct provision system, and social exclusion experienced by both asylum-seeking and refugee families, such as the cost of childcare and isolation. Communication and language barriers present as a significant challenge for both service users and service providers.

AB  - The dialogs of regular classroom teachers with 12 learning-disabled (LD) students and 12 classmates in Grades K–2 were recorded, and initiations were coded into 3 categories: content of instruction, behavior management, and social overture. Teachers initiated conversation more frequently with LD Ss than with controls. The majority of teacher initiations to LD Ss involved behavior management, primarily in response to inattentiveness and rule infraction. LD Ss did not differ from classmates in the overall frequency of initiations to teacher; however, their initiations were more often situationally inappropriate. Teacher initiations to LD Ss pertaining to the monitoring of instruction, inattention, and rule infraction occurred more often in whole-class seatwork as opposed to small-group settings. Results are interpreted in light of other evidence linking the frequency of teacher–child interaction to poor achievement, as well as to teacher perceptions of LD students.

AB  - Sweden has recently adopted a national curriculum for preschool (Utbildningsdepartementet, 1998a) and a revised curriculum for school (6-16 years of age) (Utbildningsdepartementet, 1998b). Both curricula have the same structure in form of goals, that is, what education is expected to contribute to the development of children. This means that Sweden has adopted the life-long-learning perspective, also seen in other countries' curricula (see e.g. New Zealand, Ministry of Education, 1998). In Sweden life-long-learning is a distinguished perspective focused on learning as such, but also as a means to a solid base of values and norms. In addition, the content in terms of qualities (or skills) and an understanding of different aspects of the surrounding world is a common thread woven througout the entire school system, although on different levels of complexity. This perspective on learning is based on the idea that "formation of knowledge is an internal relation between the child and the world around him/her” (Marton, 1994). This implies that every child's earlier experiences are used as a foundation for developing a broader and deeper understanding of the specific content dealt with in school-based education. The child's earlier experiences also guide how the child experiences the educational setting, the teacher's role, what is expected of him- or herself, how to accomplish specific tasks, how to interact socially, etc. Knowledge formation therefore is both content and context dependent and formed from clearly defined perspectives, values and the content of early childhood education, if it is to be benificial to the child's life-long-learning process (Pramling, 1990, 1994; Doverborg & Pramling, 1995; Doverborg & Pramling Samuelsson, 1999, manuscript). Implied in this perspective is how young children learn – by being active with their bodies and minds and through communication with peers and teachers. Children experience the world emotionally, socially and cognitively, simultaneously. Therefore the early years lay the critical foundation for the child's interests, for example in mathematics, the value of working in this area, ability to make sense of the topic, and the child's feeling of competence within this topic (Lundgren, 1979). Because of this, the system of education must learn from children and from what they seem to be most devoted to – and that is play – the child's individual realm to be scientifically explored (Pramling Samuelsson, 1999). The characteristics of play, such as joy, freedom, spontaneity, symbolism, communication, engagement and sociability, should be factors that also guide learning in early years. If these factors guide education the child's intention to create meaning from experiences result in confidence and learning opportunities. If this perspective to learning and knowledge formation is accepted, then play serves an important role both before and during school-based education. The goals specifically related to mathematics in the Swedish curriculum for 1–5-year olds states that "The preschool should try to ensure that children develop the ability to discover and use mathematics in meaningful contexts and situations, and develop their appreciation of the basic characteristics of the concept of numbers, measurement and form, as well as the ability to orient themselves in time and space" (Utbildningsdepartementet, 1998a, p. 12). The above perspective of learning and the goals described from the Swedish curriculum provide the bases for the study presented in this article, however, a more narrow description of the approach to learning adopted in the studied group follows in the next section.

AB  - In a group of children, aged 2:7 - 3:1 years, the teachers have systematically been working with developing the children's conception of numbers. In the group there are eight children who are all extraordinary fascinated by stars. The teacher takes this fascination as a starting point to develop the children's conception of numbers. She makes cards with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 stars on. The cards are sorted with regard to the numbers of stars and kept in a box with five compartments, one for each number. When the group is gathered the teacher lets the children choose one "star-card" each, which they are asked to put up on a board together with their name. The teacher works with the children in steps which have partly been developed with regard to the children's comments. The children are invited to take a star-card with a pattern which they think is nice. Further, they are invited to match cards with the same number of stars and to count the stars on their cards. The children are also asked to compare the length of the rows of cards and to work out how many cards there are in the different rows. They are also asked to pick a card with a given number of stars. This article demonstrates how the work was carried out and how the children think and how they handle the different parts of the content. When the work is finished, another group of children of the same age is interviewed and the two different groups are compared with regard to the children's conception of numbers.

AB  - Examined the effects of Kinder Training on selected kindergarten and first grade students' behavior, social skills, and early literacy skills, as well as its effects on teacher behavior in the classroom. Kinder Training involves the teacher in play sessions with a child who is exhibiting discouragement in the classroom. The participants in this study included 7 kindergarten teachers, 4 kindergarten paraprofessionals, 3 first grade teachers, and their 14 selected students (median age 5 yrs, 9 mo). The teacher conducts play sessions while receiving supervision from a counselor, learning skills that are both appropriate for the playroom and valuable for the classroom. As a result of the play sessions, the teacher–student relationship is enhanced, the student feels more encouraged in the classroom, and the teacher transfers the newly obtained skills to his or her work with other students. This transfer included an increase in facilitative statements, encouragement, and limit-setting. Additionally, the teachers decreased the number of praise statements and ineffective limit-setting. The results suggest that Kinder Training is an effective intervention for struggling students and a successful proactive approach for teacher skill development.

AB  - This doctoral thesis centres on six children, aged four to nine, who relatively recently immigrated to Sweden. The children’s encounters with literacy are in focus. These children are not only new arrivals to Sweden, they also have in common that Swedish is their second language and that their parents have had little or no formal education prior to arriving in Sweden. The study draws on sociocultural approaches to literacy, and more specifically the field of New Literacy Studies. In this study, reading and writing are viewed as social practices comprising different related sociocultural aspects such as norms, values, habits, traditions and ideologies, and the study concentrates on social and ideological perspectives on literacy. Bourdieu’s notions of habitus and symbolic capital have also been used for the analysis. The empirical material was collected through an ethnographic approach. Each child was followed for one year, particularly at school/preschool. The children’s homes were also visited, and their parents and teachers were interviewed. Observations involved different degrees of participation and were documented through field notes and photographs. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed. In addition, artefacts and school material from the field were collected or photographed. A qualitative content analysis of the collected data was performed. The analysis show that sociocultural incongruence, coupled with flawed communication between the schools and the homes, caused the children less continuity between school and home practices. Though, the results also show, that the children studied to a considerable extent adapted to the monolingual, homogenous norms when they participated in school practices. These children are therefore highly adaptable, while their teachers found it much harder to handle or even be aware of sociocultural incongruences.

AB  - Assessed the effects of (1) type of contract under which staff members are employed, (2) length of duty, and (3) number of staff members present in the living group in relation to staff members' distribution of activities and quality of care. For over 40 wks, data were collected on 30 ward staff members (aged 20–45 yrs) who were responsible for 39 residents (aged 3.75–34 yrs) with severe and profound mental retardation. Results show that staff differentially distributed their activities, especially with respect to organizational activities and the amount of custodial care, depending on the type of contract they were employed under and the number of consecutive days they worked. Number of staff present in the living group appeared to be a major factor in terms of distribution of activities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Behavior rating scales are a primary method for screening and identifying children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The factorial structure and normative data of a teacher rating scale containing the 18 symptoms of ADHD were examined in this study. Factor analyses and assessment of differences in ADHD ratings across sex, age, and ethnic group were conducted with 4,009 children and adolescents who attended kindergarten through 12th grade in 31 U.S. school districts. Two factors (inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity) were derived, and normative data for a nationally representative sample were presented. Boys, younger children, and African Americans received higher ratings of ADHD symptoms. Limitations of this investigation and potential uses of this scale in clinical practice and research are discussed.

AB  - Comprehensive assessment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms includes parent and teacher questionnaires. The ADHD Rating Scale–5 was developed to incorporate changes for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.; DSM–5; American Psychiatric Association, 2013). This study examined the fit of a correlated, 2-factor structure of ADHD (i.e., DSM–5 conceptual model) and alternative models; determined whether ADHD symptom ratings varied across teacher and child demographic characteristics; and presented normative data. Two samples were included: (a) 2,079 parents and guardians (1,131 female, 948 male) completed ADHD symptom ratings for children (N = 2,079; 1,037 males, 1,042 females) between 5 and 17 years old (M = 10.68; SD = 3.75) and (b) 1,070 teachers (766 female, 304 male) completed ADHD symptom ratings for students (N = 2,140; 1,070 males, 1,070 females) between 5 and 17 years old (M = 11.53; SD = 3.54) who attended kindergarten through 12th grade. The 2-factor structure was confirmed for both parent and teacher ratings and was invariant across child gender, age, informant, informant gender, and language. In general, boys were higher in symptom frequency than girls; older children were rated lower than younger children, especially for hyperactivity–impulsivity; and non-Hispanic children were rated higher than Hispanic children. Teachers also rated non-Hispanic African American children higher than non-Hispanic White, Asian, and Hispanic children. Non-Hispanic White teachers provided lower hyperactivity–impulsivity ratings than non-Hispanic, African American, and Hispanic teachers. Normative data are reported separately for parent and teacher ratings by child gender and age. The merits of using the ADHD Rating Scale–5 in a multimodal assessment protocol are discussed.

AB  - Little is known about how the condition of school facilities affects academic outcomes. This study examines the role of school attendance as a mediator in the relationship between facilities in disrepair and student grades in city and state tests. Data on building condition and results from English Language Arts (ELA) and Mathematics (Math) standardized tests were analyzed using a sample of 95 elementary schools in New York City. Variables relevant to academic achievement such as ethnicity, socioeconomic status, teacher quality, and school size were used as covariates. In run-down school facilities students attended less days on average and therefore had lower grades in ELA and Math standardized tests. Attendance was found to be a full mediator for grades in ELA and a partial mediator for grades in Math. This study provides empirical evidence of the effects of building quality on academic outcomes and considers the social justice issues related to this phenomenon.

AB  - Background: Proponents of telework arrangements assert that those who telework have more control over their work and family domains than their counterparts who are not permitted to work from home. Objective: Using Karasek’s theory we hypothesized that the relationship between demands (hours in work per week; hours in childcare per week) and strain (work role overload; family role overload) would be moderated by the number of hours the employee spent per week teleworking (control). Methods: To determine how the number of telework hours relates to work role overload and family role overload, we follow the test for moderation and mediation using hierarchical multiple regression analysis as outlined by Frazier et al. [50] We used survey data collected from 1,806 male and female professional employees who spent at least one hour per week working from home during regular hours (i.e. teleworking). Results: As hypothesized, the number of hours in telework per week negatively moderated the relation between work demands (total hours in paid employment per week) and work strain (work role overload). Contrary to our hypothesis, the number of hours in telework per week only partially mediated the relation between family demands (hours a week in childcare) and family role overload (strain). Conclusions: The findings from this study support the idea that the control offered by telework is domain specific (helps employees meet demands at work but not at home).

AB  - This paper examines the effect of early childhood investments on college enrollment and degree completion. We used the random assignment in Project STAR (the Tennessee Student/Teacher Achievement Ratio experiment) to estimate the effect of smaller classes in primary school on college entry, college choice, and degree completion. We improve on existing work in this area with unusually detailed data on college enrollment spells and the previously unexplored outcome of college degree completion. We found that assignment to a small class increases students' probability of attending college by 2.7 percentage points, with effects more than twice as large among black students. Among students enrolled in the poorest third of schools, the effect is 7.3 percentage points. Smaller classes increased the likelihood of earning a college degree by 1.6 percentage points and shifted students toward high-earning fields such as STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics), business, and economics. We found that test-score effects at the time of the experiment were an excellent predictor of long-term improvements in postsecondary outcomes.

AB  - Høyesterett har i tre dommer anvendt en rettsregel som innebærer at isolert sett lovlige midlertidige ansettelsesavtaler likevel strider mot arbeidsmiljøloven dersom virksomheten over tid har et stabilt og påregnelig behov for arbeidskraft (grunnbemanningslærenHøyesterett anvender begrepet «den ulovfestede lære» i Rt. 2009 s. 578 (Sykehuset Innlandet). Jeg mener grunnbemanningslæren er en bedre betegnelse, og vil kort begrunne dette innledningsvis under punkt 1.1. ). Den midlertidige ansatte er da fast ansatt, forutsatt at han er tilstrekkelig tilknyttet virksomheten. Dette er kjernen i grunnbemanningslæren, og temaet for denne artikkelen.

AB  - Utredningsmetodik och saklighet i en vårdnads-, boende- och umgängesutredning, med sexuella anklagelser, granskas. Stor okunnighet om barns utveckling och hur barn kan påverkas visas både från socialtjänsten och från barnpsykiatrin. Ett antal tankefel förekommer. Utredningen utmärks av partiskhet/"knäsittning". Det kan i detta fall hävdas att det 3-åriga (och senare äldre) barnet utsatts för psykiska övergrepp.

AB  - A survey of licensed, faith-based, child daycare programs was conducted in Metropolitan Cleveland, Ohio, to explore the parents’ satisfaction, preferences, and their perception of staff competence as well as quality of services rendered. Sixteen daycare programs and 74 parents were represented in this study. Previous research has analyzed parents’ satisfaction based on curricular issues, educational background of staff, and staff ratio. However, there is a need to determine parents’ perceptions and preferences as related to the scope of this study. Sixty-one percent of the respondents indicated that people who are devoted to their faith are more effective or much more effective as human service providers as compared with others. Sixty-nine percent indicated some level of preference for a child care worker who was a person of faith if they had a choice. Eighty percent indicated that they believed that the daycare workers were knowledgeable and skillful as human service workers.

AB  - This study concerns three preschools situated in a multi-ethnic area in Sweden in which almost all the preschool children are multilingual. Two of these preschools use music as a tool for stimulating language and social development, while the third preschool has no particular focus on music and serves as a comparison. The purpose of this paper is to discuss how the leadership at these preschools has impacted the didactic choices made. At these preschools a number of teachers formerly felt a lack of self-confidence and competence in teaching music. They used to be on the periphery, but are now competent actors in the heart of the community. This learning process is linked to the preschools in question being communities of practice led by the principals (Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991; Wenger, 1998). The preschool teachers’ narratives show that they formerly thought music to be an activity reserved for people with a special gift or a talent. Now they see that they are competent enough to use music in their daily work as a tool for language development, social training, and, above all, to bring joy to the preschool. However, the preschool teachers avoid saying that the musical activities also have an impact on the ability to develop musical skills. The inspiration the leadership has brought to each institution is of crucial importance for music activities to be a part of the daily work. But in a way this influence also has been restrictive. The preschool teachers only describe music as a tool. Other functions of music remain in the background. Didactic objectives are vital for the legitimization of all pedagogical intentions and pursuits. And since the Swedish preschools’ steering documents state that music should be a part of the preschool agenda it is important that the leadership at preschools encourage preschool teachers to see that musical activities also have an impact on the ability to develop musical skills.

AB  - Aim: Ten years ago, we published developmental data on a representative group of children (n = 25) with moderate or severe speech and language impairment, who were attending special preschools for children. The aim of this study was to perform a follow-up of these children as teenagers. Methods: Parents of 23 teenagers participated in a clinical interview that requested information on the child's current academic achievement, type of school, previous clinical assessments, and developmental diagnoses. Fifteen children participated in a speech and language evaluation, and 13 participated in a psychological evaluation. Results: Seven of the 23 teenagers had a mild intellectual disability, and another three had borderline intellectual functioning. Nine had symptoms of disorders on the autism spectrum; five of these had an autism spectrum disorder, and four had clear autistic traits. Six met criteria for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)/subthreshold ADHD. Thirteen of 15 teenagers had a moderate or severe language impairment, and 13 of 15 had a moderate or severe reading impairment. Overlapping disorders were frequent. None of the individuals who underwent the clinical evaluation were free from developmental problems. Conclusion: A large number of children with speech and language impairment at preschool age had persistent language problems and/or met the criteria for developmental diagnoses other than speech and language impairment at their follow-up as teenagers. Language impairment in young children is a marker for several developmental disorders, particularly intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder.

AB  - In this paper one specific task in a series of tasks focusing on part-part-whole relations of the ten first natural numbers and finger patterns for structure number relations, is presented and discussed. The tasks were designed, planned and enacted in an intervention program conducted in Swedish preschool during an eight-month period. In the program nine preschool teachers worked in close collaboration with the research team in planning how to enact tasks with their 5-year-old children, in an iterative process. The specific task, called the ‘snake game’, consists of five or ten beads on a string, some of the beads where to be hidden and the children would find out the hidden part by using structured finger patterns. The task was designed in accordance with the variation theory assumptions that certain aspects need to be discerned as dimensions of variations. The aim of the paper is to examine which dimensions of variations that were opened up by the teachers and what was made possible for the children to learn from the enactment of the ‘snake game task’. The data set includes 67 video observations from the teacher’s enactment of the task. The results suggest that what seems to be a ‘non-complex task’ (five/ ten beads on a string) offers rich mathematical experiences and has potential to bring fore important aspects of numbers and number relations. However, depending on which dimensions of variations that were opened up reveals different learning possibilities.

AB  - The data in this paper draws from an eight-month intervention study based on the idea that children need to discern the first ten natural numbers as relations of parts and whole to develop their arithmetic skills. In order to implement educational activities according to this conjecture, a group of Swedish preschool teachers worked closely with a research team, planning, enacting and analyzing activities. In this paper I describe how nine pre-school teachers, across 67 video-recorded films, handled one of these activities, called the ‘snake game’ with their groups of 5-year-old children. Using analysis based on variation theory, the results point to differences in the enactment of the ‘snakegame’ in terms of if and how the teachers foregrounded the structural aspects of numbers embedded in the activity.

AB  - The purpose of the current investigation was to compare 1,206 gifted and nongifted elementary students on the identification of emotional and behavioral risk (EBR) as rated by teachers and parents using a multigate, multi-informant approach to assessment. The Parent and Teacher Behavioral Assessment System for Children, Second Edition (BASC-2) and the Behavioral and Emotional Screening System were used to assess behavioral functioning as rated by teachers and parents. There were significant differences between the number of gifted and nongifted children demonstrating emotional and behavioral risk, with parents and teachers identifying a higher number of boys and nongifted children as at risk. Among children demonstrating EBR, gifted children demonstrated elevated internalizing behaviors as rated by parents. Gifted students demonstrated higher academic performance regardless of risk level, suggesting higher cognitive abilities may be one of several protective factors that serve to attenuate the development of other social, emotional, or behavioral concerns. Implications for practice and future research needs are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate visual function in a group of individuals with congenital and childhood myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), to correlate the results to the size of the cytosine-thymine-guanine (CTG) repeat expansion and the onset form, and to compare the results with those of a control group. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study with age- and gender-matched control groups. PARTICIPANTS AND CONTROLS: Forty-nine individuals with severe and mild congenital and childhood DM1 and controls matched for age and gender. METHODS: The ophthalmologic examination included best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), refraction, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, indirect ophthalmoscopy, and flash visual evoked potentials (VEPs). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual acuity, refractive error, pathology of lens, fundus, and VEP pathologic features. RESULTS: The study shows a higher prevalence of low visual acuity, hyperopia, and astigmatism in the study population compared with the controls. The size of the CTG repeat expansion had an impact on BCVA in all subgroups with lower values in individuals with larger expansion size. In childhood DM1, individuals with high hyperopia and astigmatism had greater CTG repeat expansion size than those without. No true cataract was found. Subtle nonspecific fundus changes were present in addition to VEP pathology. CONCLUSIONS: Children and adolescents with DM1 have a variety of visual function pathologies, and DM1 has an impact on the developing visual system, necessitating early ophthalmologic assessment and follow-up.

AB  - An exploratory study of attachment security with family child care providers was conducted with 41 toddlers (age 12-19 months). Temporal stability of caregiver-child attachment security was assessed using the Attachment Q-Set, observing each dyad on two occasions, 1 to 2 weeks apart. Contextual correlates of child care provider attachment were also examined, including infant and family background characteristics, infant-provider interactive involvement, quality of the parent-provider relationship, provider characteristics and working conditions, and aspects of child care quality. Attachment Q-Set security and infant-provider interactive involvement were found to be stable over time. Correlations and path analyses revealed that significant direct predictors of attachment security were the level of infant-provider interactive involvement, family socioeconomic status? and overall child care quality. Significant indirect predictors of attachment security (mediated through infant-provider interactive involvement) were child care group size, number of months with the provider, and age at entry into child care.

AB  - The aim of the study was to describe and analyse the design of learning environments and how children in preschool, preschool class and primary school create meaning and learn from the teaching aids offered to them in scientific activities planned by teachers.The theoretical reference frame was obtained from multimodal and design-oriented theory, with its focus on the creative dimensions of learning and detailed aspects of how learning takes place. The study is based on video-observations and constituted an in-depth study of a limited number of occasions spent in preschool, preschool classes and the first year of primary school when science lessons were in progress. Four children’s groups, thirty-six children and five teachers took part in the study, from different schools and municipalities. The children are aged between three and seven. The video-observations have been transcribed as text and analysed with analytical concepts found within the theoretical framework.The results show that considering the number of children in the children’s groups, relatively few children take part in the scientific learning contexts. Changes in the balance of power were evident in the learning settings and followed the interaction patterns that were identified in the children’s groups. The results also show that children create representations – both individually and corporately – in new or different ways that are made up of analogies expressed in terms of equivalent, existential, expressive and figurative analogies. The children’s verbal expressions that corresponded with the responses expected by the teachers were highly valued, were paid attention to and were recognised as know-how. This meant that many of the potential meanings that exist in children’s meaning-making in science become invisible. The results have educational implications for teachers’ work at the local level and for teacher training.

AB  - The study examined effects of playing number games (linear number board game, circular number board game, and nonlinear numerical activities) on the development of number knowledge and early arithmetic. A passive control group was also included in the design. 114 5-year-old preschool children participated. Four tasks (number line estimation, counting, naming Arabic numbers, and arithmetic calculation) were used as dependent measures. Children assigned to an intervention participated in six 10-min sessions during a period of three weeks. Children playing the linear number board game improved their performance on the number line estimation task, while children playing the other games did not. Furthermore, children playing the linear number board game showed a substantial enhancement of their calculation performance. The positive effects of playing linear number board games support the representational mapping hypothesis. The finding concerning calculation provides support to the assumption that a linear representation is important for early arithmetical learning.

AB  - The early emergent stage of writing consists of drawing and scribbling. This article provides a rationale for teachers to reframe their dispositions toward scribbling and reshape their interactions with writers in the early emergent stage. These teaching tips were derived from the authors' study of teacher, parent, and young students' perceptions of scribbling and highlight the importance of positive teacher interactions regarding the scribbling phase of early emergent writers to maintain students' self-efficacy, motivation, and writing identity in preschool classrooms. Practical strategies, positive verbal responses, and engaging questions are provided for teachers to acknowledge and encourage scribbling as early writing.

AB  - A number of studies within early childhood education and care indicate the importance of social competence. This article focuses on how friendship is created among very young children in Swedish preschools. The study was carried out within a toddler unit with 15 children. Six 1-year-old children, three girls and three boys, were observed during nine months. The ethnographic method follows a phenomenological tradition with participatory observations, including field notes, photos and video recordings. The findings show how young toddlers create friendships: 1-year-olds monitor and pay attention to individual peers, displaying intentionality and agency by spontaneously greeting their peers, by offering play invitations, and by helping peers. Mutual awareness, joint attention, shared smiles, coordinated locomotion, as well as other types of synchronized actions are parts of non-verbal elements in emerging friendship. One pedagogical implication of this study is to take young children's friendship into account when putting together preschool groups.

AB  - Increased concern about the low levels of literacy and numeracy among Grade 3 learners in South Africa is resulting in more emphasis being placed on the preparatory Grade R year. The level of learning readiness of pupils when entering formal teaching in Grade 1 is determined by perceptual motor stimulation that pupils received during the preschool phase. 'Learning readiness' can be influenced by the knowledge of teachers, teacher/child ratio, the availability of teaching aids, as well as the amount of space and time allocated to movement activities. The aim of the study recounted in this article was to determine the physical deficiencies that could negatively affect children's perceptual motor development and school readiness. Focus was placed on factors that influence perceptual motor development such as the training of teachers, availability of equipment and resources at schools with Grade R classes. Demographic information was collected with regards to; the qualification of teachers, the number of pupils, and intervention programmes that are offered at schools by outside institutions. A Likert scale questionnaire, with a combination of yes/no and open questions, was used and followed up by a personal interview. According to availability, 31 schools and 51 teachers were selected to participate in the research. Teachers of schools in developed areas and disadvantaged areas were involved in the study. The results of the study show that teachers are not sufficiently trained for the early child developmental needs within the education environment and that many schools are under-supplied in terms of resources and equipment. It is recommended that these teachers receive inservice training on learners' perceptual motor development and that the Department of Education should provide schools with resources and equipment to prevent these deficiencies in the education system.

AB  - Previous research has focused on how job conditions and work attitudes affect employee absence. This research has continued despite increases in the number of employees who cite family issues as a reason for missing work and the existence of theoretical models which assert that family structure affects employee attendance either directly or interactively (e.g., P. P. Brooke, 1986; R. M. Steers and S. R. Rhodes, 1978). Using a sample of 211 employed, married parents (aged 23–68 yrs), the present study tested a series of models that have been expanded to include the effects of family demands and family attitudes. Ss completed mailed questionnaires. Consistent with Steers and Rhodes, family demands were found to moderate the effect of job burnout on absence frequency. Experiencing a high level of burnout was associated with increased absenteeism if employees had children under 6 living at home or reported having difficulty with their child care arrangements. These results have implications for the development of effective family-supportive policies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Reviews the book, Sibling identity and relationships: Sisters and brothers by Rosalind Edwards, Lucy Hadfield, Helen Lucey, and Melanie Mauthner (2006). The authors have backgrounds in social policy, sociology, applied work with children, and women's studies, and thus bring several overarching theoretical perspectives to their analysis. Their method reflects their theoretical interests. Under the auspices of two research projects, they interviewed 102 children and young adults between the ages of 5 and 21 across a range of families, social classes, ethnic backgrounds, and regions in the U.K., asking them open-ended questions about their understandings and experiences of being a sibling, its strengths and limitations, how they resolved conflict, and the characteristics and consequences of sibling caring practices. The authors employed a number of novel methodologies, including writing and reading activities, a relationship "circle map," spider diagrams, and story vignettes. These choices result in rich narrative accounts of how siblings see and understand each other. Although the narratives are rich and wonderfully engaging, occasionally the writing and theoretical interpretations 'weigh down' the lightness and clarity of the children's own insights. There is something relevant here for nearly everyone concerned with siblings--family scholars, sibling researchers, policy advocates, and family practitioners. It can serve as a useful textbook in courses on family relationships, especially those that are interdisciplinary. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study discusses six common methodological limitations in screening for language delay (LD) as illustrated in 11 recent studies. The limitations are (1) whether the studies define a target population, (2) whether the recruitment procedure is unbiased, (3) attrition, (4) verification bias, (5) small sample size and (6) inconsistencies in choice of "gold standard". It is suggested that failures to specify a target population, high attrition (both at screening and in succeeding validation), small sample sizes and verification bias in validations are often caused by a misguided focus on screen positives (SPs). Other limitations are results of conflicting methodological goals. We identified three such conflicts. One consists of a dilemma between unbiased recruitment and attrition, another between the comprehensiveness of the applied gold standard and sample size in validation and the third between the specificity of the gold standard and the risk of not identifying co-morbid conditions.

T1  - Preschool Teachers Responsibility in a Discourse-analytical Perspective : a Swedish Case

AB  - Both internationally and nationally, there is an ongoing tendency to pinpoint responsibility as well as individual executives as responsible for different parts of activities (Svensson, 2011). However, in the educational area, this has particularly been applied when it comes to the heads of pre-schools and schools and to teachers in these contexts. Since the 2010 this trend has been clearly articulated through the discourse about preschool teachers' responsibility in the Swedish preschool curriculum (Skolverket, 2010). When the preschool curriculum was revised in 2010 there was a clear discursive change related to the preschool teacher's responsibility for the pedagogical activities. This change meant that parts of the responsibility that for many years had been described as a responsibility shared by the participants in the team, now came to be described as a preschool teacher's responsibility. Important to mention here are that these teams traditionally have consisted of various professionals, such as pre-school teachers with a university degree and child minders with an upper secondary degree. The aim of the paper is to highlight and problematize how the discourse about the pre-school teacher's mission of providing pedagogical activities in pre-school has been developed and changed over time in national policy documents. The following questions will be given special attention: How is preschool teachers' responsibility described in policy texts and other texts on higher education? What underlying discourses emerge in relation to descriptions of the preschool teachers' responsibility, why and in whose interest? Has the discourse on early childhood teacher's responsibility varied over time, if so how? The theoretical, as well as the metodological framework takes its point of departure in Faircloughs (1992, 1995, 2003) critical discourse analysis, which made it possible to investigate elements of educational change in policy texts. In the analysis the concept of discourse is both used as the designation of a specific discourse, in this case the discourse of responsibility, and in the wider sense in terms of language use seen as a kind of social practice (Fairclough, 1992). A discourse is constructed and compiled in a specific way. Each new discourse is always in effect a construction of older discourses that contribute to changes in for example policy documents. The concepts that have emerged as the most relevant ones for the analysis of discursive changes in the texts that I have analysed are intertextuality and interdiskursivitet. In relation to this study intertextuality has been used to elucidate the presence of text in other texts, while interdiscursivity involves an analysis of the particular mix of discourses, genres or styles, as articulated or working together in the text (Fairclough 2003). In the process of trying to understand the kind of responsibility that is projected in policy documents and other texts, Bernstein's (2000, 2003) concepts of horizontal and vertical discourse have been useful. These concepts contributed to an understanding of what kind of knowledge that were related to the discourse about the pre-service teachers respectively the teams responsibility. According to Bernsteins´ distinction vertical and horizontal discourse represents two fundamental forms of knowledge discourses which are described as a general and scientific respectively a context-bound common-sense knowledge discourse. Method Data is produced from a number of policy documents for the Swedish preschool from the early 1900s until 2010. The selection of documents includes both national preschool curriculum documents (Utbildningsdepartementet,1998; Skolverket, 2010), legal texts (SFS 2010:800), Government Bills (Pedagogiskt program för förskolan, 1987), reports (for example Befolkningskommissionen,1938; SOU 1951; SOU:26; SOU1972:27; Barnomsorg och skola kommittén, 1997), and other national texts containing advices and instructions (for example Socialstyrelsen, 1945, 1963). The data analysis consists on the one hand of a content analysis and on the other hand of an analysis of the use of concepts. The content analysis was used as a way to study the discourse about the preschool teachers' responsibility over time and the underlying discourses. The concept analysis was especially used in order to describe and understand the kind of responsibility that are described as the preschool teachers respectively the team's responsibility when the curriculum was revised in 2010. Expected Outcomes The results show that the discourse of preschool teacher's responsibility has been influenced by both preschool teachers' own interests, political ideas and social needs as well as economic and educational interests. Over the years the discursive change has been more and more related to the stronger state regulation and governance of early childhood education. When it comes to the discourse about the preschool teacher's responsibility there have been three important discursive changes, one in 1940s, one in 1970s and one in 2010, which in various degree was related to the preschool teachers professional knowledge and autonomi. For example, from being described as responsible in terms of being professional and autonomous in the 1940ies, to sharing responsibility with the others in the team in the 1970ies, to being described as responsible based on professional knowledge in the 2010 revised version of the curriculum. The analysis of the kind of professional knowledge that is especially ascribed the preschool teachers responsibility from 2010, is the kind of knowledge Bernstein (2000, 2003) describes as a vertical knowledge discourse.

AB  - Background: As part of teachers' everyday classroom assessment practice, feedback can be seen as connected to the formative function of assessment, with the aim of helping students in their learning processes. Much research on teacher feedback focuses precisely on the feedback's formative quality. However, in order to strengthen our understanding about the nature of teacher feedback, we also need to understand more about teachers' rationales for giving feedback to their students, especially in primary school settings. Purpose: The present study aimed to explore and conceptualise primary school teachers' rationales for giving students feedback. Sample: Thirteen Swedish primary school teachers (10 women and 3 men) with 4 to 40 years of teaching experience working with students aged 7-9 years-old (grades 1-3), participated in the study. An open sampling procedure was adopted to recruit the teachers. Design and methods: Data were collected using a semi-structured interview approach. We employed a constructivist grounded theory design for the coding and analysis of the transcribed data. Results: Analysis indicated that two main concerns emerged as regulating teachers' assessment practices. These addressed what the teachers perceived as (1) students' academic needs and (2) students' behavioural and emotional needs. According to the findings, the teachers' rationales for giving students feedback were based on those needs, and dependent on factors such as situation, relationships, time and effort. This resulted in a constant comparison and weighing of different needs by the teachers. Some needs were described as prioritised before others, which caused some rationales to be identified as taking precedence over others. Discussion and conclusions: Based on a systematic analysis of--and thus grounded in--interview data from primary teachers, the current qualitative study offers a framework for surveying, understanding and discussing teacher feedback. Overall, the study showed how everyday practices of classroom assessment and classroom management overlapped, thus underlining the importance in teacher education of understanding classroom assessment, classroom management and the relationships between the two.

AB  - Child sexual abuse (CSA) cases are notoriously difficult to investigate. Substantially fewer cases involving preschool-aged victims are prosecuted compared to cases where the victim is an older child. We aim to investigate what is required for CSA cases involving preschool-aged victims to be carried forward for prosecution. Data from prosecuted cases (N = 30) will be compared to data from discontinued preliminary investigations (N = 30). A number of factors will be examined in order to determine if they can predict prosecution in CSA cases involving preschool victims. The cases will be analyzed with respect to type and length of abuse, relationship between the complainant and defendant, the child’s disclosure of abuse, type of evidence available and the prevalence of a custodial dispute. The results will be discussed in the light of previous research into prosecution of CSA cases and we will attempt to offer some guiding suggestions to how these difficult investigations can be facilitated.

AB  - Child sexual abuse (CSA) cases are notoriously difficult to investigate, and less than 10% of cases are prosecuted. We aimed to investigate prosecutors’ experiences of preparing for and prosecuting suspected CSA cases with preschool aged victims. Nine specialized child prosecutors (6 women, 3 men) took part either in individual interviews or in focus groups on this subject. The transcripts were analyzed thematically. The prosecutors said that children's testimony was sometimes held to an adult standard and that child complainants who expressed emotion could be perceived as more credible than their less expressive counterparts. CSA victims were identified as vulnerable victims who had difficulty telling their stories. Some of the interviewers were described as lacking in the ability to approach these children. The results imply that the reliability and credibility of sexually abused preschoolers and their testimony might be influenced by a number of verbal and non-verbal factors and that there are several obstacles preventing prosecutors from prosecuting these cases.

The strategies were compiled from interviews with 20 early childhood educators from two culturally and linguistically diverse communities in Massachusetts. Emphasis was placed on the strategies that the greatest number of teachers from both school districts identified as effective. These teaching strategies seek to help ELL students make connections between content and language, and support their communication and social interactions.

AB  - Describes the free-play behaviors of 19 socially maladjusted and 19 normal preschool children in their respective naturalistic settings. The Parten Scale and a teacher-directed category were used to code the behaviors. The data were collected by videotaping Ss during the free-play period. All videotapes were coded for the most prominent type of play behavior exhibited by the target child for each 30-sec interval. A comparison of the 2 groups was made through a series of 7 t-tests on the Parten categories. The analyses indicated that the socially maladjusted Ss engaged in more nonsocial activities and were involved in more teacher-oriented interactions. The normal Ss engaged in more unoccupied and onlooker behaviors and were involved in more group play. Results are discussed with regard to the different settings for each group of children and the ways in which specific teacher behaviors, such as teacher directiveness, may be related to the social status and social skill level of socially maladjusted children.

AB  - There has been extensive research and analysis of the professionalization of early childhood educators/teachers. The recent promotion of a teacher-led workforce in England has further focused discussions on the modelling of early years teachers as professionals. In this article, the author develops an alternative analysis using the concepts of Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari to explore professionalization as a process of becoming. English policy focus has been on constituting early years teachers as reflective and rational subjects, and moving towards a narrower view of professional identity where school-ready discourses are prevalent. The author's research with early years teachers reveals a complex negotiation and interchange with the demands of professional identity. This is analysed through Deleuze and Guattari's concepts of segmentation to refer to the forms of power which order early years teachers' professional identity, and stuttering to develop the forms of resistance and negotiation that suggest a more fluid model of becoming. In particular, the analysis focuses on how stuttering opens up beyond the limits of a discourse analysis to suggest embodied and material forms of practice that are central to early years teaching. This methodology allows a move beyond the binary nature of humanist thought which posits mind-matter and culture-nature, towards a politics of possibility in which emerging early years teachers are engaged with an embodied and material world.

AB  - Research Findings: The present study assessed the extent to which early childhood educators utilized small-group literacy instruction and explored factors potentially associated with the use of this evidence-based practice. The classroom activities of 83 early childhood educators were observed in the fall and spring, and videos were coded to calculate time spent in small-group literacy instruction. Educators completed questionnaires indicating classroom adult:child ratios, literacy beliefs, and feelings of self-efficacy. Classroom Assessment Scoring System scores for classroom organization and instructional support measured the quality of classroom management and instructional interactions, respectively. On average, educators provided 11.4 min ( SD = 10.6) of small-group literacy instruction a day. It is notable that many educators provided little or no small-group literacy instruction. Negative binomial regression analyses indicated that educators with better classroom management, higher quality instructional interactions, and lower adult:child ratios were more likely to use small-group literacy instruction. Educators’ beliefs and feelings of self-efficacy were not associated with the use of small-group literacy instruction. Practice or Policy: Educators may be better able to provide small-group literacy instruction in contexts affording low adult:child ratios and high levels of classroom management and instructional support, all of which are malleable factors that can be changed via policy or professional development.

AB  - The visuospatial perceptual abilities of individuals with Williams syndrome (WS) were investigated in two experiments. Experiment 1 measured the ability of participants to discriminate between oblique and between nonoblique orientations. Individuals with WS showed a smaller effect of obliqueness in response time, when compared to controls matched for nonverbal mental age. Experiment 2 investigated the possibility that this deviant pattern of orientation discrimination accounts for the poor ability to perform mental rotation in WS (Farran, Jarrold, & Gathercole, 2001). A size transformation task was employed, which shares the image transformation requirements of mental rotation, but not the orientation discrimination demands. Individuals with WS performed at the same level as controls. The results suggest a deviance at the perceptual level in WS, in processing orientation, which fractionates from the ability to mentally transform images.

AB  - The present review is built on results and conclusions from scientific and systematic overviews, where the authors have studied and analysed research, which illustrates how academic performance among comprehensive school students is affected by outdoor teaching, by regular physical activities and/or contact with nature.The review demonstrates that the evidence is strong enough to ascertain that outdoor education has a positive effect, directly as well as indirectly, on academic performance and achievements. Very few studies indicate a correlation between outdoor education and negative effects on students’ learning, teachers’ work situation, or the school situation in general.It is therefore concluded that there is sufficient evidence for recommending more outdoor education in everyday school activities – as incidents of teaching in combination with being outdoors generate a number of positive effects on students’ learning, health, physique, as well as their personal and social development. In sum, this overview demonstrates the following:outdoor education leads to a number of positive effects for school age children, e.g., improved learning (better cognitive abilities, concentration, working memory, and motivation for studies),sufficient evidence for the possibility to introduce more outdoor-based elements in teaching among children and youth in the whole educational system,sufficient evidence for positive effects of outdoor education on cognition, which makes it worthwhile to strengthen existing as well as new national efforts that could enhance outdoor education, physical activities, and contact with nature in compulsory school, e.g., by involving teacher education institutions in a comprehensive development project at a national level,outdoor education is in line with modern pedagogical models of school development, teaching and learning.Support for improved goal achievement and good public healthResearch shows that outdoor education with regular physical activities and contact with nature can have positive and meaningful effects, both directly and indirectly, on learning, academic performance, health and wellbeing, as well as on students’ personal and social development.The statistical effects (effect measures) are typically at a rather low to medium level. However, at a social level they could potentially be most relevant from a public health and school perspective, as they contribute to better goal achievement in the compulsory school, preschool and leisure-time centre. The conditions are, that programmes and competence-raising measures are taken to initiate outdoor teaching on a large scale and that they are long-term endeavours. According to research long-lasting and more extensive programmes are more effective, physically, socially as well as cognitively, than shorter ad-hoc educational initiatives.Strong evidence for factors that indirectly influence school performanceResearch shows that regular physical activity with mobility and contact with nature during the school day has overall positive effects on learning ability, academic performance and a number of other factors that are important for students’ development and for teaching. Essential scientific arguments exist, that outdoor teaching, compared to classroom teaching using more or less traditional teaching methods, promotes factors that have indirect effects on academic performance, such as, improved concentration, working memory, and personal and social development. According to the research this, in turn, could lead to increased study motivation, better self-confidence, self-control and impulse control, creativity, ability to collaborate, and intentions for a healthier lifestyle (physical exercise and eating habits). A high degree of physical activities, together with contact with nature during the school day and in teaching, correlates with academic performance and with a number of factors that have an indirect, positive impact on school results among students.More time in teaching theoretical subjects does not lead to better resultsResearch indicates that increased physical activities during the school day or more Physical Education (PE) lessons do not have a negative influence on the results in theoretical subjects. On the contrary, most of the research indicates that more physical activities seem to have positive effects on students’ achievements in theoretical subjects, even if more research is needed in this area. Nor is there any proof that an increase in the amount of teaching hours in theoretical subjects, at the expense of e.g., physical education, has any positive effects on the results in theoretical subjects. Several researchers and systematic overviews indicate that more classroom teaching in theoretical subjects can raise the risk of physical and mental ill health among students.More longitudinal research is neededIn order to increase goal achievement, improve academic results and promote sound everyday habits among children and youth, there is enough strong evidence in the research review for considering a systematic implementation of outdoor education in compulsory school. However, a great deal of the research consists of short-term evaluations, which makes it more difficult to draw conclusions as regards outdoor activities in school and how they can contribute to a purposeful school development that will positively influence academic achievements in the long run. In other words, more longitudinal studies are needed in a Swedish school context.The overall layout of the research reviewThe present review of research literature is divided into three main sections, according to the effects of outdoor education on academic performance, physical activities, and contact with nature, respectively.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine Jordanian early childhood teachers' perspectives toward science teaching and learning and understand the contextual lived science experiences as realized by teachers in early childhood settings. The study has utilized mixed methods approach. An Arabic-validated version of the Early Childhood Teachers' Attitudes toward Science Teaching questionnaire was completed by 101 early childhood teachers who were randomly selected from preschools and kindergartens in Zarqa city; one of the biggest and highly populated cities in Jordan. Follow-up in-depth interviews were then conducted with 15 teachers who were randomly selected from the teachers whose permission was granted through collected questionnaires. Findings of the quantitative part of this study indicate that Jordanian early childhood teachers hold, in general, positive attitudes toward science. None of the variables (i.e., number of years of experience, qualification level of the teachers and number of science courses taken) had significant effect on the teachers' attitudes. Despite the reported positive attitudes, most teachers in this study reported that they allocate an average of less than 30 minutes per week to the teaching and learning of science in their early childhood classrooms. Qualitative data analysis helped in contextualizing the questionnaire findings. Three major themes emerged through constant comparative analysis of the interviews' transcripts: comfort and confidence in light of contextual experience, science instructional practices, and reasons behind the limited instructional time dedicated to science. This research paper ends by considering the role of the continuous professional development and pre-service teacher preparation programs in upgrading early childhood teachers' attitudes toward science teaching and learning.

AB  - The field of early intervention is currently faced with the challenge of reducing the prevalence of antisocial behavior in children. Longitudinal outcomes research indicates that increased antisocial behavior and impairments in social competence skills during the preschool years often serve as harbingers of future adjustment problems in a number of domains including mental health, interpersonal relations, and academic achievement. This article reports the results of a cross-site randomized controlled trial, in which 128 preschool children with challenging behaviors were assigned to either a Preschool First Step to Success (PFS) intervention (i.e., experimental) or a usual-care (i.e., control) group. Regression analyses indicated that children assigned to the Preschool First Step intervention had significantly higher social skills, and significantly fewer behavior problems, across a variety of teacher- and parent-reported measures at postintervention. Effect sizes for teacher-reported effects ranged from medium to large across a variety of social competency indicators; effect sizes for parent-reported social skills and problem behaviors were small to medium, respectively. These results suggest that the preschool adaptation of the First Step intervention program provides early intervention participants, staff, and professionals with a viable intervention option to address emerging antisocial behavior and externalizing behavior disorders prior to school entry.

AB  - This study evaluated the efficacy of the Preschool First Step (PFS) to Success early intervention for children at risk for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). PFS is a targeted intervention for children 3-5 years old with externalizing behavior problems and addresses secondary prevention goals and objectives. As part of a larger multisite, randomized controlled trial, the efficacy of the PFS program was evaluated on a subsample of 45 children who also had elevated comorbid ADHD symptoms as rated by parents and teachers. The PFS program was found to produce significantly higher social skills, and significantly fewer behavior problems across a variety of teacher- and parent-reported measures at postintervention. Effect sizes for teacher-reported effects were large across a variety of social competency indicators, including those specific to ADHD. Effect sizes for parent-reported social skills and problem behaviors were medium. Although not specifically designed for preschoolers at risk for comorbid ADHD, this generic behavioral intervention appeared to be successful for this population. Implications and limitations of the study are discussed.

AB  - Data on the quality of 15 residential homes and 17 day centers were collected for adults with learning disabilities in England. Information from a sample of 24 male and 32 female residents (aged 20–73 yrs) was collected on their behavioral characteristics, social and community integration, autonomy, receipt of attention and assistance from staff, and participation in activity. Representative group activities taking place within the centers were observed and user:staff ratios, user receipt of attention from staff and user engagement in activity recorded. Results demonstrated that the frequency of community integration, the extent of autonomy and the level of activity were associated with resident ability. However, there was a lack of association between staff–resident interaction and resident needs for support. Given the ranges on the quality of life indicators examined, Ss with more severe disabilities were found to lead segregated and under occupied existences. These findings add weight to the need to be more precise about the determinants of quality and, in particular, the role and performance of staff. The authors conclude that developing consensus on the functions and goals of day services is required if day service reform is to lead to the most effective organizational and operational arrangements.

AB  - In Australia and internationally, government policies aim to increase the supply of early childhood teachers and thus improve the quality of early childhood education and care services. In this paper, we suggest that such a policy-quality trajectory in Australia is not as straightforward as policy discourses suggest. From industrial relations and broader policy contexts, we argue that the early childhood profession is a profession on the margins and that this marginalisation complicates efforts to enhance numbers of early childhood teachers. Mindful of this marginalisation, we draw upon preliminary findings from a study exploring the motivations, beliefs and expectations of mature age postgraduate students to highlight practical issues pertaining to students and early childhood teacher education programs that further complicate policy drives to increase the supply of early childhood teachers. We propose that the success of such policy drives is dependent on a comprehensive addressing of the complexities raised in this paper.

AB  - The aim was to characterize the panorama of developmental disorders in 208 preschool children with a clinical diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), referred to a specialized centre, the Autism Centre for Young Children (ACYC), for intervention. At the centre, a research team examined all children according to structured protocols and interviews. All available test data from their assessments prior to referral were scrutinized. The boy:girl ratio was 5.5:1. In 22% of the total group a period of regression, including speech and language, had occurred. Epilepsy had been diagnosed in 6% of the children. In 38% of the children there was a definite or highly suspected learning disability/mental retardation according to cognitive test results. About the same proportion had a developmental delay that at the time of assessment could not be definitely classified and in 23% there were clear indications of a normal intellectual function. About 40% of the group exhibited hyperactivity. Differences in expressive vocabulary and adaptive functioning were strongly related to cognitive level. About 20% of the group had AD as the dominating developmental disorder, i.e., they represented a clinical picture of ""classic"" autism. The majority in this group also had learning disability. Another 20%, had ASD combined with a normal intellectual level, some of these conformed to the clinical picture of Asperger syndrome. In a relatively large group (more than half) learning disability or a general developmental delay was as evident as the ASD. In a smaller group (8%) ASD criteria were questionably met. In this group attention deficits in connection with speech and language problems were prominent. The highly individual developmental profiles seen in children with ASDs have to be taken into account when planning intervention and follow-up. The children's medical characteristics also vary considerably and will be detailed in a further report.

AB  - Studied the validity of a Catalan adaptation of the Maslach Burnout Inventory for Teachers. Human Ss: 87 normal male and female adults (mean age 34 yrs) (university professors, education) (pilot study). 47 normal male and female Spanish adults (university professors, education and medicine) (test-retest study). 1,474 normal adults (mean age 38 yrs) (preschool, primary, and secondary school teachers). Information on burnout symptoms was obtained by questionnaire. The results were evaluated according to sex, emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, personal realization, factorial structure, and the results of previous studies. Test reliability and validity were determined. The Catalan version of the test is included. Factorial analysis and other statistical tests were used.

AB  - With the widespread use of the internet, more and more children get acquainted with its various uses at a young age while an increasing number of teachers are designing learning activities that utilize various internet services. Toward this direction, teachers need practical examples of pedagogically verified learning activities. This paper presents an experimental case study of a learning activity meant for teaching preschoolers geometric concepts, which uses communication tools from the internet. The activity constitutes a developmentally appropriate adaptation of a successful model, known as "Monster Exchange", to kindergarten. The paper presents the proposed adaptation, the experimental findings regarding the errors children mad, the difficulties they encountered, and finally, the drawings that children produced, with the aim of evaluating the appropriateness and the learning value of the activity.

AB  - Reviews curricula for handicapped preschoolers to determine if the authors had addressed the needs of these learners and their teachers. Few curricula purporting to serve children with a variety of handicapping conditions actually include systematic adaptations for special needs children. Also reviewed are developmental differences in young handicapped (visually, physically, and hearing-impaired) children. Because of developmental differences, teachers and other professionals must often modify both the content and method of instruction when working with special needs children. Guidelines are presented that may be helpful in adapting curricula for this purpose. Collaborative endeavors that extend beyond the more traditional settings for evaluation into instructional environments are optimal for both the implementation and adaptation of curricula. Curricula that have been written by teams offer a number of advantages to teachers, since the activities have been carefully constructed for primary objectives, yet the teacher or other team member can examine activity and determine whether another objective can be integrated into the primary one.

AB  - South Africa's esteem is low with regard to current learner achievement in mathematics. Results from international studies, such as TIMMS and SACMEQ, continuously indicate that South African learners perform below international benchmarks in mathematics. Research and evaluation studies assert that teacher practices and poor early mathematics stimulation influence this state of affairs. Hence, this article reports on a study that explored the developmental progression of Grade R teachers' mathematics knowledge and general knowledge of teaching participating in a professional development intervention. In this article I report on data collected after a two-day workshop conducted with the teachers. The video recordings of 14 teachers' self-selected lessons were collected and transcribed, using a lesson observation tool, and analysed by means of thematic analysis. The findings indicated that teachers' knowledge of number sense forms a strong foundation for improving the quality instruction of number knowledge. The first step seen to be taken by these teachers to engage the learners was the question and answer approach. The lessons of those who tried to let learners engage lacked structure and resulted in chaos. Demonstration and drill were used to develop the learners' content knowledge. The teachers' practices were inadequate as far as developing conceptual understanding is concerned; and their classroom management skills were not sufficiently developed to include all learners in their mediation. In instances where all the learners participated, the teacher directed the participation and did not allow for learner-to-learner engagement. It is crucial to note that they showed potential for growth and willingness to learn despite the limited or minimal the training they received.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the impact of a multi-level intervention on the physical activity levels of 3–5 year old children attending center-based childcare services. Method: The trial was conducted in New South Wales Australia in 2010 in 20 centers with 459 children. The intervention, included: fundamental movement skill sessions; structured activities; staff role modelling; limiting small screen recreation and sedentary time; and an activity promoting physical environment. Control services continued with usual routines. Physical activity during care was assessed using pedometers at baseline and at six months after baseline. Intervention implementation was assessed via observation of staff physical activity practices and audits of service environment and policy. Results: Mean step counts at baseline and follow-up were 17.20 (CI 15.94–18.46) and 16.12 (CI 14.86–17.30) in the intervention group and 13.78 (CI 12.76–14.80) and 13.87 (CI 12.57–15.17) in the control group (p = 0.12). Intervention services showed significantly greater increases in the total minutes that teachers led structured activities, relative to control group services (p = 0.02). Conclusion: The intervention showed no significant effect on child step counts per minute despite increasing time that staff delivered structured activity which is likely to be attributable to difficulties experienced by service staff in delivering a number of intervention components.

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between October 2012 and July 2013. The sample consisted of medical and non-medical staff employed at PHC centres in Belgrade, Serbia. Among 1757 currently presented at work, 1526 returned the questionnaires. The data were collected by questionnaire Workplace Violence in the Health Sector—Country Case Studies, developed by the ILO/ICN/WHO/PSI. Binary logistic regression was conducted to assess the association between exposure to workplace violence and sociodemographic and work-related characteristics. Results: The prevalence of workplace violence, was 803 (52.6%), with 147 (18.3%), exposed to physical violence. Multiple logistic regression models indicated that the following work-related characteristics were positive associated of workplace violence with working between 18:00 and 07:00 h [odds ratio (OR): 1.37, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08–1.73], nurses as a professional group (OR: 1.91, 95% CI: 1.16–3.17), working with preschool children (OR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.34–0.91). There was negative association of workplace violence with encouragement to report violence (OR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.49–0.76) and the number of staff in the same work setting (OR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.56–0.96). Conclusions: More than half of employees in Belgrade PHC centres were exposed to different types of workplace violence. There is a need for interventions to protect health workers and provide safer workplace environments. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

AB  - The occurrence of potentially stressful events in young children's everyday environment was investigated. Two, three and four year old children who attended one of ten day care centers participated in the study. The most commonly encountered everyday stressors involved object struggles and conflicts over freedom of locomotion. The most common source of stress was another child and the most frequently observed responsibility for an event was the 'child is a victim of another child's aggression'. This may reflect preschool children's limited social skills and abilities and be due to characteristics of the day care setting (adult-child ratio, number of peers etc). Age effects differed according to the events but overall significant decreases were seen with age. Gender related effects were significant at age two, with two year old boys involved in more potentially stressful events than all other age/gender classifications. Verbal assertion was the most frequently used coping technique for eight of the ten potentially stressful situations, while problem solving was used when a child tried to do something with an object and social support was used when a child was a victim of an accident. The type of the event and the source of the stress seemed to play a role in the type of coping technique the young children utilized.

AB  - Målen har fått en allt viktigare position i skolan, elevernas resultat likaså. I den här studien belyses och undersöks lärares tolkning och realisering av kursplanemål i grundskolan. Läroplanen föreskriver att samtliga elever i grundskolan skall nå förutbestämda kunskapsmål. Det gap som återfinns mellan läroplanens formulerade innehåll och elevers lärande har tidigare kallats för the teaching gap eller undervisningens Grand Canyon. En sådan metafor åskådliggör den problematik som existerar i undervisningssituation mellan styrning och elevers lärande. Studien ramas in av de läroplansförändringar som har skett sedan början av 90-talet. I och med införandet av den tidigare läroplanen för grundskolan, Lpo94, förändrades kursplanens struktur i grunden. Lärarna skulle medverka i en deltagande målstyrning där de formellt gavs stort utrymme att tolka läro- och kursplaner. Att undervisa med hjälp av både strävans- och uppnåendemål visade sig dock vara problematiskt på flera sätt. En ny läroplan för grundskolan, Lgr 11, arbetades fram och trädde i kraft 2011. Lärarna blev nu tvungna att tyda en ny kursplan med centralt innehåll och kunskapskrav där elevernas utvecklande av ämnesspecifika förmågor framstod som centralt. Lärarna i studien ger exempel på hur de tolkar och realiserar kursplanemål samt iscensätter dem i undervisning inom ramen för en mål- och resultatstyrd skola. Lärarnas uppdrag har beskrivits som mer kvalificerat i och med den senaste läroplansreformen och den här studien antyder samma sak. Lärarna skall undervisa så att eleverna utvecklar ämnesspecifika förmågor men vad innebär det i ett undervisningssammanhang? Samtidigt har kraven ökat på lärare när det gäller resultatmedvetenhet och kunskapsbedömning. I studien undersöks därför också vad det kan innebära för lärare att iscensätta och realisera kursplanens innehåll via en learning study. Lärarna undersöker då vad som krävs för att elever utvecklar ett specifikt kunnande i samhällskunskap. Att lärarna gavs möjlighet att få iscensätta undervisning på det här sättet verkar ha haft betydelse för deras förståelse av såväl det ämnesdidaktiska innehållet som elevernas förståelse.

AB  - This paper addresses the relationship between class size and student-teacher interactions as an explanation for effects of class size on achievement. Observations were conducted in kindergarten and Grade 1 classes from 46 Dutch primary schools in order to address the effect of class size on the amount and type of student-teacher interactions. The relationship between these interactions and class size was negative: more student-teacher interactions of all types occurred in smaller classes. Furthermore, the effect of smaller class size is similar for all students, regardless of their cognitive and behavioral characteristics.

AB  - Trials of suitability testing prior to admission to teacher education in SwedenRELEVANCE FOR NORDIC EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH - Contemporary Swedish reports on teacher education and the teaching profession focus decreasing status of the teaching profession (Skolvärlden, 2014), a large future teacher shortage (Regeringen, 2016), major defection from teacher education (UKÄ 2016), an increasing number of complaints against individual teachers and schools (Skolinspektionen 2015) and falling ratings in PISA's knowledge assessments (OECD 2015). Related concerns are found in the other Nordic countries, with the exception of Finland (Nordic Council of Ministers 2009)In many of the problems described the good teacher is a prerequisite for improvement. The state's public inquiry (SOU 2008:109) states that "the single most important factor for a school system to be successful is that the right people become teachers.” (ibid., p.424)In 2014 The Swedish government asked for the holding of “a trial with requirements for suitability tests before entering the teacher and preschool teacher education ". Linnaeus University has, as one of two universities, been responsible for developing and trying out the suitability tests prior to admission in autumn 2016.The Linnaeus suitability tests were divided into three subtests regarding five content domains: a) written communications skills, b) oral communications skills, c) the ability to take a leadership role, d) interactive capabilities and e) ability to self-reflection and motivation for the teaching profession. A score was given for each of the five content domains. The presentation outlines the experience gained so far based on 168 applicants who have undergone the admittance test in 2016, as well as on 75 already admitted teacher students who participated in the prior simulated testing sessions during their first month at university in 2015. RESEARCH AIM - The research aim addresses how 113 students preacademic results on the five domains in the suitability tests relate to their early achievements in both theoretical and teacher practice courses in teacher education. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK - The study is framed within theories of admission research noting fields of tension where different interests meet. Admission test should give fair access to teacher education whilst justice also must include that future pupils are given access to the good teachers (Childs et al, 2011). Previous studies has indicated that tests on written communication can predict academic success (Hernandez et al, 2006). Previous studies show varying results regarding to what extent socially interactive elements in suitability testing can predict success in teacher practice courses (Shechtman, 1989; Kosnik et al, 2005). RESEARCH DESIGN - Teacher Students (113) results on suitability tests are compared to their performance on theoretical courses and teacher practice courses in teacher education. Correlations are calculated for the relations between results of the five content domains in the suitability test. FINDINGS - Will consist of a comparision of the results of 113 Teacher Student on Linnaeus suitability tests compared with their results in early theoretical courses as well as in their first teacher training courses in teacher education.

AB  - The perceptions and experiences of hard-to-manage behaviours were explored among 32 staff working in a variety of local authority and private nurseries and playgroups. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to ascertain what behaviours in children staff find most challenging, how they were managed and concerns communicated to parents. Results showed that aggression, inability to share and refusal were perceived as the most prevalent and worrying. Exclusion, explanation and distraction were the most frequently used strategies for handling such behaviours. Staff who were prepared to raise with parents their concerns about problematic behaviours that endangered the child's safety were out-of-character or persistent. A systems approach, based upon the ecological congruence model, was adopted to explain the links between staff perceptions and their tolerance for discrepancies from social norms. Staff-parent communication effectiveness was interpreted in terms of the home-pre-school relationship. (Contains 9 tables.)

AB  - Background: The Children Service Interview was designed as a brief measure of service use related to mental health problems in Great Britain. Method: We validated the Children's Services Interview against medical records from a sample of 87 children, and assessed test-retest reliability from 25 parents completing two interviews. We examined criterion validity by looking at the service use patterns of children attending clinics for different types of disorders. Results: The Children's Services Interview showed high levels of face validity and moderate or better concordance with medical records as far as contacts were recorded in the case notes. Test-retest reliability was moderate or better apart from contacts with the voluntary sector, teachers, and the number and duration of appointments with some professionals. Conclusion: The study suggests the Children's Services Interview can extract moderately valid and reliable data on service use.

AB  - Objectives or purpose. In Sweden and other Nordic countries the formation of educational systems has primarily been an issue for the national state in a rather homogenous society. Today, governance of education is embedded in global movements and a multicultural society influencing the role and function of the state. We will use two empirical cases, based in three recently completed research projects, to illuminate how curriculum and leadership research have worked in tandem to explain and develop both policy and practice. The cases focus on the assessment culture of the Swedish schools and implications of changes in governance for local educational leadership.Perspectives or theoretical framework. In the Swedish curriculum theory tradition, the curriculum has been analyzed as a pedagogical, a political, a practical and research problem. In order to analyze data and develop curriculum and leadership research the central concept of curriculum code (Lundgren 1977) is further elaborated. We pay attention to different levels, actors and contexts in an era dominated by governance, new public management, accountability and international comparative tests. With mass education from preschool to higher education, marketization and an increasing number of stakeholders the complexity of education governance has also increased and curriculum processes have taken new forms. Lundgren elaborated the concepts of steering group, codes and contexts. Codes relate to the purpose, content and method of a curriculum. He raised questions on how the frames were constituted, and identified historically developed curriculum codes manifested in the selection and organization of school knowledge (e.g. Lundgren, 1977). Shifts in codes were related to changed relations between production and reproduction (Lundgren, 1983); neither the purposes of education nor the subject content were taken for granted.Methods. In a recent empirical study, we used questionnaires, interviews and policy texts with analyses grounded in both curriculum theory and leadership research. The empirical base is Sweden from the late 1980s up until today, a highly reform intense period. Findings are presented, focusing especially on governance, leadership and assessment cultures. We include comparative studies and studies covering all 290 Swedish municipalities using both surveys and case studies.Results and/or substantiated conclusions. By using empirical findings from projects relating curriculum activities taking place on different levels with a focus on interlinked curriculum processes, we discuss these processes and further develop contemporary curriculum theory. We address conceptual issues on curriculum making including educational leadership as practice and actors. By linking research on curriculum theory with leadership studies, it is possible to attend to these problems simultaneously.Scientific or scholarly significance. In conclusion, this paper is scanning new horizons for how to develop curriculum theory further as a relational practice appearing in various contexts. Specifically, we posit a new code to explain the contemporary situation for curriculum-leadership.

AB  - Observed 6 autistic Ss (mean CA, 44.7 mo; mean MA, 24.3 mo) and 6 retarded Ss (mean CA, 56.2 mo; mean MA, 27.5 mo) for 7 20-min sessions. The following environmental parameters were manipulated: teacher-to-child ratio, presence of food reinforcement, and skill area being presented. Behavior under observation fell into 3 classes: adaptive performance (percentage response and percentage correct), attention, and maladaptive behavior. Results suggest that food reinforcement and the 1:1 teacher-to-child ratio may not generally enhance adaptive performance but may have an effect upon attention and tantrum behavior; attention to task is more predictive of adaptive behavior than attention to teacher; and interactions were generally lacking between the above parameters and diagnostic group, while level of functioning did show such interactions. Results support the practice of individual behavioral assessment of autistic and retarded children. The present procedure, coupled with statistical analysis for individual Ss, may provide educational prescriptions for individual children.

AB  - The Digital Maps Metaphor (DMM) is suggested as a transdisciplinary research tool to overcome some of the challenges that are potentially inherent in research projects that involve multiple aims, objectives, knowledge claims, and methodologies. Based on the understanding of metaphors as embodied concepts, it is argued that the DMM can be used to structure mappings of the different rationalities within transdisciplinary projects. The advantage of the DMM is illustrated by the metaphor's application to a comprehensive transdisciplinary intervention study in Swedish preschools. The structural mapping brings forth a number of contradictions between the Childhood Map, the Critical and Micro‐political map, and the Developmental map. Potentials for new emergent understandings, facilitated by the metaphor, are suggested for the benefit of children's learning and development. Empirical studies of the effectiveness of the metaphor should be the next step in order to assess its usefulness in different educational and scientific contexts.

AB  - This study explored children's experiences of instructional alignment from prekindergarten through kindergarten. Using cluster analysis to analyze data from over 1300 children in the 2009 Head Start Family and Child Experiences Survey, the study found that children have distinct and definable experiences of prekindergarten-kindergarten alignment, with Hispanic/Latino children more likely to attend Head Start programs with poor support for prekindergarten-kindergarten transitions and poor kindergarten classroom structures, and most children experiencing a decline in developmentally appropriate practices between prekindergarten and kindergarten.

AB  - The overall purpose of this study is to gain knowledge about dialogues in the setting of the preschool. The more in-depth purpose is to highlight what happens in dialogues between a teacher and a child when more children join the situation of interaction in which the dialogue is taking place. A further purpose is to attempt to understand what it is that influences change in the dialogue and what significance the actions of the teacher can have for this change. The study is based on several questions that concern interaction in preschools, who it is that initiates an increase in the number of participants in those situations that involve dialogue, and what happens with the dialogue when more children join and what causes the change in the dialogue.The study is based on video observations from a preschool; approximately 10 teachers and 50 children between the ages of one and six took part in the study. The situations that were observed and documented in video format were everyday activities (both indoor and outdoor) that were led at a nominal level by teachers. In total, 40 films were recorded. Film length was between one and 60 minutes. In 32 of the films, there was interaction between a teacher and several children, and 18 of these included dialogues between a teacher and several children. Dialogue is here given a specific significance and refers to the interaction that can be described in terms of presence, listening, reciprocity, and extending. This definition of dialogue derives from a combination of Martin Buber’s philosophy of dialogue and aspects of interaction that earlier research found to be significant for children’s learning. In two of the 18 films that showed dialogue, no other children became part of the situation of interaction; the remaining 16 films were transcribed; and both verbal and non-verbal events were made apparent in the transcriptions. Analyses of the recorded material and of the transcriptions were conducted using analytical terms borrowed from conversation analysis as well as the central term for this study dialogue. The results demonstrate a complex practice and also demonstrate that dialogues in the sense given in this study take place between children and teachers. Situations of interaction also occur where dialogues take place in which a number of children join. It can be the child joining the situation of interaction who takes the initiative to an increased number of participants; however, it can also be the teacher or the child in the dialogue. The initial address can take place during a moment of transition in the interaction or at the same time as another participant is talking. The dialogue often changes when more children join the situation where the dialogue is taking place. The dialogue can end completely or be interrupted and resume. The results further demonstrate that the dialogue can continue without seemingly being affected by the fact that more children join. This happens when the child joining and the teacher in the dialogue interact in a non-verbal manner at the same time as the teacher is talking with the child in the dialogue. The dialogue can also be continued with more participants. Who takes the initiative, how the initial address occurs, and which content is given focus by the different participants are all factors that seem to affect what happens to the dialogue. How the teacher acts when more children join also appears to be significant in terms of what happens with the dialogue when more children join. In those situations where the teacher begins talking with a number of children about different subjects, the interaction ceases to be dialogic. When the teacher asks the joining child to wait, the dialogue is both interrupted and resumed, and on those occasions when the dialogue continues with more participants, the teacher listens to the joining child and the participants take turns speaking.

AB  - This study analyzed data from a prospective longitudinal study of Swedish preschoolers to examine whether psychopathic traits and concurrent conduct problems predict future conduct problems (CP) across 1- and 2-year follow-ups into early childhood. We tested the predictive ability of psychopathic traits while controlling for concurrent CP, and also by combining psychopathic traits with concurrent CP. A community sample of 1,867 preschoolers (47% girls) ages 3 to 5 years at baseline was recruited from a Swedish medium-sized municipality. Results from multivariate regression analyses showed that psychopathic traits alone (without co-occurring CP) did not consistently predict continuing childhood CP, but did so, among both boys and girls, in combination with concurrent conduct problems. It is important to note that, the combination of concurrent CP and the entire psychopathic personality, that is, a 3-dimensional psychopathic construct, was a stronger predictor of continuing childhood CP than the combination of concurrent CP and Callous-Unemotional (CU) traits among boys but not among girls.

AB  - Extensive behavioral evidence shows that our internal representation of faces, or face prototype, can be dynamically updated by immediate experience. This is illustrated by the robust attractiveness aftereffect phenomenon whereby originally unattractive faces become attractive after we are exposed to a set of unattractive faces. Although behavioral evidence suggests this effect to have a strong neural basis, limited neuroimaging evidence exists. Here we used functional near-infrared spectroscopy methodology (fNIRS) to bridge this gap. During the pre-adaptation trials, participants judged the attractiveness of three sets of faces: normal/undistorted faces, compressed faces (the internal features and distances between them were compressed), and expanded faces (the internal features and distances between them were stretched). Then, participants were shown extremely compressed faces for 5 min as adaptation stimuli, after which participants judged the same three sets of faces in post-adaptation trials. Behaviorally, after the adaptation trials, participants rated the compressed faces more attractive whereas they judged the other two sets of faces as less attractive, replicating the robust adaptation effect. fNIRS results showed that short-term exposure to compressed faces led to significant decreases in neural activity to all face types, but in a more extended network of cortical regions in the frontal and occipital cortexes for undistorted faces. Taken together, these findings suggest that the face attractiveness aftereffect mainly reflects changes in the neural representation of the face prototype in response to recent exposures to new face exemplars.

AB  - Recent research indicates that moral judgment and 1st-order theory of mind abilities are related. What is not known, however, is how 2nd-order theory of mind is related to moral judgment. In the present study, we extended previous findings by administering a morally relevant theory of mind task (an accidental transgressor) to 4- to 7-year-old Chinese children (N = 79) and analyzing connections with 2nd-order theory of mind understanding. Using hierarchical multiple regression analyses, we found that above and beyond age, children’s 1st-order theory of mind and 2nd-order theory of mind each significantly and uniquely contributed to children’s moral evaluations of the intention in the accidental transgression. These findings highlight the important roles that 1st- and 2nd-order theory of mind play in leading children to make appropriate moral judgments based on an actor’s intention in a social situation.

AB  - Montessori's first premise is that movement and cognition are closely entwined, and movement can enhance thinking and learning (Lillard, 2005). Children must move, and practice moving, to develop strength, balance, and the stability needed to fully participate in the rigors of daily life. It is imperative for young children's motor development that, on a daily basis, parents and teachers give children opportunities for physical activity. Children need time to explore, walk, run, climb, touch, smell, see, and hear the natural world. It is also imperative that teachers begin to implement opportunities for gross-motor development within classrooms. As a physical educator and movement specialist, Melani Fuchs observes children and adults in the four phases of motor development: Reflexive, Rudimentary, Fundamental, and Specialized. Here she explains that each phase lays the foundation for the phase that follows it. In this article Fuchs explains each phase and details their natural developmental progression. Having seen a need for a classroom Movement curriculum after working with special needs children within a Montessori environment, Fuchs, in collaboration with professor Diane Craft, a faculty member of the Physical Education Department at the State University of New York at Cortland, created "Movement Matters: A Movement Album for Montessori Early Childhood Programs" (Fuchs, M. & Craft, D., 2012). The album provides a developmentally appropriate Movement curriculum for Early Childhood and early Elementary programs, with in-depth explanations and illustrations of motor development concepts. As teachers cultivate an understanding of these concepts, they develop new insights and, ultimately, new techniques to assess and assist children's pathways to mature movement skills. Teachers will find practical suggestions for leading children in physical activities as well as a discussion of Maria Montessori's philosophy regarding movement. The album's lesson plans and activities are written specifically to give teachers the means to normalize movement in the classroom (to make movement a "right" choice), thus accommodating the child's natural need to move. The lessons encourage children to move to learn, to understand movement concepts, to master movement skills, to develop self-awareness, and to become joyful, healthy movers.

AB  - I denne artikkelen retter vi søkelyset mot kommunikasjon, beslutningsprosesser og maktforhold i barnehagen som organisasjon. Med grunnlag i empirisk materiale fra to ulike barnehager med samme styrer, søker vi gjennom et relasjonelt perspektiv, å vise hvordan det utvikler seg to ulike praksiser med hensyn til kommunikasjon og beslutningstaking. Ved hjelp av Foucaults tenkning prøver vi også å klargjøre hvordan makt gjennom historiske, kulturelle og sosiale forhold, er til stede i kommunikasjon og relasjoner mellom medarbeiderne. Dette innebærer en utvidet forståelse av hva makt er og hvordan den kommer til uttrykk gjennom organisatorisk praksis.

AB  - The uneven availability of child-care centers for different kinds of families has been detailed in recent years. Much less is known about the distribution of center quality across communities. Nor do we understand the role that local contexts or state policies may play in shaping quality levels. This paper describes several quality indicators, based on reports of 170 center directors situated in three California counties. We found that most centers in lower-income and working-class communities displayed at least moderate levels of quality along structural measures, such as class size, the ratio of children per staff member, and staff education levels. About one in six failed to meet recommended quality standards. Some quality indicators were lower for centers located in communities with lower supply of center enrollment slots per capita, possibly due to excess family demand for center-based care. Center quality was not consistently influenced by community conditions such as poverty levels, ethnic composition, or maternal employment rates. Quality was higher among centers receiving stronger flows of public subsidies. We discuss the success of state agencies in advancing quality among centers and remaining policy challenges.

AB  - Because classroom size reduction (CSR) and standards based testing were implemented at the same time in California during the mid-1990s, it is difficult to isolate the effects of classroom size on outcomes from the effects of curriculum changes. As a result, the main comparison in this paper is very specific--the effect of reduced sized kindergarten classrooms on test performance in second grade. The main result of the paper is that the effect of classroom size reduction is small, especially when compared to the other determinants of student achievement at the second grade level. There is a very small effect of classroom size reduction on student achievement in reading and math, and no effect in language and spelling. Of the two offsetting effects of CSR controlling for spending--the direct effect of smaller classes and the indirect effect on teacher quality, the class-size effect is larger. Over time, the negative effect on teacher quality is reduced as new teachers gain experience and credentials. (Contains 3 figures and 2 tables.)

AB  - Prioritering handler om å gi noe forrang framfor noe annet. Man velger inn noe og velger bort noe annet. I en velferdsstatssammenheng innebærer det beslutninger om av tjenester og ressurser. Mye av innholdet i dette nummeret av TfO har relevans for prioriteringer i helse- og omsorgstjenestene i kommunene. Disse tjenestene disponerer store, men like fullt begrensede ressurser, og tjeneste-etterspørselen er vanligvis større enn tilbudet. Da oppstår prioriteringsutfordringer. Man tvinges til å rasjonere ut tjenestenes omfang og noen ganger også deres kvalitet. Man kunne gitt mer og bedre tjenester om man for eksempel hadde disponert høyere kompetanse og mer ressurser. Behovet for prioritering («rationing») oppstår ved mangel på ressurser og innebærer at noen pasienter får en ikke-optimal behandling eller tjeneste (Ubel & Goold, 1998). For eksempel oppgav 44 % av kommunene at de har personer på venteliste til langtidsopphold i sykehjem, til sammen 1420 personer (Helsedirektoratet, 2018). Disse personene oppfyller Helse- og omsorgstjenestelovens § 3-2a om at dette er det eneste tilbudet som kan sikre dem nødvendige og forsvarlige helse- og omsorgstjenester. I tillegg oppfyller de kommunens lokale kriterier for tildeling av langtidsopphold i sykehjem og som bygger på loven. Likevel bor de hjemme eller på korttidsplass i påvente av et bedre tilbud. I en virkelighet med begrensede ressurser står beslutningstakere (både klinikere, byråkrater og politikere) overfor vanskelige prioriteringer mellom brukere, brukergrupper og ulike typer av helse- og omsorgstjenester: Hvem skal få hjelp, til hva, hvor mye og hvor raskt? Hva er nødvendig hjelp? Hva er kommunens ansvar og hva er den enkeltes, familienes og sivilsamfunnets ansvar? Hva er rettferdig fordeling av fellesskapets ressurser? Hva er rimelig og hva er hensiktsmessig? Skal det kreves egenbetaling fra mottakerne? Hva tjener den enkelte mottaker best på kort og lang sikt? Hvilke prioriteringer er nødvendige for å sikre velferdsstatens bærekraft på kort og lang sikt? fordeling, omfordeling og rasjonering

AB  - Teachers in general education are expected to cope with students with diverse needs. They might not always be ready or sufficiently supported to meet these challenges. The current study aims at identifying child, teacher and environmental barriers to inclusion. Specifically it addresses the importance of preschool teachers' attitudes as the human environment factor that may facilitate inclusion of children with disability, and teachers' major concerns about environmental accommodations that inclusion implies. The study assessed how teachers' attitudes towards inclusion of children with disability are affected by the teachers' personal characteristics and are related to the accommodations they deem necessary for admission of such children to their kindergartens. It also examined whether the teachers' attitudes and requirements for accommodations differ in respect of four groups of children's disabilities: learning disabilities, sensory/motor disabilities, ADHD, and emotional disabilities. Fifty-three preschool teachers completed the Attitudes toward Disabled Persons Scale (ATDP-A) and the Environmental Accommodations of School (EAS), which was designed especially for this study (Appendix 1). The teachers' requirements proved to correlate with various teachers' characteristics such as age, experience, education and personal contact with disability. Teacher's requirements for accommodations also highly correlated with environmental working conditions (e.g., working hours, number of children). Teachers were most concerned about accommodations for children with potential behavior problems. Implications for practice and education are discussed. (Contains 3 tables.)

AB  - Ellen Galinsky, Kelly Sakai, and Tyler Wigton explore the “time famine” among American workers—the continuing sense among employees of not having enough time to manage the multiple responsibilities of work and personal and family life. Noting that large shares of U.S. employees report feeling the need for greater workplace flexibility to enable them to take better care of family responsibilities, the authors examine a large-scale community-engagement initiative to increase workplace flexibility voluntarily. Using the 2008 National Study of the Changing Workforce as a primary source of data, the authors begin with an overview of the prevalence of flexibility in today’s American workplace. They track which categories of employees have access to various flexibility options, as well as the extent to which employees with access to various types of flexibility use those options. Findings from the study indicate that the majority of employees want flexibility but that access to it varies, with more advantaged employees—those who are well educated, have high salaries, and work full time, for example—being doubly advantaged in having greater access to flexibility. A number of employers, say the authors, tend to be skeptical of the value of workplace flexibility and to fear that employees will abuse it if it is offered. But the study data reveal that most employees use flexibility quite conservatively. When the authors use their nationally representative data set to investigate correlations between access to workplace flexibility and a range of workplace outcomes especially valued by employers—employee engagement, job satisfaction, retention, and health—they find that employers as well as employees can benefit from flexibility. Finally, the authors discuss When Work Works, a large, national community-based initiative under way since 2003 to increase voluntary adoption of workplace flexibility. The authors detail the conceptual basis of the project’s design, noting its emphasis on flexibility as one component of effective workplaces that can benefit employers, employees, and communities alike. Galinsky, Sakai, and Wigton conclude by drawing lessons learned from the project and briefly discussing the implications of using research to bring about workplace change.

AB  - This article presents results of a study of 229 kindergarten teachers who completed a survey designed to gather information about the current state of Michigan kindergartens. In addition to detailed data that reveals teachers' literacy instructional practices, teachers provided written responses to the following open-ended questions: What are the main issues facing kindergarten teachers? What, if anything, would make a difference in your ability to provide the type of program you would like to provide? What kind of professional development would be useful to kindergarten teachers? Teachers identified issues related to working conditions (time, class size, materials) and literacy instruction (autonomy for decision-making, developmental appropriateness of curriculum, student readiness, parental involvement in literacy, and professional development). Their patterns of response and vibrant words provide a window on the current kindergarten teaching experience and highlight the pull (or tensions) that many teachers experience in their instructional decision making because of the complex links between policy and practice. Implications for future policy makers and professional development based in principles of emergent literacy are discussed.

AB  - The National Task Force on Early Childhood Education for Hispanics was established in 2004 with the mission of developing recommendations for expanding and improving early childhood education for Hispanic children in ways that would enhance their school readiness and raise their academic achievement in the early years of school. On the basis of an extensive review of the evidence, the Task Force made recommendations that fell into 3 major categories: (a) increasing Hispanic children's access to high-quality early childhood programs, (b) increasing the number of early childhood teachers who speak Spanish and English and the number of second language acquisition specialists, and (c) increasing efforts to design, test, and evaluate language and literacy development strategies across the early childhood years.

AB  - Robust evidence suggesting a strong association between greater educational attainment, better health and lower mortality, has led to speculation that the quality of schooling can also have effects on health. This review critically summarises findings from 15 studies in a growing area of research concerning the effects of school quality on health. Findings suggested positive, long-term benefits of high-quality pre-school. Other findings suggested that higher teacher wages, lower pupil-teacher ratios, a longer school year, and higher college selectivity had mostly positive long-term effects on health and mortality. Several studies found that school quality modified the effect of years of completed education on various health outcomes. Some measures of school quality including smaller class size in relation to mortality, and higher college selectivity in the case of smoking were not consistently related to better health. While studies varied in their consistency and significance, the weight of the evidence together, suggests that some health inequalities over the life course were explained partly by differences in school quality. This may be related to improved cognition, occupational characteristics, and the incomes of those exposed to better quality schooling. Direct health knowledge and behaviour may also play a role.

AB  - Promoting young children's academic and developmental outcomes can no longer be achieved by the single efforts of one profession, but requires professionals to work together in inter-professional teams to understand the complexity of young children's lives. Collaboration in early childhood programs involves health professionals, educators, and other professionals sharing information, validating each other's roles, and providing input around which strategies promote positive outcomes for all children. There are, however, limited studies available within early childhood education on inter-disciplinary relationships between nurses and teachers. This paper helps to fill this void by exploring the relationship of an early childhood teacher and maternal and child health nurse working alongside one another in an Australian kindergarten. Through a narrative approach, a number of characteristics of the relationship were identified as key elements to a productive relationship. Findings are important for health professionals working with early childhood educators. By understanding the complexity within and between disciplines, professionals can work effectively to support young children and their families.

AB  - Within Victoria, Australia, although there are a number of health checks for children aged birth to 3.5 years, there are none between the age 3.5-5 years. This means children may not be identified to receive the necessary support for their development prior to starting school. Better ways of intervention are needed before children start school, given that there are limited opportunities for checks prior to starting school. This paper reports on an innovative project implementing a preschool health check by a maternal child health nurse and educator at a kindergarten in Victoria, Australia. Using a narrative informed case study involving the nurse, educator and 12 families of 3-5 year old kindergarten children, the results illustrate how the nurse and educator collaborative work on preschool health check is an important initiative for continuously involving families in extra health checks. The findings are discussed around the importance and benefits of introduction of the health check and how families support such an initiative. The paper concludes with acall for reflection on the implementation and effectiveness of child health checks in Victoria.

AB  - This licentiate thesis examines mathematical activities in a preschool. More precisely, the aim is to create knowledge of how mathematical activities emerge and are constructed in children's interactions with each other and with their teachers. The empirical material consists of video recordings and field notes collected through participant observations during a six-month period in two preschool units for children 3-5 years old. Theoretically the study is based on an ethnomethodological (EM) and conversation analytic (CA) perspective. Video recordings were analyzed using conversation analytic methods, involving a close and detailed analysis of sources in situated mathematical activities. Through the use of an EM and CA perspective this study contributes with new theoretical and methodological approaches to research on mathematical activities in preschools. In the close analysis of children's actions in interaction, an active child with ideas, interests, and commitment emerges, a child who uses a variety of communicative resources when participating in mathematical activities. Whether it is the children or the teachers who initiate the activity the children are actively involved in the construction of the mathematical content. Geometric shapes and concepts as well as different aspects of children's number sense are a couple of the mathematical topics covered in the study. In the activities the childrens display knowledge of math verbally as well as with their bodies, something that is analyzed by using the concept of epistemic stance. The preschool teachers sometimes used occasions when children display specific knowledge as an educational resource for other children's learning. The study also shows that children as well as their teachers follow each other's initiatives in the activities. This means that children change and enlarge the mathematical content within the activities and that the teachers follow the children's initiative. Through this reciprocity the mathematical content of the activity is maintained.

AB  - The aim of the dissertation is to contribute with knowledge about mathematizing in preschools, by empirically and analytically examining mathematizing as accomplished in children’s multimodal interactions with each other and their pedagogues in everyday activities. Theoretically and analytically the dissertation is based on an ethnomethodological and conversation analytic perspective (EM/CA) (e.g. Goodwin, 2000; Heritage, 1984), which highlights multimodal interaction and communication in social contexts. Mathematizing is defined as participation in mathematical discourse (Sfard, 2008). A special interest is directed to how preschool children use talk, embodied actions and other semiotic resources as they orient to mathematics in play and other activities. The dissertation is based on ethnographic fieldwork combined with video recordings of everyday mathematizing in two Swedish preschools with children 3–5 years old.The findings are presented in three studies. The first study examines how mathematical activities emerge in children’s interactions with each other and with their pedagogues. Whether it is the children or the pedagogues who initiate the activity, the children are shown to be actively involved in the construction of the emerging mathematical content. Geometric shapes as well as different aspects of number sense are a couple of the mathematical topics covered in the study. The second study explores children’s mathematizing in the block play area, with an interest in preschoolers’ displayed understandings of geometry (spatiality, shape, symmetry) (Seo, 2003). The study demonstrates how the participants orient to different spatial phenomena as they work with a construction toy. The children are shown to rely upon verbal and embodied resources such as deictics and pointing gestures as geometrical aspects are actualized in their interaction. The third study investigates mathematizing with an interest in how geometrical shapes are made relevant in interaction in two consecutive pedagogical activities: reading and painting. The results of the study demonstrate how naming (baptizing) (Sfard, 2008) of geometrical shapes are central in the two activities. In the painting activity an aesthetic dimension was actualized in the children’s discourse, that somewhat obscured the mathematical content in the activity. The study thus shows the complexity of the relations between the activities. Together the studies contribute with knowledge on preschool children’s everyday mathematizing, in particular children’s appropriation of a geometric discourse as it emerges in the unfolding flow of multimodal interaction. Through the use of an EM/CA perspective the dissertation contributes with new theoretical and methodological approaches to research on mathematics in preschools.

AB  - School-wide positive behavior interventions and supports (SW-PBIS) can effectively reduce problem behaviors and simultaneously increase pro-social behaviors in general education settings. SW-PBIS is not a “packaged” intervention, but a framework through which schools create systemic changes for promoting expected behaviors, while also monitoring and intervening with students who have behavior concerns through a tiered model of service delivery. A case study documenting the SW-PBIS implementation process in an alternative educational setting is presented. Alternative schools typically serve students who qualify to receive special education services, have a lower staff-to-student ratio, and often warrant more intensive student interventions as compared to general education settings. These differences from traditional environments pose unique challenges to the SW-PBIS implementation process. Suggestions for neutralizing these challenges such as providing enhanced Tier 1 supports and extensive staff training are explained in depth in this case study.

AB  - Teacher shortages are a pervasive global issue that is expected to continue, especially in low-performing, high-needs schools [O'Connor, E. A., Malow, M. S., & Bisland, B. M. (2011). Mentorship and instruction received during training: Views of alternatively certified teachers. Educational Review, 63(2), 219–232]. In an effort to meet the demand of qualified teachers and mediate the teacher shortage, governments have had to seek innovative methods to produce increasing numbers of certified teachers while preserving teacher quality. ‘In 2005, 122 alternative routes to teacher certification exist in the United States, in 47 of 50 states and the District of Columbia’ (National Center for Education Information, as cited in O'Connor et al. (2011). This paper will describe one alternative route to the licensure programme created, in collaboration between the local university and school district, to meet the demand for qualified early childhood teachers in a large school district in the Southwestern USA.

AB  - This study examined the extent to which characteristics of early childhood teachers and settings predicted observed teacher sensitivity. Participants included 41 head teachers at child care centers located in Northern California. Accreditation status, center size, and program quality were uniquely associated with teacher sensitivity. Accreditation was also associated with a number of other teacher (training, ethnic minority status, and depression) and setting characteristics (program quality, subsidies, and child ethnic minority enrollment). Other unique predictors included more teacher training, smaller center size, and perceived organizational health. Having a greater number of depressive symptoms or working in a larger center were identified as risks to teacher sensitivity, and were moderated by higher levels of teacher training and observed program quality. The current study provides preliminary support for the importance of examining the ways that teacher and setting characteristics are related to teacher interactions with young children.

AB  - The predictors of quality child care for toddler-age children were examined in 30 center-based and 22 family child care settings. Trained observers collected information on adult/child ratios, group size, use of planned activities, use of child-designed space, housekeeping activities, as well as completed the Arnett Caregiver Interaction Scale and the Infant-Toddler Environmental Rating Scale or the Family Day Care Rating Scale. Ninety-seven parents of toddlers and 28 caregivers responded to questions regarding their childrearing beliefs, social support networks, perceived stress levels, demographic characteristics, and the prosocial attributes of the toddlers. Higher quality care and sensitive caregiver-child interaction in centers were predicted by specialized training, higher adult-child ratio, and less perceived stress by caregivers. In family child care, use of child-designed space emerged as the best predictor of higher quality care. Family characteristics were not significant predictors of quality of care. Few relationships between toddler prosocial attributes and quality indicators were found. The average quality of care in both settings was in the minimal to adequate range.

AB  - The authors collected information from caregivers, trained observers, and parents to investigate quality elements in child-care programs designed for young children in center-based settings. Participants were 75 parents of children aged 15 to 36 mo and their caregivers; from 13 child-care centers in a southeastern state. Observers collected indicators of program quality and process and structural quality indicators, including adult-child ratio, group size, use of planned activities, use of child-designated space, housekeeping activities, and caregiver-child interactions. Participants responded to questions regarding their child-rearing beliefs, social support networks, perceived stress levels, and demographic characteristics. The best predictors of higher quality care and sensitive caregiver-child interaction in centers were specialized caregiver training, higher adult-child ratios, use of planned activities, and less perceived stress by caregivers.

AB  - Rates and predictors of preschool expulsion and suspension were examined in a randomly selected sample of Massachusetts preschool teachers ( N = 119). During a 12-month period, 39% of teachers reported expelling at least one child, and 15% reported suspending. The preschool expulsion rate was 27.42 per 1000 enrollees, more than 34 times the Massachusetts K-12 rate and more than 13 times the national K-12 rate. Suspension rates for preschoolers were less than that for K-12. Larger classes, higher proportion of 3-year-olds in the class, and elevated teacher job stress predicted increased likelihood of expulsion. Location in a school or Head Start and teachers' positive feelings of job satisfaction predicted decreased likelihood of expulsion. Expulsion was relatively rare in classes where both class size and teacher job stress were low. A higher proportion of Latino children in the class and lower teacher job satisfaction predicted an increased likelihood of suspension. Implications are discussed regarding policy, prevention, and future research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

AB  - Head Start likely will need to evolve in response to the dramatic growth of state-funded prekindergarten programs during the past two decades. A potential role for Head Start in the context of widespread public school involvement in prekindergarten would be to collaborate with state prekindergarten systems to provide the comprehensive services often missing from state early education models. Data from a nationally representative survey of lead teachers in a sample of 3898 randomly selected prekindergarten classrooms (81.0% response rate) are used to explore the strengths and challenges of implementation in Head Start, public school prekindergarten, and collaborative models. Although there exists considerable overlap in the quality of Head Start and public school prekindergarten classes, findings suggest that Head Start programs excel in providing comprehensive services and small class sizes and low student-teacher ratios; public school prekindergarten employs teachers with higher levels of education, and the collaborative model appears to represent most of the strengths and relatively few of the weaknesses of both models. Head Start and public school prekindergarten systems should explore creative ways to blend education and comprehensive services into a collaborative program greater than the sum of their respective components.

AB  - These data are from a cross-sectional survey of 756 parents with children in Grades 1–3, and 176 recreation program staff members in a multiethnic population in Hawaii. Questionnaires asked about skin cancer prevention practices (sunscreen use, covering up, shade seeking), knowledge, benefits and barriers, policies, and staff norms for prevention. The most important correlates of children's prevention practices were their parents' sun protection habits. Multiple regression models—which included knowledge, beliefs, program policies, and covariates related to sun protection—explained a total of between 38% and 41% of the variance in children's sun safety habits, 22% to 25% of parents' habits, and 24% of recreation staff members' sun safety habits. The models were less successful at predicting the use of hats, shirts, and shade seeking and a composite sun protection habits index. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In a study conducted in kindergartens in Israel, three "cultures" converge: the kindergarten, the community, and the home. The differences among the two kindergartens in this study do not reside solely in the urban vs. non-urban and Jewish vs. Arab. They also reside in the contexts created by the adults as a result of their beliefs about childhood, music, play, and education, and how these beliefs are expressed in their behaviours. This account draws on a larger ethnographic study conducted in a number of kindergarten settings. The aim of this larger study was to describe and understand the self-initiated musical expressions of children aged four to five years, who bring various cultural identities to the early years setting. The sites under scrutiny in this article were two kindergartens in Israel: a non-urban state-sponsored Jewish kindergarten, and an urban Arab kindergarten in a church-operated school. The evidence showed that the musical expressions of the children in the study shared many characteristics. It also showed that differences reside, not only in the culture of the community they belong to, but also in the culture of the kindergarten. This included the physical environment, the degree of structure in the timetable, and the attitudes and rationale of the staff. This article suggests that each kindergarten develops a particular style of musical play, and that inter-cultural issues can include those that are idiosyncratic to specific peer cultures.

AB  - This paper reports on the design, methodology, and results of a study of quality in 326 classrooms in 239 Canadian child care centers. This study, the largest and most extensive ever undertaken in Canada, used the Caregiver Interaction Scale (CIS) to rate the adult-child interactions in the classrooms and the Infant-Toddler Environment Rating Scale (ITERS) and the Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale-Revised (ECERS-R) to measure the quality of classroom learning environments. The observed staff members completed questionnaires on wages, working conditions, and satisfaction levels, and the center directors also completed questionnaires on center operations and finances. Path analyses revealed that in the infant/toddler rooms the number of adults in the observed classroom and the education level of the observed staff member were direct predictors of quality. In addition, there were three indirect predictors: parent fees, adult:child ratio, and use of the center as a student teacher practicum site. There were five significant direct predictors in the preschool classrooms: wages, education level, number of staff in the observed room, staff satisfaction, and whether the center received free or subsidized rent or utilities. The three indirect predictors were auspice, adult:child ratio, and parent fees. The interaction of distal and proximal factors is interpreted and applied to the development and implementation of public policy initiatives that can provide much-needed improvement to the overall mediocre levels of child care quality in Canada.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the quality of two types of Turkish early childhood education programs: private and public preschools. Three public and three private preschools in a district of Istanbul were randomly selected. The quality of preschools was assessed using the Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale developed by Harms et al. The preschools were visited by the researcher and were observed for a nine-hour school day. Observations indicate that activities such as daily routines, parent–teacher interactions, personal and professional needs are more appropriately handled by private preschool teachers than public preschool teachers. Shortcomings exist in both types of preschools in their physical class arrangements, authoritarian teacher child interactions, poor teacher– student ratio, and emphasis on structured and paper–pencil activities. Results suggest the need for Turkish preschool programs to be more child and family centered.

AB  - Examines the argument that an increase in the number of male teachers working at the early school levels would reduce the number of school-related problems for boys in the context of the social learning and cognitive developmental theories. Studies of children's performance and development in relation to teacher gender were critically reviewed. Findings do not support the hypothesis that male teachers reduce boys' problems in school.

AB  - Explored the appeal to 321 employed parents of various corporate-supported benefits and policies that enable parents to coordinate employment and child care. Survey results indicate that fathers as well as single and married mothers found corporate assistance with family matters to be desirable. Employer-supported child care benefits and work schedule policies could motivate a sizable number of employed parents to change jobs to receive such assistance. Ss' satisfaction with corporate benefits and policies was related to their job satisfaction, organizational commitment, experience of role strain, and frequency of health symptoms.

AB  - This paper focuses on the growing immigrant-born population of early childhood education and care (ECEC) workers in the Northern Territory of Australia, who represent a committed but poorly understood group within this workforce. The recent reforms to the ECEC workforce in Australia aim to achieve high-quality ECEC services by (a) growing this workforce size to meet the demand for services; (b) meeting the higher educator-to-children ratios; and (c) raising the overall level of qualifications of ECEC workers. By combining the statistical data in an innovative way, this paper shows that even when the growing numbers in this group are combined with newly qualified, immigrant-born and Australian-born entrants, the total number of workers may still be too small to fully implement recent reforms. It concludes by identifying data quality issues and future research directions that would help inform and develop a new strategy for the Northern Territory ECEC workforce.

AB  - This article presents the results of a study on professional development in Chilean state-funded early childhood education. Based on a multiple-case study design and drawing on qualitative methods we explored teachers' perspectives on professional development at two early childhood educational centers. Two centers' directors and four early childhood teachers employed at the two major institutions offering initial education in Chile described and discussed their experiences in a variety of professional development activities. Findings reveal that, although participants value professional development and have access to a wide range of activities, their experience of professional development could be improved in several ways. Conditions identified as critical to maximize the benefits derived from professional development include (a) access to ongoing training activities for a greater number of teachers, (b) greater duration and depth in professional development sessions, (c) more opportunities to receive training guided by experts, (d) more training focused in topics related to language and socioemotional development, (e) improvement of teacher's preservice education, and (f) improvement of working conditions. The article concludes with suggestions for teacher education programs, professional development designers, and policymakers, offered in the light of the results.

AB  - The Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale-Revised (ECERS-R) is widely used to associate child care quality with child development, but its validity for this purpose is not well established. We examined the validity of the ECERS-R using the multidimensional Rasch partial credit model (PCM), factor analyses, and regression analyses with data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Birth Cohort. The PCM identified rating category disordering, indicating previously unrecognized problems with the scale's response process validity. Factor analyses identified neither a single factor nor the ECERS-R six subscales, replicating prior research regarding the scale's structural validity. Criterion validity results were mixed, with small effect sizes for regressions predicting child outcomes and moderate effect sizes for regressions predicting teacher-reported quality. Our results lend empirical support to recent critiques of the ECERS-R, and we discuss implications for its future use and for the development of future measures.

AB  - Examined the effects of Adlerian parent study groups on Black, inner-city parents and their junior high school children, focusing on home behavior of children as perceived by parents and school attendance. 17 parents (median age 38.5 yrs), 95% of whom were female, participated in the training, which consisted of the standard Adlerian mode delineated by V. Soltz and R. Dreikurs (1964) and materials from a training kit developed by D. Dinkmeyer and G. MacKay (1976). Along with 13 nontrained control parents (mean age 41 yrs), Ss responded to behavioral assessments for children. Data were obtained from classroom teachers on number of days absent, number of days tardy, and the sum of these 2 figures. Results indicate that the children of trained Ss did not improve significantly more than the children of nontrained Ss in their perceived home behavior or school attendance. This degree of change was maintained at a 4-mo follow-up. Results are discussed in the context of cultural contrasts affecting previous research with White middle-class parents and elementary and preschool children.

AB  - Over the past 20 years, the number of teacher's aides in the United States has more than doubled, potentially in response to the growth of special education programs now taking place in general education schools. Surprisingly, little research at all has focused on the role that teacher's aides may play in improving student achievement, and no known study had examined this for students with disabilities. The author addressed this void by examining how teacher's aides link to achievement outcomes for students with disabilities in kindergarten. Using nationally representative data, the findings suggest that students with disabilities in full-day kindergarten have higher reading and mathematics outcomes at the end of kindergarten when the classroom has a teacher's aide. In contrast, there was no observed benefit for students with disabilities in part-day kindergarten. The size and strength of this relationship differs by individual characteristics and teacher and classroom characteristics. Implications are discussed.

AB  - This single-case study evaluated the effects of 2 levels of center-based behavioral intervention for a young male child with diagnoses of autism, severe attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), bipolar disorder, and severe developmental delay. The child entered an applied behavior analysis school and residential program at age 4 yrs. At that time he was receiving fluoxetine and valproic acid for control of challenging behavior. For the 1st (A) phase of the study, the teacher:student ratio was 1:1, and lasted 12 mo. Next, the teacher:student ratio became 1:2 (the B Phase), which continued for 9 mo. Then 1:1 intervention was reinstated. Dependent variables included out-of-seat behavior, aberrant behavior, motor imitation, stereotypic responses, matching to sample, and appropriate communication. By the end of phase A, substantial improvements were documented and fluoxetine was discontinued. Improvements were maintained for all dependent variables 3 mo into phase B, but after 6 mo, gains were maintained on only 1 dependent variable. Nine months after a return to phase A, improvements over B-phase levels were evident for 5 dependent variables. It is concluded that reducing treatment intensity prematurely may carry considerable risk of skill loss and behavioral deterioration. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In this essay we examine how educators work within a component of a class size reduction reform designed to strengthen the connections between families' home and school lives. We describe the accomplishments and struggles experienced by educators enacting this "lighted schoolhouse" based on our research in nine schools over three years. Specifically, we consider how educational resources are applied and experienced in schools and how opportunities to share knowledge between home and school are produced. We find educators' views of families' roles in schooling are shaped by how they are positioned by the context of the reform. (Contains 7 notes, 1 figure and 2 tables.)

AB  - The early childhood years serve as an essential foundation for subsequent literacy development. Despite the increased attention given to children's early literacy development, gaps remain in our understanding of what is actually taking place in child care programs across the nation. The purpose of this study was twofold: (1) to assess the extent to which early childhood educators engage children in literacy-building activities, and (2) to identify educator or programmatic characteristics associated with the promotion of early literacy activities in child care centers. One hundred and eighty surveys were completed by early childhood educators attending regional training events. Findings demonstrate that efforts are being made in a number of areas to engage children in a variety of important language and literacy activities in their centers; however, a sizable minority of those surveyed indicated that they do not frequently engage children in recommended activities. Multiple regression analysis suggests that certain characteristics related to the educator and program itself appear to have a positive influence on how often educators promote language and literacy activities in their centers: availability of print materials, the educator's confidence in the training received in basic literacy skills instruction, and the number of children cared for in a particular program. Implications for practitioners are discussed.

AB  - The temperament of 12 normal (4–24 mo old) and 43 developmentally delayed, Down syndrome, cerebral palsied, and audiovisually handicapped infants (7–35 mo old) were assessed by Ss' mothers, teachers, and an independent observer using the Carey Infant Temperament Questionnaire. Observers also rated Ss' temperament during classroom play interactions and during dyadic play interactions with the mothers and teachers. Although interrater agreement coefficients were moderately high, mothers rated Ss' temperament as less difficult than did the observers who, in turn, rated Ss as less difficult than did the teachers. Normal, developmentally delayed, and Down syndrome Ss were rated as having less difficult temperaments than cerebral palsied and audiovisually handicapped Ss on most dimensions during classroom play. The interaction context also affected temperament ratings, with "more difficult" ratings assigned during classroom play than during the dyadic interactions.

AB  - Acluster of three public schools was studied in an effort to assess students' attitudes toward and participation in science, and how they might vary by gender and grade. Two to three classes at each grade level from K–12 were surveyed to assess and compare attitudes toward science, extent of prior science-related experiences, and perceptions of science and scientists; each class also was observed to determine the relative numbers of teacher-student dyadic interactions related to each gender, as well as the proportions of girls and boys actively versus passively participating in laboratory activities. Overall, girls and boys expressed similar opinions on all survey scales, but girls were less likely to view science as a male-stereotyped field; younger students expressed more positive attitudes toward science than did older students. Girls also participated actively in science class: they initiated as many teacher interactions as did boys, but did not receive as much teacher attention; from elementary school to the early secondary years they also were as likely as boys to manipulate science equipment as to record data.

AB  - Assessed the influences of age, sex, and dominance on 121 3–6 yr old Ss' duration of unilateral stance. Ss were selected and judged by teachers as normal children. Ss were tested for eye, hand, and foot preference and were then classified on overall dominance. Maximal duration of unilateral stance, or up to 60 sec, was tested on each foot. Means over age groups showed progressive increase in duration of unilateral stance with increasing age. No sex differences were found. A stepwise multiple correlation-regression showed stance on the nondominant foot and age as the only significant variables in stance on the dominant foot. Findings may help in evaluating children for neurodevelopmental disorders. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Staff attributions for challenging behaviour are purported to relate to staff responses to such behaviour. To elucidate this relationship, much recent work has relied on eliciting staff attributions to written descriptions of a client engaging in challenging behaviour. However, current attribution theory suggests that eliciting attributions in relation to written descriptions is likely to be qualitatively different from attributions to known clients with challenging behaviour. Thirty-four staff completed the Challenging Behaviour Attribution Scale (CHABA) with respect to clients (aged 4-50 yrs) with whom they worked before, during and after completing a longitudinal course in assessment and intervention for challenging behaviour. Significantly more staff attributed challenging behaviour to negative reinforcement and self-stimulation after training. There was a significant reduction in the number of staff attributing challenging behaviour to positive reinforcement after training. However, a number of deficiencies in the CHABA were identified which may render interpretations inconclusive. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Over more than a decade, specialist Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) schools or classes for children with autism have developed in the UK and Ireland. However, very little is known internationally about how ABA is defined in practice in school settings, the characteristics of children supported in ABA school settings, and the staffing structures used. To answer these questions, the focus of the present research was a nationwide census of ABA schools throughout the UK. As far as it was possible to ascertain, we achieved a 100% return rate. There were 14 ABA schools and classes throughout the UK, supporting 258 children with autism, and employing 382 staff that supported ABA teaching. The mean ratio for ABA staff to children was 1.4 staff members: 1 child (range 0.7:1–2:1). The majority of all staff members were graduates or had a higher academic qualification (67.7%). This census methodology, if repeated, may help to identify future trends and can provide a baseline for developments in ABA schools/classes in the UK.

AB  - Background: Young children are an important focus of sun-protection efforts, but there has been relatively little study of sun-protection interventions developed for preschool-aged children and their parents. This paper reports on the evaluation of Sun Protection is Fun! (S.P.F.), designed to improve parents' practices and psychosocial outcomes related to protecting preschool children from sun exposure. Methods: A group-randomized trial was conducted in 20 preschools to evaluate the S.P.F. parent intervention that included a video, newsletters, and handbooks. A separate, on-site intervention for preschool staff aimed to create a preschool climate that encouraged parents' sun protection for their children. Cross-sectional samples of parents completed surveys at baseline (n = 384), 12 months (n = 640), and 24 months (n = 694). Results: S.P.F. demonstrated significant effects on parents' sun-avoidance strategies at 12 months (P < .05) and sunscreen use at 24 months (P < .05). There were significant intervention effects on parents' sun-protection knowledge (P < .001), perceived norms of teachers' sunscreen use (P < .001), sunscreen impediments (P < .05), and sunscreen expectancies (P < .05) at 12 months. Parents' perceived norms of teacher sunscreen use were significantly improved at 24 months (P < .001). Conclusions: More intense intervention strategies may need to complement take-home materials to result in greater effects on parents' sun protection for their children.

AB  - The preschool is an important yet understudied setting for sun-protection interventions. This study evaluates the effects of Sun Protection is Fun! (SPF) on preschool staff behavioral and psychosocial outcomes related to protecting children from sun exposure. Twenty preschools participated in a 2-year, group-randomized trial to evaluate SPF, a behavioral intervention grounded in social cognitive theory and designed to be more extensive than previous preschool sun-protection interventions. The staff intervention included training, a video, newsletters, a curriculum, and sunscreen. Cross-sectional samples of staff completed surveys at baseline (N = 245), a 12month intervention assessment (N = 192), and a 24-month intervention assessment (N = 225). At the 12-month and 24-month assessments, significant behavioral effects were seen for use of sunscreen, protective clothing, and shade. Knowledge, self-efficacy, and norms were among the psychosocial variables most affected by the intervention. This study demonstrates that the SPF intervention is effective in improving staff outcomes related to children's sun protection.

AB  - Background We examined whether children cared for by stressed caregivers show lower socio-emotional well-being and more stress, compared with children cared for by less stressed caregivers. Methods Perceived stress and cortisol levels of professional caregivers ( n= 44), and associations with children's ( n= 44) well-being and cortisol levels in home-based child care were examined. Results Caregiver perceived stress and cortisol levels were related to children's well-being but not to children's cortisol levels. Children's social fearfulness acted as a moderator between caregivers' mean ratio of diurnal change in cortisol and children's well-being. When caregiver cortisol levels decreased, more fearful children were reported higher on well-being than less fearful peers. In contrast, when caregiver cortisol levels increased, more fearful children were reported lower on well-being. Conclusions The findings point to differential susceptibility. Child care organizations and parents need to notice that a non-stressful child care environment is in particular important for children with a difficult temperament.

AB  - In previous historical studies on preschools, the main sources are texts; photos are used merely as illustrations. Inspired by the idea to use visual materials to study the look of the past by scrutinising historical photos and films of naptime in preschool, this article will shed light on preschool as an institution and on the materiality of naptime practices. The data comprise of historical photographs and films from the period 1900–1970 (in total 14 films and approximately 200 photographs that, in one way or the other, depict naptime: adult and child interaction, the beds' constructions, the material organization of rooms and naptime routines). By using visual analyses, visualizations and the notion of path dependence, the article shows how the everyday practice of napping was carried out in the historical preschool in relation to questions of continuity and change. The results suggest that the design of beds, as child-sized and easy to move and store, can be understood as defining the institution as a preschool with play and educational practices as its main purpose. At the same time, however, the beds themselves indicate that care, as sleep or napping, was an essential practice in historic preschools.

AB  - Reviews the book, La dyslexie démystifiée by Marie-France Maisonneuve and Sébastien Normand (2011). Dyslexia is a learning disability that even today is not well known and often diagnosed late. While scientific knowledge has advanced greatly, professional practices have not kept pace. Marie-France Maisonneuve, a remedial teacher, and Sébastien Normand, professor of clinical child psychology, have written this book to improve opportunities for dyslexic children. They can be proud of their work. Clear and understandable, the book is addressed to teachers and parents but it also offers useful information for professionals. In Ontario and Quebec, dyslexia is rarely diagnosed before the age of seven or eight. The authors insist on the importance, beginning in kindergarten, of identifying children who may have difficulty learning to read and write and they suggest an evaluation approach for parents and professionals. The most important chapter provides a detailed description of different strategies for motivating a child to read and write, to overcome problems of self-esteem and avoid discouragement when compared to other students. This is a book that will help parents of a child diagnosed with dyslexia to understand the steps that can be taken at home and in school to support a child who has difficulty learning to read and write.

AB  - Collaboration represents the means by which family-centered early intervention services emerge in relation to a child with a disability. As with any relationship, the interactions between parents and early intervention service providers are influenced by numerous variables. Sensitivity to family uniqueness, empathic communications, and positive beliefs about the child with the disability and the family are among the documented factors contributing to constructive interactions (Dinnebeil & Rule, 1994). In contrast, a factor impeding productive relationships relates to stereotypical assumptions by the early intervention professional. While parental response research supports varying reactions to a child with a disability, some investigations suggest that professionals may use the more stereotypical belief that parents typically experience heightened distress. The purpose of this study was to document response variations through comparing groups of parents of preschoolers with disabilities to a control group. In addition to more traditional analyses, distributions of responses and normative comparisons were employed. Results supported a range of response in all three groups of parents. Implications for early intervention professionals and approach to family assessments are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

AB  - The objective of this small study was to elicit responses from early childhood teachers in India on mathematics learning strategies and to measure the extent of finger counting technique adopted by the teachers in teaching young children. Specifically, the research focused on the effective ways of teaching mathematics to children in India, and examined teachers' approach to number counting. In India, children were taught by their parents or by their teachers to use fingers to count. The qualitative study conducted by the researcher further enriched the topic with first-hand comments by the teachers. Although the finger counting method was not the only process that teachers would adopt, it was embedded in the culture and taken into consideration while infusing mathematics skills. The teachers confirmed adopting the Indian method of finger counting in their teaching strategy; some specified that the method helped children to undertake addition and subtraction of carrying and borrowing, as counting by objects could not be available all the time. Although the study is limited by its small sample to the unique mathematics learning experience in India, it provides readers with a glimpse of culturally responsive teaching methods and an alternative mathematics teaching strategy.

AB  - This study provides a census of full-time virtual schools and blended schools from 35 states. Specifically, it utilizes data visualization and exploratory data analysis to examine student demographics and school performance measures of virtual schools and blended schools operating in the 2014-15 school year. The school achievement measures for both virtual and blended schools indicate these schools are performing poorly. Nevertheless, the evidence suggests that their enrollment growth continues. Large virtual schools operated by for-profit education management organizations (EMOs) dominate this sector and are increasing their market share. While more districts are opening their own virtual and blended schools, the schools are typically small, and with limited enrollment. The proportion of Black and Hispanic students in virtual schools is lower than the national average, while students enrolled in blended schools more closely resemble the race and ethnic characteristics of students enrolled in brick-and-mortar public schools nationwide. Virtual and blended schools, while serving students in kindergarten through grade 12, have higher concentrations at the elementary and secondary levels. The empirical work in this area is in its infancy; hence, this study seeks to contribute to both the conceptual and empirical implications of virtual and blended schools by embracing a balance between their public and private benefits.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the quality of the literacy environment in inclusive early childhood special education (ECSE) classrooms ("N" = 54). The first aim was to describe the quality of the literacy environment in terms of structure (i.e., book materials and print/writing materials) and instruction (i.e., instructional support). The second aim was to examine the interrelationships among teacher and classroom factors and the quality of the literacy environment. Results showed that, on average, the quality of the structural literacy environment was low to moderate, and the quality of the instructional literacy environment was generally low. Only one factor, the number of children who were dual-language learners, related to the quality of the structural literacy environment, whereas the quality of the instructional literacy environment was positively associated with two teacher-level factors (teacher education and self-efficacy) and negatively associated with one teacher-level factor (the number of language and literacy workshops attended). Study findings suggest the need to examine ways to improve the literacy environment of ECSE classrooms and to better understand sources of variance with respect to the literacy environment.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between pre-school teachers' discipline beliefs and normative-humanistic orientations. The sample consisted of 156 female pre-school teachers from public (89%) and private (12%) pre-schools in the western Anatolian region of Turkey. A Polarity Scale consisting of 45 items related to normative-humanistic orientation, a Beliefs on Discipline Inventory consisting of seven paired items related to low-high discipline orientation, and a general survey questionnaire were administered to participants. The results from comparisons of the total scores of the two scales show a positive and significant relationship between low- high discipline beliefs and normative-humanistic attitudes. The results and correlations between discipline beliefs, normative-humanistic attitudes of the teachers and background variables such as satisfaction level with occupation, beliefs about the prestige of teaching, age, seniority, type and the properties of the institution, age of students, and in-service training opportunities were discussed with reference to teachers' personality characteristics and belief systems.

AB  - Background: There is a high risk that young children who show early signs of mental health problems develop symptoms in the same or overlapping areas some years later. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is widely used to screen externalizing and internalizing problems early in life. In Sweden 80-90% of all children aged 1-5 years go to preschool and preschool is thus an appropriate context for finding early signs of mental health problems among children. Methods: This study is part of a longitudinal project too investigate the frequency of emotional and behavioural problems for children between 1 and 5 years of age in Sweden. The SDQ including the impairment supplement questions were rated by preschool teachers too establish Swedish norms for SDQ in preschool children. Results: The sample involved 815 children with a mean age of 42 months (SD = 16, range 13-71 months). 195 children were followed longitudinally for three years. There were significant differences between boys and girls on all subscales except for the Emotional subscale. The prevalence of behavioural problems was similar to other that in European countries, except for Prosocial behaviour, which was rated lower, and Conduct problems, rated higher. Swedish children were estimated to have more problems in the preschool setting, scored by preschool teachers. The development of behaviour over time differed for the different subscales of SDQ. Conclusions: The teacher version of the SDQ, for 2-4 year-olds, can be used as a screening instrument to identify early signs of emotional distress/behavioural problems in young children. Preschool teachers seem to be able to identify children with problematic behaviour with the use of SDQ at an early age. The development of behaviour over time differs for the different subscales of SDQ. The Swedish norms for SDQ are to a large extent, similar to findings from other European countries.

AB  - Purpose: Early Childhood Education in Sweden and the Nordic countries has a long tradition of social pedagogical policy in which learning; play and care, are made integrated (Bennet, 2010). Now there are indications that this situation is changing dramatically which this article aims to investigate. The study highlights Swedish Early Childhood Education policy as an assemblage in which neoliberal governance is produced through and within policy networks (Brown, 2009). The purpose of this article is to investigate the productive forces that create and produce assemblages within this policy governance, how they formulate and transform Swedish Early Childhood Education policy. The concept of assemblage (Deleuze and Guattari, 1983) is useful to conceptualize policy making and make it possible to analysis the moving elements; connections of discourses and materiality that forms different forces and trajectories and how they work to form and transform policy. Methodology: The study is conducted using a policy assemblage approach (Savage, 2018). In order to work with a policy assemblage approach, I have to get away from hierarchical forms of thinking and understanding. Instead, I am using the concept of "rhizome" that regards social formations as multidirectional and never ending together with lines. The concept of lines helps me to think about how policy moves and transfer through a process of assemblage and re-assemblage and explore the ways in which early childhood education policy in Sweden may, or may not be stabilized (Clarke, 2015). Lines are like trajectories of components which create productive relationships with a number of potentialities and realisations. The analytical work is conducted by following and mapping the lines of forces that create and shape Early Childhood Education assemblage, not on the policy itself Findings: In the ongoing analysis I have identified sex lines which try to create a new Early Childhood Education assemblage and one line of resistance. The lines that try to create a new assemblage are: a. Neuroscience b. Teaching, c. Digitalisation d. Disciplinary didactics (mathematics language - literacy, science) and e. Evidence based research and practice, f. revised curriculum 2019. The line of resistance is created by the large number of preschool teachers who argues that teaching in preschool is synonymous with learning and co-construction of knowledge. This point of departure is criticized by the Swedish School Inspectorate (2016). Taken together shows this assemblage an major policy flow in a direction towards individualisation, bioscience, digitalisation and didactisation of early years. Contributions: The study illustrates a changing landscape of Swedish Early Childhood Education and contributes to an analysis showing significant changes of policy in a direction towards an educational assemblage consisting of: individualisation, bioscience, and digitalisation and didactic. This new policy assemblage raises questions about inequality and stands in sharp contrast to the Nordic model based on social pedagogy, play, learning and care. To make use and think through policy assemblage, the assemblage perspective both complement and develop policy studies and offers analytical and methodological opportunities by placing the policy making into politics of translation and assemblage within neoliberal governance.

AB  - Mental health problems often debut in early childhood and may last throughout adulthood, thereby making early detection and intervention especially important. The overarching aim of the present thesis was to identify patterns of emotional and behavioural problems indicating mental health problems in preschool children. To facilitate the detection of such problems early on, one available screening instrument Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), was validated. The development and interaction of externalising problems in preschool children were studied over time. Functioning and behaviour and their relations to protective and risk indicators in both environmental and personal characteristics were explored. The long-term goal was to increase knowledge about early identification of emotional and behavioural problems in preschool children in order to facilitate early intervention. In Study I (n=690), the subscales Hyperactivity and Conduct Problems were shown to be valid for children in the age group 1–3 years. A reasonable level of validity was found for the age group 4–5 years when using the original SDQ four-factor solution. The preschool teachers considered most of the SDQ items relevant and possible to rate. Based on the results of Study II (n=815), a score of ≥12 on the SDQ Total Problems Scale is recommended as a cut-off for Swedish preschool children. There were significant differences between boys and girls on all subscales except for the Emotional subscale. The Swedish norms for SDQ are to a large extent similar to findings from other European countries. Study III (n=195) showed that preschool children’s conduct problems decrease over time. Children exhibiting more initial hyperactivity (at year 1) have less reduction in conduct problems over time, i.e. the more hyperactivity early in life, the more conduct problems at year 3. In Study IV (n=197), children high in engagement and social interaction function well over time, even in the presence of hyperactivity, while children with low engagement and interaction alone or in combination with hyperactivity and conduct problems continue to have problems. Stability was related to the existence of a larger number of protective or risk indicators respectively. Taken together, this thesis has shown that the SDQ can be used to identify preschool children at risk of developing mental health problems later in life.

AB  - The aim of the research project is to analyze and describe how pre-school teachers during an in-service training period develop theoretical knowledge about focusing the content when planning for teaching science in pre-school. The variation theory is used for analysis as well as for the planning for teaching in pre-school. The theory can be described in terms of learning object, critical aspects, discernment, simultaneity and differences. 30 pre-school teachers from nine different municipalities participated in the project. The empirical material consists of a questionnaire as the preschool teachers answered in the beginning and in the end of the training period and of group reports. The results can be discussed as a number of critical aspects in relation to teachers'learning as: ways of understand the concept of variation, to discern the object of learning and to discern o shared space of learning.

AB  - Drawing on new materialist thought (Barad 2003, 2007, 2010, 2011, 2014), this study explores preschool children’s gendered becomings as they play and explore together with two large boulders in a natural setting. The study takes its point of departure in emergent science (Siraj-Blatchford 2001) which refers to science as a social practice that is already explored by children’s daily play. Data for the project was constructed during a field study in a Swedish preschool with 25 five-year old children. The focus of the field study was the children’s play and explorations together with the preschool environment, during activities not specifically guided by teachers. The findings show how also natural materials, as the boulders in this study, can take part in and shape, both the children’s scientific explorations and their gendered becomings. This means that the ways that a child managed to explore and become was dependent on if and how the child managed to co-act and play together with the boulders and friction. However, not only the boulders, but also gender norms functioned as co-creators in this process. This goes against the common thought of children’s play in nature as “free and equal”, a notion that is not often questioned. Studies exploring children’s play and learning outdoors often lack gender perspectives, especially when science is also in focus. One of the article’s conclusions is the need for preschool teachers to engage in how children explore emergent science together with the natural/ material-discursive surroundings. That is, how different natural materials co-act with gender norms in different ways, moment by moment, and thus enable or prevent children from engaging with science and scientific phenomena.

AB  - Research topic/Aim: This paper focuses on the division of labor regarding special educational needs coordinators (SENCOs) and preschool teachers who work with children in need of special support. The overall purpose of the study is to increase knowledge concerning work with children who are deemed to be in need of special support in preschool. The main study consists of two separate studies. The first study helps to visualize SENCOs´ tasks, perceptions and role. In study II, a particular focus is on how preschool teachers perceive the jurisdiction of work related to children in need of special support and how tasks negotiated in relation to the work of SENCOs.Theoretical framework: A theory of professions, primarily based on Abbott (1988), is used to understand SENCOs´ occupational role and work, especially in the light of Abbott's reasoning concerning jurisdictional control and division of expert labor.We are also interested in SENCOs´ perceptions, therefore it is relevant to use different perspectives on special education. In this study, we use Persson´s (1998) terms, categorical and relational perspective, to understand how SENCOs and preschool teacher explain causes of children’s difficulties.Methodological design: The first study is part of a total population study where all SENCOs in Sweden (n= 4252) who were examined by the examination acts of years 2001, 2007, and 2008 were sent a questionnaire. In a later phase of the procedure, the responses from SENCOs working towards preschool were extracted from the 3190 responses received and reported earlier. Thus, this study consists of 523 participants (i.e. 16.4 % of the 3190 respondents).The second study consists of interviews with preschool teachers about their work with children in need of special support and how they describe their cooperation with SENCOs.Expected conclusions/findings: The results show that SENCOs’ working hours are primarily spent on consultation. They regard their possibilities to influence their colleagues' views on children's difficulties as high. Regarding SENCOs’ perceptions of why children have difficulties in preschools, a large number of SENCOs indicate that it is because preschool is poorly prepared to handle children's differences.The second study is currently in the analyzing process. However, preliminary results indicate that preschool teachers have great confidence in SENCOs’ work.Relevance for Nordic Educational Research: This study examines SENCOs’ work in Swedish preschools. It is relevant to compare and discuss their role within a Nordic context. Earlier studies indicate that Nordic Countries are similar when it comes to the role and work of SENCOs (Takala &amp; Ahl, 2014). However, little is known about SENCOs’ work in preschools.

AB  - This article studies the role of working conditions and health for elderly female day-care teachers’ decision to enter early retirement. Entry into retirement is analysed in a duration framework that allows for unobserved heterogeneity in the baseline hazard. Data are from a Danish longitudinal data set based on administrative register records for 1997–2006. Working conditions are measured by four indicators. First, work pressure is measured by the child-to-teacher ratio, which varies across municipalities and over time. Second, working conditions are measured by the proportion of children with a problematic social background. Third, the share of trained teachers is considered an indicator of working conditions. And fourth, the size of the institution is assessed as an indicator of working conditions. Regressions in a duration model framework show that there is no significant relationship between the child-to-teacher ratio or the size of the institution and early retirement. However, working conditions measured by the social background of the children and the share of trained day-care teachers have a significant effect on the probability of early retirement. Finally, a poor health condition is associated with a higher propensity to enter early retirement. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

AB  - The literature on occupational health points to work pressure as a trigger of sickness absence. However, reliable, objective measures of work pressure are in short supply. This paper uses Danish day care teachers as an ideal case for analysing whether work pressure measured by the child-to-teacher ratio, that is, the number of children per teacher in an institution, affects teacher sickness absenteeism. We control for individual teacher characteristics, workplace characteristics, and family background characteristics of the children in the day care institutions. We perform estimations for two time periods, 2002–2003 and 2005–2006, by using generalized method of moments with lagged levels of the child-to-teacher ratio as instrument. Our estimation results are somewhat mixed. Generally, the results indicate that the child-to-teacher ratio is positively related to short-term sickness absence for nursery care teachers, but not for preschool teacher

AB  - This study examined the relationship between mothers' child care subsidy use and their earnings and labor force attachment. Using Wisconsin administrative data, this study examined 48months of subsidy use for mothers who became eligible for child care subsidies between March 2000 and February 2001 (n=8984). Comparing subsidy-eligible mothers who received subsidies and those who were eligible but did not, we estimated the likelihood of experiencing an increase (or decrease) in earnings and the likelihood of experiencing an increase (or decrease) in the number of quarters employed. We used multinomial regression models to estimate each economic outcome separately and used logistic regression models to estimate both of the outcomes together. In both separate and joint analyses of earnings and quarters employed, we found that subsidy receipt was associated with an increase in the probability of an increase in earnings and/or number of quarters employed and a decrease in the probability of a decrease in quarters employed. However, in general, these associations were only significant when mothers received a subsidy for 12months or more. These findings suggest the importance of identifying potential barriers to subsidy use, as stable receipt of subsidies may contribute to parents' economic well-being.

AB  - Swedish leisure-time centres were formerly part of Swedish social and family policies but were transferred to an educational context in the 1990s. This transfer was accentuated by both the Education Act of 2010 and the new teacher training established in 2011, which also included education particularly directed for leisure-time centres. The state's intention with this discursive shift was to highlight education and learning within the activity in a more distinct way. This article is based on an ethnography-inspired study at one leisure-time centre called the Sunflower. The data are based on six weeks of field work including participating observations, field notes and walk-and-talk conversations. The study takes its point of departure from representations by staff concerning what they emphasise regarding the centre's activity, how these representations are related to each other and which strategies staff members use when talking about and monitoring the pupils' activities. The results show the strong presence of older traditions concerning values and practices regarding the performance at work: supporting children with good care, stressing the importance of children's free play and using a peripheral subject position during work. The results also show that a stress on the child-to-staff ratio as circumscribing the activity which is enhanced by the pupils misallocated age distribution.

AB  - "Teacher turnover," the number of teachers who leave a program during a year has numerous detrimental effects that can lower the quality of care received by children and families. High rates of teacher turnover, high child-to-adult ratios, and poorly trained staff characterize poor-quality child care in the United States. In fact, high rates of teacher turnover may be a consequence of low program quality. In this article, the authors discuss and identify the causes, consequences and solutions of teacher turnover in child care.

AB  - In the modern western world, the discursive construction of fatherhood and everyday fathering practices has been underpinned by the spatial separation of work from home, of public from private. However, increasing numbers of employees are now working from home and a disproportionate number of these are men with young children. This article draws on new empirical research to examine the implications for fathers and for organizations as home-working disrupts earlier spatial configurations of fatherhood and fathering practices. The article concludes that as the spatial boundaries between home and work collapse, new accommodations between fatherhood/fathering and organization are emerging. However, these are underpinned by a traditional gender division of labour in the household. More broadly, these findings confirm the inadequacy of static distinctions between public and private, showing that while such distinctions are still used to mark space and time, this is relational, contingent and unstable.

AB  - Discusses the language (verbal skills) aspect of social competence by (1) providing a rationale for the relationship between verbal behavior and social competence; (2) describing 2 problem areas that hinder the attainment of functional verbal skills, and thus enhanced social competence; (3) offering a common solution to both problems; and (4) providing an experimental demonstration of a simple application of the recommended solution with preschool developmentally delayed children. The objective of the demonstration was to teach 3 female children (aged 4 yrs 9 mo to 5 yrs 5 mo) to use vocalizations to request desired materials or events. Two Ss had Down's syndrome; most of their vocalizations were unintelligible. The 3rd S vocalized more frequently than the other 2 Ss, but her speech was also unintelligible and she seldom initiated speech to obtain desired materials. Results indicate that by introducing delays (i.e., simply waiting) during predetermined opportunities, teachers substantially increased the number of vocal requests initiated by the 3 Ss.

AB  - The objective was to explore the relationship between staff related variables and patient outcome in day treatment programmes for patients with personality disorders. The importance of staff size, skill mix and treatment intensity (hours of treatment per week) was examined, in addition to location-specific effects. Multi-centre data routinely collected under non-experimental conditions from nine units, all members of a cooperative network in Norway, were analysed using a multilevel analysis. The data set consisted of treatment unit characteristics for the period 1993-2005, constituting an unbalanced panel of 71 units, together with information from 1574 patients who completed day treatment according to the plan. Patient outcome was measured by change in Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF). Twelve per cent of variation in patient outcome was attributed to the treatment unit level. Staff size and treatment intensity influenced outcome to a minor extent, while an increased proportion of nurses or other college-educated personnel was associated with improved patient outcome. A positive location-specific effect was found in one unit attached to a university. Potential cost savings seem to be apparent with respect to staff size and, to some extent, skill mix.

AB  - The main issue of this work concerns the meaning of educational supervisionas a tool for collaborative work-related knowledge formation in preschool.The study is based upon and complements the analysis of the phenomenoneducational supervision in a previous study presented in my previousbook Det mångtydiga mötet – ett försök att förstå komplexiteten i pedagogiskhandledning med yrkesverksamma [The many folded encounter – anattempt to understand the complexity in collaborative educational supervision].Supervision dialogues are in the focus as one of several tools for developingthe content of knowledge in preschool, the knowledgebase of the professionals,and their coping with professional issues within their daily work.These two studies together form my licentiate treatise. For studying the phenomenon,two perspectives have been used: a societal and an inter-subjectiveperspective. Educational supervision, as an epistemic culture, is analysed inrelation to an emerging knowledge society.The implementation of a new curriculum for preschool, with its model forparticipatory goal-steering, has been the basis for the analysis of the supervisionprocess as an activity for knowledge formation. The analysis is relatedto curriculum theory. Issues related to power are crucial in contexts for supervision.These are analysed with regards to the participators in the supervisiondialogue on the one hand, and to institutional actors, e.g. the relationshipbetween university and preschool and between the professionals in a localpreschool and the administrative level of the municipality, on the other. Thefundamental premise of the work has been that supervision is to be conductedon the conditions of those being supervised.The study relies on previous experiences of and reflections on supervisionas well as on consultee-centered case consultation. Further material and methodsused for the study are interviews with supervisors and supervised, andtextual analysis of contemporary educational literature on supervision. Thelatter includes both a close and a distanced re-reading of my above mentionedbook. Educational supervision of professionals seems to have developedinto a specific domain within the field of supervision. As a result of the review,supervision was categorised as three approaches with regards to their respectiveoverarching goal.The potentially positive and negative effects of supervision, as well assome pitfalls, have been identified. The conclusions concern criteria for goodsupervision that contribute to a dialogue for knowledge formation within aninter-subjective perspective. An inter-subjective relation, with an object forsupervision that is negotiated with regards to autonomy as well as reciprocalityis emphasized. A narrative strategy for supervision is seen as a possibilityfor developing a professional language and a domain for further investigations.

AB  - In the United States, an increasing number of new teachers are being prepared through alternative, or early entry, routes into teaching. These new forms of teacher preparation raise important questions about how and in what ways candidates are being prepared, particularly in key areas such as classroom management. To shed light upon these questions, this paper draws upon data from a larger study of teacher preparation in New York City which is engaged in examining the features of both alternative and traditional pathways into teaching. This paper uses qualitative data regarding preparation required by 31 childhood teacher education programs and survey data from 460 program graduates, to analyze new teachers' preparation for classroom management in New York City. We found that less than half of the traditional programs required any coursework in classroom management. Early entry candidates were more likely to have had a course in classroom management. The paper also reports survey findings regarding teachers' reports of their opportunities to learn, which suggest that teachers in traditional programs may encounter more foundational knowledge in such courses, while early entry teachers may have more opportunities to learn practical, concrete strategies.

AB  - Essay 1: This paper investigates whether mandatory activation programs for welfare recipients have effects on welfare participation, employment and disposable income. In contrast to earlier studies, we are able to capture both entry and exit effects. The empirical analysis makes use of a Swedish welfare reform in which the city districts in Stockholm gradually implemented mandatory activation programs for individuals on welfare. On average, we find that mandatory activation of welfare recipients increases employment as well as disposable income. However, these sizes of the estimated effects must be considered relatively small. There are some indications of larger effects for single-headed households.Essay 2: This study tests whether individuals who grow up with parents on welfare benefits are themselves more (or less) likely to be welfare recipients as young adults, compared to individuals who grow up in non-welfare households. We use the sibling difference method to identify causal effects separately from the effects of correlated factors. While a descriptive analysis reveals a fairly high positive intergenerational correlation, especially in the late teens and conditional on a large set of household level factors, the sibling analysis provides no support for a causal effect of parents’ welfare benefit receipt on children’s future welfare use.Essay 3: Spending on health care makes up a large proportion of the GDP in Sweden as in most developed countries. The introduction of private alternatives and more competition in the market have been advanced as a way to increase efficiency and patient choice, but the previous literature contain conflicting evidence regarding the quality impact of market reforms in health care. This paper examines the impact on health care quality of reforms aimed at introducing more competition in the market for primary health care. The analysis is performed using cross-county variation in private supply and the financial incentives provided by the health care organization in Sweden 1998 to 2010. The analysis separates between measures of quality which are easily observed by patients and measures intended to capture medical quality, which are more difficult for patients to assess. The results indicate that the reforms intended to increase competition do not seem to improve the overall quality of primary health care. Increased competition in the market is associated with more visits to the primary health care, but otherwise, the results give no support for effects on availability or patient satisfaction. The results on clinical quality do not indicate any consistent evidence of any impact of competition either.Essay 4: This paper investigates differences in worker absence between privately and publicly employed workers in Swedish primary schools and preschools. Using hive-offs, i.e., ownership changes from a public to a private owner, I analyze the effects of private versus public employment on sickness absence, parental leave, and temporary leave for care of children. The empirical analysis suggests a substantial negative effect on sickness absence in preschools, but not in primary schools. For parental leave and temporary parental leave for care of children, no significant effects are found in either industry. The fact that parental leave, which is voluntary to a greater extent than sickness absence, seems to be unaffected by ownership opposes the argument of stronger incentives for effort in the private sector. However, the finding of a negative effect on sickness absence suggests that private employment may be associated with better work conditions, at least for workers in the preschool sector.

AB  - This article takes a starting point in the idea that science in preschool would benefit from starting with children’s questions and situations in preschool everyday life. In a previous study preschool teachers have collected such questions and everyday situations in their own preschool practice. A content analysis was performed resulting in a number of different categories describing the potential science content. With the present study we want to contribute to a deepened understanding of how preschool teachers view the possibility to work with science starting from different kinds of questions and situations in preschool everyday life. The data were collected in focus group interviews with preschool teachers who were asked to evaluate different questions/situations (collected in the previous study) in respect to the extent they could work as starting points for science learning situations. The results show that the preschool teachers put forward different kinds of reasons when discussing whether or not the questions/situations could work as a starting point for science learning. These reasons are discussed in relation to policy documents as well as earlier results in the research field concerning science and preschool.

AB  - In Sweden of today and Europe, there is a lively debate about the reception and education of migrating children, young people and adults (Nilsson & Bunar 2015; Nilsson Folke 2015). The educational challenges have often been conceptualized and explained as a problem of difference in culture, ethnicity and language of the migrant children (León-Rosales 2010; Lunneblad 2013; Nilsson & Bunar 2015). Bouakaz, (2009), for instance, shows that in meeting the newly arrived families, it is the differences that are conceptualized as problematic. The position of the child’s mother tongue is a basic factor affecting access to education and school success (Ball 2011). Intercultural school development is a fundamental condition for democratic societies, and a priority in European policy today (Council of Europe 2007, 2015, 2016). The project at hand aims to address the demands of a changing educational landscape and broaden the picture of the situation of children and families with an immigrant background from a civic perspective. The project focuses newly arrived children’s first encounter with the Swedish educational system in the context of preschool. There are few studies on newly arrived children in the Swedish preschool. According to Tallberg Broman et al. (2015) focus on diversity, migration and ethnicity is also limited in relation to preschool. The forms of early childhood education and care vary greatly across Europe (European Commission, 2015). In Sweden, preschool is part of the overall education system. It has its own national curriculum, as well as formal university level training requirements for preschool teachers. Since the 1970s, preschool has played an important part of Swedish integration policy (Lunneblad 2013), and today an intercultural approach is emphasized (Skolverket 2010). In 2011, one in five preschool children had a different first language than Swedish and this number is increasing. Only in 2015, more than 16,000 children between one and six with the right to attend preschool and preschool class arrived in Sweden (Skolverket 2016; Migrationsverket 2016). In this process preschool as an organisational and educational setting has an important role to play. As Persson (2012) has pointed out, in an increasingly segregated society, and in the case of creating intercultural and multilingual education, the preschool can provide solutions and make a difference. This is why the project’s objective is to develop ways of organising spaces in preschool for successful learning and teaching through a participatory approach. The preschool teachers and other actors, as well as the children and their families take part in and collaborate in the research project from their perspectives and in a manner where their experiences and knowledge are seen as assets. The aims of the project in this respect correspond to the principles set forward by the Working group of the European Commission, which stress that quality depends on ”relationships between ECEC providers and children’s families; relationships and interactions between staff and children, and among children; (...) the involvement of parents in the work of the ECEC setting and the day-to-day pedagogic practice of staff within an ECEC context;” (European Commission, 2014, p. 6) ”A professional role is one which is regulated and requires individuals to develop and reflect on their own practice and with parents and children, create a learning environment which is constantly renewed and improved.” (European Commission p. 70) The participatory research design, in which different actors co-operate to organize preschool as a setting and civic instrument will also constitute a knowledge contribution in itself. Besides the participant’s knowledge development, the objective is to strengthen the scientific base and proven experience as support to professional knowledge. Methodology, Methods, Research Instruments or Sources Used The project is carried out in a preschool in southern Sweden, where one of the sections is an introduction class for children 3-5 year who do not speak any Swedish at all or very little. In the section there are 20 children and the activities focus on strengthening the children's identity and language, both the Swedish and the first language. The project is carried out mainly at the introduction section, but the study will also include the preschool as a whole, because the children after about a year's stay in the introduction section, move to another department at the present preschool or to a preschool closer to their home. A participatory approach is used, involving head teachers, teachers and other preschool staff members, the children and their families. We lean on the action research tradition (McNiff 2002; Norton 2009; Kemmis 2009). The approach implies that teachers, teams and institutions, together with researchers, are encouraged to systematically explore their work to develop the pedagogical knowledge and teaching. Much of the implemented research within educational action research has the teachers in focus, although educational action research implies a process in which all involved should be included, also the students (McNiff 2002). In the project, we will involve researchers and teachers, as well as the children and their families (Gallacher & Gallagher 2008; Clark 2010). The staff at the participating preschool have accepted to work in a participatory way, where researchers together with staff, children, care takers, and preschool management investigate strengths and challenges regarding how the preschool can reinforce language development. The model for the implementation of the project follows the typical participatory action research cycle, which includes planning, action, observation and reflection (McNiff 2002). The function of PAR is here taken as Braye and McDonell (2013, 269) argue, to “get the people affected by a problem together, figure out what is going on as a group, and then do something about it”. Conclusions, Expected Outcomes or Findings During the spring of 2017, the project will have run its first phase. In this phase of the project, the families, the prechool teachers, the children, preschool leaders and members of the municipal administration will have had the opportunity to formulate their concerns and discuss them in groups. For adults, focus groups with participants from each category will be carried out, that is, one with staff, another with management and a third with families. To get an insight to the children’s perspectives, we will use suitable methods adapted to the specific group of children. This presupposes a child-centred approach that fits within the children’s play and daily activities. The approach of using groups will give the participants in each category the opportunity to share and formulate problems, which in turn will give the project perspectives and experiences from the various groups of participants. An anticipated challenge is that the families live in different neighbourhoods, which limits opportunities for informal contacts between them. The staff and management of the preschool have identified some challenges and problems, but also strengths that the section and the preschool face in relation to the children’s learning and development. They see that although multilingualism can be considered an asset, the multilingualism in itself doesn’t create the dynamics in which learning opportunities and development can take place, something that also Kultti (2014) has observed in her research on how to deal with newly arrived children with a first language differing from the majority language.

AB  - Inclusive Education for students with special educational needs is a global phenomenon, a major event of momentous proportions affecting directly and indirectly a significant percentage of the world's population. In response to international and national mandates requiring its implementation, educators everywhere are engaged in the daily task of providing educational services within inclusive general education classroom settings. It is expected that inclusion in the United States will become more prevalent in classrooms across the nation over the next ten years due to progressively more stringent federal and state mandates. In order for inclusion to result in adequate yearly progress for all student subgroups, it is imperative that it be properly implemented. Research has established that a critical component for proper implementation is an understanding of baseline attitudes in regard to inclusive education held by educators. The purpose of this study is to explore the attitudes of pre-K-12 general and special education teachers, school site administrators, school psychologists, paraprofessionals, physical and occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, certified non-teaching, school office staff and special education office staff in a medium sized school district in southern Arizona. This study examines the attitudes held by educators, their foundations of knowledge, attitudes, perceptions, and opinions that shape their attitudes, and potential recommendations for implementation strategies that are predicted to be successful by these educators.

AB  - This article presents a brief history of the Berkeley Child Study Center from the establishment of the Institute of Child Welfare in 1928. The authors review the center's more than 75 years of continuous service as a laboratory preschool. With its careful attention to staffing and its philosophy of giving priority to children's free activity and interests, the program has attracted families who value high staff-child ratios, the presence of a research component, and a rich play environment. University lab schools have a vital role in early childhood education in developing and demonstrating innovative practice, preparing leaders, conducting research, and providing community service through teacher training and advocacy.

AB  - The functional status and perceived problems of 21 persons with severe brain injury were reported at admission (when Ss were 17–64 yrs old), and at 1 and 3 yrs postdischarge from a community-based postacute rehabilitation program. Functional status was measured by participation in productive activity, financial support, place of residence, and level of supervision required. Improvements observed at 1-yr follow-up remained stable or had improved at 3-yr follow-up. Loneliness and depression, while not reported at admission, increased over time to become the 2 problems reported most frequently at 3-yr follow-up.

AB  - This case describes the situation of Smile Land Academy (SLA), a real-world based childcare center. SLA has grown from a very small company to a fairly large-sized organization (30 employees with 150 children). Unfortunately, its system for record-keeping, summarization of data, and reporting has not kept pace. The hard copies and spreadsheet software programs that have been used to manage the data are no longer effective or efficient. This case presents the situation SLA is in as well as the desired system features and outputs that the organization would like in a new system.

AB  - Studied the extent to which a change in the method of training preschool teachers had an effect on the amount of time devoted by these teachers to play activity in the classroom. The extent to which preschool teachers stimulated play activity, and the relative success of such stimulation on play behavior were also determined. The effects of teaching experience and the social-class composition of the preschool classes on the activities of the teachers were also determined. Ss included 65 normal Dutch adults (preschool teachers). Ss completed a questionnaire on their own and their students' backgrounds. Ss and their classes were observed during a day of school to determine the amount of time spent on various activities. Two lessons per S were observed and scored for play stimulation and its effects.

AB  - This study explored the relation between childcare quality (staff–child ratio and staff–child interactions) and behavioural development between the beginning and the end of the childcare year among a sample of 44 low-income Latino four-year-olds in 14 childcare programmes. Neither staff–child ratio nor staff–child interactions were related to children's behaviour at the beginning of the childcare year. Further, staff–child ratio was not significantly related to changes between the beginning and the end of the childcare year in children's behaviour skills. However, staff–child interactions characterised as warm and involving direct instruction related to the development of positive social skills (e.g. taking turns, solving peer conflicts) were significantly associated with decreases in children's behaviour concerns from the beginning to the end of the childcare year. Staff–child interactions characterised negatively (e.g. overly controlling, strict scheduling) were also associated with decreases in children's behaviour concerns. Implications for improving behaviour skills of low-income Latino children by adjusting non-familial childcare features and measurement of childcare features are discussed.

AB  - Preschool classrooms with varying levels of structural quality requirements across the state of West Virginia were investigated for differences in measured structural and process quality. Quality was measured using group size, child-to-teacher/staff ratio, teacher education, and the Early Childhood Environmental Rating Scale-Revised (ECERS-R; Harms, T., Clifford, R. M., & Cryer, D. (2005). The early childhood environment rating scale-revised. New York, NY: Teachers College Press). Thirty-six classrooms with less structural quality requirements and 136 with more structural quality requirements were measured. There were significant differences between classroom type, with classrooms with more structural quality requirements having significantly higher teacher education levels and higher environmental rating scores on the ECERS-R subscales of Space and Furnishings, Activities, and Program Structure. Results support previous research that stricter structural state regulations are correlated with higher measured structural and process quality in preschool classrooms. Implications for preschool state quality standards are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

AB  - Early childhood education (PK-2) has become a site of increasing accountability, with the attempt to normalize instruction through "scientifically based" reading programs. The use of authentic children's literature for early literacy instruction is often pushed aside in lieu of highly scripted commercial programs. As early childhood teacher educators prepare preservice teachers, there is a need to move beyond a one-size-fits-all approach. This article speaks to teacher educators who wish to provide preservice teachers with the theoretical rationale for keeping authentic children's literature as a focus of early reading programs. Drawing on early reading research and sociocultural theories of literacy development, the article provides examples of curriculum and instruction around picture-books that have received the Charlotte Zolotow Award, which is given to children's books with high-quality writing. The article offers numerous book suggestions for use in teacher education classes that demonstrate how language-rich, conceptually challenging children's literature is essential for early reading success.

AB  - Examined the classroom behavior of children with disabilities in both social and mastery domains. Also, the relations among child characteristics, classroom characteristics, and children's behaviors were examined. 153 children (mean age 40.4 mo) with disabilities (49 with Down syndrome, 57 with motor impairment, and 47 with developmental delays) were observed in a total of 148 preschool classrooms. Social interaction with peers and teachers, strategies employed in attempts to master tasks, and use of time in the classroom were recorded by trained blind observers using a modified time sampling procedure. Analyses indicated significant relations between Ss' classroom behavior and 3 selected classroom characteristics: degree of integration, teacher–child ratio, and the extent to which Ss could choose activities. Ss with higher levels of cognitive performance displayed more advanced levels of social interaction and mastery task involvement. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Introduction: There is no consensus as to which is best treatment of femoral fractures in children. Patients and methods: We performed a cost analysis comparing three treatments of femoral shaft fractures in children aged 3-15 years at 3 hospitals during the same period (1993-2000). The analysis included total medical costs and costs for the care provider and were calculated from the time of injury up to 1 year. Results: At hospital 1, treatment consisted of external fixation and early mobilization. At hospital 2, the treatment was skin or skeletal traction in hospital for 1-2 weeks, followed by home traction. At hospital 3, treatment was skin or skeletal traction in hospital until the fracture healed. Results: The average total costs per patient were EUR 10,000 at hospital 1, EUR 23,000 at hospital 2, and EUR 38,000 at hospital 3. Interpretation: The main factor for determining the cost of treatment was the number of days in hospital, which was lower in children treated with external fixation.

AB  - AimIncreasing numbers of young children are now being diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This study aimed to analyse developmental trajectories in a representative group of preschool children with ASD. MethodIn a naturalistic study, 208 preschool children with different subtypes of ASD were followed over a 2-year period. Their trajectories, as regards persistence of ASD diagnoses, developmental/intellectual levels, adaptive functioning and expressive speech, were monitored. ResultsDevelopmental profiles showed considerable change over time, especially in children with atypical autism and in those with developmental delay/borderline intellectual functioning at their first assessment. Approximately 50% of the children were found to have intellectual disability (ID) at follow-up and, of these, the majority had severe ID. This was in contrast to the first assessment by the referral team when ID had rarely been mentioned or discussed. ConclusionChanges in developmental profiles during preschool years are common in children with ASD. This implies that reassessments, covering different developmental areas, are needed. Such follow-up assessments prior to the start of school will yield a more valid estimation of the child's general cognitive level and a more accurate ASD diagnosis and thus form a better basis for realistic educational planning and intervention.

AB  - Clinical predictors of 2-year outcome in preschoolers with ASD were studied in a population-based group of very young children with ASD (n = 208). Children who gained the most (n = 30) and lost the most (n = 23), i.e., increased or decreased their adaptive functioning outcome according to the Vineland Composite Score between study entry (T1) and follow-up (T2), 2 years later were compared. Individual factors that differed significantly between the two outcome groups were cognitive level, age at referral, not passing expected milestones at 18 months, autistic type behavior problems and regression. However, logistic regression analysis showed that only cognitive level at T1 (dichotomized into IQ &lt; 70 and IQ a parts per thousand yen 70) made a unique statistically significant contribution to outcome prediction (p = &lt;.001) with an odds ratio of 18.01. The findings have significant clinical implications in terms of information at diagnosis regarding clinical prognosis in ASD.

AB  - The focus of this study has been to examine a number of municipalities that, in different ways, work to recruit more men to work in preschools. The aim of the study has been to identify ways of working, initiatives and processes conducted by municipalities aiming to recruit more men to work in preschools. The concepts of agency and preparedness are central in this matter. The study includes seven municipalities, all included in one network specially aiming at raising the number of men working in preschool. Between 2014 and 2016, the network met ve times. Interviews and discussions were carried out with key persons involved in the local work to recruit more men to preschools. This analysis can show trends in initiating the concrete work to encourage more men to work in preschools. The results show that an organisation is needed, several measures are to be conducted and the formulation of objectives provides the organisation with a mandate and, ideally, also the time and resources for the work. The organisation and objectives contribute to continuity in the work, something that long-term areas for change often need.

AB  - Preschool teachers’ expectations about what mathematics they should engagechildren in are generally centred about numbers and counting. However, theSwedish preschool curriculum and research into young children’s developmentof mathematical understanding suggest that children can be offered a muchricher set of ideas. In this paper, we examine material from a professionaldevelopment course which indicates that discussing Bishop’s six universalmathematical activities provided preschool teachers with a wider perspective fordiscussing the mathematics, which children in their preschools engaged with.

AB  - Examined aspects of dominant–submissive sex role behavior in 10 male and 10 female preschool children (aged 4 yrs) and their female teachers during conversation at the snack table. In Investigation 1, groups of 2 boys and 2 girls were observed talking with female student teachers, and checklists were kept of the number of teacher–child and child–teacher interruptions during conversation. In Investigation 2, tallies were kept of the number of times boys and girls assumed the dominant roles of distributing snacks and snack materials. During conversation, boys interrupted teachers more frequently than did girls. Teachers interrupted girls more frequently than they interrupted boys. No significant differences were found in the frequency of participation by boys or girls in passing snacks. Results are discussed in relation to the teacher's role in teaching dominant–submissive sex role behaviors to children. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - If history repeats itself there are special reasons to pay attention to those phenomena that tend to return in new disguises. The seventeenth century child witch trials among the Basques and in northern Sweden seem to be such a phenomenon. During the last 15 years the western world has experienced these trials in a new and refined disguise. A number of parents and employees of nursery schools have been tried for abusing children in organized Satanic rituals. A comparison of the historical and modern child witch syndromes shows the following parallels: association with moral panic; breakdown of solidarity; a saturation point; the argument that the crime is of such a secret kind that it cannot be exposed without slackening legal procedures; witch signs and witch tests; absence of physical evidence; brainwashing; moral pressure during interrogation of witnesses; unconscious influencing of the witnesses; contamination of evidence; irregularities in the interrogation procedures; consistency of confessions one with another is taken as proof that they are true. The article concludes that judges, legal experts and social workers of today may learn a great deal from how the problems were handled by the Spanish Inquisition.

AB  - This longitudinal study assessed the emergence of gender differences in over 300 children's academic competency beliefs from kindergarten or first grade through fifth grade. Children, their parents and their teachers rated the children's competencies in math and literacy and their math and literacy skills were also assessed directly. Beginning in third grade, girls rated their math competencies lower than did boys, even though there was no gender difference in math achievement or in teachers' ratings of children's math ability. Parents also rated boys' math competencies higher than girls in both third and fifth grades. Although girls outperformed boys on the literacy achievement measure in third and fifth grade, and teachers' ratings of children's literacy ability reflected this gender difference in performance, gender differences were not found in either parents' or children's ratings of literacy ability. Results of regression analyses indicated that actual achievement and teachers' ratings predicted children's judgments of their literacy skills. Parent ratings of children's competence were a particularly strong predictor of children's judgments of their math skills.

AB  - The quality of care in infant and toddler classrooms was compared across inclusive (n=64) and noninclusive classrooms (n=400). Quality was measured using the Infant/Toddler Environment Rating Scale-Revised (ITERS-R). An exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis revealed four distinct dimensions of quality within the ITERS-R. Inclusive classrooms were higher in quality on the overall scale as well as on three of the four factor-based scales. Teachers reported, on average, that children had mild to moderate disabilities. Correlational analyses indicated that neither having more children with disabilities nor having children with more severe disabilities was associated with higher or lower quality scores. Teacher education and teacher-child ratios were important predictors of quality. Information on low-scoring items on the Personal Care Routines subscale is also presented.

AB  - Quality Rating and Improvement Systems (QRIS) include the assessment of classroom quality as one component of how early childhood programs are monitored and licensed in many states across the United States. However, varying measures and foci of quality exist and have led to challenges in accurately depicting program quality across programs and improvement efforts. The current validation study explores several measures of classroom quality and their associations with components and overall star ratings of the North Carolina QRIS and preschool children's social-emotional outcomes within center-based child care programs. Data for this study were collected in 2009, 10 years after the start of North Carolina's QRIS. Results indicate that individual levels of star ratings did not generally represent distinctive levels of classroom quality, but did differentiate classrooms at the lower and higher levels of quality. Structural features of the environments such as teacher education and teacher–child ratio were associated with classroom quality across these measures in the expected directions; however, teacher experience was not. Further, children's social-emotional outcomes were predicted to a varying degree by star levels and different aspects of classroom quality as represented by these various measures. Results are discussed in terms of the differing levels of quality and teaching processes in classrooms. Future directions for research are presented to contribute to an increased understanding of QRIS and children’ experiences in early care and education programs.

AB  - History shows that educational systems and educational theorists have consciously or unconsciously structured the education of young children toward one end or the other of the continuum between "internals" and "externals". Systems in which teacher-guided learning was based on efforts to satisfy individual needs, systems that encouraged self-reliance and self-determination would be considered "internals", because their stated goal was to produce citizens with a high level of autonomy. Because this nation's early childhood systems are Eurocentric, individuals need to recognize that little distinction was made between adults and children until the 1600s. The basic system of early education today can be traced directly to Friedrich Froebel (1782-1852), the "father of the kindergarten" who was strongly influenced by his time with Pestalozzi at Yverdon. Because Froebel's system had not been perfected by the time of his death, his followers and competitors tried to improve upon it, with some setting down rigid rules for the use of his materials. In the United States, people have examples of both internal and external methods in the teacher education programs that were developed in the last half of the 19th century. The most egregious use of the kindergarten as an external device, however, was probably that of William T. Harris, a Yale dropout who had worked up to the position of St. Louis superintendent of schools by 1867. He endorsed the idea of hiring women teachers because they worked for lower salaries, and opened the first public school kindergarten in 1873. During the 1880s, some of the female academies began to add Froebelian teacher training components. Many of them developed into normal schools and even into the universities where teachers now teach. With the depression of the 1890s and popularization of the Herbartian system, there was a movement into public schools and a subsequent regimentation. Teachers from the normal schools were trained to teach the three Rs and were not aware of Froebel's basic philosophy. His name was largely forgotten, although circle time, the sandbox, building blocks, and free play time were maintained until recent years. In this article, the author reflects on the history of early childhood education.

AB  - Children who live with medical conditions that were previously considered incompatible with long term survival are often highly dependent on interventions and equipment which would traditionally have required hospitalization. However, it is generally accepted that their social, psychological, emotional and developmental needs are best met at home. One of the many factors that can impede these children from being discharged from hospital is the lack of availability of staff who can provide care and support for them and their families. Increasing the number of staff who are able to provide such support might, therefore, assist in providing for their care needs. This article reports on a study of the perceived education and training needs of staff who care for children with complex needs and their families.

AB  - Objective: There is evidence that parents living with mental disorders have limited access to parenting support. We conducted a survey of mental health agencies in Ontario, Canada, to establish a benchmark from which progress in service availability can be evaluated, and to identify any barriers to availability in terms of program location and parent gender. Method: We surveyed 119 directors of community and inpatient mental health service agencies (54% response rate) and directors of 80 different agencies to which they referred clients for parenting support services (56% response rate). Respondents indicated the types of parenting support services they provided and the clientele they served. Results: The most common parenting support service in mental health agencies was referral to another agency. Individuals with mental disorders were eligible for services at the referral agencies on a case-by-case basis, and few agencies had programs for children. Parenting services were associated with the number of staff in the agency and with offering programs in urban or both urban and rural locations, which perhaps also indicates larger size of the organization. Agencies served fathers and mothers approximately equally, but child care was uncommon. Conclusions: Integrated clinical services for parents living with mental disorders are lacking. Such services should be designed to treat mental health as well as provide parenting skills intervention and practical support for parents, consistent with a recovery model.

AB  - This study used the Family and Child Experiences Survey, 2009 cohort, to explore the levels of depression among a nationally representative sample of Head Start teachers at the beginning and end of the preschool year. Results showed that one in three Head Start teachers reported some depression either in fall or spring, and that change in depression between fall and spring was commonplace. Characteristics of individuals (initial depression, Hispanic/Latino ethnicity), classrooms (class size, number of DLLs, average child prosocial skills), and the workplace (peer depression, curriculum support, positive workplace climate, number of employer-provided benefits) were linked to change in teacher depression. Moreover, reduced depression over the course of the year was uniquely predictive of children's gains in prosocial skills and declines in problem behaviors, as rated by teachers; however, no associations emerged between teacher depression and parent-rated child socioemotional outcomes. Overall, results undergird the importance of considering teacher depression as a dynamic construct in early education settings. In addition, findings highlight common method variance as a potential methodological challenge in this line of research for which future studies should carefully account.

AB  - Aims: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is often described as comprising an unusual brain growth pattern and aberrant brain lateralization. Although it is important to study the pathophysiology of the developing ASD cortex, examples of physiological brain lateralization in young children with ASD have yet to be well examined. Methods: Thirty‐eight boys with ASD (aged 3–7 years) and 38 typically developing (TD) boys (aged 3–8 years) concentrated on video programs and their brain activities were measured non‐invasively. We employed a customized child‐sized magnetoencephalography system in which the sensors were located as close to the brain as possible for optimal recording in young children. To produce a credible laterality index of the brain oscillations, we defined two clusters of sensors corresponding to the right and left hemispheres. We focused on the laterality index ([left—right]/[left + right]) of the relative power band in seven frequency bands. Results: The TD group displayed significantly rightward lateralized brain oscillations in the theta‐1 frequency bands compared to the ASD group. Conclusions: This is the first study to demonstrate unusual brain lateralization of brain oscillations measured by magnetoencephalography in young children with ASD.

AB  - With the starting point in a planned study about democracy in different preschools, this roundtable invites to a deepened discussion about power relations in democratic fostering of children and the need and value of studying their situation in preschools in different local contexts. In Sweden, as well as in other Nordic countries, preschool is the first important step for many children in the education to be a democratic citizen. The goals in the Swedish curricula are ambitious; girls and boys from different backgrounds shall, for example, have the same possibilities to exercise influence and to learn about, and “to live”, democracy in preschool (Skolverket 2010). How this should be carried out is left to the pedagogues to decide. The democratic commission in the curricula is sometimes contradictory (e.g. solidarity with others and individual freedom of choice), and research from Nordic countries reports that the commission are understood in different ways, and often seen as difficult to implement (Jansen, Johansson &amp; Eriksen Ødegaard 2011). One often emphasized key component for children´s possibilities to participate is to be seen as competent persons. However, what is understood as competent is not neutral, for example, in Kjørholt´s (2008) study, competences that were highly valued in other cultures than the Norwegian, ran the risk of being interpreted as shortcomings. The aim of the planned study is to develop knowledge about democratic fostering in preschools in different local contexts with respect to ethnical and socio-economic circumstances. Of special interest is the content and methods used in the pedagogic practice, as well as the children´s own attempts to influence in preschool. Questions about how democratic subjects are presented in the pedagogic practice, as well as questions about how, and what, the children are promoted to, and themselves try to, influence are focused. Three preschools will be selected to cover a variety of local contexts in terms of ethnicity and socio-economic circumstances, one from a rural area, and two from big cities (one district with a large number of immigrants and one district with a majority of “middle-/upper class”). A critical ethnographic approach will be applied, and the empirical material will consist of observations, conversations, interviews and documents (two months in each preschool). The analyses will focus on power relations such as gender, ethnicity and social class perspectives, and the relation to local contexts. It is central to consider both different groups of children´s attempts to influence, and the power relations in the pedagogic practices, i.e. the relationship between agency and structures in the different environments.ReferencesJansen, K E, Johansson, E &amp; Eriksen Ødegaard (2011).

AB  - In Sweden, as well as in other Nordic countries, preschool is the first important step for many children in their training to be a democratic citizen. The goals in the Swedish curricula are ambitious; girls and boys from different backgrounds shall, for example, have the same possibilities to exercise influence and to learn about, and “to live”, democracy in preschool (Skolverket, 2016). How this should be carried out in the daily activities is left to the pedagogues to decide. The democratic commission in the curricula is sometimes contradictory (e.g. solidarity with others and individual freedom of choice), and research from Nordic countries reports that teachers understand this commission in different ways, and often see it as difficult to implement (Jansen, Johansson &amp; Eriksen Ødegaard 2011). This paper focuses ‘the lived democracy’ in preschools, with a special interest for children´s influence. It covers the processes when teachers invite children to influence, as well as in the children’s own attempts to influence in preschool (how and about what, and the responses of the teachers).The analysis in this paper is based on Basil Bernstein’s (2000) theories regarding power, control and pedagogic codes, in combination with pertinent feminist perspectives on democratic education (principally those of Arnot &amp; Dillabough (2000), Arnot &amp; Reay (2007) and Gordon (2006)). An ethnographic field study has been carried out during 2015-16, with participant observations in three preschool groups during two months each, eight group interviews with teacher teams, and eleven interviews with children in small groups. The preschools were selected to cover a diversity of local contexts in terms of ethnicity and socio-economic circumstances, from rural areas, and from districts in big cities (with a large number of immigrants, and with a majority of “middle-/upper class”). In the analyses it is central to consider both different groups of children´s attempts to influence, and the teacher’s invitations in the pedagogic practices. The preliminary result focuses, for example, if the processes of influence are individually or collectively oriented, the teachers´ attitudes to, and their expectations on, children’s´ possibilities to act, and what seem to be a legitimate way to exercise influence if wanting to reach the teachers ears. ReferencesArnot, M &amp; Dillabough, J-A (2000).

AB  - This paper focuses democratic fostering in different preschools from gender perspectives. It covers the teaching in and about democracy, as well as children’s power-positions and their attempts to affect daily preschool activities. Previous research show how teacher’s expectations on, and attitudes to, different children have impact on children’s way of acting (Eidevald 2011), children´s choices are not neutral, but unspoken influenced by gender norms (Ryan 2005), and gendered power-relationships are not statically realised, but vary depending on contexts (Walkerdine 1990). The analysis is based on Basil Bernstein’s (2000) theories regarding power and control, in combination with gender theories (Arnot 2006; Connell 1987). An interpretative and critical ethnographic approach was applied (Beach 2010), with participant observations to cover democratic processes in daily practice, and interviews with teacher teams and children (Hammersley &amp; Atkinson 2007). Preschools in three districts (rural, immigrant, high-income) were analysed as different pedagogic codes (Bernstein), and with varying masculinities and femininities that children adopt (Connell 1987). A consent form including information about the project and informants rights was provided to all parents and teachers involved. Informed consent was negotiated with the children, and pseudonyms replaced the participants’ names. The results show boys and girls who exert influence in all groups. However, whether their agency were perceived as strong or boundless differed due to local context, as well as if the children´s free play choices were traditionally gendered or not. By showing how power relations interacts in preschools, the quality of democratic education for all children may increase.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between staff size and perceived organizational support (POS) in early childhood education (ECE) organizations. Design/methodology/approach: A territory-wide questionnaire survey was designed to investigate the perceptions of preschool teachers in Hong Kong on four dimensions of organizational support, namely, teacher participation in decision making, school management support, school performance in organizational support, and organizational negativity in organizational support. In total, 2,066 teachers from 189 schools were sampled with stratified random sampling. Confirmatory factor analysis and latent mean analysis were employed. Findings: There was a significant relationship between staff size and POS. Specifically, teachers working at small schools in terms of staff size reported significantly higher POS than their counterparts in medium and large schools in aspects including teacher participation in decision making, school management support, and school performance in POS. Conversely, both medium and large schools had higher scores on organizational negativity. Research limitations/implications: There may exist other factors (e.g. principal leadership), which are not investigated in this study, that influence POS. Future studies are needed to capture a fuller structural relationship among an array of factors that influence POS. Originality/value: Research on staff size and POS has been conducted separately, without one element informing the other. The findings of the present study will stimulate more research on POS and staff size. The study will stimulate thinking about whether larger preschools are more efficient than smaller preschools in terms of scale of economies in a marker driven, ECE context. Building upon the foundation laid by the study, future studies may explore the interaction between staff size and POS on intended student outcomes in ECE.

AB  - The aim of the current study was to detect similarities and differences in the preschool literacy environment in the Nordic countries, with a special focus on what the environment offered to multilingual children who do not speak the language. Some minor studies (Bøyum, Hofslundsengen, Haukedal &amp; Pedersen, 2016; Dahlgren, Gustafsson, Mellgren &amp; Olsson 2013; Mellgren, Skriver Jensen &amp; Hansen 2010; Mårdsjö Olsson &amp; Löfström 2008; Simonsson, 2004; Svensson 2005, 2007, 2009; Öman 1986) has indicated less literacy activities in some preschools. This study expands on the earlier work of literacy environment. The theoretical base is socio-cultural as artefacts are looked upon as vehicles of the culture in which children live. We present a survey of the literacy environment in Finland, Norway and Sweden. The data consisted of mapping in 20 preschool classrooms in each of the three countries including number of books, children's access to books, reading and writing activities and digital tools. The participating preschools gave informed consents to data collection. This study contributes to knowledge about what experiences of literacy children at the ages of 0 to 6 years get during their stay in preschool, if these experiences differ among the Nordic countries and if so, how and in what way they differ. The finding from the study adds to the limited knowledge about literacy learning in the Nordic preschool system, 171 and implies the importance of preschools literacy environment for children's development of emergent literacy skills.

AB  - Although the number of employees on overseas assignments accompanied by their families has increased steadily, little is known about the effects of this experience on family functioning. Japanese families on family-accompanied assignments living in Hong Kong were compared with families living in Japan (consisting of 135 and 248 paired partners, respectively). Applying an ecological framework, family functioning was examined using the Feetham Family Functioning Survey–Japanese (FFFS-J). Japanese wives living in Hong Kong rated family functioning lower, particularly in the area of “relationship between family and family members.” Between paired marital partners living in Hong Kong, the level of satisfaction in the area of “relationship between family and society” was significantly lower for wives than for husbands. This study provides application of the family ecological framework in families in a multicultural environment and identifies potential areas for family assessment and intervention that may of interest to health care professionals who care for families living away from their home countries.

AB  - Fingu is a game and a game platform using virtual manipulatives designed to help children develop competence and fluency with basic number combinations. We present results from an intervention lasting for seven to nine weeks, in which 82 children (5, 6, and 7 years old) were allowed to play the game as part of their ordinary preschool or school activities. The results showed significant positive differences between pre- and post-tests in four arithmetic measures, with moderate to large effect sizes. In contrast, most differences between post-tests and delayed post-tests were non-significant, with low or no effect sizes.

Indicators of daycare quality included quality of interaction with teachers, arrangement of the physical space, spaciousness of the environment, appropriateness and variety of the materials provided for play, quality of the outdoor area, group size, and child–teacher ratio. Relationships were found between these dimensions and Ss' absorption in solitary play and knowledge of social problem solving. Most relationships held up after the effects of social class were statistically removed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Added Value? Preschool Teacher Students’ Views On And Examples Of The Added Value Of ICT As A Tool For Learning

AB  - In today’s digitalized society the potential of digital technologies and how to use these to support learning has increasingly become a focus of research. Since preschool children’s use of ICT is continuously increasing, more interest is also being paid to the question of how ICT can be used for pedagogical purposes in preschools, although research in this area is still limited (Sandvik, Smørdal &amp; Østerud 2012). The use of ICT in preschools is itself a controversial matter. Earlier research has questioned whether young children should be subjected to ICT (Straker et al 2009; Kalas 2010). A growing number of studies, however, identify the potential of ICT as a tool for learning in preschools when the use of ICT is based on pedagogical principles and supports learning of an intended content (McCarrick &amp; Li 2007; McKenney &amp; Voogt 2009). In other words, if ICT is to be used to create a pedagogical added value in preschools, preschool teachers must develop an ability to integrate pedagogical knowledge, content knowledge and technological knowledge.The aim of this study is to examine what kind of added pedagogical value pre-service preschool teachers think educational technologies can bring to preschools and to analyze their oral, written and practical digital examples and presentations of such added value through the lenses of the theoretical framework of Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK).Mishra and Koehler (2008) has built on Shulman’s (1986) pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) to create a conceptual framework that also includes technological knowledge and the ability to successfully integrate this with their pedagogical knowledge and content knowledge. They label their conceptual framework Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK). The TPACK framework has proven useful as a tool for describing the type of knowledge required by teachers for successful technology integration (Voogt et al 2012). A teacher that possesses TPACK knows how to successfully integrate ICT in their practice to create an added pedagogical value. Thus, looking for signs of TPACK means looking for signs of successful technology integration. Hence there are a number of studies that try to measure teachers’ or student teachers’ TPACK with the intention of identifying successful ICT integration (Angeli &amp; Valanides 2009; Kramarski &amp; Michalsky 2010). In this study the theoretical framework TPACK is used to analyze preschool teacher students’ oral presentations, written texts and digital examples of ICT use for added value in preschools.The following research questions have been formulated: - What types of arguments did the preschool teacher students present to support or questions the use of ICT to create added pedagogical value in preschools? - What types of examples were given of successful ICT use for added pedagogical value in preschools by the preschool teacher students in their written documentation? - To what extent do the preschool teacher students’ practical digital examples show signs of added pedagogical value by successful ICT integration (i.e. to what extent do the preschool teacher students’ digital examples show signs of TPACK or other subdomains in the TPACK framework)

AB  - PURPOSE: We evaluated 4-hour voiding observation as a method of basic assessment of bladder dysfunction in young boys with posterior urethral valves. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Voiding pattern, including number of voids, voided and residual urine volume, and bladder capacity, was determined noninvasively in 24 boys younger than 4 years with posterior urethral valves and compared to that of healthy age matched controls. Results were then compared to those of standard cystometry. RESULTS: The number of voids was higher, voided volume was smaller and residual urine volume was higher in the posterior urethral valve group. There was no difference in voiding pattern before and after removal of the anatomical obstruction. Voided and residual urine volume, and bladder capacity were higher on standard cystometry than on voiding observation. CONCLUSIONS: Four-hour voiding observation is an easy noninvasive method that focuses on emptying difficulties and clearly detects differences in voiding patterns between boys with posterior urethral valves and healthy, nontoilet trained children. We recommend the method as a complement to standard cystometry for the diagnosis and followup of bladder dysfunction in young boys with posterior urethral valves to identify the need for treatment.

AB  - PURPOSE: In boys with resected posterior urethral valves (PUV) deterioration of renal function is seen during childhood and adolescence, which may partly be caused by bladder dysfunction. We present data on renal and bladder function initially and at followup of boys with PUV in whom the bladder dysfunction has been treated since infancy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 35 boys with PUV. Bladder regimen, including early toilet training from the age of 1.5 years and detrusor relaxant drugs for the treatment of incontinence from ages 4 to 6 years, was introduced to all patients. A total of 19 boys were started on clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) at a median age of 8 months due to pronounced bladder dysfunction with poor emptying, unsafe pressure levels, high grade reflux and renal impairment. RESULTS: No serious complications of CIC have been seen during followup. Of the 19 boys 2 stopped performing CIC due to noncompliance of the parents at 1 and 3 years, respectively. Initial renal function, measured as median glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in percent of expected for age, was 60% in the CIC group and 90% in the nonCIC group. At followup at a median age of 8 years the CIC group (n = 14, 3 transplanted boys excluded) had an increase in median differential GFR (difference between followup and initial GFR) of 7% (p <0.01), which was similar increase to that of the nonCIC group. In the 2 boys who stopped performing CIC renal function deteriorated with a median differential GFR of -24%. In the CIC group detrusor instability decreased. Poor compliance was seen in 6 of the 19 boys initially and only one remained poorly compliant. In 1 of the boys who stopped performing catheterization a low compliant bladder developed. In all of the other cases bladder capacity increased more than expected for age. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that treatment of bladder dysfunction in boys with PUV can counteract the deterioration in renal function seen during childhood but the number of patients in our study is limited.

AB  - Research on learning has shown the importance of the learner's possibilities to discern what differs as well as what is similar when meeting new phenomena. But how does this kind of understanding develop when young children try to understand their environment in natural settings? The results of Tolschinsky's research (2003) about young children's understanding of numbers and letters before being taught are considered in this study. Tolchinsky's results showed that children can separate cards that can be read from those which can not be read. In this study the point of departure is variation theory, and Tolchinsky’s results are seen through the perspective of what children do discern, what they discern simultaneously and what kind of variation they seem to need to discern. The aim in this study is to describe how children understand the concepts whole, halves and quarters. Three children aged four, five and six years old have been interviewed before, during and after a playful instruction about the topic. The results show how children understand the phenomenon and what implications this can have concerning their future learning. Due to one of the results, the children understand halves as halves as long as both halves are visible, but as soon as one half disappears the remaining becomes a whole as it is one piece and not two previously connecting to each other.

AB  - We compared the effects of three treatment approaches on preschool-age children with autism spectrum disorders. Twenty-nine children received intensive behavior analytic intervention (IBT; 1:1 adult:child ratio, 25-40 h per week). A comparison group (n = 16) received intensive "eclectic" intervention (a combination of methods, 1:1 or 1:2 ratio, 30 h per week) in public special education classrooms (designated the AP group). A second comparison group (GP) comprised 16 children in non-intensive public early intervention programs (a combination of methods, small groups, 15 h per week). Independent examiners administered standardized tests of cognitive, language, and adaptive skills to children in all three groups at intake and about 14 months after treatment began. The groups were similar on key variables at intake. At follow-up, the IBT group had higher mean standard scores in all skill domains than the AP and GP groups. The differences were statistically significant for all domains except motor skills. There were no statistically significant differences between the mean scores of the AP and GP groups. Learning rates at follow-up were also substantially higher for children in the IBT group than for either of the other two groups. These findings are consistent with other research showing that IBT is considerably more efficacious than "eclectic" intervention.

AB  - The genetic testing of minors within the direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing (GT) context has been given relatively little attention. The issue of testing healthy children for diseases that would only develop in adulthood raises many important ethical, legal and social issues. As genetic testing is now available outside of the traditional health care system, often without even the intermediate of a health care professional, we surveyed 37 DTC GT companies regarding their policies for testing in children. Although the response rate is relatively low (35%, 13/37), our findings reveal that a clear majority of companies do perform genetic testing in minors. As such, companies testing for adult onset diseases are acting in contradiction of established professional guidelines, which state, among others, that, for predictive genetic testing, the availability of therapeutic or preventive measures is necessary for testing to be performed in asymptomatic minors. The community of stakeholders in children's health care and genetic testing should, therefore, decide which standards need to be upheld by DTC GT companies and ensure that these are met.

AB  - Teaching styles were investigated in 28 middle-class sibling dyads (older sibling M age = 8.2 yrs; younger sibling M age = 5.11 yrs) using two sets of block design tasks (five easy; five hard). Older siblings employed a greater number of strategies (i.e. physical demonstrations, scaffolding, corrective feedback) in the hard than in the easy tasks, thus demonstrating the ability to adjust teaching strategies according to task difficulty. Teachers also employed more frequent strategies when learners were younger indicating that they may be sensitive to developmental differences. In the hard tasks, learners responded positively to teacher guidance, but were also more likely to reject the teacher's help, perhaps demonstrating responsibility for their own learning. Findings are discussed in light of current social-cognitive approaches highlighting the important roles of both teacher and learner during episodes of sibling teaching in middle childhood.

Investigated associations among different levels of these variables and with quality of care and children's social development. Findings suggest that meeting licensing standards for ratios and groups has a positive effect on ratings of the quality of care provided for children. (GLR)

AB  - We examined children's growth in school-related learning and social skills over the pre-Kindergarten (pre-K) year in state-funded programs designed to prepare children for kindergarten. We expected that children's gains in academic and social skills could be attributed to variations in the structural and classroom process dimensions of program quality. Nearly 3000 (n=2800) children were randomly selected, four per classroom, from approximately 700 randomly selected, state-funded pre-Kindergarten classrooms in eleven states. Enrollment in pre-K appeared related to gains in academic skills. Children showed larger gains in academic outcomes when they experienced higher-quality instruction or closer teacher-child relationships. Gains were not related to characteristics of the child or program (i.e., ratio, teacher qualifications and program location and length). These findings have implications for a range of state and local policy and program development efforts as well as for theories of contextual influences on development.

AB  - In recent years, the Chinese government has initiated a national plan to universalize quality kindergartens for all age-eligible Chinese children. Kindergarten is the main form of early childhood education and care (ECEC) service across China. However, the government faces two thorny issues on the journey toward realizing educational equity for some of the nation's most vulnerable children. The first issue is the critical shortage of kindergarten programs. The second issue is a widening gap in quality between rural and urban kindergarten programs. Therefore, this study examines the quality of 91 kindergarten programs across different locations and funding sources in Zhejiang Province based on a stratified random selection method to gain insights into the aspects and magnitude of quality disparities in programs serving children from the richest and most powerful urban residents to the most disadvantaged village families. Program quality was rated utilizing eight subscales of the Chinese Early Childhood Programs Rating Scale, modified from Harms, Clifford, and Cryer's (2005) Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale. Finally, recommendations for future studies and policy formation are provided to enhance and perhaps hasten the process of universalizing quality kindergartens in the increasingly market-based context of modern China.

AB  - The benefits of outdoor play for children’s well-rounded development are maximized when children experience enjoyment and, at the same time, gain physical, motor, cognitive, and social-emotional competence. This study examined the quality of outdoor play in Chinese kindergartens, the dominant form of full-day early childhood education program serving children aged from 3 to 6 years in China. The Outdoor Play Rating Scale was used to study the quality of the provision for children’s outdoor play. A total of 174 classrooms from 91 kindergartens in Zhejiang Province were included in the study. A stratified random sampling procedure was used to select kindergartens and classrooms. Results indicated that there was inadequate opportunity for outdoor play, including free play, as well as low level of physical activity by children. We found significant differences in quality of outdoor play across kindergartens in different locations (urban/non-urban areas). Recommendations were provided to practitioners in the discussion that primarily emphasized addressing the need to increase opportunities for children’s access to a wide range of outdoor activities and to improve teachers’ professional competencies in organizing quality outdoor activities for children. Implications for policymakers include the need to narrow the gap in the quality of outdoor environments in kindergartens so that children’s play is supported in ways that will enhance children’s early development and learning.

AB  - This study explores the relationship between structural variables and program quality in early childhood programs across economic, sociocultural, and policy contexts in Zhejiang, China. Using the Chinese Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale (CECERS), researchers collected data in 162 randomly selected classrooms representative of the sociocultural and economic conditions of Chinese early childhood programs. The findings showed that a set of program structural variables accounted for 60% of the variance in overall program quality. Similar findings were shown for two specific program quality indicators: structural quality (‘Provisions for Learning’) and process quality (‘Teaching & Interaction’). Results suggest that policy makers in early childhood education in China should offer more benefits and training for teachers, recognize teachers' professional qualifications, and maintain lower child-to-teacher ratio to improve Chinese ECE programs.

AB  - In this study, the generalized additive modeling (GAM) was used to explore possible threshold effects on multiple program structure quality indicators (class size, child-to-teacher ratio, teaching experience, teacher salary) in relation to the classroom teacher-child interaction quality indicators as measured by the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS) in a sample of Chinese kindergarten classrooms. One hundred eighty classrooms in 60 preschools were selected for the study, based on a stratified sampling procedure. The results were mixed, and revealed threshold effects on some structural indicators. The findings are discussed in the context of Chinese early childhood education practice. As the first study of its kind in a Chinese context, the findings could have some implications for early childhood education policy and practice despite some limitations of the study. Future research may consider better design and more representative sample for studying these issues. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

AB  - The Chinese implementation of the second child policy has resulted in a dramatic need for infant and toddler early care programs, yet little research exists to guide how to weigh quality options. This study utilizes an internationally validated assessment instrument—Infant and Toddler Environment Rating Scale-Revised—to explore program quality in 79 Chinese early care classrooms. Three profiles emerged to reflect the variation in quality observed. Further, teacher and classroom characteristics were explored to understand differences in observed quality. Results indicated that child-to-teacher ratio, class size, certification, teacher salary and school property successfully differentiated the three profiles, while teachers' years of teaching, degree and time allocated for free play did not. Findings are discussed in light of previous literature and the Chinese sociocultural context. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

There are indications that the majority of these difficulties might be related to the presence of background noise. Moreover, research has also shown that high-level noise has a more detrimental effect on cognitive performance and self-rated disturbance in individuals with HI than low-level noise. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of different types of background noise on cognitive performance and perceived disturbance (PD) in employees with aided HI and normal hearing. Research Design: A mixed factorial design was conducted to examine the effect of noise in four experimental conditions. Study Sample: A total of 40 participants (21 men and 19 women) were recruited to take part in the study. The study sample consisted of employees with HI (n = 20) and normal hearing (n = 20). The group with HI had a mild-moderate sensorineural HI, and they were all frequent hearing-aid users. Intervention: The current study was conducted by using four general work-related tasks (mental arithmetic, orthographic decoding, phonological decoding, and serial recall) in four different background conditions: (1) quiet, (2) office noise at 56 dBA, (3) daycare noise at 73.5 dBA, and (4) traffic noise at 72.5 dBA. Reaction time and the proportion of correct answers in the working tasks were used as outcome measures of cognitive performance. The Borg CR-10 scale was used to assess PD. Data Collection and Analysis: Data collection occurred on two separate sessions, completed within 4 wk of each other. All tasks and experimental conditions were used in a counterbalanced order. Two-way analysis of variance with repeated measures was performed to analyze the results. To examine interaction effects, painwise tests were used. Pearson correlation coefficients between reaction time and proportion of correct answers, and cognitive performance and PD were also calculated to examine the possible correlation between the different variables. Results: No significant between-group or within-group differences in cognitive performance were observed across the four background conditions. Ratings of PD showed that both groups rated PD according to noise level, where higher noise level generated a higher PD. The present findings also demonstrated that the group with HI was more disturbed by higher than lower levels of noise (i.e., traffic and daycare setting compared with office setting). This pattern was observed consistently throughout four working tasks where the group with HI reported a significantly greater PD in the daycare and traffic settings compared with office noise. Conclusions: The present results demonstrate that background noise does not impair cognitive performance in nonauditory tasks in employees with HI and normal hearing, but that PD is affected to a greater extent in employees with HI during higher levels of background noise exposure. In addition, this study also supports previous studies regarding the detrimental effects that high-level noise has on employees with HI. Therefore, we emphasize the need of both self-rated and cognitive measurements in hearing care and occupational health services for both employees with normal hearing and HI.

AB  - Although they are the lesser known Nazi atrocities, it is estimated that some 5000–8000 children with physical and intellectual disabilities were killed in Nazi Germany under a programme of euthanasia. Chronologically, they were a precedent, being the Nazis' first organised and systematic killing programme that would later enlarge to include adults with disabilities and ultimately, to the broader programme of racially motivated ‘euthanasia’ of the holocaust. The programme intimately involved medical staff, including a number of paediatricians, many of whom would go unpunished and continue to practice for many years after the war. This paper outlines the origins and development of the programme, examines how families were involved and affected and looks at what motivated the medical staff involved with the killing. The history of the Nazi child euthanasia programme has a number of important lessons for practicing doctors and health policy‐makers in the 21st century.

AB  - Theory of mind skills and a range of social behavior in everyday life were assessed in a sample of 21 French children (aged 4–11 yrs) with pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs)and 22 normally-developing preschoolers. Parents, teachers and therapists were interviewed using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales and a new supplementary scale, the "Echelle d'Adaptation Sociale pour Enfants" (EASE; U. Frith et al, 1994). Teachers and therapists were able to differentiate subtle forms of social problems in everyday life between subgroups of children diagnosed later to have either autism or PDD-not otherwise specified, according to DSM-III—R criteria. This study offers a (small) cross-cultural replication of recent work suggesting that differences in the mentalizing skills of children with autism are reflected in the everyday social behavior of this group. A significant effect of informant was found for the PDD group, and this effect was particularly pronounced when children with autism were considered separately. The implications of informant differences are discussed. Mentalistic and non-mentalistic items of the EASE are appended. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Studied theory-of-mind skills and everyday social behavior in normal children vs children with pervasive developmental disorders (PDD). Ss were 21 male and female British school-age children (mean age 7.4 yrs) (13 Ss with au autistic disorder and 8 Ss with PDD not otherwise specified) (mean IQ of 55.2); 22 normal male and female British preschool children (mean age 4.5 yrs); and normal British adults (parents, teachers, and therapists). Adults were interviewed with the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales and the Social Adaptation Scale for Children. Their ability to differentiate subtle forms of social problems in daily-life behaviors between subgroups of children diagnosed subsequently with autism or PDD not otherwise specified according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-III-Revised (DSM-III-R) criteria was assessed. A series of ANOVAs was performed. Informant effects for subgroups considered separately or jointly were analyzed. (English abstract) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study used hierarchical linear modeling to predict first grade students' peer acceptance, classroom engagement, and sense of school belonging from measures of normative classroom teacher-student support and individual teacher-student support. Participants were 509 (54.4% male) ethnically diverse, first grade children attending one of three Texas School districts (1 urban, 2 small city) who scored below their school district median on a measure of literacy administered at the beginning of first grade. Peer nominations from 5147 classmates were used to assess both normative and individual levels of teacher support. Normative classroom teacher-student support predicted children's peer acceptance and classroom engagement, above the effects of child gender, ethnic minority status, and individual teacher-student support. Results are discussed in terms of implications for teacher preparation and professional development. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

AB  - To support teachers with their classroom responsibilities, schools have increasingly turned to paraprofessionals for assistance, with the largest numbers of paraprofessionals employed in the field of special education. Owing to this important role that paraprofessionals now perform in the education of children with disabilities in the USA, we set out to investigate the responsibilities that paraprofessionals working with young children with disabilities had. We were also interested in identifying how paraprofessionals and the teachers with whom they work alongside perceived the paraprofessionals' level of preparedness for their roles and their job satisfaction. Fifty-two paraprofessionals and 59 teachers of young children with disabilities participated in the study. Overall, both paraprofessionals and teachers indicated that paraprofessionals were generally well prepared for activities they frequently engaged in and both viewed themselves as collaborative members of an educational team.

AB  - Comments on article by Ximena Domínguez et al. (see record 2010-06305-003). The authors have have conducted a methodologically sophisticated study describing the growth of learning behavior among Head Start children. By doing so, they contribute to a growing body of evidence that holds promise for realizing the potential of preschool education to prepare all children for a successful school entry. Their study is representative of a new generation of research that seeks to define classroom quality in terms of teacher–student interactions rather than structural aspects of classrooms such as teacher–student ratios or teacher degrees or certification. They investigated how much of the variation in children's baseline levels and rate of growth in learning behaviors is attributed to differences between children and how much can be explained by differences between classrooms. The description provided by them suggests the measure possesses many positive features, including its multidimensional nature, efficiency and economy of administration, its grounding in classroom situations. They used a composite score to investigate children's growth in learning behavior. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Analyzed one-year gains of children with severe disabilities, children with mild/moderate disabilities, and typically-developing children, in segregated or integrated preschools. Found that segregated programs had smaller adult/child ratios and shorter operating hours than integrated programs. Children with severe disabilities in segregated preschools showed fewer gains than others. No group of children with disabilities increased the amount of peer interaction. (Author/KB)

AB  - This study investigates the relationship between the language of instruction and learning of literacy skills among pre-primary school children in a multilingual environment. The sample consists of 1867 learners from low-income urban households, attending 147 low-cost private pre-primary schools located in low-income areas of Nairobi, Kenya. About one-half (48.4%) of the learners were taught basic aspects of literacy such as letter naming, letters sounds and rhymes using Kiswahili (a local lingua franca) while the other half (51.6%) were taught these aspects using English. The learners involved in this study come from different ethnic backgrounds and hence Kiswahili and English are not their first languages. This study poses the question: In a multilingual environment, is there an advantage in learning literacy skills using a second language (in this case Kiswahili) over a third language (English)? Relationship between literacy scores and language of instruction is examined using descriptive techniques. This relationship is further examined using multivariate techniques controlling for learner sex, classroom resources, class size, teacher pre-service training, and teacher years of experience, among other variables. Results show that learners taught literacy skills using Kiswahili significantly outperformed their counterparts taught using English (at p < 0.05 level) even after adjusting for the effects of other factors in the analyses. The implications of the finding to education policy and practices are discussed.

AB  - Conducted a cost–benefit analysis of all child and adolescent psychiatric day treatment centers throughout Germany. The questionnaires of 43 centers (560 treatment places; 63% male, 31 female; mean age 10 yrs 2 mo) were analyzed. The results show a mean treatment duration of 104 days, regardless of the primary psychotherapeutic orientation (behavioral, psychodynamic, family therapy, etc). Personnel levels are 80.5% below those prescribed by government guidelines. Mean treatment costs per patient are DM 36.30. Rates per day and duration of treatment are negatively correlated (i.e., the higher the rate per day, the shorter the treatment, which is likely to be explained by a higher number of personnel). The amount of time the children are present in day treatment per week was found to be the most influential variable; the longer the children are present, the shorter the duration of the whole treatment. Diagnosis, gender, and age only marginally influence duration and cost of treatment. Network effects as operationalized by the availability of additional inpatient and outpatient facilities do not influence costs and duration of day treatment.

AB  - "Projections of Education Statistics to 2022" is the 41st report in a series begun in 1964. It includes statistics on elementary and secondary schools and postsecondary degree-granting institutions. This report provides revisions of projections shown in "Projections of Education Statistics to 2021" and projections of enrollment, graduates, teachers, and expenditures to the year 2022. In addition to projections at the national level, the report includes projections of public elementary and secondary school enrollment and public high school graduates to the year 2022 at the state level. The projections in this report were produced by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) to provide researchers, policy analysts, and others with state-level projections developed using a consistent methodology. Assumptions regarding the population and the economy are the key factors underlying the projections of education statistics. NCES projections do not reflect changes in national, state, or local education policies that may affect education statistics. Appended are: (1) Introduction to Projection Methodology; (2) Supplementary Tables; (3) Data Sources; (4) References; (5) List of Abbreviations; and (6) Glossary.

AB  - The present study originates in an interest in toddlers' spontaneous literacy activities and Swedish preschool practice. The curriculum for Swedish preschool (National Agency for Education, 2011b) clearly states that preschools should work on the basis of a holistic view of the child and that activities should be both enjoyable and based on toddlers' experiences, play and desire to learn. Because the curriculum can be interpreted in a number of different ways, it is important to highlight how tasks in preschool, specifically those directed at written language, are realized in practice. Hence, the aim of this article is to explore educators' talk about their work with written language within an early childhood literacy frame. The study is seen from a social constructionist perspective, and the analysis is based on focus group interviews with ten preschool educator teams on two separate occasions for each. Two themes are identified as being clearly displayed in the educators' talk about toddlers' literacy: The first theme is "doing literacy: toddlers' bodily and material manifestations". The second theme covers the educators' educational manner and the "educators' construction of literacy: a playful and material approach based on values and traditions". Finally, these themes are discussed in relation to the educators' professional language, concrete and contextual literacy events, material aspects and a view of toddlers as literate persons in their own right. Hence, the study contributes to a wider discussion about toddlers' everyday activities and interest in written language. In addition, the study makes the suggestion that, in order for work with literacy among toddlers to be based on the child, professional language which highlights toddlers' ways of expression from a broad perspective of what it is to be literate, is needed.

AB  - Systematic quality work is an important commitment for Swedish preschools. The latest changes to the regulations and curriculum for the Swedish preschool have increased the expectations for follow-up and documentation of each child’ s experiences and proficiencies in the curriculum’ s target areas, as well as how this is linked to quality development work in the preschool in general (cf. Sverige, 2010; The Ministry of Education 2010). Within the preschool manager function lies a special responsibility for the planning, monitoring and development of these activities and for ensuring that the systematic quality work is carried out in conjunction with the staff, guardians and children. Research on principals’ leadership in schools has generated a solid base of knowledge over time, but, in the Swedish context it seems that the research has paid less attention to the preschool manager’ s leadership. This paper focuses on preschool managers’ leadership as it relates to quality development and learning for the staff. It builds upon the results of a previous study where 18 preschool managers, in a questionnarie with open-ended questions, expressed their understanding of their own leadership in the systematic quality work (cf. Håkansson, 2016). The results from the study showed, among other things, a tension between linear and interactive forms of governance in the systematic quality work, but also that knowledge gaps among the staff could lead to uncertainties that the preschool manager has to address. In the study, there were traces of what can be characterised as leadership for learning (ibid.). The research reported in this paper is a qualitative follow-up interview study with ten of the preschool managers mentioned above. The main purpose of the paper is to contribute to a deeper understanding of preschool managers’ leadership of systematic quality work in Swedish preschools. Three research questions are adressed: What strategies and substantial leader actions do the preschool managers use in the systematic quality work?How do the preschool managers handle knowledge gaps and uncertainties around the systematic quality work among the staff?In what ways do the general governance of the systematic quality work from the municipality influence the preschool managers leadership for learning in practice?The theoretical framework of this study is based on curriculum theory (i.e. the frame factor theory, Lundgren, 1989), which among other things, pay attention to three components in the understanding of, for example, the outcome of teaching, or in this case preschool managers leadership in the systematic quality work – frames/preconditions, processes, results. In this study it is chiefly the internal and organisational preconditions and how they influence processes and outcomes that are in focus. Other research-based points of departure for the study is the school improvement research carried out in recent decades which have helped to highlight what it is that characterises successful development work and leadership (cf. Hallinger 2011; Hargreaves and Fullan 2012), but also the knowledge base around professional and collegiate learning, which in this context is related to the preschool managers’ leadership (Stoll, 2009). Also important as a framework and related to the mentioned empirical research is the research on school principals in general but also and particularly research related to preschool managers (c.f. Hallinger, 2011; Nihlfors, Jervik Steen, and Johansson, 2015; Ang, 2011; Ho 2011). Of special interest here is for example the concept of ’leadership for learning’ developed in a British preschool context (cf. Siraj-Blatchford and Manni (2008). This study investigates in particular some aspects which relates to the preschool managers’ leadership, such as effective communication and openness around expectations, monitoring and assessment of practices and developing collegiate learning as well as a collaborative culture. The overall research approach in the study is qualitative and the main source of material consists of interview data, complemented with documents describing the tools of the preschools’ systematic quality work. Ten preschool managers have been interviewed, four of them in pairs. The preschool managers’ management teams have also been interviewed but that data is not reported in this paper. The interviews were carried out on site at the different preschools around Sweden.The preschools are situated in municipalities of different sizes, ranging from bigger towns to smaller commuting villages. The interviewed preschool managers are experienced and educated for the task at hand, although not all of them had participated in the national educational programme for school leaders, which is not mandatory for Swedish preschool managers. The interview guide was built upon the earlier mentioned components: frames/preconditions, processes, results, which emanate from the so called frame factor theory (Lundgren, 1972; 1989). Examples of questions/themes from the interview guide are:Preconditions: General: (external conditions; proportion of educated staff; grouping of children et cetera). Internal: Describe how the systematic quality work is organised in the preschool (quality groups; responsibility, ”key persons” et cetera).Processes: What long-term strategies do you as a preschool manager use in the systematic quality work? What are the motives? What are your expectations on the staff’s systematic quality work and its impact on daily work? What concrete leader actions are used in the systematic quality work?Results: Do you have examples on how the leadership leads to collegiate learning among the staff? Can you give examples on how the general governance of the systematic quality work from the municipality influence your leadership?Each interview lasted approximately 60-70 minutes and was recorded with a dictation machine. All the preschool managers had allotted time for the interviews and the themes/questions seemed to contribute to an open dialogue and room for alternative perspectives. This is important as the study is qualitative in nature and designed to create material that is as rich and personally coloured as possible (cf. Cohen, Lawrence, and Morrison 2000 ). The transcripts of the interviews cover more than 50 pages of text and have been analyzed in several steps both deductively and inductevily. Generic categories, preliminary patterns and new questions that arose were tested interactively (cf. McDonald et al. 2014; Bryman, 2002). The results of the empirical analysis will be presented in terms of thematic categories related to the three research questions. Within ongoing analyses it is, for example, obvious that preschool managers use at least three different forms of long-term strategies in the systematic quality work: Long-sightedness through a) organizational solutions (staff allocated to follow-up, evalutation and improvement), b) substantial persistence (for example, recurring important content in the daily work with the children, such as reading aloud), c) systematic use of certain methods/tools in the systematic quality work (cf. replication in science). The results also show that, so far, preschool managers’ expectations on the staff proceed from several perspectives related to for example a) the content of the preschool teachers’ work and their cognitive approach view of children, values, engagement et cetera, b) different actions from the preschool manager (relational actions, formal actions, feed back et cetera). These results will in turn be related to the question of the knowledge gap around the improvement work among the staff in terms of different leader actions for different knowledge levels. When it comes to the overall governance of the systematic quality work in the preschool and how it influence preschool managers leadership that will be discussed in light of the well known concepts top-down, and bottom up (cf. Fullan, 1994; Hopkins et.al., 2014). The preliminary results show that preschool managers handle the governance in an independent way, but at the same time they need a balance between top down and bottom up strategies from the superior level to create a meaningful discussion around quality on their own preschool.

AB  - There is substantial evidence that preschooler's performance in early math is highly correlated to math performance throughout school as well as academic skills in general. One way to help children attain early math skills is by using targeted educational software and the paper discusses potential gains of using such software to support early math development. Furthermore it is argued that the content of early math software should be centered around notions such as number sense and spontaneous focus on numerosity. Beyond that, the paper argues for seven design criteria to consider if the goal is to provide strong support for early math via educational software: (1) use a pedagogical approach clearly based on research on early learning of mathematics, (2) provide a set of relevant representations in an appropriate order, (3) provide informative and meaningful feedback, (4) pay attention to motivational aspects for the age group, (5) provide individually adapted support as well as challenge, (6) include a reporting function for educators, and (7) enable the use of an inclusive pedagogy. These seven design criteria are described and illustrated by concrete examples drawn from a newly developed play-&-learn game in early math: Magical Garden.

AB  - Flera tidigare studier visar att utbildningstraditionen i samh�llet har f�r�ndrats. Idag utbildar sig fler p� gymnasiet och fler l�ser vidare p� h�gre utbildningar vilket inneb�r att utbildningsniv�n i v�rt samh�lle �kat. Utbildningssystemet beskrivs ofta som ett �sj�lvreproducerande system�, d�r ben�genhet att v�lja en viss utbildning i h�g grad �r beroende av utbildningstradition, framf�r allt i familjen, men ocks� i samh�llet runt individen. I �storps kommun har en l�g utbildningstradition uppm�rksammats. Det �r inte ovanligt med avhopp fr�n gymnasiet och ett flertal gymnasieelever slutf�r inte sin gymnasieutbildning inom de avsedda tre �ren. N�r det g�ller h�gre studier vid h�gskola eller universitet ligger utbildningsniv�n i �storps kommun l�gre �n riksgenomsnittet. Med anledning av detta beslutade �storps kommun att f�lja upp gymnasieeleverna genom en studie. Studiens syfte �r att tillvara erfarenheter av utbildning bland ungdomar i �storps kommun samt �ka kunskapen om hur ungdomarna ser p� framtida utbildnings- och karri�rm�jligheter. Resultaten i studien visar att m�nga ungdomar efterfr�gar mer st�d fr�n vuxna i skolan n�r det kommer till val av utbildning och framtida yrke.

AB  - Background: The rising number of children in daycare nurseries increases opportunities for the transmission of infectious diseases. Pathogens may be transmitted directly from child to child via sneezing, coughing and touching, or indirectly via the environment. Toys are among the fomites with the highest pathogen load, but their role in disease transmission is unknown. Aim: To determine if washing and disinfection of toys can reduce sickness absence and microbial pathogen load in the nursery environment. Methods: Twelve nurseries (caring for 587 children) were randomized to intervention and control groups. The intervention consisted of washing and disinfection of toys and linen every two weeks for three months by a commercial cleaning company. The extent and causes of sickness absence among the children were recorded in both groups before and after introduction of the intervention. Ten sampling points in each nursery were examined for bacteria and respiratory viruses. Results: The presence of respiratory virus DNA/RNA was widespread, but very few pathogenic bacteria were found in the environment. The intervention reduced the presence of adenovirus [odds ratio (OR) 2.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-5.0], rhinovirus (OR 5.3, 95% CI 2.3-12.4) and respiratory syncytial virus (OR 4.1, 95% CI 1.5-11.2) compared with the control group, but the intervention had no effect on sickness absence or disease patterns in the nurseries. Conclusion: Although cleaning and disinfection of toys every two weeks can decrease the microbial load in nurseries, it does not appear to reduce sickness absence among nursery children.

AB  - The number of children in daycare centers (DCCs) is rising. This increases exposure to microorganisms and infectious diseases. Little is known about which bacteria and viruses are present in the DCC environment and where they are located. In the study described in this article, the authors set out to determine the prevalence of pathogenic bacteria and viruses and to find the most contaminated fomites in DCCs. Fifteen locations in each DCC were sampled for bacteria, respiratory viruses, and gastrointestinal viruses. The locations were in the toilet, kitchen, and playroom areas and included nursery pillows, toys, and tables, among other things. Coliform bacteria were primarily found in the toilet and kitchen areas whereas nasopharyngeal bacteria were found mostly on toys and fabric surfaces in the playroom. Respiratory viruses were omnipresent in the DCC environment, especially on the toys.

AB  - This article analyses how ‘eco-certified children’ are constructed as desirable subjects in teaching materials addressing education for sustainable development. We are interested in how discourses structure this cherished practice and how this practice has become ‘natural’ and obvious for us. A discourse analysis is carried out by looking at the material through the lens of Foucault’s notion of pastoral power. The analysis departs from teaching material addressing issues on sustainable development: (1) textbooks for primary and secondary school; (2) games targeted at preschool and school children; and (3) children’s books about sustainable development. The results show that the discourse of education for sustainable development is characterized by scientific and mathematical objectiv- ity and faith in technological development. It emphasizes the right of the individ- ual and the obligation to make free, however ‘correct’, choices. In the teaching materials, the eco-certified child therefore emerges as knowing, conscious, rational, sacrificing and active. This child is constructed through knitting together personal guilt with global threats, detailed individual activities with rescuing the flock and the planet. In a concluding discussion, we discuss how ESD is framed in a neoliberal ideology. With the help of ESD, an economic discourse becomes dressed in an almost poetic language.

AB  - Research Findings: Early child care policy and practice are grounded in a growing understanding of the importance of the first years of life. In earlier studies, associations between child–staff ratios and peer skills yielded inconsistent findings. The current study used data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development ( N = 1,364) to test the existence of curvilinear associations between child–staff ratios and observed peer skills at the ages of 3 and 4.5 years in order to derive optimal ratios featuring higher levels of peer skills. The findings indicated curvilinear associations between child–staff ratio during the first 3 and 4.5 years and the frequency of positive and negative peer interactions—especially positive peer interactions. Furthermore, these curvilinear associations characterized positive play with a friend at 4.5 years. Optimal child–staff ratios featuring higher levels of peer skills were somewhat lower for positive play with a friend than for the frequency of positive peer interactions. Practice or Policy: Curvilinear associations that point to an optimal value of child–staff ratio may be used to validate child care standards. Optimal child–staff ratios found in the current study coincided with recommended early care standards. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

AB  - Caregiver–child interaction and social participation were compared in community-based daycare centers and group daycare homes. Use of group daycare homes made it possible to control for group size and adult–child ratio. 10 Ss were randomly selected from 4 facilities. Daycare homes were found to be more structured in terms of curriculum, and more flexible in terms of overall schedule and social–emotional climate. Adult–child interaction and social participation were of higher quality during structured periods in daycare homes. The adult–child interaction in both types of daycare was impersonal and neutral in affective tone. (30 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The presentation takes its point of departure in the relatively new international phenomenon of therapeutic education. This phenomenon is part of the commissioned task in the Nordic countries and internationally to see to the emotional formation of young people in youth education. Taking on Swedish teacher descriptions of how this task is played out in the classroom, we highlight emotional rationales that emerge in these descriptions. In addition, we discuss how these rationales relate to a normative project of fostering qualified collective beings, partly by encouraging the students to search for their “innermost” in order to share it with each other and thereby making their innermost a matter for the collective.

N1  - Presented at the joint symposium &quot;&quot;A global epidemic of mental ill-health? Interdisciplinary perspectives on the educational implications of reconfiguring social, economic and human crises&quot;&quot;. Symposium abstract: This collaborative Symposia is for researchers who share an interest in trying to understand the social, political and educational roots and outcomes of an era of ‘multiple crises’. It responds to a phenomenon in growing numbers of countries around the world for policy makers, media pundits, researchers and citizens themselves to depict apocryphal discourses of crisis. These range from parenting and education, to civic engagement, capitalism itself, the legitimacy of the state and its agencies, experts and authority. Amidst these crises, mental health, emotional well-being and vulnerability, have taken centre stage. Claims from the World Health Organisation that we face a global epidemic of mental ill-health intertwine with claims that we face unprecedented levels of civic disengagement, educational disaffection, poor parenting and economic recession. In many countries, educational settings have become key sites for rising levels of both targeted and generic psycho-emotional interventions. Leaving aside the stark and pessimistic tones of crisis discourses, it does seem that there is a crisis of mental health amongst rising numbers of children, young people and adults. There has been a big increase in diagnosis of syndromes, disorders and other psychological conditions and in prescribed drugs and compulsory specialist interventions, state-sponsored programmes in kindergarten/nurseries, schools, vocational, adult and higher education. But more widely, images of psycho-emotional vulnerability has led to a big rise in programmes to develop competences and attributes of emotional literacy, emotional management, resilience, empathy and self-esteem. And the language of trauma, abuse, stress, anxiety, depression and vulnerability is everywhere, from policy texts to everyday work and home conversations, and teachers’ discussions about their students. Untangling and making sense of the nature and extent of a crisis of mental health is far from easy. It demands imaginative, inter-disciplinary and open minded debate. Can we explain a preoccupation with mental health as a re-defining of everyday life and challenges as part of what some sociologists and educationalists call ‘therapeutic culture’? Is it predominantly a social construction exploited and fuelled by global drug companies and the wider psychology industry? Or do governments unable to address intractable structural social and economic crisis benefit by attributing crisis to individuals’ weak psychological resilience? Is it that governments are trying to toughen us up psychologically to meet the demands of a highly competitive, neo-liberal, marketised world? What images of human subjects are implicated in these discourses and questions? More practically, what role does formal and informal education, at all levels, have in addressing these questions and in developing resilience? 2016-09-15T09:08:42.126+02:00

AB  - Difficulty with social competence is a core deficit of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Research on typically developing children suggests the amount of adult talk they are exposed to can positively affect their social competence. With growth in the number of children with ASD entering the inclusive preschool classroom, there is a need to understand how adult talk in this context influences their development of social competence. This study aimed to determine: (1) the types and amounts of adult talk children with ASD receive in the preschool classroom; (2) the relationship between child characteristics (i.e., autism severity, language, cognitive ability and behavior) as well as setting characteristics (i.e., adult-child ratio and activity area) and adult talk; and (3) the link between adult talk and the socially competent behavior displayed by children with ASD. The data for this study were drawn from a larger study comparing the efficacy of comprehensive treatment models serving preschool-aged children with ASD. Children (ages 3-5) with ASD who were enrolled in business-as-usual (BAU) (n= 23) or LEAP (n= 43) inclusive preschool classrooms made up the sample. Preschoolers were videotaped for roughly 30 minutes during normal center time activities. Videotapes were coded post-hoc by observers naïve to the purposes of the study using adapted versions of two coding schemes: Kontos' (1999) Teacher Talk classification and the Code for Active Student Participation and Engagement-III. The results indicate that child (i.e., autism severity, cognitive ability) and setting (i.e., activity area) affected the types of talk children received. Further, preschoolers who received higher amounts of certain types of adult talk (e.g., supporting peer relations) had more concurrent displays of socially competent behavior. In examining children's social competence over time, it was found that higher amounts of supporting object play and positive social contacts talk positively affected certain indicators of children's social competence (e.g., social motivation), as reported by teachers. Alternatively, children who received large amounts of behavioral management talk at the beginning of the school year were perceived by teachers to have worsening social competence (e.g., social awareness) by the end of the year. Implications future research and practice are discussed.

AB  - Studied the social interaction of 9 handicapped and 21 normal Ss (mean ages 4.82 and 4.46 yrs, respectively) with one another and 6 teachers. The mean General Cognitive Indexes (as measured by the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities) of handicapped and normal Ss were 71.13 and 101.05, respectively. Although most variables showed no differences between handicapped and normal Ss' peer- and teacher-directed behaviors, results suggest that normal Ss tended to selectively interact with other normal Ss when engaging in more complex (associative) social play. Handicapped Ss did not show the same tendency to interact more within their own group. Handicapped Ss received more help and affection from peers, and were more affectionate toward peers than were normal Ss. Teachers refused handicapped Ss' requests and corrected their behavior more often; however they also gave them more help and more affection than they did normal Ss. Results are generally congruent with those of J. Ipsa and B. Matz (1978) but showed more segregation on the part of normal Ss. (17 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In this study we investigated determinants of the graduation rate of public alternative schools by analyzing the most recent, nationally representative data from Schools and Staffing Survey 2007-2008. Based on the literature, we built a series of three regression models via successive block entry, predicting the graduate rate first by (a) student demographics, then by (a) student demographics and (b) staffing characteristics, and finally by (a) student demographics, (b) staffing characteristics, and (c) school processes, with a purpose to compare the models to study the effects of those variables more amenable to policies (i.e., staffing characteristics and school processes). Among others, we found (a) that staffing characteristics and school processes are important blocks of variables to predict the graduation rate, (b) that summer programs and Hispanic teacher ratio are positively associated with the graduation rate, with having same teachers for 2 years or more being a marginally positive predictor, and (c) that having the traditional grade structure and providing day care are negatively correlated with the graduation rate. Implications of our findings for policy and future research are discussed.

Work conditions had not changed for half; half did not agree with the staff-child ratio; and three-quarters were not satisfied with their awards and wanted higher wages. (HTH)

AB  - PURPOSE: We describe the development of voiding patterns and bladder control in healthy children during the first 3 years of life. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We determined voiding patterns, bladder capacity and post-void residual urine volume per 4 hours individually and noninvasively every 3 months in 36 female and 23 male healthy infants using the 4-hour voiding observation. RESULTS: Voiding frequency decreased slowly from 5 to 2 voiding episodes per 4 hours from ages 3 months to 3 years. We noted interrupted voiding in 33% of subjects at age 3 months but this condition was rare after age 2 years. Voiding during sleep occurred mainly during the first 7 months of life and did not continue after age 18 months. Bladder capacity increased from a median of 52 to 67, 68 and 123 ml. during years 1 to 3, respectively. As measured by post-void residual urine volume, bladder emptying was unchanged during years 1 and 2 but it decreased during year 3 (median 6 versus 0 and mean 4 versus 3 ml. per 4 hours). CONCLUSIONS: During the first 3 years of life the number of voiding episodes, including interrupted voiding, post-void residual urine and voiding during sleep, decreased while bladder capacity increased.

AB  - There are conflicts between waged labour and motherhood that make it difficult for women to seize independence as workers and at the same time be mothers. These conflicts manifest themselves in women’s everyday practices as well as in feminist theory and in the women’s movement. The purpose of the thesis is to study the construction of motherhood and labour, and how the meanings attributed to motherhood and labour uphold women’s subordination. It is a study of how motherhood and labour are used to naturalise the gender order and make it legitimate. This is done by analysing texts on childminders encompassing the period 1967 to 1999. In Sweden, childminders are often perceived as solving the conflict between waged work and motherhood in a specific way. Employed by the municipal authorities, childminders work at home, taking care of other people’s children as well as their own. However, solving one dilemma, they find themselves in another. Working with children in the confinement of the home is not seen as a “real job” as long as it is connected to motherhood. The struggle of the childminders to count as “real” workers is a tale of their separation from motherhood. In the study, perceptions of motherhood and labour are seen as expressions of gender relations, which means that motherhood and labour are seen as equally gendered and structured. In political theory, labour is seen as the key to property in the person, as well as representing labourers’ contribution to society. This understanding of work renders it crucial to theories of democracy, as it legitimises the worker’s political participation. The dissertation shows how this theoretical function of labour rests on constructing motherhood as the other, and mothers as incapable and illegitimate political subjects. Three key distinctions between motherhood and labour are distinguished and analysed. The first deals with the perception of motherhood as “being” and labour as “doing”. The second focuses on the conception that labour is a goal-oriented, rational activity whilst motherhood is seen as biologically determined with its own intrinsic values. In this view, motherhood can therefore not be understood as an activity that aims to transform. The third distinction is the opposition between the irreplaceability of the mother and the replaceability of labour power. The thesis concludes that strategies defining mother-like activities as labour presume that these activities are distinguished from motherhood. Paradoxically, when women in general become working mothers, leaving children at day-care, the biological aspect of motherhood is stressed, upholding motherhood as an institution. The differences construed between motherhood and labour are often naturalised and ascribed to women’s biology and double hardships: that they need to be both mothers and workers. This formulation makes it possible to manoeuvre and control women. Labour and motherhood can be used against each other in ways that grant men control over women, and at the same time deprive women of their power to act. Patriarchal power seems to be necessary to maintain the present underpinnings of democratic theory.

AB  - In recent years, economic downturn and changes to Indiana's school funding have resulted in significant financial reductions in General Fund allocations for many of Indiana's public school corporations. The main purpose of this statewide study is to examine the possible impacts of these budget reductions on class size and student achievement. This three-year, quantitative study examines budget cutback amounts, teaching position reductions, per-pupil spending changes, class-size data, and student-achievement indicators. Methods of data collection include a statewide superintendent's survey, an evaluation of student achievement indicators, and a collection of public financial records of participating Indiana school corporations. Currently, year one is complete. A compilation of this data provides current information regarding General Fund budgets, position reductions, and class sizes for Indiana's public schools.

AB  - What kind of cognitive capacity must a human child develop to be able to join pretend play? This is the main question of the dissertation. To get a fair answer a great part of the background discusses what pretend play and human cognition is. Homo sapiens sapiens seems to be the only now living animal that is capable of pretense. That indicates, not only that humans have a special cognition, but also, that pretend play is a very complex activity that demands a complex cognitive capacity. To get a better understanding of what pretend play is for preschool children an experiment was carried out. Children from two to five years of age were included in the test. Two main groups, with three-year-olds and five-year-olds, were compared. The test material consisted of video clips with children acting. In some of the clips they were acting like in a real everyday situation. In other clips children were pretend playing. The video clips were designed to vary in certain ways to find out whether the test groups were affected by this in their decision making. They were supposed to tell what kind of activity they saw and if it was for real or pretense. The results suggest that children are influenced by several factors: play signals (smile, sound effect, different timing in movement), play objects (replications, strange objects, fictive objects) the number of actors (in this case one or two) and violations of everyday rules/laws. It was a clear difference between three-year-olds and five-yearolds with respect to what sense they could make of a scene and what they were influenced by. Five year old children are more capable of telling what intention an actor (playmate) has during complex pretend play even when the indicating factors are few. Three year old children cannot always understand the full intention behind a pretense scene. They depend strongly on play signals and certain objects to tell if the scene is a real or a pretend play scene. Also they do not understand what a scene is about if the actors use fictive objects. Differences between test groups are in many cases statistically significant suggesting that the cognitive capacity differs from three to five years of age. The cognition of a five year old is generally more redundant and robust in understanding pretend play.

AB  - Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) has been associated with persistent diarrhea, reduced growth acceleration, and failure to thrive in children living in developing countries and with childhood diarrhea in general in industrialized countries. The clinical implications of an EAEC carrier-status in children in industrialized countries warrants clarification. To investigate the pathological significance of an EAEC carrier-state in the industrialized countries, we designed a 1-year dynamic cohort study and performed follow-up every second month, where the study participants submitted a stool sample and answered a questionnaire regarding gastrointestinal symptoms and exposures. Exposures included foreign travel, consumption of antibiotics, and contact with a diseased animal. In the capital area of Denmark, a total of 179 children aged 0-6 years were followed in a cohort study, in the period between 2009 and 2013. This is the first investigation of the incidence and pathological significance of EAEC in Danish children attending daycare facilities. Conventional microbiological detection of enteric pathogens was performed at Statens Serum Institute, Copenhagen, Denmark, and at Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark. Parents completed questionnaires regarding gastrointestinal symptoms. The EAEC strains were further characterized by serotyping, phylogenetic analysis, and susceptibility testing. EAEC was detected in 25 (14%) of the children during the observational period of 1 year. One or more gastrointestinal symptoms were reported from 56% of the EAEC-positive children. Diarrhea was reported in six (24%) of the EAEC positive children, but no cases of weight loss, and general failure to thrive were observed. The EAEC strains detected comprised a large number of different serotypes, confirming the genetic heterogeneity of this pathotype. EAEC was highly prevalent (n = 25, 14%) in Danish children in daycare centers and was accompanied by gastrointestinal symptoms in 56% of the infected children. No serotype or phylogenetic group was specifically linked to children with disease. © 2016 Hebbelstrup Jensen, Stensvold,Struve, Olsen, Scheutz, Boisen, Röser, Andreassen, Nielsen, Schønning, Petersen and Krogfelt.

AB  - Konklusion og perspektiver Samlet set kan det konkluderes, at ny viden fra VIDA i København-uddannelsen er blevet implementeret i fornyelse af praksisser i en stor del af institutionerne, hovedsageligt, som det er nævnt, som det kommer til udtryk på lederniveau. Det er især principperne om refleksion, systematik og håndtering af viden, der synes at være slået igennem. I forhold til princippet om organisatorisk læring peger analysen på, at der kan være en række udfordringer i flere institutioner i forhold til at ”formidle”, dele og ”sælge” VIDA-modellen og VIDA i København-viden til den samlede personalegruppe inden for den forholdsvis korte projektperiode (1 år). På samme tid kan der også kun identificeres få eksempler på, at den nye viden er blevet til egentlig innovation forstået som nye aktiviteter og praksisser, dvs. praksisser, som er realiseret og forankret i nye praksisser. Den samlede analyse har endvidere givet et indblik i, hvilke faktorer der kan virke henholdsvis styrkende og hæmmende i et projektforløb som VIDA i København. Her har det vist sig, at tid, ledelse, struktur og rutiner i den organisatoriske praksis spiller en rolle som mulige hindringer, men også, at der hvor det ser ud til at lykkes at implementere ny viden i praksis, er i institutioner præget af, at der prioriteres forhold som tid, struktur og rutiner på nye måder, så det at implementere forskningsviden konkret i nye praksisser gøres muligt. Når det er sagt, skal det understreges, at rapporten belyser udvikling af ledelsespraksis, pædagogisk praksis og hensigten om at forankre denne, og det er sket inden for en meget kort tidsramme. Derfor skal resultaterne tages med det forbehold, at tidsrammen nok var for kort, når ambitionen er at skabe omfattende forandringer. Et længerevarende forløb ville sandsynligvis kunne have medført endnu større forandringer og resultater, som vi så det i VIDA-modelprogrammet, et 2-årigt projektforløb. Rapporten skal derfor især avendes som et pejlemærke for, hvor deltagerne i VIDA i København er ”på vej hen” – det vil sige, at rapporten peger fremad. Baseret på disse resultater vil videreudvikling af VIDA i København med fordel vil kunne inddrage erfaringer fra dette studie ved at satse på længerevarende forløb, sikre at deltagende dagtilbud understøttes i at organisere og prioritere tid, ledelses- og strukturelle vilkår samt understøttes i at skabe konkrete organiseringer med henblik på at etablere og fastholde nye former for fælles læreprocesser i dagligdagen. Ved et fortsat arbejde med at sætte øget fokus på at organisere hverdagens praksisser vil dette i sig selv styrke betingelserne for, at forankring af ny viden i praksisser realiseres.

AB  - Because children with autism often insist on sameness, teachers minimize the number of changes experienced throughout the day. This study examined the effects of a rotating classroom schedule on the behaviors of children attending a school for children with autism. Archival data, 6 months prior to classroom rotation and 6 months after classroom rotation, were analyzed for 81 children and adolescents attending a school for youth with autism. Fifty-one of these participants did not have any crisis events either before or after classroom rotation. Results from nonparametric tests indicated no statistically significant change in number of crisis events or time in crisis after rotation was implemented. Limitations of the study and the implications for educational planning for students with autism are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

AB  - Background: Although health care reforms may improve efficiency at the macro level, less is known regarding their effects on the utilization of health care personnel. Following the 2002 Norwegian hospital reform, we studied the productivity of the physician workforce and the effect of personnel mix on this measure in all nineteen Norwegian hospitals from 2001 to 2013. Methods: We used panel analysis and non-parametric data envelopment analysis (DEA) to study physician productivity defined as patient treatments per full-time equivalent (FTE) physician. Resource variables were FTE and salary costs of physicians, nurses, secretaries, and other personnel. Patient metrics were number of patients treated by hospitalization, daycare, and outpatient treatments, as well as corresponding diagnosis-related group (DRG) scores accounting for differences in patient mix. Research publications and the fraction of residents/FTE physicians were used as proxies for research and physician training. Results: The number of patients treated increased by 47% and the DRG scores by 35%, but there were no significant increases in any of the activity measures per FTE physician. Total DRG per FTE physician declined by 6% (p < 0.05). In the panel analysis, more nurses and secretaries per FTE physician correlated positively with physician productivity, whereas physician salary was neutral. In 2013, there was a 12%–80% difference between the hospitals with the highest and lowest physician productivity in the differing treatment modalities. In the DEA, cost efficiency did not change in the study period, but allocative efficiency decreased significantly. Bootstrapped estimates indicated that the use of physicians was too high and the use of auxiliary nurses and secretaries was too low. Conclusions: Our measures of physician productivity declined from 2001 to 2013. More support staff was a significant variable for predicting physician productivity. Personnel mix developments in the study period were unfavorable with respect to physician productivity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

AB  - In Sweden, as in the other Nordic countries, teacher education programmes have in recentyears become increasingly scientific. The importance of scientific knowledge andunderstanding has been emphasised and the professional teacher is seen not only as a ‘doer’but also, and more importantly so, as ‘a reflective practitioner’. In the education of all newteachers - from preschool to upper secondary school – the emphasis is currently on the factthat teaching is to be seen as an outcome of a scientific approach and scientifically-groundedworking methods. Simultaneously, the status of workplace-based learning (VFU) has becomeelevated to form an integral part of the programme of education, on an equal footing with themore theoretical content. In preschool settings, educated teachers work side-by-side with staffwho, although they lack any formal education, nevertheless can sometimes have longexperience from work in these settings.My aim here is to present an exploratory study of a recently started teacher educationprogramme in which all of the participants, although they have a long experience from workin pedagogical settings in preschools and recreational centres, have no formal teachereducation. It is a characteristic of this educational programme that, to be accepted, studentshave to work at least 50% of a full-time post in their ordinary workplaces. The aim of thestudy is twofold. One part is to describe and analyse the students’ experiential knowledge aswell as whether, and if so how, that knowledge is transformed in the interaction withtheoretical knowledge during the education programme. The other aim is to describe andanalyse the process of change in professional identity that takes place in the shift from oneprofession to another in the same workplace.In this paper I present the results of an initial discourse analysis of the ways in whichprospective teacher students talk about their pedagogical field of action, the ideas they haveconcerning their forthcoming profession and the forms of experiential knowledge that theypossess and express. The analysis was performed on texts and recorded discussions producedduring an introductory course the aim of which was to validate the participants’ knowledgeusing the first year courses studied by students on the university’s regular teacher educationprogramme as a benchmark. The study can be regarded as a longitudinal exploratory casestudyand I will, in this presentation, also introduce a number of tentative results relating tothe students’ experiential and theoretically-based knowledge at the end of the two initialprogramme courses. Further, I will also discuss the students’ professional identities and,finally, I will present and explore a research design that is intended to comprise participantobservations, interviews and document-analysis, planned for the next three and a half years.

AB  - This thesis consists of four self-contained essays. Essay 1: Mixed-aged classes (MA-classes) are a common phenomenon around the world. In Sweden, these types of classes increased rapidly during the 1980:s and 1990:s, despite the fact that existing empirical support for MA-classes is weak. In this paper, we estimate the effect of attending an MA-class during grades 4-6 on students’ cognitive skills. Using a unique survey with information on students, parents and teachers, we are able to control for many factors that could otherwise bias the results. We find a negative effect on short-run cognitive skills, as measured by grade 6 cognitive tests, and this effect is robust to a rigorous sensitivity analysis. Essay 2: We examine whether the impact of pre-school interventions on cognitive skills differs by immigrant background. The analysis is based on Swedish data containing information on childcare attendance, rich family background information, the performance on cognitive tests at age 13, and long-run educational attainment for cohorts born between 1967 and 1982. We find that childcare attendance reduces the gap in language skills between children from immigrant backgrounds relative to native-born children. We find no differential effects on inductive skills, however. Nor does childcare appear to affect the distribution of long-run educational attainment. Essay 3: This paper estimates the effect of child gender on mothers’ and fathers’ parental leave. The focus on Sweden, a highly gender equal society, yields additional knowledge on the prevalence of gender biases in industrialized countries. The results show that a first born son increases fathers’ parental leave with 0.6 days (1.5 percent) and decreases mothers’ leave by a similar amount, leaving the total leave unchanged. Both the sign and size of this effect is in line with previous research. However, there are interesting differences between groups that departs from previous studies. Non-traditional families, with high maternal relative earnings and/or educational levels, show even larger gender biases, indicating that it may be mothers, rather than fathers, that are the driving force behind this child gender bias. Essay 4: This paper investigates the effect of parental leave – both own and spousal – on subsequent earnings using different sources of variation. Using fixed-effects models, and in line with previous results, parental leave is found to decrease each parent’s future earnings. Also spousal leave is important, but only for mothers. In fact, each month the father stays on parental leave has a larger positive effect on maternal earnings than a similar reduction in the mother’s own leave. Using two reforms of the parental leave system as exogenous sources of variation yields only imprecisely estimated effects, even though the reforms had a strong effect on parental leave usage. However, the point estimates tentatively suggest effects in the same range or larger than the fixed-effects model found.

AB  - Preschool teachers observe children’s behaviors and assess their abilities in relation to explicit or implicit expectations and norms daily. In Sweden as in the OECD generally, the pressure to assess children’s development has increased immensely over the last decade, even in the preschool. This ethnographic study investigates assessment as a part of the daily routine of Swedish preschools. The setting is two preschools: a multi-ethnic preschool in a disadvantaged area, and a preschool that teaches children with predominately Swedish middle class background. The study includes data from participatory observations, recorded conversations and interviews with teachers as well as written documentation about the children. Using Giddens’ constructs of structuration, rules and resources, I found that preschool teachers (re)structured the institutional practice in everyday activities. In everyday practice they used available resources in order to comply with the curriculum, within the institutional frames of rules. Recently imposed assessments were assimilated to the ordinary routines of the preschool. Furthermore, new demands of documenting the development and learning of individual children contradict an earlier statutes that preschool children should not be subjected to assessments. To resolve this conflict, teachers adopt modes of writing and talking about the children, which seemingly focus on the performance of the preschool, but construct the children “between the lines”. The stories of individual children are thus hidden in stories about the institution. This can be understood as soft governance (Foucault) or symbolic violence (Bourdieu). Finally, the socializing messages were different in the two preschools: adaptation to given linguistic and social norms predominated at the culturally diverse preschool; whereas creativity and pliability towards children’s wishes prevailed at the culturally homogenous preschool. This suggests that assessment practices both indicate and reinforce different institutional habitus in different preschools which may be seen as a threat to the role of education in promoting equity.

AB  - Aspects of democracy in preschool-home collaboration Research topicThe research is a part of a larger project aiming to consolidate relationships between universities and schools/preschools in order to develop models for cooperation. This presentation focus on the first stage of the project and examines preschool teachers’ understandings of the democratic mission of preschool. The aim of this presentation is to highlight some issues of teachers’ work and aspects of democracy in relation to preschool-home collaboration. Theoretical framework The theoretical framework is an ecological approach of “teacher agency” according to Priestly, Biesta and Robinson (2015). Agency situated in teachers’ professional work, described as the outcomes of interactive processes of critical reflections, as entanglements of their experiences and projective abilities. Reflections used to evaluate how to respond to problematic situations and dilemmas occurring in the situated cultural, structural and material context, called the practical-evaluative dimension (Biesta et. al., 2015). The theory help illustrate teachers’ differing aspects of democracy, and how teachers form their action repertoires when evaluating experiences out of the situated context. Methodological design The data collected through interviews in focus groups, included 48 preschool teachers discussing the democratic mission and teacher assignments. Conversations recorded and analyzed by content analysis. The initial analyze revealed that aspects of democracy in relation to preschool-home collaboration were predominant in the discussions about the democratic mission. This appeared as an emergent theme around democracy and was analyzed by the practical-evaluative dimension of the theoretical perspective of TA. Findings The result show how structural and cultural factors as policies, education, religion, language, discourses and norms were crucial in the teachers’ understandings of democracy in relation to preschool-home collaboration.It reveals three different approaches of teacher agency that suggests various consequences for preschool-home collaboration:Predominant approach, teacher agency characterized by teachers using power to maintain norms and strong structures in disagreements with parents. Democracy regarded as a content, but not practiced as a form, in teachers’ response to parents and children. An approach that constrains parents’ and children’s participation. Limited approach is appearing in situations where teachers lack experiences or/and knowledge about the teaching assignment and policies. This often results in teachers avoiding problematic situations and dilemmas in their work. Transformative approach of teacher agency is when teachers being critical to their own ideas and interested in different perspectives. Understanding democracy as a way to exist with others to increase mutual understandings of problematic situations and dilemmas occurring in preschool-home collaboration. Democracy made together in deliberative conversations between teachers, children and parents that enables participation. Relevance to Nordic educational research This presentation contributes with knowledge about how different approaches of teacher agency enable or constrain preschool-home collaboration. Understandings that provides an opportunity to increase achievement of democracy in preschool-home collaboration. A crucial part of the democratic mission of preschool. The larger project provides knowledge of cooperation models between researchers and teachers in order develop collaboration between universities and schools/preschools.

AB  - Research topic/aimIn 2017, a regional cooperation project was initiated with four municipalities and Halmstad University, called From Great to Excellence (FGTE). The project is planned to run for five years, and participants are persons active in schools and preschools at different levels within the school practice. Within the FGTE project, the participants perform different development projects in cooperation across the municipal boundaries, where they act as critical friends for each other in order to drive each project forward (see e.g. Sales, Moliner, &amp; Amat, 2017). In this study we have focus on the utilization of knowledge acquired in groups in participants own school context. The question we ask is “How is transfer of knowledge from group work to own practice perceived by participants participating in a course about research methodology? Theoretical frameworkThe theoretical framework in this study is situated within the socio-cultural field, since much of the focus is around the collaboration between the participants. Conversation is an arena for developing knowledge and by supporting and challenging each other's pronounced thoughts, prerequisites for development of knowledge are given (Vygotsky, 1978).Methodological designThe empirical material for the present study consists of a questionnaire disseminated to the participants after they had completed the course. A total number of 57 questionnaires were collected which counts for about 65-70 percent of the total number of participants. The questionnaires were analyzed with SPSS factor analysis to detect underlying variables.Expected conclusions/findingsPreliminary results show that, while expecting quite the opposite, by using factor analysis, a strong negative relation between, on one hand, the variable “the usage of research methodology has developed in the group”, and on the other hand, the variables “I have increased my ability to use new analytical concepts in my practise and “I have increased knowledge in evaluating my own practice”. Meaning that the participants do not feel they, themselves, have learned more about the use of scientific methods relating to their own practice. While the group is progressing, their own learning has been put back.Relevance to Nordic educational researchThrough this study, we want to highlight the potential for improvement work in preschool and school practice which lies in developing school activities through a regional cooperation project. This, we mean, are of utmost relevance to Swedish/Nordic as well as international research fields within education.ReferencesDanielsson, E. (2017).

AB  - This paper offers a summary analysis of 4 years of interviews with 1,003 kindergarten and first through third grade teachers regarding their experience in teaching either a small class, a regular size class, or a regular size class with a full-time teacher's aide. The paper uses teachers' descriptions of their experience to explore the effect of reduced class size or reduced teacher/pupil ratio on developmental appropriateness of primary grade curriculum and on adult-child interaction. Current class size research is briefly sketched. The paucity of findings regarding classroom processes is noted. Next, Project STAR, a 4-year longitudinal study of effects of reduced class size and teacher/pupil ratio in kindergarten through third grades is described. Results of the teacher interviews are summarized and discussed in relation to the National Association for the Education of Young Children's position statements on developmentally appropriate practice in the primary grades. It is concluded that small classes of about 15 students and regular size classes of about 25 students and a full-time aide contribute to a primary grade experience that is more congruent with the developmental and learning needs of students than is the experience of proportionally larger classes.

AB  - Challenging behavior in preschool is a serious concern for teachers. Positive behavior interventions and supports (PBIS) have been shown to be effective in reducing such behaviors. Class-Wide Function-Related Intervention Teams (CW-FIT) is a specific multi-tiered intervention for implementing effective classroom management strategies using PBIS practices. CW-FIT has been shown to be effective in elementary classrooms but has not yet been evaluated with younger age groups. CW-FIT Tier 1 is a group contingency utilizing social skills training, teacher praise, and positive reinforcement to improve student behavior. The present study examined the effects of CW-FIT Tier 1 implementation on student group on-task behavior and on teacher praise and reprimand rates in four preschool classrooms. A single-subject delayed multiple baseline design with embedded reversals was used to evaluate impact. Results indicated the intervention increased student group on-task behavior and teacher praise to reprimand ratios. Both teachers and children found CW-FIT Tier 1 to be socially valid. Limitations and implications of this study for researchers and practitioners are discussed.

AB  - This article considers the issue of recruitment of men into primary teaching, with particular reference to the early years of schooling. The latest UK statistics reveal that there are 27,000 male primary teachers and 141,000 females. However there are disproportionately greater numbers of male head teachers. The presence of men in this environment is perceived as crucial. The public discourse, then, calls for more men to function as role models and this paper examines the different voices within this discourse. It also surveys the initiatives taken by the UK government and the Teacher Training Agency as part of the recruitment drive to secure more men in the primary sector. The second part of the article presents research undertaken with female teachers. It explores their perceptions and experiences of male teachers at key stage one. Women suggest that rather than recruiting men as a group, what is needed is the "right kind of man". This paper considers this notion and concludes that there needs to be greater clarity within the public discourse as to the meaning of male role models and the need for more men working with young children. The voice of female teachers is currently absent from the public discourse. Given their knowledge and experience, women can offer a significant contribution to policy and should have the opportunity to be heard.

AB  - During preschool history a large number important points of departures regarding children’s learning and development have been brought to attention. In this paper we want to spread some light on two of them. One of these is children’s own experiences and the other is an aesthetic dimension of learning. In this presentation we want describe this topic, to analyse and discuss it. In modern education children’s experiences are considered to be a starting point for their learning and development. A difficulty then is that children arrive to pre-school with different experiences and expectations against which they relate new knowledge of their surrounding world (Pramling Samuelsson &amp; Asplund Carlsson, 2003). Therefore, to take advantage of and make use of each child’s knowledge seems to be a pedagogical consequence in the learning processes. The concept of aesthetics has often got a one-sided interpretation as a methodical support for learning and development about different contents (Pramling et al, 2008). Children have been viewed as creative individuals, who through their own will, actions and practices learn to develop into human beings. At present the Swedish curriculum points out the importance of, as it says: “Creating and communicating by means of different forms of expression…/” (Utbildningsdepartementet, 1998. s. 10). The tendency, thus, is to view aesthetic expressions as a method closely related to children’s development and acquisition of knowledge. The purpose of this study is to find out how aesthetics can be seen as one dimension of children’s experienced world. The research question is how children’s experienced world appear in verbal communication and how will those experiences be used in a learning situation. The study took place in a pre-school setting with children 3-5 year of age. The data consist of video observations in situations where teachers and children work with science content or more specifically they investigated; “What is soil?” The data are analyzed qualitatively (see Sinclair (2001) and Hohr and Lorenzer (1975) in Austring (2006)). The outcome of the analysis shows that three categories of children’s experienced world can be discerned, which we like Sinclair label: “Pathfinder”, “Track-Taker” and “Floater” (Sinclair 2001). The outcome also shows that the children’s use of their experiences is related to these three categories. When the children are dealing with the science content in focus another result points out that there are three different ways of acting present: empirical, aesthetic and discursive way. On a general level one conclusion is, that aesthetics is a natural part of children’s experienced world and that it is of importance for children in their meaning making. Strong or weak aesthetics in a learning situation will be further discussed and problemized.

AB  - This presentation aims to share results from a study concerning the preschool teacher as a curriculum-maker to preschool. The research question addressed is “what is characteristic for the curriculum offered, as it appears in one teacher’s verbal communication with 1-3 year old children?”. The study is carried out in Sweden and the research area is motivated by the need for knowledge about the implications that a goal-oriented preschool curriculum and broad discretion for teachers might imply for activities in preschool. A qualitative case study with a narrative approach has been adopted and follows the Swedish research council guidelines and ethical rules in social science research. Empirical data consists of videotaped observations of communication between a single teacher and a number of children aged between 1 and 3 during one morning in preschool. The results show that the teacher has an idea of bringing up and to conceptualize children’s near surroundings. Further on there is an idea of inclusion and to teach children different abilities. They also show that the teacher frequently uses questions as a means of communication, where a large number of shifts between different children and different issues are particularly characteristic. Although this contributes to a child perspective, it also implies a teacher-centred position and a fragmented way of exercising the discretion vis-à-vis the curriculum. The findings are discussed and related to curriculum theory and to early childhood perspectives. This research is expected to have impact on understandings of how preschool teachers deal with their teaching assignment for the youngest children in preschool.

AB  - The study assessed the nature of teacher–child interactions in early childhood classrooms in India, from the teachers’ and parents’ perspectives. Specifically, the impact of teacher training, satisfaction with training and job, years of experience, and class size on the teacher–child interactions were examined. Sixty-five preschool teachers and 173 parents from an urban city in India comprised the total sample. Results using teacher reports indicated that the findings were not significant. According to parent reports, 25% of variance was accounted. Amount of experience showed a trend towards significance. Satisfaction with training of teachers inversely impacted the nature of teacher–child interactions. These findings suggested the interplay of specific factors such as limited space, finances and cultural notions of teaching/education, and adult–child relations on the perceptions of early childhood teachers and parents on teacher–child interactions in an Indian Context.

AB  - Computer technology holds promise for facilitating learning and teaching in the current educational systems at all levels. This study examined computer use in Jordanian pre-school settings. The study surveyed 113 pre-school teachers from 43 pre-school settings, gathering information about their perception of using computer in their classrooms. Later, in-depth interviews were conducted with 15 teachers. The findings showed that computers were employed in a few pre-school settings although the perceptions of pre-school teachers about using computers were generally positive. Pre-school teachers acknowledged the role of computers in developing children's learning and providing them with exciting and meaningful experiences. Moreover, the findings revealed some difficulties faced by the pre-school teachers in using computers, such as lack of funds, lack of encouragement from head teachers, and the large numbers of children in the classroom were found to be the main impediments for not using computers in their practice. The study concluded by putting forward a number of suggestions and recommendations for the field. (Contains 7 tables.)

AB  - When a child understands number relationships, he or she comprehends the meaning of numbers by developing multiple, flexible ways of representing them. The importance of developing number relationships in the early years has been highlighted because it helps children build a good foundation for developing a more sophisticated understanding of number and quantity; therefore, teachers of young children must provide rich experiences with number relationships, which allows students to develop flexibility in representing numbers. Three types of number relationships (i.e., subitizing, more-less, and parts-whole relationships) can be taught in early childhood classrooms. This article outlines these number relationships, follows with the classroom activities that Becky, a preschool teacher in a university-affiliated program, presented in her preschool classrooms, and discusses effective instructional approaches for teaching number relationships.

AB  - Number relationships, which go far beyond counting skills, refer to the ability to represent a quantity in multiple, flexible ways. It is arguably among the most important mathematics concepts in number and quantity. The current study examined the effectiveness of number relationships instruction in preschool classrooms. Participants included 73 children and 4 teachers from a half-day preschool program in a local school district. For the intervention group, two teachers provided number relationships instruction to 37 of the children in their classrooms (four sections total). No treatment occurred for the control group consisting of the remaining 36 children taught by two teachers. Before and after the 12-week treatment period, the TEMA-3 (Test of Early Mathematics Ability-3rd Edition) was administered both as a pretest and a posttest to assess children's understanding of number and quantity. Results indicated that children in the intervention group who received mathematics instruction with the emphasis on teaching number relationships scored significantly higher on the posttest than their counterparts in the control group. However, results of the current study did not reveal any advantages by age group for number relationships instruction. Small sample size may have limited this analysis.

AB  - Popular Abstract in Swedish I denna avhandling presenteras tre studier som fokuserar på human serviceorganisationer, klientarbete, arbetstillfredsställelse och arbetsmiljö. Det övergripande syftet med denna avhandling var att med särskilt fokus på grad av direkt klientarbete och tillfredsställelse i arbetet undersöka arbetssituationen i olika typer av human serviceorganisationer. I den första studien var syftet att undersöka hur personer som arbetar i nära relation med klienter samt första linjens chefer konstruerar och upplever framgång och misslyckande i arbetet. Resultaten visade att många av de beskrivna framgångs- och misslyckandesituationerna innefattade klientrelationer samt samarbete och kommunikation med anställda och kolleger. Andra viktiga aspekter inkluderade bristande resurser, hög arbetsbelastning samt vaga och otydliga organisationsförändringar. I den andra studien undersöktes huruvida socialsekreterares upplevelse av arbetssituationen kan kopplas till graden av direkt klientkontakt. Enkätsvar från 525 socialsekreterare analyserades och resultaten visade att socialsekreterare med hög grad av personliga kontakter med klienter upplever högre arbetsbelastning och lägre tillfredsställelse och meningsfullhet än de som i mindre omfattning har direktkontakt med klienter. I den tredje studien undersöktes relationen mellan arbetsmiljöaspekter och upplevelsen av generell tillfredsställelse i arbetet bland socialsekreterare (n=525), sjuksköterskor (n=512) och förskollärare (n=545). En enkätundersökning visade att motivation och optimism var den viktigaste faktorn i förklaringen av generell arbetstillfredsställelse. Andra viktiga faktorer var ledarskap, arbetsbelastning, improvisation och initiativ i arbetet, relationer till kolleger, kontroll och organisatoriska mål.

Ample evidence of acute emotional strain along with noticeable grief reactions was found in the early months of bereavement. 10 Ss reacted to the trauma severely and were so markedly hindered in their daily functioning that psychological help was imperative. The disorganizing effect of the trauma of the loss of a father as reflected in this high percentage of disturbance in normal children indicates that a child who has lost a parent is a child at risk.

AB  - Discusses the behaviors and changes reported by the mothers and teachers of 24 normal kibbutz children (aged 1–10 yrs) over a period of 1–26 mo after their fathers died in the October 1973 war in Israel. Adjustment phases, coping strategies, and behavioral symptoms and problems are described. Findings indicate that the death of a father in war brings about a severe stress situation for the child at both the preschool and the middle-childhood age. The abrupt disequilibrium created by the death itself and the resulting changes in the family place difficult demands on the adaptation and coping capacities of the child. Ample evidence of acute emotional strain along with noticeable grief reactions were found in the early months of bereavement. A marked increase in the number and variety of symptomatic behavior changes testified to the seriousness of the threat to the child's sense of well-being after notification of the death. 10 of the 22 Ss aged 2–20 yrs reacted to the trauma severely and were so markedly hindered in their daily functioning that psychological help was considered imperative. The disorganizing effect of the trauma of the loss of a father as reflected in this high percentage of disturbance in normal children indicates that a child who has lost a parent is at risk.

AB  - Background: Particularly in the last 10 years the conceptual models of partial hospitalization are subjected to major changes, reflecting to the integration of day hospitals in regional mental health service systems and especially to the provision of an alternative to acute inpatient treatment. Systematic nation-wide surveys assessing these changes are missing. Method: After developing a structured questionnaire integrating differences in European mental health care systems, a German national survey of current structural and procedural quality markers of psychiatric day hospitals was carried out in 2001. 51.4% of the addressed psychiatric hospitals (N=191) returned the questionnaire. Analysis is based on descriptive and correlational methods, compares the situation in the Eastern and Western German Federal States, and uses cluster analysis to differentiate the day hospitals according to their main program function. Results: In general, establishment of day hospitals in Germany has not yet reached the evidence-based capacity level. This statement especially applies to the situation in rural areas. 56% of the day hospitals currently assess themselves as an alternative to inpatient treatment simultaneously providing differentiated psychotherapeutic treatment. Comparing clinical institutions in the Eastern and Western parts of Germany demonstrates the clearer orientation towards acute psychiatric treatment in the recently (mostly after 1995) established East-German hospitals. This is reflected in the spectrum of main clinical diagnoses, in the average length of treatment episodes, in the definitions of contraindications, and in the provided diagnostic measures. While administrative circumstances are homogenous for day hospitals, there is a considerable variation in staff numbers related to the core professions. Conclusions: Guidelines for professional training and continuous qualification as well as staffing have to be modified according to requirements resulting from the change of clinical functions. Each day hospital has to clarify and define its main program function(s), and has to better communicate the consequences for the regional mental health service system.

AB  - Investigated the reliability of the time-sharing paradigm as a function of the age of the child and the concurrent speaking task employed. Ss were 40 normal right-handed children, 10 at each of 4 age levels: 3, 5, 7, and 9 yrs. Each S was presented with 3 concurrent speaking tasks, syllable repetition, sentence repetition, and story telling. There were control tapping and verbal conditions as well. The entire experimental procedure was administered 2 times within a 2-wk interval. Ss were more likely to show the predicted asymmetry on the 1st administration of the paradigm than on the 2nd one. The sentence repetition task was the one most likely to show the predicted asymmetry between hands, although Ss showed the most consistent performance on the syllable repetition task.

AB  - The effectiveness of a comprehensive intervention with preschool children aimed at reducing the risk of later substance abuse was examined. The intervention targeted risk factors during the preschool years linked to later substance use in adolescence and adulthood. Head Start classrooms were randomly assigned to either the intervention or the control group. A classroom-based curriculum was delivered by Head Start teachers who received a number of training workshops and continued consultation. Parent training and home visits were also provided to intervention families. Positive parenting as well as parent-school involvement increased over the 1st year of intervention. Intervention families maintained the positive effects on parenting into the kindergarten year over a matched control group; however, effects on school bonding were not maintained. Improvements in social competence, reported by teachers and parents, were found at the end of kindergarten. No changes were found for self-regulation.

AB  - Recent advances concerning emerging/beginning reading skills, positive behavioral support (PBS), and three-tiered schoolwide prevention models combined with federal mandates (i.e., IDEA and No Child Left Behind) have stimulated interest in providing early and intensive instructional intervention services to children at risk for reading and behavior problems. New measures for identifying students as early as kindergarten who are not acquiring early basic literacy skills make this possible. However, questions regarding exactly how to formulate, deliver, sustain, and manage secondary-level interventions remain to be addressed. This paper describes first-year, first-grade findings for students participating in secondary-level interventions (i.e., small-group reading instruction) in a randomized trial of the efficacy of secondary and tertiary reading and behavior interventions under way at the Center for Early Intervention in Reading and Behavior, University of Kansas. The formulation of the experimental secondary-level intervention was guided by evidence supporting the efficacy of (a) small groups of 3 to 6 participating students and low student?teacher ratio combined with (b) explicit, phonics-based instruction. Selected curricula were Reading Mastery, Proactive Reading, Programmed Reading, and Read Well, use of which varied by choice across experimental-group schools. PBS was an additional intervention context in experimental schools. Comparison schools and first-grade teachers did not employ the three-tiered model, early screening, or PBS; most students were taught using conventional whole-group instruction, little or no individualization, and curricula with weak scientific evidence. Initial results indicate significantly larger growth for experimental secondary-level at-risk students than for comparisons. Experimental-group first graders not showing growth were those identified with disabilities or behavioral risks and English language learners. Implications are d

AB  - This article presents the results of a survey examining existing early childhood special education practices in Taiwan, the Republic of China. Descriptive data on personnel representing several disciplines currently providing early childhood services were gathered through a questionnaire survey of 134 programmes in Taiwan. The following characteristics of professionals and paraprofessionals (e.g. teaching assistants) in these early childhood intervention programmes were documented: title of job(s); years of experience; levels of education; receipt of specialised early intervention training; types of licence/credential/certification; and in-service training opportunities. Further, programme information such as the following was collected: total number of all children; number of children with special educational needs; staff-child ratio for centre-based programmes; type of service(s) provided by the programme or programme setting(s); and staff case load for home-based programmes.

AB  - Aims: This study evaluated the prevalence of voice problems in kindergarten teachers and investigated some background factors affecting vocal health. Methods: One hundred and nineteen female kindergarten teachers volunteered by responding to an Internet questionnaire on voice habits, voice symptoms, and the amount of negative impact various working conditions may have on their voices. Phoniatric examination was carried out with a rigid laryngoscope. Results: Of the subjects, 71.5% reported frequent strain on the voice (monthly or more often), and 56.3% reported hoarseness without infection. Eighty-six percent reported that when their voice got tired during the working day it recovered quite well, well or remarkably well by the next day. Noise at work was considered most detrimental to the voice. Clear organic findings were observed in 10.9% of the cases and did not correlate with subjective voice symptoms. Conclusions: The results confirmed earlier findings that a remarkable number of kindergarten teachers suffer from voice problems and consider noise in the environment especially to be harmful to their voices. However, the majority reported recovering well from vocal symptoms. Further studies are needed on individual speech habits, working day-related voice evaluation, recovery time and work-environmental factors. A follow-up is warranted to identify the main factors leading to voice problems. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

AB  - Paper 1: This paper examines the determinants of teacher turnover using matched employee-employer panel data from Swedish lower and upper secondary schools in a market-oriented institutional environment with a growing private sector and individually negotiated wages. I find statistically significant and robust negative correlations between mobility and monetary compensations. Unlike previous research, I do not find robust evidence that share of minorities correlates positively with turnover. The positive association exists; however, in the case of private and upper secondary institutions. Paper 2: This paper examines the job mobility of teachers with different skills using matched employer-employee data from Swedish secondary schools. In addition to standard quality measures, I have access to population-wide data on cognitive and non-cognitive assessments of males born in 1951 or later. The results show that high-quality teachers are less mobile than others, and that there is no significant correlation between turnover and share of minority students. Interestingly, teachers with better skills are less likely to leave the profession, which suggests that the documented drop in the quality of inflowing teachers may partly be offset by a higher tendency for high quality teachers to stay in the profession.Paper 3: This paper examines teachers’ mobility in response to exogenous changes in the credentials of their students using data from Stockholm high schools. I explore a major admission reform that lead to the reshuffling of students between schools within the municipality of Stockholm. The results show that a 10-percentile-point increase in student quality decreases the probability of a separation by up to 9 percentage points. These effects are very similar across all types of teachers and are found mainly for mobility between schools rather than out of the profession. They are also present only in the lower half of the student quality distribution. Teachers react mostly to direct measures of student quality (grades from compulsory school) rather than to other characteristics that are correlated with student quality (immigrant status, parental income, paternal cognitive skills). Finally, I do not find any significant effects of changes in student quality on individual teacher’s earnings or school hiring policies.Paper 4: We examine the effects of child’s gender on family expenditure patterns using data from the Polish Household Budget Survey 2003-2010. A first-born daughter compared to first-born son increases overall and child related spending on clothing. At the same time, it decreases spending on games and toys as well as, at the intensive margin, early inputs into human capital production function measured as pre-kindergarten and kindergarten expenditure. We show that these findings are not driven by effects of child gender on maternal labor supply and are unlikely to be driven by the negative effects of first-born girl on fertility decisions or marital stability. Our findings suggest that child gender leads to differential expenditure patterns, which in turn might lead to early assignment of social roles.Paper 5: We estimate the effect of family size on female labour supply using data from the Polish Household Budget Survey, and instrumenting for family size with twinning at first and second birth. We identify a positive bias of OLS in the estimates of maternal labour supply on family size among highly educated and older mothers, and those who had their first child born after the age of 26. This unusual and counterintuitive result confirms the importance of accounting for heterogeneous treatment effects in the analysis of the relationship between labour market and family outcomes. Furthermore, among families with at least one child we identify the total average causal effect of an additional child on mother’s employment to be -6.7 pp. We find no significant effects of having additional children on female employment among families with two or more kids.

AB  - The theme of this thesis is democratic values in pre-school and how these are revealed in the children’s relations in that setting. It describes what the children take responsibility for and how they do it; how they demonstrate care in the sense of consideration, and what they show respect for and how they show it. The study was carried out within the framework of the state pre-school as portrayed in two pre-school departments in a municipality in western Sweden. The daily activity was followed in two pre-school groups comprising children aged 3-6 years, among which field studies were carried out over a total of 36 weeks. Observations focusing on the children’s behaviour and their communication both with each other and the teachers, made with the help of an open research protocol, audio-recordings and diary notes, resulted in descriptive field records, which were analysed in four stages. The understanding of domain theory was used as a conceptual tool for comprehending and explaining how values, value judgement and consensus may be distinguished and sorted. The analytical procedure has been influenced both by a perspective of positioning and power relations and interpretation based on value theory. The analysis has resulted in three thematic values, among which Responsibility is shown in the way the children behave in words and actions, meaning that the children do not speak about taking responsibility but, a fact that is central to this study, initiate responsibility. They show in different ways that they take responsibility for everyday matters both on their own behalf and on behalf of others. Care refers to the perception of others’ needs in an empathic way, and that the children demonstrate by their actions an empathic understanding of someone else. This means that care is a value that the children use in order to support each other within their cultural community as separate from adults’ perspective. In this way, their caring acts sometimes appear to be in opposition to the perspective that the teachers’ positions express. Respect is shown to be a value that means that the children, when encountering another, abstain from what they are doing or change their current position for that other person’s benefit. In certain situations, the children abstain from their self-chosen position in favour of a social convention or an opinion that is asserted, which means that respect is embedded in a complex way. Gender differences have been identified as an all-pervading theme in the empirical material. An important part of the children’s experiences takes place in the group divisions between girls and boys, which is why these affect the affinity that they develop. In the everyday structure, girls and boys participate as social actors with expectations and norms formed with the support of the gender differences that are made. Both girls and boys stress the importance of their fellowship, while at the same time a pattern can be discerned that ascribes girls and boys different degrees of agency.

AB  - Introduction: In Visual Art Education and Visual Studies social perspectives have recently gained increasing importance (Kallio-Tavin 2015; Quinn, 2006, 2010). From a broader perspective, visual knowledge in educational practice can be related to, and problematized from, ethical and political aspects, as well as feminist, ecological, multicultural dito. Visual analysis of society and the use of visual research methods are nowadays recognized in various disciplines (Rose 2012). The visual is described as an essential part of moving from a modern to a postmodern society in our Western cultural sphere (Mirzoeff 1998, 1999). Problematization: A discourse of documentation and systematic quality assurance has come to take strong expression in Swedish preschool (Elfström 2015; Hakansson 2014). Due to these different visual methods has become part of the pre-school prectice through the process of observation of the educational activities but also through increased medialization (Bjervås 2011; Dahlberg, Moss & Pence, 1999; Elfström 2015; Häikiö 2007; Lenz Taguchi 2000, 2012; Lindgren 2016; Olsson 2014; Sparrman & Lindgren 2010; Svenning 2009). Therefore, it is important to discuss and problematize the use of so-called visual tools as part of the changes, not least theoretically, and discuss the impact this change has had on the preschool practice. Visual knowledge includes both the ability to use vision as well as interpretation of the seen including educational work with materials and environments (Karlsson Häikiö 2012, 2014) and therefore the need for visual literacy and picture analysis has increased in preschool. The documented material needs to be analyzed and interpreted as multimodal expression (Kress 2009/2011) - as well as other kinds of visual material produced. Method / Study: In the aesthetic and creative work with children with different materials like various colors, clay, light, etc. in themselves have transformative dimensions. In the creative exploration the boundaries are blurred between storytelling, play, relationship-building and other forms of communication (Häikiö 2007). The presentation gives examples of how visual events, staged and documented by the preschool teachers, in the children’s creative activities with visual and other materials. This communication between children and materials can be described as an intra-modal materialization (Karlsson Häikiö forthcoming), a phenomenon as an on-going intra-active becoming (Barad 2007; Lenz Taguchi 2012). In this intra-action, from a post humanistic interpretation, separate elements and different expressions are merged in a material-semiotic distribution of visual communication (Asberg, Hultman & Lee 2012). Through video and documentation analysis, thus a number of different visual relativities and relationships can be interpreted in a variety of ways based on the idea of co-becoming (Johansson, 2015). The analysis provides a kind of cutting or intersectional point (leikkauspiste, Kirkkopelto 2004) in the visualization of the documentation or the learning process that can be used pedagogically (Häikiö 2007). Results / Conclusion: By seeing the educational work as a continuous creation (Johansson 2015) also the perception of how knowledge comes forth is changed. A transformative approach to learning means that knowledge is born, transformed and constantly modified during the learning process in ever new situations. This places new demands on teachers' professional knowledge but also tools for analysis of the pedagogical work. Transformative learning (Mezirow 1997, 2000) and the questioning of taken for granted assumptions raise awareness of the need for new perspectives and methodological considerations based on a constant professional transformation of methodology and didactics (McLeod 2015 p. 256).

AB  - This paper examines the impact of computer programming of robots on sequencing ability in early childhood and the relationship between sequencing skills, class size, and teacher's comfort level and experience with technology. Fifty-eight children participated in the study, 54 of whom were included in data analysis. This study was conducted in two different school environments, where both class size and teacher's experiences with the technology used varied--one teacher had used the system for the prior year, the other teacher had not. School environments were further subdivided into control and experimental groups. Kindergarten children in the experimental group were exposed to the TangibleK program for a period of twenty hours, taught by their classroom teacher. Children participated in computer programming activities using a developmentally appropriate tangible programming language, specifically designed to program a robot's behaviors. All fifty-four participants sequencing skills were assessed before and after the intervention using a picture story sequencing task and analyzed using a repeated measures, 2x2x2 design ANOVA. A significant interaction was found between group assignment and test results. No significant interactions were found for school assignment. Results are discussed taking into account class size, teacher experience, and teacher comfort level with technology. (Contains 1 figure and 1 table.)

AB  - Changes in global patterns of residence mean that preschool teachers welcome immigrant children and families into preschools in increasing numbers. Many teachers report both anticipation and apprehension about having immigrant children in the classroom. Apprehension is related to concerns about a lack of enough knowledge about languages and cultures to sensitively work with children and families. To overcome apprehensions and challenges, teachers are encouraged to learn from the work of other adults. This study builds upon research that suggests that teachers can also look to the children as a source of knowledge. The purpose of this study was to explore how preschool immigrant children might use a disposable camera to communicate with their teachers. The participants of this qualitative study were immigrant and native born students in a local preschool. Each child was given a disposable camera, instruction about taking photographs and the request to take pictures of what was important to them. Data were collected by recording each child telling the teacher about the pictures. Data were analyzed for themes, patterns and categories. Findings indicated that the messages that the children conveyed to their teachers included important information about language development and family cultural identity. Findings also identify teacher strategies that helped and hindered child ability to communicate during the photo-narration process. An implication of the study was a shift of child agency within the teacher child relationship during photo-narration activity.

AB  - Methodological issues impacting the relationship between aggression and restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped behaviors and interests (RRSBI) were examined in 2648 children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) using a multi-method, multi-informant analysis model to assess the effects of informant, assessment method, and aggression phenotype. Overall, a significant, but small relationship was found between RRSBI and aggression ( p < .05). There was significant heterogeneity of estimates with large effect sizes observed when utilizing teacher report and a broad phenotype of aggression. Variance in estimates was attributed to differences in informant and assessment method with two times greater effect attributed to informant. Results suggest strategies to optimize future investigations of the relationship between RRSBI and aggression. Findings also provide the opportunity for the development of targeted interventions for aggression in youth with ASD.

AB  - Background: The incidence of child abuse following natural disasters has not been studied thoroughly. However, parental stress and decreased social support have been linked to increased reports of child maltreatment. We hypothesized that a large-scale natural disaster (North Carolina's Hurricane Floyd) would increase the incidence of inflicted traumatic brain injury (TBI) in young children. Methods: Results: An ecologic study design was used to compare regions affected to those regions unaffected by the disaster. Cases of inflicted TBI resulting in admission to an intensive care unit or death from September 1998 through December 2001 in North Carolina were ascertained. Poisson regression modeling was employed to calculate rate ratios of injury for each geographic area by time period. Inflicted TBI in the most affected counties increased in the 6 months post-disaster in comparison to the same region pre-disaster (rate ratio 5.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.3-20.4), as did non-inflicted TBI (rate ratio 10.7, 95% CI = 2.0-59.4). No corresponding increased incidence was observed in counties less affected or unaffected by the disaster. The rate of inflicted injuries returned to baseline in the severely affected counties 6 months post-hurricane; however, the rate of non-inflicted injuries appeared to remain elevated for the entire post-hurricane study period. Conclusions: Families are vulnerable to an elevated risk of inflicted and non-inflicted child TBI following a disaster. This information may be useful in future disaster planning.

AB  - Play is considered an important activity of the early childhood years. Research supports the contribution of play to children’s development, learning, and well-being. In spite of this, time for play is being pushed out in many early childhood programs by greater time allotted to formal instruction in narrow academic skills to be tested eventually by standardized tests. As a result, current preservice teachers are likely to see fewer examples of appropriate time and support for play in their field placements in early childhood settings. The purpose of this study was to document and analyze what happens when an experiential play lab is implemented in an early childhood teacher education program. This qualitative study includes multiple forms of data collection, including two forms of reflective writings and group discussions. After the workshop, preservice teachers made a greater number of references to play in their defense of developmentally appropriate practice, and the nature of their references to play increased in their focus on play process and on teacher roles in children’s play, as compared to prior to the lab. The results of this study of an experiential play intervention support its potential as a means of probing, documenting, and enriching students’ understanding of the importance of providing for and supporting play in classrooms for young children.

AB  - To help inform policymakers and the public about the progress of education in the United States, Congress has mandated that the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) produce an annual report, "The Condition of Education." This year's report presents 42 indicators on important topics and trends in U.S. education. These indicators focus on population characteristics, participation in education, elementary and secondary education, and postsecondary education. This year's "Condition" shows that about 90 percent of young adults ages 25 to 29 had a high school diploma or its equivalent in 2013, and that 34 percent had a bachelor's or higher degree. As in previous years, in 2012, median earnings were higher for those with higher levels of education--for example, 25- to 34-year-olds with a bachelor's degree earned more than twice as much as high school dropouts. Also, the unemployment rate was lower for bachelor's degree holders in this age range than for their peers with lower levels of education. In 2012, almost two-thirds of 3- to 5-year-olds were enrolled in preschool, and 60 percent of these children attended full-day programs. At the elementary and secondary level, there were nearly 50 million students in public schools in 2011--over 2 million of which were in charter schools. The number of students in elementary and secondary schools is expected to grow to 52 million by 2023. Postsecondary enrollment was at 21 million students in 2012, including 18 million undergraduate and 3 million graduate, or postbaccalaureate, students. One in five school-age children lived in poverty in 2012, up from about one in seven in 2000. In school year 2011-12, some 3.1 million public high school students, or 81 percent, graduated on time with a regular diploma. About 66 percent of 2012 high school completers enrolled in college that fall. Meanwhile, the status dropout rate, or the percentage of 16- to 24-year-olds who are not enrolled in school and do not have a high school diploma or its equivalent, declined from 12 percent in 1990 to 7 percent in 2012. At public and private nonprofit 4-year colleges in 2011, most of the full-time undergraduates (88 and 86 percent, respectively) were under the age of 25; however, only about 29 percent of full-time students at private for-profit colleges were. About 56 percent of male students and 61 percent of female students who began their bachelor's degree in the fall of 2006, and did not transfer, had completed their degree by 2012. In that year, over 1 million associate's degrees, 1.8 million bachelor's degrees, and over 750,000 master's degrees were awarded. "The Condition of Education 2014" contains the latest data available on these and other key indicators. As new data are released, the indicators will be updated on the "Condition of Education" website. Along with these indicators, NCES produces a wide range of reports and data to help inform policymakers and the American public about trends and conditions in U.S. education. A "Guide to Sources" and a glossary are provided. [For "The Condition of Education 2013. NCES 2013-037," see ED542714.]

AB  - The U.S. Congress has mandated that the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) produce an annual report to help inform policymakers about the progress of education in the United States. Using data from across the center and from other sources of education data, "The Condition of Education 2015" presents 42 key indicators on important topics and trends in U.S. education. These indicators focus on population characteristics, such as educational attainment and economic outcomes, participation in education at all levels, as well as aspects of elementary, secondary, and postsecondary education, including international comparisons. New to the report this year are three spotlight indicators that describe approaches to learning behaviors for first-time kindergartners, disparities in educational outcomes among male youth of color, and differences in postsecondary degree completion by socioeconomic status. This report also includes a new feature--The At a Glance--that allows readers to quickly make comparisons within and across indicators. This year's Condition shows that 91 percent of young adults ages 25 to 29 had a high school diploma or its equivalent in 2014, and that 34 percent had a bachelor's or higher degree. As in previous years, median earnings were higher for 25- to 34-year-olds with higher levels of education in 2013. Also, in 2014, the unemployment rate was generally lower for those with higher levels of education. A glossary of terms is included. ["The Condition of Education 2014. NCES 2014-083" can be viewed in ERIC at ED545122.]

AB  - Congress has required that the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) produce an annual report to policymakers about the progress of education in the United States. "The Condition of Education 2016" presents 43 key indicators on important topics and trends in U.S. education. These indicators focus on population characteristics, such as educational attainment and economic outcomes; participation in education at all levels; and several contextual aspects of education, including international comparisons, at both the elementary and secondary education level and the postsecondary education level. The three Spotlight indicators for the 2016 report provide a more in-depth look at some of the data. Supplemental indicators, which help to provide a fuller picture of the state of American education, are available online. "The Condition" includes an At a Glance section, which allows readers to quickly make comparisons within and across indicators, and a Highlights section, which captures a key finding or set of findings from each indicator. The report contains a Reader's Guide, Glossary, and a Guide to Data Sources that provide additional information to help place the indicators in context. In addition, each indicator references the data tables that were used to produce the indicator, most of which are in the "Digest of Education Statistics." This year's "Condition" shows that 91 percent of young adults ages 25 to 29 had a high school diploma or its equivalent in 2015, and that 36 percent had a bachelor's or higher degree. Median earnings continued to be higher for 25- to 34-year-olds with higher levels of education in 2014, and in 2015, the employment rate was generally higher for those with higher levels of education.

AB  - Children aged 3 years and 41/2 years old watched a puppet, struggling to achieve goals, who was helped by a 2nd puppet and violently hindered by a 3rd. The children then distributed wooden biscuits between the helper and hinderer. In Experiment 1, when distributing a small odd number of biscuits, 41/2-year-olds (N = 16) almost always gave more to the helper. Children verbally justified their unequal distributions by reference to the helper's prosocial behavior or the hinderer's antisocial behavior. In Experiment 2, when biscuits were more plentiful, 41/2-year-olds (N = 16) usually gave equal numbers to helper and hinderer, indicating that 41/2-year-olds usually preferred not to distribute unequally unless forced to by resource scarcity. Three-year-olds (N = 16 in Experiment 1, N = 20 in Experiment 3) gave more biscuits equally often to the helper and to the hinderer. In many cases, this was because they were confused as to the identities and actions of the puppets, possibly because they were shocked by the hinderer's actions. Two fundamental moral behaviors are therefore demonstrated in young preschoolers: indirect reciprocity of morally valenced acts and a preference for equality when distributing resources, although the cognitive bases for these behaviors remain unclear. These results join other recent studies in demonstrating that the seeds of complex moral understanding and behavior are found early in development.

AB  - Over-imitation, which is common in children, is the imitation of elements of an action sequence that are clearly unnecessary for reaching the final goal. A variety of cognitive mechanisms have been proposed to explain this phenomenon. Here, 48 3- and 5-year-olds together with a puppet observed an adult demonstrate instrumental tasks that included an unnecessary action. Failure of the puppet to perform the unnecessary action resulted in spontaneous protest by the majority of the children, with some using normative language. Children also protested in comparison tasks in which the puppet violated convention or instrumental rationality. Protest in response to the puppet's omission of unnecessary action occurred even after the puppet's successful achievement of the goal. This observation is not compatible with the hypothesis that the primary cause of over-imitation is that children believe the unnecessary action causes the goal. There are multiple domains that children may believe determine the unnecessary action's normativity, two being social convention and instrumental rationality. Because the demonstration provides no information about which domains are relevant, children are capable of encoding apparently unnecessary action as normative without information as to which domain determines the unnecessary action's normativity. This study demonstrates an early link between two processes of fundamental importance for human culture: faithful imitation and the adherence to and enforcement of norms.

AB  - The aim of the study was to examine how family demographics, parental literacy activities with preschool children and children’s attitudes toward reading relate to Croatian children’s performance in reading and writing in second and third grade of primary school. Participants were 587 pupils from 7 primary schools, along with one of their parents taking part in an international study also aiming at investigating literacy skills in relation to working memory within different orthographic structures (English, Swedish, Estonian and Croatian). Hierarchical regression analyses revealed significant contribution of all studied predictors (demographic variables including child’s gender, mother’s education and number of family members ; parental literacy activities ; and child’s attitudes toward reading) to performance in reading and writing. However, relations between predictor variables and reading and writing scores differ for younger and older children. Proximal measures (parental literacy activities in preschool period and children’s attitudes toward reading) contributed more to children’s reading and writing in second grade, whereas distal, demographic variables (child’s gender and the number of family members) were more contributing in third grade. Mother’s educational level was an important predictor in both grades. Results suggested that both individual and family characteristics are important contributors to early reading and writing of Croatian children.

AB  - Standard false belief tasks indicate that normally developing children do not fully develop a theory of mind until the age of 4 years and that children with autism have an impaired theory of mind. Recent evidence, however, suggests that children as young as 3 years of age understand that thought bubbles depict mental representations and that these can be false. Twelve normally developing children and 11 children with autism were tested on a standard false belief task and a number of tasks that employed thought bubbles to represent mental states. While the majority of normally developing children and children with autism failed the standard false belief task, they understood that (i) thought bubbles represent thought, (ii) thought bubbles can be used to infer an unknown reality, (iii) thoughts can be different, and (iv) thoughts can be false. These results indicate that autistic children with a relatively low verbal mental age may be capable of understanding mental representations.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is often described as a disorder of aberrant neural connectivity. Although it is important to study the pathophysiology of ASD in the developing cortex, the functional connectivity in the brains of young children with ASD has not been well studied. In this study, brain activity was measured non-invasively during consciousness in 50 young human children with ASD and 50 age- and gender-matched typically developing human (TD) children. We employed a custom child-sized magnetoencephalography (MEG) system in which sensors were located as close to the brain as possible for optimal recording in young children. We focused on theta band oscillations because they are thought to be involved in long-range networks associated with higher cognitive processes. The ASD group showed significantly reduced connectivity between the left-anterior and the right-posterior areas, exhibiting a decrease in the coherence of theta band (6 Hz) oscillations compared with the TD group. This reduction in coherence was significantly correlated with clinical severity in right-handed children with ASD. This is the first study to demonstrate reduced long-range functional connectivity in conscious young children with ASD using a novel MEG approach.

Human Ss: 100 male and female Japanese preschool and school-age children (aged 5 yrs 3 mo to 6 yrs 2 mo) (kindergartners). Normal Japanese adults (teachers). The children were asked to rate their own cognitive and physical competence. Teachers rated the children on the same variables. A conservation task and perspective-taking task were administered to measure the children's cognitive performance.

AB  - Research suggests the importance of professional development for teachers of at-risk children, and while educational technologies can be harnessed to help support teaching practice in innovative ways, such programs are often limited in scale. "My Teaching Partner (MTP)" was designed to deliver a targeted program of professional development for teaching quality, integrated with early childhood curricula, to large numbers of teachers. It has been used by 235 teachers of at-risk preschool children across the commonwealth of Virginia. MTP links curricula with layers of web-based support, including an on-line consultant--a teaching expert who regularly observes, de-briefs, and extends teachers' educational practice. The research-based curricula support the needs of at-risk Pre-K students in language, literacy, and social relationships; numerous video clips demonstrate effective teaching practice. In this paper, we describe the user-centered design process used and the support services and curricula delivered. The dynamic nature of the website is emphasized, including development practices which enable non-developers to easily contribute and maintain website contents. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of this approach, and describe the field trial now underway, which includes examination of child outcomes, teaching quality, and teacher reflectivity. Evaluation data from the project are also summarized. (Contains 7 figures and 1 table.)

AB  - The Russian system of education in 2007 exhibited the persistence of the same tendencies as in 2006, relating to the demographic situation in the country. The number of students continued to decline in general secondary education (school education) and in primary and secondary professional education, but the numbers increased in preschool education and in higher professional education. From 2000 to 2007 the number of students enrolled in Russian general education schools fell by almost a third, and the number of teachers also declined. Some more reductions are needed to bring Russian schools in line with international figures, and budgets and educational goals will need to be reconsidered. In this article, the author discusses the main tendencies of the development of the system of education of the Russian Federation in 2007. (Contains 13 tables, 3 figures and 8 notes.)

AB  - Although the interpretation of studies of face recognition in older children, adolescents, and adults with autism is complicated by the fact that participating samples and adopted methodologies vary significantly, there is nevertheless strong evidence indicating processing peculiarities even when task performance is not deficient. Much less is known about face recognition abilities in younger children with autism. The study reported here employed a well-normed task of face recognition to measure this ability in 102 young children with autism, pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) not otherwise specified, and non-PDD disorders (mental retardation and language disorders) matched on chronological age and nonverbal mental age, and in a subsample of 51 children divided equally in the same 3 groups matched on chronological age and verbal mental age. There were pronounced deficits of face recognition in the autistic group relative to the other nonverbally matched and verbally matched groups. Performance on 2 comparison tasks did not reveal significant differences when verbal ability was adequately controlled. It is concluded that young children with autism have face recognition deficits that cannot be attributed to overall cognitive abilities or task demands.

AB  - Ideal-worker norms permeate workplaces, guiding employers’ evaluation of workers and perceptions of workers’ worth. The authors investigate how an ideal-worker norm violation—working anything but full time—affects workers’ perception of unfair treatment. The authors assess gender and parental status differences in the relationship. Analyses using Midlife Development in the United States II data reveal that women who violate the norm when they have children perceive greater unfair treatment than women who violate the norm but do not have children in the study period. Men who work anything but full time do not perceive unfair treatment. The authors’ findings inform efforts to challenge ideal-worker norms.

AB  - We examined independent and interactive links among three central characteristics of children's experiences in early childhood education and care and the German receptive vocabulary of single language learners and dual language learners (DLLs). We allowed for possible differential effects depending on children's language background. Our sample included 2,231 children (n = 1,555 single language learners, n = 371 DLLs from families in which German was frequently spoken, n = 305 DLLs from families in which German was less frequently spoken). Children attended 177 classrooms in 95 early childhood education and care centers and were 30 to 80 months old. We found that classroom process quality predicted German vocabulary only for DLLs with low exposure to German in the family. An earlier age at entry was linked to a larger German vocabulary for all children, but the link was stronger for DLLs from families with low exposure to German. Classroom composition did not predict German vocabulary.

AB  - Teachers spend most of their time in school in classrooms, and their instruction and teaching practices may be affected by classroom context such as class size. We examine whether teacher effects interact with classroom context such as class size. Specifically, we seek to determine whether teacher effects are more pronounced in small classes than in regular size classes in early grades. The results point to some evidence that teacher effects are more variable in small classes than in regular size classes. However, the pattern does not seem to be systematic.

AB  - Investigated natural rates and ratios of reinforcements, time use, student attentiveness, and interruptions of student performance in 96 private piano lessons. 48 teachers and 2 students/teacher participated (student age ranging from preschool to older adult). Intervallic observation procedures were used with an observation form adapted for the present investigation; pilot-testing of the form resulted in interobserver reliability of .85. Results indicate that student age was a significant factor in observed differences among 12 selected variables. Elementary students (preschool through Grade 6) received highest rates and ratios of approvals, secondary students (Grades 7 through 12) spent more lesson time in student performance, and adults (high school graduates to adults of retirement age) were most on-task during lessons. All students were on-task for at least 85% of the lesson time, and lesson time was largely divided between student performance and teacher instruction.

AB  - Objective It had been suggested that programming of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis may underlie the associations of reduced size at birth with raised blood pressure in later life. We investigated whether morning salivary cortisol mediates the inverse association of birthweight with systolic blood pressure in children.Design Subjects and measurements – a historical cohort study involving 1152 Swedish children aged 5–14 years, who took part in a family study comprised of mother, father, and two full-sibs delivered in 1987–1995 after 38–41 weeks gestation within 36 months of each other. Birthweight and gestational age were available from obstetric records. Blood pressure, weight, height and puberty stage were measured at a clinic. Cortisol was measured by radioimmunoassay in morning salivary samples taken at home, within 30 min of waking.Results Morning cortisol showed a weak negative association with length of gestation in siblings, was not related to birthweight or to systolic or diastolic blood pressure. There was no change in the strength of the negative association between birthweight and systolic blood pressure on adjustment for cortisol (−1·4 mmHg/kg, 95% CI −2·7, −0·2; adjusted for age, sex, puberty stage, weight and height, and cortisol).Conclusions Morning cortisol was not associated with size at birth, and did not mediate the birthweight–blood pressure association in children born from full-term pregnancies. It is possible that basal cortisol levels are of more importance in explaining associations of size at birth with later blood pressure in older subjects, or in populations with more varied length of gestation. Alternatively, our results may be caused by misclassification of the hypothalamo–pituitary-adrenal activity.

AB  - Research topic/aim: The purpose of this presentation is to describe ways of including gender equality and gender sensitivity in programmes for teachers in preschools and leisure-time centres. The presentation takes its point of departure in research literature on gender in higher education and teachers’ education.Theoretical and methodology framework: Gender sensitivity, intersectionality, diversity, norm-critical thinking and, recently, norm-creativity are only a few of the eye-catching terms in gender and education discussions. Some of them are used more descriptively while others stand for explicit theoretical paradigms. I will, in a first step investigate, which are the predominant perspectives and what do they contribute to our knowledge on gender in (preschool) teachers’ education.(Expected) conclusions/findings: Hopefully, the established knowledge can be applied to specific education contexts: Preschool teachers’ education and teacher in leisure-time centre programmes. These programmes are both similar and different to each other. The number of men studying to become preschool teachers has been low over the years, while programmes for teachers working in leisuretime centres attract almost equally many men and women. For our own university we know that these programmes include knowledge on gender and education into their curriculum and the teaching. However, involved teachers also voice a wish to work more strategically with gender in their programmes. The systematic literature study is expected to inspire our work with further gender inclusion into teachers’ and preschool teachers’ programmes.Relevance to Nordic educational research: Gender equality is nothing that comes for free and working with gender equality is a highly relevant topic for teachers’ education in Nordic countries. However, international research in the field is still in the beginning. Teacher educators in Finland have over the last decade worked strategically with gender sensitive education in teacher training programmes and also in Sweden and other Nordic countries there are a number of actors in the field. The discussion with researchers from different Nordic countries and actors from various teachers’ education programmes can stimulate our work on gender inclusion in teachers’ education and training.

AB  - Constructed from a synthesis of theoretical and empirical studies in motor abilities an extensive range of test items with auxiliary apparatus; these items were administered to 765 children 4½–14½ yrs of age. Results indicate that motor proficiency can be assessed safely and reliably in 1 testing period. The factor analysis of the 46 items supported the original subtest grouping of the items that employed a theoretical-rational strategy. Factor analysis of the subtests suggested the existence of 2 major dimensions, Speed-Precision-Strength and Balance-Coordination.

AB  - Various meta-analyses found that trauma-focused cognitive behavioral treatments (TF-CBT) are effective for children and adolescents with posttraumatic stress disorders. A TF-CBT-oriented treatment program for children (up to 10 years of age) and their relatives was developed including educational and play-orientated components using a narrative, which is named ”Seafarers’ Camp.” The program comprised children’s individual therapy (15 sessions, 50 min), children’s group therapy (15 sessions, 100 min), relatives’ training in a group format (10 sessions, 100 min), family counseling sessions at home, and children’s physician examinations in a quarterly period. To examine the effectiveness of this treatment in comparison with effects of published German health-care studies and meta-analyses, we examined data from 47 children with posttraumatic disorders, who were between 5 and 13 years old (61.7% males), at pre- and posttreatment and at 6-month follow-up assessments. Main outcome measures were the self-rated posttraumatic and caregiver-rated phobic symptoms; secondary outcome measures were self-rated depressive complaints and quality of life as well as caregiver- and teacher-rated general behavioral problems. Children experienced various traumatic events, mostly severe forms of neglect ( n = 9), sexual or physical abuse ( n = 13), as well as the witnessing of violence ( n = 15). The majority met the criteria of posttraumatic stress disorder ( n = 25) and adjustment disorder ( n = 8). Significant pre-to-posttreatment improvements were found in self-rated posttraumatic and caregiver-rated phobic symptoms, caregiver- and teacher-rated externalizing behavior, and caregiver-rated internalizing behavior. No significant improvements were found regarding other measures when adjusting the p-value cut-off for multiple testing. The effect sizes were moderate to high for the posttraumatic and phobic symptoms, with g* = 2.47 and 0.29 at posttreatment and g* = 1.53 and 0.56 at follow-up assessments. Response rates for both symptom groups were 70.4% and 19.2%; all individuals showed a remission of the posttraumatic symptoms in the posttreatment period. In addition, we found moderate effect sizes on caregiver- and teacher-rated general behavioral problems. Hence, the results are in agreement with findings in existing meta-analyses and German health-care studies, although younger children were included in the present study. The major limitation of the present study is the lack of a control condition and the participation of the program developers during the treatment run. The TF-CBT-orientated treatment program should be examined independently from the program developers in a randomized controlled trial, and the incremental effect of group therapy should be studied.

Untersucht wurde, ob eine Verminderung der posttraumatischen und phobischen Symptomatik sowie weiterer Verhaltensauffälligkeiten erreicht werden konnte. Die Daten von 47 Kindern im Alter von 5 bis 13 Jahren (61.7%männlich) wurden vor und nach der Therapie sowie sechs Monate im Anschluss erhoben. Nach der Behandlung waren die selbstbeurteilten posttraumatischen und fremdbeurteilten phobischen Symptome, sowie die fremdbeurteilten Auffälligkeiten signifikant verbessert. Die Effektstärken fielen erwartungsgemäß moderat bzw. hoch aus; die Responseraten für die posttraumatischen und phobischen Symptome betrugen 70.4% bzw. 19.2%. Alle Kinder wiesen am Behandlungsende eine Remission der posttraumatischen Symptome auf. Das Behandlungsprogramm sollte zukünftig in randomisiert-kontrollierten Studien untersucht werden.

AB  - This study was designed to develop a content coverage index to evaluate the implementation of a statewide physical education curriculum--the Exemplary Physical Education curriculum--at the kindergarten through 2nd-grade level. This study was conducted in multiple phases, including the development of a content coverage index, a validation study for the index, and an investigation of the implementation of the statewide curriculum by teachers. Participants were 92 elementary physical education teachers who attended an inservice program for the statewide curriculum and completed the content coverage index. The inter-item agreement for the grade levels studied provided evidence that the index was reliable in this sample of teachers. Point-biserial correlations between the teachers' level of usage of the curriculum and ratings of whether an objective from the curriculum was taught demonstrated that the index produced valid information on the curriculum implementation. Further validity evidence was provided by correlating the level of usage of the curriculum by teachers and the total number of lessons taught from the curriculum. This study may serve as a model for developing similar indexes for curriculum evaluation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

T1  - The personal and the political : how personal welfare state experiences affect political trust and ideology

AB  - Citizens in advanced industrial democracies frequently have personal experiences with public services and welfare state arrangements. They may have regular contact with public health care services, schools, public transportation, public libraries, and many other types of services. And at one life stage or another they may receive parts of their incomes in the form of pensions, student aid, unemployment insurance, and so on. This study investigates the extent to which personal welfare state expenences affect general political orientations. What are the political effects when a person is discontent with some aspect of, say, the particular health services or the public kindergartens that she has been in personal contact with? Does she lose faith in the weifare state or in leftist ideas about large-scale state intervention in society? Does she take her negative experiences as a sign that the political system and its politicians are not functioning satisfactorily? Will her inclination to support the goveming party drop? Addressing these and other questions, this study develops a theoretical framework that incorporates insights from a muititude of research traditions, including research on voting behaviour, social psychology, rational choice theory, political psychology, and institutional theory. The framework is tested empirically using Swedish primary survey data collected under the auspices of the 1999 West Sweden SOM Survey, and the 1999 Swedish European Parliament Election Study. The results indicate that personal welfare state experiences have substantively significant effects on political orientations. This is a somewhat different conclusion than the one found in much previous research - especially the "economic voting" literature. By and large, this research has reinforced the notion that the personal is separate from the political, in that it has usually found relatively weak statistical relationships between, on the one hand, political attitudes and behaviour, and personal economic hardship and personal unemployment on the other. Rather, the economic voting literature emphasises the political importance of mass media-driven "sociotropic perceptions" of societal events and trends, rather than personal experiences of events and trends. Furthermore, personal welfare state experiences are not uni-dimensional events. Rather, the perspectives of self-interest, distributive justice, and voice oppominities all appear to capture different aspects of these experiences that are consequential for political orientations. Specifically, self-interest is idiuential mainly for political ideology, with those who gain personally from the weifare state being more likely to support state intervention and more likely to stand further to the left. In contrast, experienced distributive justice and experienced voice opportunities have an impact mainly on political trust, where those who have personally experienced injustice are less likely than others to be satisfied with the democratic system and to trust politicians. Finally, the effects of personal welfare state experiences appear systematically structured by "the institutional interface." Customer institutions - where discretion is rare and exit-options frequent - are better at generating positive experiences, and in turn positive effects on welfare state support and political trust, than client institutions - where discretion is frequent and exit-options rare.

AB  - Background: Evidence-based programs (EBPs) targeting effective family skills are the most cost effective for improving adolescent behavioural health. Cochrane Reviews have found the Strengthening Families Program (SFP) to be the most effective substance abuse prevention intervention. Standardized cultural adaptation processes resulted in successful outcomes in several countries. Objective: To promote wide-scale implementation and positive outcomes in Ireland, a unique model of inter-agency collaboration was developed plus guidelines for cultural adaptation with fidelity. Methods: 250 high-risk youth and families were recruited to complete SFP and its parent questionnaire. A quasi-experimental 2 group pre- and post-test design was employed where the norms were the comparison group. A 2 x 2 analysis of variance (ANOVA) generated the outcome tables including p values and Cohen’s d effect sizes. Evaluation feedback was used to improve outcomes the next year. Results: All 21 measured outcomes had statistically significant positive results. Larger effect sizes were found for the Irish families than the USA families ( d = 0.57 vs. 0.48 for youth outcomes, d = 0.73 vs. 0.65 for parenting and d = 0.76 vs. 0.70 for family outcomes). Overt and covert aggression, criminality and depression decreased more in Irish youth, but the USA youth improved more in social skills. Conclusions: This study suggests that SFP 12–16 is quite effective in reducing behavioural health problems in Irish adolescents, improving family relationships and reducing substance abuse. Additionally, the Irish interagency collaboration model is a viable solution to recruitment, retention and staffing in rural communities where finding five skilled professionals to implement SFP can be difficult.

AB  - This study describes the social contexts in which four-year-olds undertake practitioner-assigned cognitive/learning tasks within preschools and the different experiences these contexts provide for children. Data was collected in 34 preschool settings in South East England, using a phenomenographic mapping of activities and social groupings during learning activities. The data was subject to frequency-based analyses. Results identified distinct social pedagogic contexts wherein children interacted with practitioners or with peers; these contexts were differentiated by group size and composition, activity, type of interaction with practitioner and peers, level of cognitive challenge and genderisation of activity. The results revealed that while children engaged in cognitive/learning activities within both practitioner- and child-oriented pedagogic worlds the nature of the activities within these social contexts emphasised interactive inclusion and interactive exclusion respectively.

AB  - Introduction &amp; Purpose: The discourse of violence has largely focused on female victims of male violence, and partly ignored male victims. More men than women die of homicide and are exposed to non-fatal violence. Being physically assaulted is a traumatic experience with serious and long-lasting consequences. It is primarily young men aged 16-24 who suffer from violence. It can be difficult for these men to be in the role of victims, and this can be reinforced by norms that say masculinity stands for power and strength while the role of crime victims is rather an expression of weakness. The purpose of the study are to analyze mortality patterns among men aged 18-24 who have been exposed to violence leading to hospital care. Methods: Register data including all men in Sweden 18-24 years that received at least one night of hospital care after injury from another person in 1992-2005. For each hospitalized man, nine age-matched men were randomly selected from the population each year. Data is available from the year before hospitalization/inclusion and 10 years after (or to 2006 when follow-up ends). Results: Analyses are based on Cox regressions, controlled for age, days of inpatient care from violence, days of hospital care for other reasons, degree of urbanization, country of birth, presence of preschool children, gainfully employed/ not, financial assistance/not, education, and income. Compared to men from the population, exposed men had &gt;3 times higher risk (HR=3.34) for all-cause mortality, &gt;4 times higher risk (HR=4.16) to die from suicide, and about 20 times higher risk (HR=19.63) to die from violence. The difference between exposed and non-exposed men in all-cause mortality, decrease significantly over the 10-year follow-up from HR 4.48 to 2.66, in mortality from violence from HR 45.23 to 2.06. Regarding mortality from violence, the difference between exposed and non-exposed men was not significant after 10 years. The risk difference to die from suicide remained stable over the follow-up period. Conclusions: Paying attention to the long-term consequences from violence, there are also opportunities to change the situation and allow for alternative development for men who have been abused. This is especially important when it comes to the risk for suicide.

AB  - Literacy coaches provide job-embedded professional development for teachers, and the number of literacy coaches in elementary schools is increasing. Although literacy coaching offers promise in terms of improving teacher practice and student achievement, guidance is needed regarding the qualifications, activities, and roles of literacy coaches. The seven guiding principles in this manuscript offer research-based directions for literacy coaching. The guiding principles address (1) the specialized knowledge needed for literacy coaching, (2) the amount of time that should be focused on working directly with teachers, (3) collaborative relationships with teachers, (4) research-based coaching activities, (5) intentional and "on-the-fly" coaching, (6) the coach as a literacy leader in the school, and (7) the evolution of the literacy coach over time. After each principle is introduced, the specific research that supports the principle is discussed. In addition, a vignette of each guiding principle is provided to illustrate the principle in action.

AB  - Research Findings: Using observational data gathered in 730 kindergarten classrooms in 6 states, the present study focuses on the quality of children’s learning opportunities in kindergarten classrooms. Findings show that overall, children experience moderate to low levels of quality in the areas of classroom organization and instructional support in kindergarten. Results are also presented in comparison to children’s experiences in the pre-kindergarten year. These comparisons indicate that kindergarten children spend a greater proportion of the school day in language arts, math, and whole-group instruction and less time in centers than they do in pre-kindergarten. An examination of predictors of kindergarten classroom quality indicated that program characteristics (i.e., adult–child ratio, length of school day) and teacher psychological variables (i.e., beliefs and depressive symptoms) were stronger predictors of classroom quality than were teacher experience and educational background. Practice or Policy: Findings are discussed in terms of implications for children’s academic and social development in kindergarten as well as for kindergarten teacher preparation and development.

AB  - Within the rapid changes in communication techniques, culture, pedagogy, and developments in knowledge, it is vital that educators are familiar with new educational changes, mainly those changes which are connected to technology. Change can be accompanied by fear, and thus some teachers might resist changing (Fullan, 2006). In the digital age, some teachers might be reluctant to change because they feel they are immigrants in the digital world (Prensky, 2001). In developing countries, such as Algeria and Libya, teachers might feel more frustrated because of the digital gap in their countries and because of the digital gap with the students (Warschauer, 2003). This conceptual paper aims at exploring the main factors that inhibit teachers from change. This paper focuses on teachers from kindergarten to college teachers in general. The rationale behind dealing with teachers in general, and not teachers of a specific discipline is to explore the way teachers in low technology areas could see their development from a digital perspective. It is also assumed that digital education is needed in all fields of education as there are already policies about the integration of technology in education (Hamdy, 2007). In the context of this paper, change is defined as a switch from Mindset 1 to Mindset 2. Educators with Mindset 1 consider the digital age as an extension of the industrial world; whereas educators with Mindset 2 believe the digital age is a post-industrial era, and the changes that are happening should be approached as new.

AB  - This study was designed to examine the links between parenting, children's perceptions of family relationships, and children's social behavior. Seventy-four children (M age = 6.01 years; 39 boys; 35 girls) and their parents took part in the study. Children completed relationship-oriented doll stories that were coded for coherence, prosocial themes, and aggressive themes. Parents completed a report of their child's social behavior, a parenting scale, and a number of demographic items. Teachers also completed measures of children's social competence and externalizing behavior. Warm parenting predicted both a child's representation of prosocial themes in the doll stories and social competence, whereas harsh parenting predicted both a child's use of aggressive themes in the doll stories and a child's externalizing behavior. These findings support the idea that children are constructing models of relationships out of the early interactions with caregivers, and that they use these representations to guide their social behavior.

AB  - Background: Social and communication impairments are core deficits and prognostic indicators of autism. We evaluated the impact of supplementing a comprehensive intervention with a curriculum targeting socially synchronous behavior on social outcomes of toddlers with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Methods: Fifty toddlers with ASD, ages 21 to 33 months, were randomized to one of two six-month interventions: Interpersonal Synchrony or Non-Interpersonal Synchrony. The interventions provided identical intensity (10 hours per week in classroom), student-to-teacher ratio, schedule, home-based parent training (1.5 hours per month), parent education (38 hours), and instructional strategies, except the Interpersonal Synchrony condition provided a supplementary curriculum targeting socially engaged imitation, joint attention, and affect sharing; measures of these were primary outcomes. Assessments were conducted pre-intervention, immediately post-intervention, and, to assess maintenance, at six-month follow-up. Random effects models were used to examine differences between groups over time. Secondary analyses examined gains in expressive language and nonverbal cognition, and time effects during the intervention and follow-up periods. Results: A significant treatment effect was found for socially engaged imitation ( p = .02), with more than doubling (17% to 42%) of imitated acts paired with eye contact in the Interpersonal Synchrony group after the intervention. This skill was generalized to unfamiliar contexts and maintained through follow-up. Similar gains were observed for initiation of joint attention and shared positive affect, but between-group differences did not reach statistical significance. A significant time effect was found for all outcomes ( p < .001); greatest change occurred during the intervention period, particularly in the Interpersonal Synchrony group. Conclusions: This is the first ASD randomized trial involving toddlers to identify an active ingredient for enhancing socially engaged imitation. Adding social engagement targets to intervention improves short-term outcome at no additional cost to the intervention. The social, language, and cognitive gains in our participants provide evidence for plasticity of these developmental systems in toddlers with ASD.

AB  - The Frank Porter Graham (FPG) Child Development Institute, Early Intervention Training Center for Infants and Toddlers with Visual Impairments and Their Families, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, was a national project that developed resources with the goal of building the capacity of colleges and universities to prepare personnel to serve infants and toddlers with visual impairments and their families. Researchers and leaders collaborated to develop a white paper outlining recommended practices by early intervention and visual impairment professionals in their work with children. It was from this research, practice, and policy base that a new early intervention training program, Early Learning Visual Impairment Services Training and Advancement (EL VISTA), at Illinois State University (ISU) was built. Experts in the field of visual impairment have agreed that training combining early intervention and visual impairment standards and recommended practices requires a specialized set of knowledge and skills. Children with visual impairments or deafblindness from birth through the age of 22 years receive services from trained teachers of students with visual impairments and orientation and mobility (O&M) specialists. Yet teachers of visually impaired students and O&M specialists are typically not fully trained in the developmental patterns of babies and children with visual impairments or deafblindness. The number of infants and toddlers with visual impairments or deafblindness who deserve and require highly skilled teachers of visually impaired students and O&M specialists trained in early intervention points to the need for additional programs that prepare personnel in early intervention. This article sends out an urgent call to the field of visual impairment to prioritize this need and establish a new profession within a profession, teachers of visually impaired students and O&M specialists who are a highly trained subset of the field of visual impairment, in order to meet the unique needs of infants and toddlers ages birth through 3 years who are visually impaired or deafblind. Standards, guidelines, and recommended practices from both the early intervention field and the field of visual impairment could guide the development and implementation of a personnel training program that is focused on providing high-quality training so as to produce new service providers to meet the unique needs of these infants and toddlers. To address the need for trained personnel to serve children and their families, ISU was awarded a five-year Office of Special Education Programs OSEP personnel preparation grant, EL VISTA (H325K140108) beginning in 2014. The primary goals for the project are: (1) to improve the quality of personnel who are fully credentialed to serve infants and toddlers who are visually impaired or deafblind who live in urban and rural areas where there are critical shortages; (2) to increase the number of personnel who are fully credentialed to serve these infants and toddlers who live in urban and rural areas where there are critical shortages; and (3) to create and implement a clear, effective plan for evaluating the knowledge and skills of graduates. One by one, this article outlines each of the three goals and describes plans for implementing and addressing a unique curricular design employed in the EL VISTA project that forges ahead toward recommended practices and personnel preparation curricular standards from both the early intervention field and the visual impairment field toward the creation of a new profession: the early intervention and visual impairment profession.

AB  - Studied the behavior of 80 middle-class white nursery-school children within the framework of equity theory. Ss worked on a task with a fictitious partner whose performance they observed to be superior, equal, or inferior to their own. Ss were then given rewards that their team had earned and told to divide them between themselves and their partner. Results indicate that 4-yr-old Ss tended to distribute rewards self-interestedly by taking significantly more than 1/2 for themselves. The behavior of the 5-yr-old Ss was consistent with the assumption that they employed the norm of equality. No evidence was found to indicate that the behavior of preschool children is influenced by equity, the norm that mediates adult behavior in reward-allocation situations. (15 ref.)

AB  - Organophosphates are used in a wide range of materials and consumer products and are ubiquitous in indoor environments. Certain organophosphates have been associated with various adverse health effects. The present paper reports mass fractions of organophosphates in dust samples collected from 500 bedrooms and 151 daycare centers of children living in Odense, Denmark. The identified compounds include: tris(isobutyl) phosphate (TIBP), tri-n-butyl phosphate (TNBP), tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), tris(2-chloroisopropyl) phosphate (TCIPP), tris(1,3-dichloroisopropyl) phosphate (TDCIPP), tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP), triphenylphosphate (TPHP), 2-ethylhexyl-diphenyl phosphate (EHDPP), tris(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate (TEHP) and tris(methylphenyl) phosphate (TMPP). Both the number of organophosphates with median values above the limit of detection and the median values were higher for samples from daycare centers than for samples from homes. Organophosphates with median mass fractions above the limit of detection were: TCEP from homes (6.9 μg g-1), and TCEP (16 μg g-1), TCIPP (5.6 μg g-1), TDCIPP (7.1 μg g-1), TBOEP (26 μg g-1), TPHP (2.0 μg g-1) and EHDPP (2.1 μg g-1) from daycare centers. When present, TBOEP was typically the most abundant of the identified OPs. The sum of the organophosphate dust mass fractions measured in this study was roughly in the mid-range of summed mass fractions reported for dust samples collected in other countries. On a global scale, the geographical distribution of organophosphates in indoor dust is quite variable, with higher concentrations in industrialized countries. This trend differs from that for phthalate esters, whose geographic distribution is more homogeneous. Exposure to organophosphates via dust ingestion is relatively low, although there is considerable uncertainly in this assessment.

AB  - Teachers are often ill-prepared to manage classrooms in urban schools. In the present study, an empirically-based behavioral management strategy, the Good Behavior Game (Game), was investigated. The effects of the Game on student behavior and teacher response statements, including praise, were examined. A teacher with 22 students in a first grade classroom of an urban elementary school participated in implementation of the Game. Using a withdrawal design, results showed that student on-task behavior increased while disruptive behavior decreased, replicating previous findings. The number of teacher praise statements remained at near zero levels across conditions. Frequency of teacher neutral and negative statements varied with the level of student disruptive behavior. Teacher praise and limitations are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

AB  - Strategic remembering emerges gradually during the preschool years. Socialization practices, specifically mother-child social interactions, might provide the foundation for the development of skills necessary for effective organization of information in memory. In the current study, 48 mothers and their 40-month-olds were engaged in the process of remembering (i.e., study and recall) categorically related picture stimuli in a laboratory context. Children's recall was reliably predicted by the way in which mothers structured both the study and recall periods of the deliberate memory task. Specifically, maternal verbal and physical behaviors that focused on organization of items, such as sorting items into distinct groups and providing the name of a category, were most beneficial in supporting children's memory. Moreover, some mothers employed a number of different mnemonic techniques that emphasized categorical connections among items, suggesting systematic approaches in the manner in which mothers help children to learn effective ways of remembering.

AB  - This article describes how a farm-based class in the Great Lakes region investigated how plants and animals prepare for winter. Two groups of children, ranging in ages from three to five years old, had a farm, pasture, gardens, forest, and a pond available for exploration. A low teacher-to-child ratio was maintained, with one teacher to approximately five children, to ensure safety and facilitate the teachers' ability to address the students' needs and interests. The teachers were interested in exploring how and why the plants and animals living in a place might change over time, how they could be connected, and how their coexistence could support their survival. They used guided inquiry to structure the project, in which they posed the essential question: "How do plants and animals prepare for winter?" It was an open-ended question that as educators they were curious about as well. The children's interests and questions and the local resources they encountered created the guiding questions. Throughout their investigation, they supported the children's development of scientific inquiry practices: observing, questioning, predicting, problem-solving, collaborating, and communicating ideas and new understandings.

AB  - This article studies an activity in a Swedish preschool setting where children's elaborations and understandings of floating and sinking are central. In a Swedish preschool context, it is advocated by the National Agency for Education (2016) that different forms of knowledge and ways of learning are used within the institutions to form a coherent whole. Based on a cultural-historical framework (Fleer, 2010; Hedegaard, 2012; Vygotsky, 1978, 1987), it is argued that if children are supported by a teacher, who mediates a cultural and historical, as well as institutional, perspective of knowledge, children may enhance their knowledge of science. Data was collected using a video-based technique called shadowing (Czarniawska 2007), and the overall study was framed within a case-study methodology. The analyzed activity show four children collaborating and exploring a range of aspects related to floating and sinking together with one teacher, acted out in a playful but focused manner. The results show that aspects such as the item, the fluid, and the way children handled the items to remove or add weight, were found important by the children. They used everyday language to talk about size, holes, weight, amount of water, and what changing preconditions would mean when different objects were placed in water. Their vocabularies were enhanced during the activity and seemed to foster emergent notions of density and Archimedes' principle, indicating that the language used has the potential to mediate the progress of both spontaneous and scientific concepts, where scientific concepts are understood as emergent.

AB  - The latest years, empirical studies based on children’s own activities as well as teacher initiated activities has focused on science in the early years (Larsson, 2013, 2016). These results has not been discussed in relation to quality education in regards to science in preschools, nor to quality measurement tools as ECERS-3. By focusing on the ECERS-3 item number 22 and the undertakings in regards to science within the Swedish preschool curriculum (National Agency for Education, 2016) this presentation highlights quality issues that may contribute to qualitative changes in relation to teaching and learning in preschools.

AB  - Swedish early childhood education has gone through a tremendous expansion since the 1970s. This massive expansion coincided with some significant changes in how early childhood education was conducted. Apart from a “schoolification” of the content in Swedish early childhood education (from primarily being a kind of day-care into more of a preschool education) the sphere of early childhood education also went through a significant change in how preschools were organized and funded. The latter process can be described as a marketization of Swedish preschools, which is one of the main focuses of the research project “The First Choice: The Expansion of Preschool, its Marketization and Increased Importance for Families’ Educational Strategies” (http://www.edu.uu.se/research/shed/projects/firstchoice/)In this paper we will examine the emergence of the conditions for a Swedish preschool market by analyzing three different political decisions in the 1980s, 1990s and the 2000s, which included a ban on profit-making preschools (1984), a waiver of the ban (1991), and the introduction of a kind of childcare voucher that allows Swedish parents to freely choose preschool for their children (2009). The study is based mainly on analyzes of parliamentary debates, but it also makes use of the extensive newspaper debate in connection with the decisions in parliament.Our paper will focus on how the nature of preschool children and their education was discussed in these debates. Our paper will be guided by the hypothesis that the marketization of the preschool sector also implied changing visions of children and their education, whereby children were portrayed as rational agents responding to their environment, and as economic resources that enables an efficient resource distribution of the Swedish government’s resources.

AB  - Background: Respiratory and gastrointestinal infections are common during childhood, especially in young infants < 2 years of age. Although these common infections are rarely fatal inhigh-income countries as Denmark, they are a source of significant morbidity burden to thechildren and their families, and lead to a substantial economic burden on society. Childrenattending daycare have an increased risk of infections, mainly due to an increased exposure topathogens through social interaction between children, and due to a not yet fully developedimmune system. Strategies to prevent infections in daycare settings are of great importance in acountry like Denmark, where 90 % of children are cared for outside the home in daycare facilitiesby the age of 2 years. Probiotics, defined as live microorganisms that when administered inadequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host have been suggested in prevention ofrespiratory and gastrointestinal infections in children. Objective: The main objective of this PhD thesis was to examine the effect of probiotics inreducing absence from daycare due to respiratory and gastrointestinal infections in Danish infantsduring their first months in a daycare setting, and to explore potential factors modifying the riskof infections. Further, the current evidence on the use of probiotics in prevention of respiratoryinfections in children attending daycare was systematically reviewed. Methods: Paper I reports on a randomized, placebo-controlled trial investigating the effect ofprobiotics on absence from daycare due to respiratory and gastrointestinal infections in Danishinfants (The ProbiComp study). A total of 290 infants were randomly allocated to receive placeboor a combination of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 and Lactobacillus rhamnosusGG in a dose of 109 colony-forming units per day of each for a 6-month intervention period. Absence from daycare, symptoms of illness, and doctors visits were registered by the parentsusing daily and weekly web-based questionnaires. Information on household characteristics, i. e. household size, number and age of siblings, family history of allergy, pets, and parental educationwas obtained in background interviews with the parents. Paper II consists of a systematic review and meta-analysis, which were performed according tothe guidelines in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. The reviewincluded randomized placebo-controlled studies examining the effect of probiotics on respiratoryVIIIinfections in children attending daycare, and meta-analyses were performed on subgroups forseparate probiotic strains or combination of strains used in the studies. In Paper III, longitudinal data from the ProbiComp study was used to explore potential risk factorsof respiratory infections, diarrhea and absence from daycare during the first months afterenrolment to daycare, including factors related to the household, child characteristics, and the typeof daycare. Results: In Paper I, we found no difference in number of days absent from daycare between theprobiotic and placebo group. Moreover, there were no group differences in any of the secondaryoutcomes including number of children with doctor diagnosed upper or lower respiratoryinfections, number of doctors visits, number of antibiotic treatments, occurrence and duration ofdiarrhea, days with symptoms of common cold, days with fever, days with vomiting, and parentalabsence from work due infant illness. In Paper II, 15 randomized controlled trials were included, with a total of 5,121 children aged 3months to 7 years. However, due to a very high diversity in reported outcomes and in probioticstrains used in the studies, the number of studies available for strain-specific analysis was limited. Based on data from three studies, children receiving Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG showed asignificant reduction in duration of respiratory symptoms, whereas no significant differences wereobserved for other analyzed outcomes. Based on data from two studies, Bifidobacterium animalissubsp. lactis BB-12 had no beneficial effect on duration of respiratory symptoms and daycareabsence. Meta-analysis on other strains or combination of strains was not possible due to limiteddata and differences in ways of reporting the outcome. Paper III included 269 infants, observed for a mean of 5.6 months following enrolment to daycare. The risk of acquiring at least one URTI was higher in infants with previous respiratory infections, and was inversely associated with birthweight, infant age at enrolment to daycare. Moreover, therisk was lower in infants in family daycare compared to infants in age-integrated facilities and ininfants from households with pets. No significant risk factors of lower respiratory infections anddiarrhea were identified. Discussion and conclusion: The findings from the ProbiComp study do not support the use of acombination of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GGfor prevention of absence from daycare due to respiratory and gastrointestinal infections in Danishinfants during the first months in daycare. The systematic review and meta-analysis suggested thatIXLactobacillus rhamnosus GG may be beneficial in reducing duration of respiratory symptoms inchildren attending daycare, whereas the potential effects of other probiotic strains were notpossible to assess due to limited available data. A number of previously published studies havesuggested that probiotics may play a role in prevention of respiratory and gastrointestinalinfections in children. However, the findings from this PhD thesis underline that the evidence isstill not clear on which particular strains to recommend, the optimal dose, and the timing. Thereis, therefore, still a need for more studies in this area. In order to plan and target preventivestrategies to those at highest risk, it is important to identify potential factors modifying the risk ofinfections, and results from the ProbiComp study suggested that infection risk in infants startingdaycare is modified by both environmental factors and factors.

AB  - Preschool systems changed significantly in New Jersey in 1998 when the State's Supreme Court required the poorest school districts to implement high quality, intensive preschool programs for all three- and four-year-olds. Since the first year of implementation in 1999, New Jersey's Abbott districts have been providing preschoolers with access to quality early childhood programs defined by state certified teachers, class size of 15 with two teachers, master teachers who serve as mentors, professional development opportunities, and state contracted facilities. As ordered by the Court, the State has adequately funded program implementation. This article discusses the steps New Jersey took to scale up the quality of these programs within a short four-year time frame; and presents remaining challenges to quality which include maintaining a diverse teaching force, fostering collaboration between school districts and community-based programs, aligning early childhood pedagogy across the P-3 range, and upgrading facilities.

AB  - When a recipe is followed perfectly, it may be assumed that it will yield consistent outcomes but that is not always the case. While 'teaching' may be considered by some to be the equivalent of following a 'recipe' or a scripted program, the variables that teachers experience on a daily basis support the need for promoting expertise in this profession. My experience teaching kindergarten for several years provides insight into the sizeable number of decisions that teachers make on a daily basis. For the majority of the decisions made, there is no script to follow; however, a wealth of pedagogical knowledge, experiences, and insight into the academic, social, and familial contexts that influence the lives of children assists in the decision-making process. Expertise allows professionals to do the right thing at the right time (Dörner & Schölkopf, 1991). National Board Certified Teachers (NBCTs) have demonstrated their commitment to professional growth by earning a voluntary certification that is a prestigious teaching credential. This credential is earned through a process that measures educators' practice against high and rigorous standards set forth by the NBPTS (2004). NBCTs emphasize that teachers must reflect upon and analyze their practices in order to refine their skills. Three ingredients for promoting expertise are motivation, metacognition, and mentoring. These are all essential; however, another crucial component in the mix is money. Recommendations have been made that all states should provide financial incentives that recognize quality teaching (Bales, 2004; Laverick, 2005) and that accomplished teachers should be adequately compensated (Shanker, 1996). The efforts of teachers who want to excel should be supported. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Child-staff ratios are an important quality indicator. They are often collected by observing one randomly selected classroom several times during a 2-h period on a single day. However, it is unclear whether these measures represent the ratios that children actually experience during most of their time in care. This study compared ratio data collected from a single classroom during a 2-h period on a single day with data collected from multiple classrooms in the same center during 8-h periods over 10 days. Analysis of data from 77 child care centers found moderate correlations between the two measurement methods. Ratios measured during a 2-h period from a single classroom on a single day tended to underpredict ratios measured from multiple classrooms and multiple days. Results suggest that the representativeness of ratio measurements can be improved by lengthening the observation period and especially by measuring ratios in multiple classrooms.

AB  - Increasingly, states are implementing quality rating and improvement systems (QRIS) as a means of improving the availability of high-quality child care and children's school readiness skills. A fundamental design decision under QRIS is where to set the thresholds on the quality measures used in the program assessment component of the QRIS. This study applied generalized additive modeling (GAM) on data from Colorado's QRIS in order to identify thresholds on several components of Colorado's QRIS, including the Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale-Revised (ECERS-R), classroom ratios, and staff credentials. We found evidence of baseline thresholds that needed to be surpassed before significant relationships between quality and outcomes could be observed. In addition, there were ceiling thresholds, such that beyond certain cut-points, gains in quality were associated with little to no improvements in outcomes. Based on this work, it appears that GAM can be used to empirically identify thresholds, but more research is needed to understand the applicability of the GAM-derived thresholds in other early care contexts and settings.

AB  - Many child care centers temporarily move children and teachers in and out of their assigned classrooms throughout the day. Such practices create frequent discontinuity in children's experiences in child care, including discontinuity in their peer and teacher relationships. This study examined the prevalence and patterns of teacher and child movement between classrooms, the characteristics of teachers and children who were more likely to move between classrooms on a daily basis, and the associations between children's and teachers' rate of daily movement between classrooms with children's social-emotional outcomes. A moderate to high prevalence of child and teacher movement between classrooms was observed (29% and 83%, respectively). Children who were younger, considered solitary, and who had been enrolled in their classroom for shorter periods of time were less likely to transition between classrooms. Children's rate of movement was a positive predictor of teachers' perceived conflict with children in their care, and a negative predictor of teachers' perceived closeness. In addition, the more frequently teachers moved, the less children were inclined to indicate liking their teachers or centers. However, the more frequently children moved, the more likely children were to indicate liking their peers and for their peers to indicate liking them. Results are interpreted in light of additional research avenues that can inform sensible daily teacher continuity practices.

AB  - Hong Kong's most recent education reform proposal is the "Consultation Document of the Working Party on Harmonisation of Pre-primary Services" ("Consultation Document".) This examines the feasibility of combining kindergarten and childcare centres and having one single body regulating them. It has stimulated great responses from the early childhood education sector. As one of the major training institutions for kindergarten teachers and childcare workers, the faculty and students of the Hong Kong Baptist University have had extensive discussions on the "Consultation Document" with experts in the sector. This article reviews the development and rationales of the "Consultation Document" and examines its recommendations on teacher training, subsidy schemes, and transition arrangements. The authors' views and counter-proposals are also discussed.

AB  - Brain research has confirmed what many early care and education professionals have known all along--warm, nurturing relationships among babies, toddlers, and their caregivers support children's development. The nurturing adult-child interaction that supports children's development is called "responsive care". Responsive care is supported by small adult-child ratios and primary care systems. Furthermore, small adult-child ratios support the child observation strategies that are central to responsive care. It is important for caregivers to "intentionally" implement responsive interactions because this type of care has been shown to be particularly important for encouraging babies' social-emotional development. How do early childhood educators provide nurturing care to infants and toddlers that supports their long-term development? This article outlines eight practical strategies, called the Ps of the Responsive Caregiving Process.

AB  - Assessed the quality of infant education in the Seville, Spain, area, in both the private and public sector. Quality was defined in structural and process variables. Structural variables were the ratio, group size, and training of teachers. Process variables included classroom quality assessed with the Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale, and educational practices assessed with an observational instrument. The sample was composed of 59 preschool units of 5-yr-old children. The general quality of education provided for 5-yr-olds was low. Structural variables of quality, ratio, and teacher training were inappropriate: the ratio was too low, and most teachers did not have specific training in preschool education. Process variables of quality, quality of the classrooms and educational practices were not adequate: quality of the classrooms was just above minimal and educational practices were very traditional, heavily focused on improving preschool abilities and preparing children to go into the school system. Findings suggest a need for further improvement in the quality of day-care provision. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Examined how parents evaluate child care centers when they must consider all the characteristics of the center simultaneously using surveys from 235 parents who were in the process of finding child care for their children. Utilizing conjoint analysis, parents were presented with profiles of child care centers in which 8 center characteristics were varied. Parents evaluated all 8 characteristics simultaneously and then indicated how likely they were to select each center. Results indicate that the characteristics of child care centers that most significantly affect parents' decision-making vary based on demographic characteristics of the parents. Single mothers attend most strongly to cost in their decision making, while married mothers attend to the child/staff ratio and married fathers give relatively equal attention to 4 factors; cost, convenience, child/staff ratio and hours of operation. Further differences in parents' decision-making strategies were found based on parents' education and family income. These findings are discussed in light of the importance of developing child care programs which meet the needs of parents as well as children. The 8 child care characteristics and levels are appended. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The primary purpose of this study was to assess whether kindergarten through twelfth grade teachers differ from people in non-teaching occupations in their reactions to people who stutter (PWS). Taking differences in age and education into account, we compared reactions to PWS between 263 teachers and 1336 non-teachers in the United States based on their responses on the Public Opinion Survey on Human Attributes-Stuttering (POSHA-S, St. Louis, 2012). Findings indicated that teachers use a greater number and variety of information sources about PWS than the general public and that male teachers do so even more than female teachers. With regard to the other POSHA-S components, accommodating/helping, knowledge/experience, and sympathy/social distancing of PWS, teachers’ responses were not significantly different from their non-teaching counterparts. Regardless of occupation, women reported reactions to PWS that are considered more accommodating and helpful to PWS than the reported reactions of men. Learning outcomes: Readers should be able to: (1) identify the challenges that students who stutter encounter in the K-12 school setting, (2) identify recommended ways teachers can react to their students who stutter, (3) summarize findings regarding teachers’ reactions to people who stutter (PWS), and (4) identify key variables that are associated with reactions to PWS.

AB  - Despite high rates of Chinese kindergarteners (3–6 years old) enrollment in early care and education (ECE), the quality of that care has not been widely examined. Following rapid economic growth in urban areas in the past three decades, there are growing concerns within China that families in urban and rural areas are experiencing an ECE opportunity gap. To address this concern, this study examined ECE quality and its association with child outcomes based on a relatively large sample of kindergartens in China. Using a stratified and random sampling method, the study recruited 1, 012 children (age 3–6) from 178 classrooms in Zhejiang Province, a relatively developed region with a population of over 54 million people. We used the Chinese Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale to measure ECE quality and found moderately low quality for the study sample. Also, lower quality was observed in rural than urban areas, in private than public programs, and in programs with overall low parent education than those with high parent education. One dimension of quality, teaching and interactions, predicted child outcomes in language, early math, and social cognition as measured by the Children's Developmental Scale of China ( age 3–6) in hierarchical linear models. The possible sociocultural and contextual reasons for these findings and implications for policymakers and practitioners are discussed in this paper.

AB  - The effects of naturally-occuring within-group variations in social density were assessed via observations of children in an extremely crowded township nursery in South Africa. The nursery class consisted of 83 children who ranged in age from 32 to 64 months. Levels of crowding at home appeared to exert only a small effect on sensitivity to crowding at nursery. (Author/BN)

AB  - Preschool teachers share their environment with young children on a daily basis and interventions promoting social competence are generally carried out in the preschool setting. The aim was to find out if and how preschool teachers' definitions of social competence are related to factors in the preschool environment like: a) the number of children having problems related to social competence; b) the support provided to the children; and c) the preschool environment and current research definitions. Method: 481 preschools from 22 municipalities in Sweden participated. Data was analyzed using a mixed methods design in which a qualitative content analysis was followed by group comparisons using quantitative methods. Results: Preschool teachers defined social competence mainly as intrapersonal skills, or as interpersonal relations. The definitions of social competence were not related to the numbers of children having problems related to social skills or social competence in units, the amount of the support provided to the children or the preschool environment. Conclusion: Preschool teachers' definitions of social competence are partly multidimensional, which implies that the interventions aimed at promoting children's social skills and social competence also should be multidimensional. Preschool teachers' definitions of social competence have little relevance to environmental factors, which indicate that social competence, as a construct is more dependent upon perceptions of the individual than on contextual factors.

AB  - The overall aim of the thesis, with four empirical studies, was to test the applicability of a functional approach in investigating social competence of children in need of special support within the preschool context. The main theoretical framework was systems theory. Study I and II investigated preschool teachers’ definitions of children in need of special support and social competence respectively. Study III was a prevalence study investigating the number of children in need of special support based on traditional disability categories and functional difficulties. In study IV the social competence of children perceived to be in need of special support based on traditional categories and functional difficulties was compared using an observational method. The results in study I showed that teachers adopt either a child perspective or an organizational perspective in defining children in need of special support. The child perspective was related to a greater number of children in need of special support in the preschools, indicating that in preschools with several children in need of special support, teachers are more prone on seeing the needs of individual children, as opposed to the needs of the organisation. Study II found that teachers define social competence in young children in terms of intrapersonal skills, or as interpersonal relations. Study III found that the majority of children in need of special support are undiagnosed children with functional difficulties related to speech- and language and peer interaction. Study IV found similar profiles of social competence between diagnosed children and undiagnosed children perceived to be in need of special support. Overall, the results yielded support for adopting a functional approach in studying the social competence of children in need of special support.

AB  - The acquisition and development of motor skill is an important aspect in human development. Children's motor skills have been investigated for many decades as the developmental milestones and have been used as a scale to describe children's developmental level by researchers. However,studies on the characteristics and the development of culturally related motor skill are very limited.Investigating culturally related motor skill will be very helpful to understand the nature and developmental course of human motor skill. Chopstick using is not only a necessary operation in the daily lives in eastern countries, but also one of the typical fine motor skills which are very important for the functional activities in early child development. In the present study,the characteristics and the development of chopstick using skills were investigated by comparing the types and frequencies of chopstick using gestures in 3-7 year old children and adults.181 participants were included in this study. 91 children aged from 3-5 and 60 pupils aged from 6-7 were selected from one kindergarten and one primary school as the children group. 30 undergraduates were selected as the adult group. Wooden objects in different sizes were used in this study. Participants were asked to hold and move the objects from one testing board to another with a pair of chopsticks. Their gestures and actions were photographed.Results indicated that 8 kinds of chopstick using gestures were found in both children and adults and they differed in the relative position of each finger,the interplay between fingers and chopsticks, the space of the palm and the agility in dealing with different tasks etc. The frequencies of Gesture Two, Five and Six were very low both in children and adults, which showed that similarity existed between children and adults,and the gestures used during early ages may have some effect later. With age increase,more and more people tended to use the more efficient gesture. In children, frequencies of the more efficient gesture (Gesture Type One) changed from 3.7% in 3 year olds to 23.1% in 7 year olds,while frequency of the lower efficient gesture (Gesture Type Four) changed from 59.3% to 23.1% accordingly. In adults, frequency of Gesture Type One was 50%,which was significantly higher than the ones in children, while frequency of Gesture Type Four was 10%, which was significantly lower than the ones in children.

AB  - One goal educators have is to empower students at all levels in this diverse and changing society whether they work with teacher candidates or with P-12 students. Teachers are seeing increased differences in race, ethnicity, culture, and special needs in children in their classrooms. The changing composition of early childhood classrooms challenges educators to be more responsive to the diverse needs of all children. Therefore, implementing a curriculum that is culturally responsive and inclusive to assist children's needs is imperative. To prepare teacher candidates to integrate anti-bias or diversity curriculum with the regular curriculum then becomes a crucial goal of every teacher preparation program. Unfortunately, many teachers currently in the classroom report that they feel inadequate to teach multicultural or anti-bias curriculum. Implementing a diversity curriculum may not be easy because of the fear, uncertainty, or discomfort of many teachers and teacher educators. Teachers' beliefs influence and affect their teaching practices and may become barriers that prevent the integration of anti-bias curricula. However, previous research found that teacher candidates' level of intercultural sensitivity could be enhanced by their teacher preparation courses and activities and from teacher educators who encouraged teacher candidates to discuss and reflect upon issues. In this article, the authors discuss what an anti-bias curriculum is, provide the theoretical framework and rationale for involving teacher candidates in certain activities that promote the anti-bias curriculum, and offer additional anti-bias strategies for teacher candidates and teacher educators to implement in their classrooms.

AB  - Societal change and prescriptions in curricula demand a change in educationalpractice. This can create conflicts between practitioners’ usual practices (norms)and those prescribed by curricula. One example is the introduction of Informationand Communication Technology (ICT) into preschool practice. Hence, our aim isto analyse how norms are used as arguments for or against using computers inpreschool practice. Data consist of naturalistic texts from 31 preschool teacherstudents revealing their experiences in attempting to embed computers intopractice. Results show ambivalence to computer use. Two lines of argumentsemerged: one embracing the new technology, the other rejecting this newtechnology. The following arguments were made to justify ICT in preschool: thechild as a citizen, the competent child and the active child. Concern wasexpressed between the teacher’s need for control and the child’s need forindependence and guidance.

AB  - Research aims: The aim of this study is to describe and interpret the trans-disciplinary exploration of children, in constructing the choreography of the “Dance of the dinosaurs” where mathematics is one of the disciplines used. . The central question is: In what way does children´s trans-disciplinary exploration emerge? Other questions are: What could be learned about the mathematical understanding of children through their applications? What problems emerge during the process and how are the children acting?Relationship to previous research works: The study is a part of a larger pedagogical development project in preschool class and primary school, initiated by the Swedish Reggio Emilia institute.Theoretical and conceptual framework: Deconstructive dialogues, fantasy and rhizome constitute central conceptions in the theoretical framework.Paradigm, methodology and methods: Methodologically, the study is an example of dialogical research, enabling a bridge between post-modern and modern theories and approaches. The children attend an F-1 form. Their interest in dinosaurs resulted in a dance project, including a few groups of children. The empirical material consists of a total of six hours of video-tape, completed by diary-notes. By posing question to the empirical data, patterns of actions is emerged which interprets according to the theoretical framework.Ethical considerations: The study adheres to the ethical guidelines of the Scientific Council regarding research, where the participation and approval of children are seen as fundamental.Main finding or discussion: Some findings: Time, space, pattern, size, number emerge in the mathematical work of children, children cooperates and aims for more.Implications, practice or policy: The study illustrates a trans-disciplinary exploration where children explore and identifies new problems, reflects critically and calls in question.

AB  - Measuring, recording and judging the value of individual achievements and societal phenomena is nothing new. In one sense, it is a natural part of what it means to be a human among humans, that is, a phenomenon that is part and parcel of culture. The systematic character and scale of evaluation today, however, reflect a more modern, rational approach to this activity. The increasingly frequent use being made of evaluation and assessment is linked to the assumption that individuals and societies are amenable to development. Associated with this is a goals–and–means philosophy, with planning and evaluation as key components. Although – or perhaps precisely because – this rationality has been challenged, much emphasis is placed on the importance of carefully following, monitoring and evaluating activities and their out-comes. Nowadays, moreover, our dependence on knowledge is underscored. Concepts such as a knowledge economy or society, and lifelong and life-wide learning, can be seen as examples of this. In political and economic terms, the result has been a growing interest in the contribution education can make to the development of society.In 2008 some three million individuals were involved in child day care or in preschool, primary, secondary, adult or higher education in Sweden. In addition, there were the people employed in school and other education and in research, and the 2.1 million who participated in some form of staff training.Education, in other words, is an activity that tangibly affects a great many people. Although education for children and young people is provided in both the public and the private sector, it is funded mainly from the public purse. That means that, economically, education is our biggest policy area, a fact which in itself invites considerable interest in questions concerning its meaning, effectiveness and benefits, for both the individual and society.From the standpoint of educational science, assessment can be regarded as one of the systems by which education signals what knowledge is important and how knowledge, skills and proficiency can be expressed, discerned and communicated. Together with curriculum and pedagogy, assessment or evaluation is thus one of what the sociologist of education Basil Bernstein (1971/1980) called the “message systems” of education. Grades and diplomas also serve as tools for selection, opening or closing doors to different educational pathways and careers. Assessment and grading by teachers thus crucially influence students’ life chances. Against this background, it is hardly surprising that questions of pupil achievement, school results and the effects of education are high on the agenda of public and educational debate. Here, it will be explored whether this is also the case in research.

AB  - The aim of the study was to map the field of internal and external conditions that Swedish Home and Consumer Studies teachers and pupils have contend with. A questionnaire was constructed and delivered online in November 2010. It contained 27 question covering teacher qualification, quality of premises and equipment, lesson time and collaboration, and the use of national syllabi. A total of 385 persons across the country answered the questionnaire; about 21% of those teaching Home and Consumer Studies in Swedish compulsory school during the school year 2009–2010. These respondents taught in a total of 392 compulsory schools, which equalled about 22% of the schools teaching grades 7–9 in Sweden. Almost a quarter (23%) of the teachers lacked formal training for Home and Consumer Studies. Respondents without an appropriate degree qualification included those trained as nursery school teachers, dietitians and civil engineers. As regards classrooms, while 88% of respondents reported access to fully equipped kitchens with stoves, sinks and work surfaces, 5% used regular classrooms and the remainder were obliged to come up with alternative solutions, such as using portable kitchens in regular classrooms or conducting their lessons in the school restaurant. This study raises many questions about the quality of Home and Consumer Studies provision in a number of schools. The local deficiencies in the nationally decided frame factors for Home and Consumer Studies found by the present study gives us reason to doubt that all pupils achieve the overall learning goals of ‘knowing in practice’ and making informed choices utilizing environmental, economic and health perspectives. This might affect the health and economy of the individuals in the long run, with implications for the national economy and public health. On the basis of these findings, we therefore recommend that current conditions for Home and Consumer Studies and how the subject should operate in schools become a focus for national debate.

AB  - This thesis investigates the development of oral narrative competence from age 4 to 6 in Swedish monolinguals (N=72) and in both languages of Swedish-German (N=46) and Swedish-Turkish (N=48) bilinguals growing up in Sweden. Picture-based fictional narratives were elicited with Cat/Dog and Baby Birds/Baby Goats from the Multilingual Assessment Instrument for Narratives (MAIN, Gagarina et al. 2012) and A2/B2 from the Edmonton Narrative Norms Instrument (ENNI, Schneider et al., 2005). Vocabulary, character introduction and narrative macrostructure were studied. Vocabulary production scores on Cross-linguistic lexical tasks (CLTs, Haman et al., 2015) were compared to NDW (number of different words) in narratives. Production of macrostructural components, macrostructural complexity, and answers to comprehension questions were analyzed. Effects of age and differences in performance between groups, between the bilinguals’ two languages, and between narrative tasks were investigated. Narrative comprehension was high already at age 4, but still developed substantially with age. In contrast, macrostructure in narrative production was at a rudimentary level at age 4. Even at age 6, the narratives contained few complete episodic structures. Children mainly included actions visible in the stimuli and rarely verbalized goals and other macrostructural components that required inferencing. The ability to introduce story characters appropriately developed strongly from age 4 to 6, but stimuli had a large effect on performance. Vocabulary showed most improvement from age 5 to 6. Development with age was clearer for the majority language Swedish than the minority languages German and Turkish, where individual variation was larger. In Swedish, pronounced differences were found between the bilingual groups. The Swedish-German bilinguals performed similarly to the monolinguals. On most measures, the Swedish-Turkish bilinguals performed lower than the other two groups, though precisely how much varied across measures. Generally, the Swedish-German children performed better in Swedish than in German, whereas the Swedish-Turkish children performed similarly in both languages or slightly higher in Turkish. The study shows that bilinguals’ two languages need not develop in parallel, and that results depend on the tasks and specific measures used. Bilingual groups differ from each other, and it is therefore not meaningful to compare all bilinguals to all monolinguals.

AB  - Compared parents' and teachers' Behavior Problem Checklist ratings of 57 children in counseling and 1,300 children not in counseling. Children were in kindergarten through 8th grade. ANOVA and the general linear model revealed that Ss in counseling were evaluated as exhibiting more deviant behavior. Duncan multiple range tests indicated that parents tended to see more maladjustment than teachers. A number of interactions were found, with teachers perceiving more socialized delinquency and psychotic signs than parents for the treatment group in contrast to the no-treatment group. Correlations between parents and teachers were low to moderate with mother–father coefficients being higher than mother–teacher and father–teacher coefficients. Although a larger sample might have produced more significant results, the relationship between parents' and teachers' observations did not differ when those for Ss in counseling and not in counseling were compared.

AB  - Examined the acquisition of language finiteness in children exhibiting specific language impairment (SLI). Speech construction of 3 German-speaking children (aged 4.9-6.9 yrs) with SLI was examined concerning the extent to which grammatical and lexical means were mastered and their stage of finiteness development. Data were analyzed using the concept of finiteness developed by W. Klein (1998, 2000). Results show that each subject (S) chose a different developmental path to come to terms with the interaction of these devices. One S relied on a morphological finiteness, and differentiated tense morphosyntactically. Another employed a number of constructions dependent upon the kind of speech situation. The 3rd S appeared to have the concept of tense and produced tense contrasts when locating events in the present or in the past, but did not use agreement.

AB  - The overall aim of this thesis is to increase our knowledge of different occupational groups´ views on work with children in need of special support. This is explored in four separate studies.The first study investigates the views of occupational groups in preschools and schools in one municipality. A questionnaire was handed out to all personnel (N=1297) in the municipality in 2008 (72.5 % response rate). The second study explores the views of educational leaders (N=45) in the same municipality. Questionnaire # 2 was distributed in 2009. All the educational leaders responded to the questionnaire. The third study describes the views of different occupational groups concerning special educational needs coordinators´ (SENCOs) role and work. This was highlighted by comparing responses from questionnaire #1 and # 2. Responses concerning SENCOs´ work were also added using a third questionnaire. This questionnaire was handed out in 2006 to chief education officers (N=290) in all municipalities in Sweden. The response rate was 90.3%. Finally, the fourth study presents five head teachers´ descriptions of their work with special needs issues. Study four was a follow-up study of questionnaire # 2. These head teachers were selected because of their inclusive values and because they seemed to be effective according to certain criteria. They were interviewed in January 2012.The results reveal a number of interesting findings. For example, there are both similar and different views among the occupational groups concerning work with children in need of special support. A majority of the respondents in all groups state that children´s individual deficiencies is one common reason why children need special support in preschools/schools. Differences between the occupational groups become especially visible regarding their views of SENCOs‟ work.Critical pragmatism (Cherryholmes, 1988) is applied as a theoretical point of departure. Skrtic´s (1991) critical reading and analysis of special education relative to general education is specifically used to interpret and discuss the outcome of the studies. Additionally, Abbott´s (1988) reasoning concerning the “division of expert labor” is used to discuss the occupational groups´ replies concerning “who should do what to whom”.The findings in the studies are contextualized and theoretically interpreted in the separate articles. However in the first part of this thesis (in Swedish: Kappa), the theoretical interpretations of the empirical outcome are discussed in more detail and the results are further contextualized and synthesised. Inclusion and premises for inclusive education are also discussed in more depth in the first part of the present thesis.

AB  - Based on the results from a Swedish research project, this paper investigates young children's meaning-making in relation to moving images in a preschool context. The specific focus of the paper is to look at if – and how – two year-old children can be said to make meaning during the screening of a series of short animated films at their preschools. What kind of meanings are made and how are they communicated by the children? How do the films become resources for childrens meaning making and to what extent can social interaction with peers and preschool teachers be said to influence childrens meaning making during the screening of the films? The results presented are based on analyses of both interaction in front of the TV screen and of the animated films.The theoretical framework is based on a social semiotic (Hodge &amp; Kress, 1988; Kress, 2003; van Leeuwen, 2005) and multimodal (Kress &amp; van Leeuwen, 2001; Jewitt, 2009) approach, which implies a view of communication and representation as a social process of signmaking. Both theories are united in a common interest in understanding how people communicate and make meanings with a wide range of resources, or modes. Semiotic resources are used both to produce and interpret texts, in the same way as signs are made both externally and internally. The analyses of both interaction and of the animated films were guided by the theoretical assumptiom that all texts simultaneously construct different types of meanings through three metafunctions (Jewitt &amp; Oyama, 2001; Iedema, 2001; van Leeuwen, 2005). They represent some aspect of the world (the ideational metafunction); represent and construct relations between represented and interactive participants (the interpersonal metafunction); and are organised as coherent texts (the textual metafunction). Meanings are made through the use of various modes in relation to these different aspects.The project included studies at eight preschools spread over three Swedish municipalities. Approximately 150 children in the ages from two to four participated in the project. They watched the films in groups of four to six children. Nine screenings were recorded with video camera and mp3 recorders. All video material was transcribed multimodally and analysed by means of the social semiotic and multimodal framework presented above. Aspects that were attended to specifically in the transcriptions included verbal interaction, gaze/eye movements, gestures, posture, mimics and motions. Apart from the filmed material, interviews were made with children, parents and preschool teachers. The role of the interviews was to construct a background in terms of how moving images were used in the preschools and how familiar the children were with different kinds of media etc. Accordingly, interviews were transcribed more thematically than the video material.The paper shows that the children indeed make meaning in relation to the fillms and that they make a number of forms of meaning during the screenings. The meanings are made in different modes and are influenced by a number of factors, such as the social interaction with peers and preschool teachers, whether or not the stories are familiar to the children from before, and the childrens previous experiences of moving images . The paper also shows that the young children are highly competent in practicing literacy skills during the screenings, exemplified by their expertise in interpreting various aspects related to film languageReferencesBanks, Marcus (2001): Visual Methods in Social Research.

AB  - Although the relationship between noise exposure and vocal behavior (the Lombard effect) is well established, actual vocal behavior in the workplace is still relatively unexamined. The first purpose of this study was to investigate correlations between noise level and both voice level and voice average fundamental frequency ( F₀) for a population of preschool teachers in their normal workplace. The second purpose was to study the vocal behavior of each teacher to investigate whether individual vocal behaviors or certain patterns could be identified. Voice and noise data were obtained for female preschool teachers (n=13) in their workplace, using wearable measurement equipment. Correlations between noise level and voice level, and between voice level and F₀, were calculated for each participant and ranged from 0.07 to 0.87 for voice level and from 0.11 to 0.78 for F₀. The large spread of the correlation coefficients indicates that the teachers react individually to the noise exposure. For example, some teachers increase their voice-to-noise level ratio when the noise is reduced, whereas others do not.

AB  - Research Findings: Shared reading is reported to be the single best instructional practice for emergent literacy skills. Vocabulary instruction practices implemented during shared reading by both Head Start (HS) teachers and teachers from more affluent private school settings were compared to determine whether there were differences between the 2 groups of teachers in their implementation of research-based practices. HS teachers implemented vocabulary instruction practices during shared reading more often, and chose different words to instruct, than private school teachers. Whereas 78% of HS teachers provided some vocabulary instruction during shared reading, only 59% of private school teachers did so. Among those teachers who provided vocabulary instruction during shared reading, HS teachers used significantly more contextualization strategies for word instruction than private school teachers. These findings suggest that preschool teachers who work with children from high-needs backgrounds use vocabulary instruction during shared reading as a way to bolster children’s vocabularies more frequently than teachers working in private preschools that serve children from more privileged backgrounds. Extratextual language was also compared, and private school teachers had a higher mean length of utterance and type–token ratio than the HS teachers. Practice or Policy: Professional development is recommended for preschool teachers to increase the implementation of best practices for vocabulary instruction during shared reading.

AB  - Early television exposure has been associated with various health outcomes including childhood obesity. This paper describes associations between patterns of television viewing, on one hand, and diet, taste preference and weight status, on the other, in European preschoolers and schoolchildren. The IDEFICS baseline survey was conducted at examination centers in Italy, Estonia, Cyprus, Belgium, Sweden, Germany, Hungary, and Spain. 15,144 children aged 2-9 completed the basic protocol, including anthropometry and parental questionnaires on their diets and television habits. A subsample of 1,696 schoolchildren underwent further sensory testing for fat and sweet taste preferences. Three dichotomous indicators described: children's habitual television exposure time; television viewing during meals; and having televisions in their bedrooms. Based on these variables we investigated television habits in relation to overweight (IOTF) and usual consumption of foods high in fat and sugar. A possible role of taste preference in the latter association was tested in the sensory subgroup. All television indicators were significantly associated with increased risk of overweight, with odds ratios ranging from 1.21 to 1.30, in fully adjusted models. Children's propensities to consume high-fat and high-sugar foods were positively and, in most analyses, monotonically associated with high-risk television behaviors. The associations between television and diet propensities were not explained by preference for added fat or sugar in test foods. To summarize, in addition to being more overweight, children with high-risk television behaviors may, independent of objectively measured taste preferences for fat and sugar, passively overconsume higher-fat and particularly higher-sugar diets.

AB  - Children have many opportunities to learn from others through oral and printed sources. A few recent studies investigating children’s trust in printed versus oral information suggested that as soon as children acquired the basic reading ability, they placed more trust in printed over oral testimony when learning names for unfamiliar objects. Previous studies have shown that a proportion of the information that early readers gained from printed sources might be fragile and lost once the printed label is no longer present, but those studies have not examined young children’s subsequent use of the accepted oral or printed information. The current experiments examine whether Chinese young children from 4 to 6 years old trust the printed information more than oral information, to what extent the young children extend their new knowledge to subsequent circumstances, and the effects of reading ability on initial trust and subsequent use. In this study, 125 Chinese young children from 4 to 6 years of age were tested. Each child completed four tasks: the reading ability task, the hybrid sorting task, the short-term recognition task of hybrid pictures (3 minutes after the sorting task), and the long-term recognition task (2 weeks later). Children’s reading ability was evaluated by a single-word recognition test involving words from the hybrid sorting task. For the hybrid sorting task, children were presented with pictures of hybrid creatures that looked more like one of two species, and had the opportunity to accept or reject an oral or printed label that referred to the perceptually non–dominant species. For the recognition tasks, children were asked to name the same set of hybrid creatures or sort them to the related locations. We analyzed the experimental data using hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) (score level and individual level) to investigate the contribution of information type, reading ability and age to children’s initial trust of information, children’s recognition of hybrid pictures in the short term and in the long term. We found that Chinese young children trusted both oral and printed labels in the original sorting tasks: There’s no significant main effects of information type, age, or reading ability on children’s trust in oral or printed information, but the interaction between reading ability and information type predicts children’s trust. Using simple slope analysis we found that all children trusted the printed information, while higher-level readers were more likely to reject the oral information than lower-level readers. Despite of prior great trust of information in the original sorting tasks, young children seldom applied the information to the subsequent short-term or long-term tasks. However, they tended to apply more printed information than oral information in the long run. There were interaction effects of reading ability and information type on children’s subsequent use of information both in the short-term and in the long- term. Specifically, lower level readers were more likely to use the oral information than the higher level readers in the short term, while higher-level reader were more likely to use the printed information than the lower-level readers in the long run. The role of print awareness in the relationship between reading ability and children’s trust and subsequent use of information was discussed.

AB  - Research Findings: This article is about computer use in 3 Swedish preschools with a specific focus on the preschool teacher's way of managing this use. Data were collected in 3 preschools serving children from 3 to 5 years of age. The data consisted of approximately 13 hr of video-documented observations and interviews with 9 teachers. The study is an example of a situated evaluation, which is an evaluation that takes place within an institutional practice such as a preschool. A key question is how this new artifact should be used in preschool activities. Practice or Policy: The study revealed how political and theoretical visions may be realized in everyday preschool practices. The teacher's approach to computer use was shown to be determined by a combination of the teacher's assumptions about the possibilities of computers and the dominant underlying principle or rationale at work in the preschool. It is argued that the computer is treated differently depending on whether a caring, nurturing, or teaching rationale dominates. It is also argued that the dominant rationale produces three different meaning-shaping practices; in the study, these are labeled protective, supporting, and guiding. These environments afford quite different possibilities for children to learn about and from the computer.

AB  - This article presents an action research conducted by a group of teachers comparing multiage with same-age interactions of children, especially among toddlers. The research involving 31 children ranging in age from two through five-and-a-half was conducted under optimal conditions, with small groups, low teacher-child ratios, and highly trained teachers. The research found that dominance behaviors (hitting, kicking, spitting, taking or demanding objects, etc.) were significantly less prevalent in multiage groupings than in classrooms of same-age peers. The children in the multiage groups also demonstrated higher rates of language exchange--talking to each other and imitating speech--than children with same-age peers. The findings, however limited, raise interesting issues and as action research served to: (1) increase teachers' collective confidence in looking for answers to questions in the environment rather than blaming children; (2) demystify research and convert it from something that is out there to a tool that is available and useful to classroom teachers; and (3) open the door to further inquiry by giving teachers permission and encouragement to examine practices that they had accepted as givens. More refined research can help teachers learn more about how the size and age composition of groupings affects children's behavior.

AB  - Swedish well baby nurses and preschool teachers meet almost all children between 0 and 6 years of age. Their ability to identify children at risk for maltreatment is important and they therefore play a considerable role in early detection and prevention of trauma in children. This study is part of a research project conducted in three socio-economically different areas in the city of Göteborg. The aim was to study what signs of maltreatment did well baby nurses and preschool teachers identify in children under their responsibility. The group under study consisted of 12 well baby nurses and 274 preschool teachers. The well baby nurses were responsible for 3 995 and preschool teachers for 1 516 children between 0 and 6 years of age. The results showed that well baby nurses and preschool teachers identified and observed signs of maltreatment in a considerable number of children under their responsibility. There were great differences, however, both between and within the two groups under study. Well baby nurses and preschool teachers in the same area most often did not identify or observe signs in the same children. The signs most frequently observed were signs of physical neglect followed by signs of emotional unavailability in parent-child relation and emotional neglect. Signs of physical abuse were rarely observed.

AB  - Challenges faced by national educational authorities when implementing school development: A qualitative case study about an attempt to create accessible teaching environments in a Swedish municipality’s pre-schools and schools.1. Research topic/aimNational school authorities regularly introduce new concepts for school development to be implemented “at a grassroots level”. This paper addresses one such school development concept implemented in a Swedish municipality. Its goal was to increase children’s’ and students’ access to learning environments in schools and pre-schools. Implementation of this pedagogical concept was to proceed over a longer period of time and be linked to systematic quality work carried out in the municipality. The purpose of this paper is to describe and discuss how the implementation process was perceived by the school administration, teachers and other personal during the time the concept was introduced and thereafter.2. Theoretical frameworkThe point of departure for this study is how the implementation process is related to what in Sweden is referred to as chain of governance. The chain of governance is the main principal for the organizational framework that creates structure for top-down management and as such is central to describing and understanding the implementation process within this framework. Implementing educational concepts is often considered relatively unproblematic by school authorities, however there are indications that there are a number of difficulties to overcome.3. Methodological designThe study is based on a qualitative case study that is limited to one preschool, one school and the project's steering group. The research design can be characterized as an ongoing evaluation project, a term that has been used more and more in recent years related to different types of development projects in order to achieve a number of advantages pertaining to evaluation, research and organizational development. A central idea of ongoing evaluation research is to increase the effectiveness of development work by providing ongoing feedback to project management, but also by contributing to systematic learning, generating new research-based knowledge as well as demonstrating alternative ways of solving problems.Collecting data from several sources allowed for data triangulation. The compilation and analysis of data is based on a hermeneutic interpretation related to the theoretical basis of the study. The results are based on both the managements’ and the staffs’ perspectives both of which are compared and contrasted to each other. Interest is directed at the processes that were initiated and what took place in those processes.4. Expected conclusions/findingsThe study is expected to show how the project's steering group acted to implement the evaluation tool, how they tried to transform the project concept into practical activities, how they informed and communicated with the staff concerned, how they organized the work and how they addressed the problems that arose along the way. This description is contrasted with how school management and staff describe what happened when the concept was applied in their organizations.5. Relevance to Nordic educational researchThere is a general interest in showing how centrally formulated concepts are implemented at the local level, because in many countries similar initiatives are being carried out, albeit in other areas. An increased understanding of this can contribute to increased general knowledge of implementation processes, but also in this specific case to problematize the concept of accessibility.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the educational pathways of a group of children with and without special educational needs from the last year in preschool to 1st grade. Fifty-six children participated and 65 educational settings were visited. A longitudinal and mixed method approach was adopted. Data was collected via observations, conversations, interviews and a questionnaire. Over the early school years, the number of children with special educational needs increased. Their need of support ranged from some needs, to high and to very high needs. The support was integrated into ongoing activities and offered among peers, as well as provided in the form of one-on-one training and therapy, one-on-one conversation and after school training. The settings were comprehensive or specialised in a certain diagnosis, and the application of inclusion ranged from non-existent, to integrated activities and partial and full inclusion. The findings are related to national and international discussions on the topics of inclusive education, support provisions and early childhood educational pathways.

AB  - In Sweden, preschool inclusion is embraced and preschools are open for children both with and without special educational needs. The purpose of this study was to examine the characteristics of a number of preschool units in Sweden that provide education and care to children with special educational needs with regard to organisation, resources and quality. The purpose was also to provide reflections on the usefulness of different structured observation rating scales designed to assess preschool quality. Eight preschool units located in four Swedish districts were visited. A total of sixteen 5-year-old children with special educational needs/disability and forty typically developing children of the same age participated. The data sources were structured observation rating scales (Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale, Caregiver Interaction Scale and Inclusive Classroom Profile), ABILITIES Index questionnaire, unstructured observation, interviews, conversations and documents. Two overall typologies of preschool units were identified: the comprehensive units enrolled children with various special educational needs/disability, while the specialised units enrolled children with the same disability. The staff resources were greater in the specialised units. The overall quality in the observed units ranged from low to good. In units educating children with a disability diagnosis, the quality was never low. None of the preschool units was scored as having a good inclusive environment. The structured observation rating scales complemented each other and covered, in part, different quality aspects of the units. The study shows that there is a large variation in quality between the units and that there is a need to further develop the quality of the preschool units and of the services for children with special educational needs in Swedish preschools.

AB  - The present thesis investigates, analyses and critically discusses the manner in which children with special needs are categorised in the Swedish preschool. The emergence of the category and its construction depends on a number of “truths” concerning children, related to historical and cultural processes in society. A main focus of the thesis is to investigate how legitimacy is established for the practice of defining deviance among preschoolers, and analyse the knowledge and rationalities that prevail in discursive practice. As part of this, the ways of defining children with special needs as a group are clarified, as well as the administrative procedures for handling their cases throughout the organisation. The study combines two strands within discourse analysis: “classical” discourse analysis with origins in Foucaults work and critical disourse analysis (CDA). The concept governmentality was used to make an analytical matrix, adapted to prescool practices. Data has been collected in a disadvantaged district belonging to the conurbation of a Swedish major city. Empirical material includes recording of an administrative meeting, application documents, interviews and national policy documents. The study shows that the categorisation have different effects and functions in different contexts. Implemental perspective: The practice of development evaluation of preschoolers has increased the written documentation, often based on techniques originating in compulsory school. These techniques are frequently ill adapted to the curriculum of the Swedish preschool, which emphasise the competent child and clearly encourages the child`s agency in preschool activities. Evaluation techniques also play the role of an incentive driving towards increasing individualisation. Educators tend to distance themselves from generalising concepts, and often assume a relational standpoint to defining deviance in children, but adapt to techniques that require a more individually based practice, which places the problems with the child. When parents consent to submit application documents, power is transformed to a range of professional actors, and a client-expert relationship is established. Administrative perspective: On the management level, the child primarily is subject to an economical rationality, and is expected to fit into existing preschool activities. The empirical material of this thesis does not display the inclusive perspective which occupies such a prominent position in special education discussions concerning compulsory school. The administrative conversation observed in the study was characterised by a quantitative approach, concerning resources for children who are considered deviant. Discussions at the meeting did not concern any aspect of the quality of the support offered, and the relationship between children and educators was reduced to a number of resouce hours per child. Societal (professional) perspectives: In an analysis of how resources for children with special needs are allocated in the city district, results will depend on which type of knowledge and rationalities are judged to be legitimate. Children who received a diagnosis delivered by a physician, or who are in the course of being investigated at the habilitation centre, obtain the largest support measures. A pattern supported by national policy documents, who constitute a steering mechanism towards implementation in educational establishments. Development evaluations in preschool can be seen as a step in Foucaults term “psycomplex”, where psychology is manifested in the institutions dealing with preschool children and their activities. The close historical link between pedagogy and developmental psychology, combined with a general development in society towards giving the individual perspective a central position, may contribute to the dominance of psychiatric assesments in explaining deviance among preschoolers.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between two structural factors of quality: organisation form (stable groups versus flexible groups) and staff-child ratio, in relation to interaction quality in toddler groups in Norwegian early childhood education and care (ECEC). Data were collected from 206 kindergarten groups in the period from 2013 to 2015. Interaction quality was measured through the infant/toddler environment rating scale-revised subscales, Interaction, listening and talking, and program structure. A two-way MANOVA revealed that organisation form with small, stable groups were related to higher interaction quality, while the staff-child ratio and interaction quality varied depending on different content dimensions. These findings have clear implications for policy and the training of ECEC staff.

AB  - The authors evaluated the effectiveness of the Quality Improvement System (QIS) developed and implemented by Children's Services Council of Palm Beach County (Florida) as a voluntary initiative to improve the quality of childcare and education. They adopted a growth model approach to investigate whether childcare sites that participated in QIS showed greater growth in school readiness of their children than childcare sites that did not participate in QIS over a period of 3 years. After control for site characteristics, the authors found that (a) QIS sites grew significantly faster than non-QIS sites in initial sound fluency and (b) non-QIS sites grew significantly faster than QIS sites in terms of the probability of becoming a low-performing provider.

AB  - This colloquium problematizes the use of early childhood international field experiences as a tool for professional development with Euro-Western pre-service and in-service teachers. The authors critique experiences where minority-world educators teach or implement internships within majority-world contexts. It is critical for Euro-Western teacher education programs to provide pre-service and in-service teachers with opportunities to expand their global views of the early childhood professional through international field experiences. But how can this be done when conceptions of the "professional" are constructed in Euro-Western images, ideas, curricula, ideologies, and privilege? The authors make a call for early childhood teacher educators to reconsider, deconstruct, and re-examine themselves and their pre-service and in-service teachers' rationale for engaging in international field experiences.

AB  - The topic of this study is to generate knowledge about children’s understandingof graphical symbols. These forms of knowledge are prevalent in contemporarysocieties, for example, in the form of letters, numbers, road signs, maps, andcomputer icons. More specifically, in this thesis is scrutinized in detail howchildren develop symbolic skills and how this can be supported througheducational activities. The theoretical basis of the study is variation theory(Marton &amp; Tsui, 2004). This theory conceptualizes learning in terms ofdifferentiation and integration. Two empirical studies are reported. The first isabout two children, Olle and Lasse, who both are in the age span four to fiveyears. How these children handle graphical symbols in the form of producingsigns that they put up in their homes are followed over time. Hence, thechildren’s own make and use of symbols in their everyday life are studied. In thesecond empirical study, the findings from the first study and theoretical insightfrom variation theory are orchestrated in a preschool center with two teachersand twelve children, to see if these principles can be functional in supportingchildren’s development of symbolic understanding. Both studies are based onvideo data. The findings are that a particular pattern of variation entitled,‘contrast’ is functional in developing such insight, while another pattern ofvariation entitled, ‘induction’ is not. In addition, meta-communication is arguedto be important not only for the researcher to gain access to the child’sunderstanding but also to the child’s development as such. The theoreticaldistinction made by Vygotsky between ‘pseudo concepts’ and ‘concepts (proper)’is used to discuss the findings.

AB  - We live in a communication society where we are exposed daily to graphical symbols such as, road signs, text, icons on Internet, notes, letters, numbers, maps, logos and graphs. The question is how do children understand graphical symbols and how could teachers in preschool promote children’s learning about the communicative functions of symbols?Research aimThe topic of this study is to generate knowledge about children´s understanding of graphical symbols. This knowledge is an example of what we could call a “preschool-content” and that could contribute to a didactic knowledge of Swedish preschool.Theoretical frameworkThe theoretical basis of the study is variation theory (Marton &amp; Tsui, 2004). This theory conceptualizes learning in terms of differentiation and integration.Research design Two empirical studies are reported. The first is about two children in the age span of 4-5 years. How they spontaneous handle graphical symbols in their everyday life at home are followed over time. In the second empirical study, the findings from the first study and theoretical insight from variation theory are orchestrated in a preschool center with two teachers and twelve children, to see if these principles can be functional in supporting children’s development of symbolic understanding. Both studies are based on video data.Expected findings The study shows how the learning of symbols can be described in terms of continuous differentiation. An important result is that variation and meta-communication are two keys in the learning process. Through conducting this empirical study, three principles can easily be put to use in preschool in order to provide support for all children to develop an understanding of graphical symbols.Relevance for Nordic Educational researchAn important subject in the Nordic countries in relation to the changes in the curricula’s as well as in education of preschool teachers is how content like the communicative function of symbols can be handled in preschool education.

AB  - The aim of this presentation is to highlight and exemplify some aspects of the relation between, children's perspectives and ethics, based on the way that theory can help in illuminating the relation in between them. The analysed material is part of the result in a larger study with interest in three-year-olds and cameras in preschool. Discussions about ethics, young children's voice and their participation in research has been present in childhood research over a number of years (Christensen &amp; James, 2008; Eide, Hognerstad, Svenning &amp; Winger, 2010). By taking the theoretical point of entry with new materialism and in particular together with Karen Barad (2003, 2007) and her agential realism, I understand the relation between the researcher and the children as flattened out (Jackson &amp; Mazzei, 2012). The research material that is presented is part of a qualitative study with an ethnographic and post-qualitative (Lather, 2013; Lather &amp; St Pierre, 2013) approach. Parents and children have approved to take part in the study, and the chosen theoretical framework offers ethical considerations throughout the whole research process (Lenz Taguchi, 2010). By applying theories to the research material emerges how intra-actions (Barad, 2007) in-between three-year-olds and cameras becomes a guide for the researcher and the following research process. The children become pathfinders showing changes in the understanding of both ethics and children's perspective in research. The result may be of interest not only for researchers, but also for both teachers and children in preschool.

AB  - The starting point of this article is that we are constantly engaged in significant relations, not only to other humans, but also to nonhuman matter. I argue that contemporary educational research often do not sufficiently acknowledge how material components matters in the ongoing production of gendered subjectivities. Even though theoretical perspectives such as social constructionism and post structuralism offer a view on the subject as contextual and situational, it is rare that this interest take into considerations the material components and conditions. Most often it is the inter-subjective or interpersonal relations, and the discourses that lay down the conditions or make possible these relations, that are being understood as the context from which the child emerges. Nonhuman matter is most often not mentioned at all. In this article I will explore the relations between children and nonhuman materiality. My empirical material consists of memories from preschools, narrated and put into writing by a group of adult researchers using the methodology of collective biography. By analyzing these stories/memories, with the help of a number of concepts and ideas that can be understood as related to a posthumanist theoretical perspective, I want to show how things that we traditionally consider as passive or dead, as dots on the floor, dolls and furniture, can be regarded as forces that plays an important role as constitutive actors in children’s gendered subjectivities.

AB  - Researchers have been interested in listening to children's/adolescent's perspectives since the 1980s. This is because their viewpoints and experiences may be different and separate from adults who care for them. However, when studying this age group, primary informants typically are mothers, fathers, or teachers. number of methods have been used to gather data from younger populations that provide a more naturalistic approach. Many of these methods are qualitative and include daily diaries, spontaneous drawings, and video cameras. Auto driven photo elicitation is one way to document life and to talk about life experiences. This method produces different kinds of information than other qualitative methods. It addresses concerns related to power relationships often occurring between researcher and participant since participants choose the images discussed, and it is an effective method of gathering data from reticent populations such as children. In addition, photo elicitation encourages trusting relationships and helps participants make meaning of their world as they talk about their snapshots. Finally, it is an inexpensive and user friendly way to gather data allowing children/adolescents to participate in research when they may not have the skills/abilities to discuss abstract ideas.

Findings show that each staff member spent a diminishing proportion of his/her time interacting with clients as the number of staff in the room increased. This finding is consistent with that of M. F. Cataldo and T. R. Risley (1972), who investigated the organization of an infant daycare center. (4 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - To meet recent accountability mandates, school districts are implementing assessment frameworks to document teachers’ effectiveness. Observational assessments play a key role in this process, albeit without compelling evidence of their psychometric rigor. Using a sample of kindergarten teachers, we employed Generalizability theory to investigate (across teachers, raters, and lessons) the stability of scores obtained with two different observation measures: The CLASS K-3 and the FFT. We conducted a series of Decision studies to document (for both measures’ constituent domains) the number of lessons per teacher and raters per lesson that would justify the use of observation scores for high stakes decisions. Acceptable, stable scores for individual-level decisions about teachers may generally require more raters and lessons than is typically used in practice (1–2 raters and fewer than 3 lessons). The considerable variability of observation-based scores raises concerns about either measure’s appropriateness for making individual or group decisions about teachers’ effectiveness.

AB  - Research Findings: The Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale–Revised (ECERS-R) is widely used to evaluate the quality of early childhood education and its association with child development. However, the psychometric properties of the ECERS-R are not well established. Consequently, in this study we tested 3 different factor solutions of the ECERS-R using models sourced from the existing literature (featuring 1-, 2-, and 3-correlated-factor solutions) and applying confirmatory factor analysis to data from the epidemiological sample of the Embu Pre-school Mental Health Study (n = 1,292 children). Alternative measures of child education quality (such as teacher-to-child ratio) were also analyzed. The confirmatory factor analysis returned good fit indices for both the unidimensional and 3-correlated-factor solution models. Practice or Policy: This study showcases different applications of the ECERS-R, both the full and shortened versions. These findings are particularly important for improving ECERS-R guidelines for researchers, professionals, and policymakers.

By using empirical data from a wider context than the specific speech event, it is possible to gain knowledge about the complexity of the construction of parent-teacher conferences.Using the concept of a “pocket of local order” it is argued hat parent-teacher conferences are practices, which consist of a large number of activities linked to resources and restrictions that can be interpreted as an imperative to the participants: to conduct talks in preschool and at home, to fill in forms and then use these activities in the conference. In addition, parents, teachers as well as children contribute to the construction and maintenance of the pocket of local order, i.e. activities that can be interpreted as an imperative to the actors in order to reach institutional goals.

By using empirical data from a wider context than the specific speech event, it is possible to gain knowledge about the complexity of the construction of parent-teacher conferences. Using the concept of a 'pocket of local order', it is argued that parent-teacher conferences are practices which consist of a large number of activities linked to resources and restrictions that can be interpreted as an imperative to the participants to conduct talks in preschool and at home, to fill in forms and then use these activities in the conference.

AB  - This paper reports the experiences of 150 children and six primary teachers when active learning pedagogies were introduced into the first year of primary schools. Although active learning increased the amount of talk between children, those from socio-economically advantaged homes talked more than those from less advantaged homes. Also, individual children experienced very little time engaged in high-quality talk with the teacher, despite the teachers spending over one-third of their time responding to children's needs and interests. Contextual differences, such as the different staffing ratios in schools and pre-schools, may affect how well the benefits of active learning transfer from pre-school contexts into primary schools. Policy-makers and teachers should pay particular attention to the implications of this for the education of children from economically less advantaged home backgrounds. (Contains 6 tables.)

AB  - Background: Inpatient quality deficits have important implications for the health and well-being of patients. They also have important financial implications for payers and hospitals by leading to longer lengths of stay and higher intensity of treatment. Many of these costly quality deficits are particularly sensitive to nursing care. Objective: To assess the effect of nurse staffing on quality of care and inpatient care costs. Design: Longitudinal analysis using hospital nurse staffing data and the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient Databases from 2008 through 2011. Subjects: Hospital discharges from California, Nevada, and Maryland (n = 18,474,860). Methods: A longitudinal, hospital-fixed effect model was estimated to assess the effect of nurse staffing levels and skill mix on patient care costs, length of stay, and adverse events, adjusting for patient clinical and demographic characteristics. Results: Increases in nurse staffing levels were associated with reductions in nursing-sensitive adverse events and length of stay, but did not lead to increases in patient care costs. Changing skill mix by increasing the number of registered nurses, as a proportion of licensed nursing staff, led to reductions in costs. Conclusions: The study findings provide support for the value of inpatient nurse staffing as it contributes to improvements in inpatient care; increases in staff number and skill mix can lead to improved quality and reduced length of stay at no additional cost.

AB  - Teachers' ratings of children's competencies may in part reflect characteristics and perspectives of teachers who assigned the ratings, which compromises their validity as a measure of child attributes. The purposes of this study were to use multilevel modeling to (a) estimate between-rater variance in teachers' ratings of children's social behaviors and relationships with teachers and (b) examine characteristics of teachers and classrooms associated with teachers' perceptions of these social competencies. Ratings of 711 children completed by 210 prekindergarten teachers indicated that between 15% and 33% of the total variance in teachers' ratings was attributed to mean differences between raters. After controlling for characteristics of children and their families, teachers' ratings of positive relationships and behaviors were associated with fewer years of experience, higher self-efficacy, non-White race/ethnicity, shorter length programs, better child-teacher ratios, and programs located within school settings. Implications are discussed for interpreting and analyzing teachers' ratings of children's competencies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

AB  - Investigated the hypothesis that burn-out among child-care workers would more likely occur when there was a greater number of children per staff member. 83 staff members (directors, head teachers, regular teachers, and volunteers) serving in publicly funded, private, and university-affiliated day-care centers with child/staff ratios ranging from 4:1 to 12:1 were questioned about background, characteristics of current job, and attitudes and feelings about child-care work, and were given semantic-differential-type mood scales to be filled out before and after work. Results show the following: (a) The ratio of staff to children had great impact on both working conditions and staff feelings about their jobs; as predicted, the more children per staff member the less satisfaction observed. (b) Overall, longer working hours were associated with more stress and negative attitudes, and primarily, if the longer hours involved more work with the children. (c) The chance to take time out when under pressure, e.g., do some less stressful work, was associated with less burn-out. (d) Number and perceived importance of staff meetings was related to better working conditions. (e) Persons working in less structured centers were more likely to become emotionally exhausted from their work but to have more positive feelings toward it. Recommendations for combating burn-out are offered. (22 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - There has been very little research into children's technological practice in early childhood settings. This article describes four typical examples of the technological activity that occurs on a daily basis in New Zealand early childhood settings. It is suggested that children come to compulsory schooling with well-developed technological knowledge and competence in instigating and carrying out technological tasks that is not recognized and taken advantage of by the majority of primary early years programme developers and teachers. A number of ways by which early years school technology programmes could benefit by recognizing the extent of children's emergent technological literacy and amending programme delivery and teaching strategies are detailed.

AB  - Analyzed psychological and educational data of 66 5–17 yr old males with coagulation disorders, 18 of whom were HIV-seropositive. Most Ss scored within the normal range on parent-, teacher-, and self-report mood and behavior scales. Mean IQ (113.5) was higher than normal; however, there was a disproportionately high prevalence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD [28.3%]), learning disability (LD [15.8%]), and graphomotor weakness. These were not significantly related to HIV status or to type and severity of coagulation disorder. School absenteeism was high but not significantly related to academic achievement or to diagnosis of ADHD or LD. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This paper seeks to make trouble for the metaphor of 'balance' in early childhood education research, drawing on the arguments of Gore (1993, 1997), Haraway (1991), McWilliam (1999), and a study (McArdle, 2001) that was designed to focus not only on teacher practice, but also to inquire into ways of speaking teacher practice. Our rationale for trouble-making is to ask questions about the way that the imperative to 'balance' disallows the investigation of pedagogy as a more complex field of practice, one that is inevitably riddled with unresolved and unresolvable contradictions and tensions. To understand how it is possible to think structure as freedom, we are forced to refuse any neat distinction between what enables and what constrains (McWilliam, 1999). For Haraway (1991), inquiry is 'blasphemous' when it refuses to 'see' practices in terms of the possibility of resolution, focusing instead on the irony of their unresolvability.

AB  - Assessed the effectiveness of a field-based program to improve teaching in inner-city day care centers. Integrated teams of experienced teachers worked with day care teachers at 9 centers on a daily basis. Findings indicate that both the active involvement of administrators and teachers and a flexible training program that enables the teachers to choose the methods and approaches applicable to their needs are necessary in order for change to occur. The centers where more teacher growth occurred had the following characteristics: (a) active support and interest of the administrator-director, (b) active interest and willingness to change on the part of the teachers, and (c) a pupil–staff ratio of at least 2 adults to 20 children. The centers where less teacher growth occurred had the following characteristics: (a) disharmony (i.e., personality conflicts) among center teachers to which the director paid little attention, (b) less flexible staff that were less willing to change patterns of teaching and less willing to allow the children to make some noise, (c) high pupil/low staff ratio, and (d) little support from director for staff development.

AB  - Examined 718 infants (aged 11–17.9 mo), toddlers (aged 18–35.9 mo), and preschoolers (aged 36–61.7 mo), who were enrolled in 120 child-care centers from Massachusetts, Virginia, and Georgia, to determine the effects of quality of care on children's social outcomes. Four auspices of child-care centers were sampled: nonprofit, local for-profit, national chains for-profit, and church-sponsored. Social outcomes included mothers' ratings of attachment, observations of social skills in classroom, and parents' rating of behavior problems. Quality of care assessment was based on teacher characteristics, teacher:child ratio, and teacher–child interactions. In addition, child developmental patterns and family characteristics, such as work–family interference and family stress, were tested. Results show that there were few associations between teacher–child interaction and children's social outcomes. Higher work–family interference was associated with poorer social outcomes generally. Children in nonprofit centers had better social outcomes on some measures, although effects were small. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Institution- and resident-oriented case practices for institutionalized retarded persons were investigated in 166 living units in 19 institutions in the US and 11 institutions in a Scandinavian country. Living units in the Scandinavian country were more resident-oriented than those in the US. Large central institutions were characterized by the most institution-oriented care practices, group homes by the most resident-oriented practices, with large and small regional centers falling between these extremes. Within type of institution, care practices were generally homogeneous. Living units for more severely retarded residents were characterized by more institution-oriented practices. Large living-unit size was predictive of institution-oriented practices while cost/resident/day, number of aides/resident, and number of professional staff/residents did not predict care practices. Characteristics of the Child Management Inventory, which assesses resident care practices, are examined. (29 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - A strong predictor of children's food intake at a meal is the amount they are served, and with a high percentage children attending preschool, there is a need to consider the relationship between portion size and intake in this context. In a two-part repeated measures study we investigated whether the portions teachers serve to children i) differ from those children would serve themselves and ii) impact food intake at a local preschool in Singapore. Part 1 ( n = 37, 20 boys, 3.0–6.8 years) compared the quantity of food served, consumed and leftover across three serving methods: ‘regular’ teacher-serving; child self-served portions; and a deliberately large portion served by the teacher (150% of each child's average previous gram intake). Part 2 ( n = 44, 23 boys, 2.4–6.2 years old) consisted of three additional observations of school-based servings outside of the experimental manipulation and enhance external validity of the study findings. Results indicated that serving size and intake was similar when the children and teachers served their ‘regular’ portions, but children consumed most overall when the teacher served the larger 150% portion. This was dependent on the child's age, with the oldest children being most responsive to the large portions while the youngest children tended to serve and consume a similar weight of food, regardless of the serving method. Though the younger children were generally served less than the older children, they consistently had more leftovers across all of the study observations. These data suggest that younger preschool children moderated food intake by leaving food in their bowl, and emphasise the unique influence of caregivers over children's eating behaviours outside of the home environment.

AB  - "The Condition of Education 2017" is a congressionally mandated annual report summarizing the latest data on education in the United States. This report is designed to help policymakers and the public monitor educational progress. This year's report includes 50 indicators on topics ranging from prekindergarten through postsecondary education, as well as labor force outcomes and international comparisons. "The Condition" includes an "At a Glance" section, which allows readers to quickly make comparisons within and across indicators, and a "Highlights" section, which captures a key finding or set of findings from each indicator. The report contains a "Reader's Guide," a "Glossary," and a "Guide to Data Sources" that provide additional information to help place the indicators in context. In addition, each indicator references the data tables that were used to produce the indicator, most of which are in the "Digest of Education Statistics." In addition to the regularly updated annual indicators, this year's report highlights innovative data collections and analyses from across the Center: (1) The first spotlight indicator examines the relationship between student risk factors at kindergarten entry (poverty and low parent educational attainment) and academic achievement in early elementary school; (2) The second spotlight indicator draws on administrative data from the Center's EDFacts data collection and finds that 2.5 percent of students in U.S. public elementary and secondary schools were reported as homeless in 2014-15; (3) The third spotlight indicator draws on longitudinal data from the Beginning Postsecondary Students Study to examine the rates at which first-time college students persist toward completion of a degree or certificate; and (4) The fourth spotlight indicator examines how disability rates for U.S. adults vary by educational attainment, finding that 16 percent of 25- to 64-year-olds who had not completed high school had one or more disabilities in 2015, compared to 4 percent of those who had completed a bachelor's degree and 3 percent of those who had completed a master's or higher degree. In addition, two indicators provide insights from the Center's recent work on technology in education. The first previews key findings from the Center's upcoming report, "Student Access to Digital Learning Resources Outside of the Classroom." The second presents findings from the National Assessment of Educational Progress's 8th-grade Technology and Engineering Literacy (TEL) assessment.

AB  - This paper explores the design, development and evaluation of an early childhood literacy iPad application, focusing on the English Alphabet, called "A to Z Safari" trialled in Australian classrooms. A to Z Safari was designed to assist students in the early years of schooling with learning the alphabet and building on their knowledge of letter-sounds. This paper details the process that led to the design and development of A to Z Safari and evaluates the success of the application (also known as "app"), using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), from a classroom trial in 2015. Quantitative data from the app statistics gathered on student use, and qualitative interviews with classroom teachers explores how students and teachers received A to Z Safari. It was found that the design of A to Z Safari exhibited ease of use and usefulness for the target cohort in regards to gameplay and teacher support, however a number of updates need to be made to the app's functionality to satisfy future, larger scale use. Suggestions for those designing similar apps for use in classroom environments have been provided.

AB  - Previous research indicates that girls spend less time than boys exploring a novel toy; whether this finding is due to individual differences, sex differences in the toys' attractiveness, or the restricted number of exploration indices employed has not been answered. The novel toy used in the present study was a box with 5 manipulanda and 3 detachable panels that incorporated a sex-typed feature (picture on panel) that appealed to boys and girls, respectively. Panels were identical except the depictions they presented: a house, dashboard of a car, and pinwheel of colors (control). An independent assessment of panel preference with 35 boys and girls (aged 42–75 mo) indicated that girls preferred the house panel while boys preferred the car panel. Results indicate that Ss in both the car and house conditions spent significantly more time manipulating the novel toy and less time manipulating the familiar toys during a 15-min free play session than Ss in the control group. Girls in the house condition spent significantly more time than boys exploring the novel and familiar toys concurrently, suggesting that girls may have a proclivity toward exploring certain types of novel toys in conjunction with familiar toys.

AB  - This study is a population-based investigation of children's school readiness with a national sample of low-income children, utilizing data from the Family and Children's Experiences Survey (FACES; 2000-2003). Guided by a developmental ecological framework, we posed 3 research questions: (a) How do children's early school readiness skills in the social and cognitive domains overlap (as they enter preschool)? (b) Do these configurations of school readiness skills meaningfully predict children's school adjustment by the end of kindergarten? (c) In addition to the patterns of children's school readiness identified at the beginning of their first Head Start year, do relevant family and classroom context factors help to predict and/or moderate end-of-kindergarten outcomes? Results revealed 5 distinct patterns of school readiness for this national sample of low-income children. These profiles related in meaningful ways to end-of-kindergarten outcomes, such that children in more competent preschool profiles did better over time. Moreover, these patterns of school readiness identified at the beginning of the Head Start year were the most consistent predictors of end-of-kindergarten performance, controlling for demographic and context factors. However, results revealed that proximal contextual influences in the family (i.e., maternal education and parenting style) and classroom (i.e., teacher experience, teacher education, and adult-child ratio) further predicted end of kindergarten performance across preacademic and social domains. Findings illuminated significant within-group patterns and variability among an at-risk population, relevant for informing early childhood education and early intervention.

AB  - In this case, a child with a spinal cord injury was denied access to an afterschool care program that her nondisabled siblings were allowed to attend because she did not meet "eligibility requirements." Specifically, the independent contractor who ran the program mandated that students be able to function in an environment with a student to teacher ratio of 15:1. District personnel initially claimed that the decision to deny admission was not their responsibility because the program was not administered by the schools, while the contractor claimed that they could not hire additional personnel without district approval.

AB  - Describes the development of an extension of the Meadow/Kendall Social-Emotional Assessment Inventory for Deaf Students for use in assessing 3–6 yr olds. The 49-item inventory was sent to 54 educational programs for the deaf in 10 states in order to collect normative data. 875 teachers completed and returned the inventory. Test–retest reliability, interrater reliability, and validity of the assessment inventory are discussed. It is hoped that this inventory will be useful to those who want to encourage positive social and emotional growth in deaf preschoolers.

AB  - We theorized that student test score performance will be positively related to the percentage of school district revenues raised from local taxes and with salary levels of school district administrators. Using both fixed and random effects panel analyses, we examine data for 217 Kindergarten-to-Grade 12 school districts in New Jersey for the years 2002-2009. Our results support the inference that increases in the percent of school funds raised locally have a positive influence on student test scores. However, the results for our hypothesis involving administrative costs were mixed. Administrative salaries and administrative spending were found to be positively related to test score performance in the one-way time fixed effects model, but not in the two-way models. Finally, classroom spending and the student-faculty ratio were found to be positive and significant in some of the tests, although not robust to alternative specifications. (Contains 6 tables.)

AB  - In 1948, four residential care centers provided services for 150 children with intellectual disability (ID). The first medical director in the Ministry of Social Affairs was appointed in 1970. In Israel, the Office of the Medical Director is responsible for the medical service for persons with ID. Because of a lack of data on medical services for people with ID, a questionnaire was developed and pilot tested in 1997 in several residential care centers. For the first national survey study for 1998, a final-survey instrument was used, with the following sections: information on the age, gender, and level of intellectual disability of persons served at the residential care center in question, status of the population served, profile, nursing, medical, and allied professional staff, number of annual examinations, preventive medicine aspects, medications, number of annual cases of infectious disease, annual unintentional injury, number of deaths, number of hospitalizations, internal residential center hospitalization, ambulatory out-patient use, use of outside laboratory examinations and dental care In 1998, 6,022 persons were served in 9 government, 32 private, and 12 public centers. The average number of persons per center was 113.62 (range 22 to 398). Of the patient population, 80% were between 20 and 60 years old, 50% had severe or profound intellectual disability, and 41% had moderate disability. 24% were nursing patients, 20% were confined to a wheelchair, 29% suffered from epilepsy. Of the total population, 65% were receiving medication daily for chronic illness and 46%received psychotropic medication.

AB  - Quality control of service provided is an important component of the administration of any service or business. In Israel, the Office of the Medical Director of the Ministry of Social Affairs is responsible for the medical service in residential-care centers for persons with intellectual disability (ID). During 1997-1998, a standard annual questionnaire was developed and the first national survey study conducted in 1998. This present paper presents the findings of the eighth national survey conducted in 2005, for which the following information was gathered via questionnaires: information on the age, gender, and level of intellectual disability of persons served at the residential care center in question, status of the population served, profile, nursing, medical, and allied professional staff, number of annual examinations, preventive medicine aspects, medications, number of annual cases of infectious disease, annual unintentional injury, number of deaths, number of hospitalizations, internal residential center hospitalization, ambulatory out-patient use, use of outside laboratory examinations, and dental care. In 2005, 6,749 persons were served in 9 government, 37 private, and 12 public centers. The average number of persons per center was 116.36 (range 23 to 366). Of the patient population, 79.1% were between 20 and 60 years old, 47% had severe or profound intellectual disability, and 41.3% moderate disability. 24% were nursing patients, 18% were confined to a wheelchair, 31.2% suffered from epilepsy. Of the total population, 82.2% received medication daily for chronic illness, and 51% received psychotropic medication.

AB  - In Israel, the Office of the Medical Director of the Ministry of Social Affairs is responsible for the medical service in residential care centers for persons with intellectual disability (ID). During 1997-1998 a standard annual questionnaire was developed, and the first national survey study was conducted in 1998. This paper is an analysis of the sixth national survey which was administered in 2003. The following data were gathered and assessed: age, gender and level of ID of persons served at the care center in question; the status of the population served; nursing, medical and allied professional staff; number of annual examinations; preventive health care; medications; number of annual cases of infectious disease; annual unintentional injury; number of deaths; number of hospitalizations; internal residential center hospitalization; ambulatory outpatient utilization, utilization of outside laboratory examinations, and dental care. In 2003, 6,500 persons were served in nine government, 36 private and 12 public centers. The average number of persons per center was 114.03 (range 24 to 388). The survey in 2003 showed that 80.1% of the population was between 20 and 60 years old. Within this population 50.1% had severe or profound ID, 40.8% had moderate ID, and 8.5% had mild ID. Twenty-four percent were nursing patients, with a high workload for the care staff, and 20% of individuals surveyed were confined to wheelchairs. The present survey demonstrated that 30.2% had epilepsy, 80.5% received daily medication for chronic illness and 48.7% received psychotropic medication for psychiatric illness.

AB  - In Israel, the Office of the Medical Director of the Ministry of Social Affairs is responsible for the medical service in residential-care centers for persons with intellectual disability (ID). A standard annual questionnaire was developed during 1997-1998, and the first national survey study was conducted in 1998. This present paper presents the findings of the seventh national survey in 2004, for which the following information was gathered via questionnaires: age, gender, and level of intellectual disability of persons served at the residential care center in question, status of the population served, functional profile, nursing, medical, and allied professional staff, number of annual examinations, preventive medicine aspects, medications, number of annual cases of infectious disease, annual unintentional injuries, number of deaths, number of hospitalizations, internal residential center hospitalization, ambulatory out-patient use, use of outside laboratory examinations, and dental care. In 2004, 6,610 persons were served in nine government, 37 private, and 12 public centers. The average number of persons served per center was 113.97 (range 23 to 372). The survey in 2004 showed that 79.2% of the population with ID in residential care in Israel was between 20 and 60 years of age; 48.8% had severe or profound ID, 41% had moderate ID, and 10% had mild ID; 23% were nursing patients; 19% were confined to a wheelchair; 31% had epilepsy; 83% were receiving medication daily for chronic illness; and 52.5% were receiving psychotropic medication for psychiatric illness.

AB  - Aim: To analyse the social situation of parents who have a child with cerebral palsy (CP). Method: This was a population‐based longitudinal study with linkage to public registries. Parents of children with CP ( n = 3671) identified in the Danish CP Registry were compared with 17 983 parents of children without CP. Employment, income, cohabitation status, and presence of additional children were factors analysed during a follow‐up period of 28 years. We followed parents from before their child was born and up to the age of 43 years of the child. Results: Mothers of children with CP under the age of 10 were less often employed: odds ratio [OR] of employment at age 5y 0.45 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.36–0.57), but only 11% left the labour market. Mothers of children without CP had higher incomes: ratio full‐time working 1.11 (95% CI 1.07–1.15). The risk of not living together was not increased among parents of children with CP: at age 5 years OR 1.04 (95% CI 0.84–1.28). Parents of children with CP as the first born postponed or more seldom had subsequent children: hazard ratio [HR] 0.75 (95% CI 0.68–0.83). Interpretation: The Danish welfare system seems to have succeeded in keeping parents in the labour market and living together with their child. Special attention needs to be paid to the financial situation of families with children with CP under 10 years of age.

AB  - Identified staff behaviors and parental coping patterns helpful to parents during their child's hospitalization in a pediatric intensive care unit (ICU). 21 mothers and 15 fathers of 27 hospitalized children (mean age 4 yrs) were asked, within 5 days of their child's discharge from the ICU, their perception regarding the use and helpfulness of selected coping strategies and the helpfulness of a number of staff behaviors, as well as whether these staff behaviors were experienced. A large percentage of Ss perceived health care professionals in the pediatric ICUs as providing, at least minimally, all of the staff behavior/interventions listed. The staff behavior seen as most important by the largest number of parents was "being permitted to stay with their child as much as possible." In evaluating the overall findings regarding personal coping strategies, it appears that Ss most frequently used problem-focused coping strategies and that these strategies were seen as most helpful. Emotion-focused coping was used by a slightly lower percentage of Ss than problem- and appraisal-focused coping. (21 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study compared 2 sets of middle-class families: Taiwanese families in Taipei, Taiwan, and European American families in Longwood, a neighborhood in Chicago. Nine primary caregivers from Taipei (8 mothers, 1 aunt) and 11 primary caregivers (all mothers) from Longwood, all of whom had focal children aged 4-5 yrs with at least 1 sibling, were interviewed. The goal of this study was to deepen understanding of a set of narrative practices in European-American families in which young children's transgressions are downplayed or erased, a pattern that is cast in relief by the frequent, foregrounded narration of young children's transgressions in Taiwanese families. Evidence from the mothers' folk theories was used to illuminate these patterns, revealing that the pattern is reversed with respect to the narration of parental transgressions. The Taipei mothers treat parents' past misdeeds as undermining of adult authority and thereby not narratable to children, whereas the Longwood mothers regard parental misdeeds, including "hell-raising," as highly reportable for their humor and their power to humanize parents. These findings are discussed in relation to contrasting ideals and understandings of the dynamics of selves over time. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The main purpose of the study was to explore the child sexual behaviors that Italian teachers have observed in the school context. A representative sample of 227 children, from 5 to 10 years old, was rated by their teachers through the Child Sexual Behavior Inventory. Frequencies of sexual behaviors among children aged 5 to 6, 7 to 8, and 9 to 10 are presented. Younger children showed a broader range of sexual behaviors that decrease with the growing age, such as males in comparison to females. Moreover, findings showed that child sexual behavior is not only related to age and gender but also to family characteristics. These results suggested that child sexual behaviors reported by teachers through the Child Sexual Behavior Inventory may provide useful information about the development of children’s sexuality. The knowledge of age appropriate sexual behaviors can help teachers discern normal sexual behaviors from problematic sexual behaviors.

AB  - The change from students learning all subjects together in a one-room schoolhouse to learning in classes separated by subject and grade resulted in distinct disciplines such as social studies, mathematics, science, and English. What was lost was the unified, holistic curriculum that a one-room setting required. Since students move from pre-kindergarten to twelfth grade, disciplines such as mathematics have become more compartmentalized as learners progress into the areas of algebra, geometry, and precalculus, for example. Outside of a school setting, however, the lines between the disciplines of math and science tend to blur. The purpose of this article is to provide middle school mathematics teachers with a rationale and method for correlating math and science, disciplines that are natural partners, by understanding the components of both that have a reciprocal relationship.

AB  - Examined the ability of 2 measures of preschool children's social strategy knowledge to predict classroom behavior with peers. 32 children (aged 4–5 yrs) were administered the Preschool Interpersonal Problem Solving Test (PIPS) and an enactive assessment of strategy knowledge. Observational and teacher-rating measures of children's positive and aggressive peer behavior were also obtained. Significant correlations were obtained between (1) the number of strategies produced in the enactive measure and cooperative play ratings by teachers, (2) the number of strategies produced in the PIPS and observations of positive peer behavior, and (3) ratings of friendliness in the PIPS and teacher-rated cooperative play and aggression and observations of aggression.

AB  - The first few days and weeks of life of the newborn infant mark a time when parent–child relationships begin to form. When a child is born who is either premature or sick, the child is often admitted into a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) to allow optimal opportunity for survival. Yet, while the infant's medical needs are being met, the needs of the parents and the opportunity for them to interact with and assume a parental role with their newborn child may not be met. This study examined how the admission of the baby into the NICU may affect the parental feelings and emotions as well as attachment to the infant. 30 parent sets were interviewed after their infants were released from an NICU to determine the presence of feelings, stressors, and attachment difficulties while their infants were NICU patients. Results demonstrate several significant differences and likenesses between mothers and fathers within the feeling, stressor, and attachment domains. These findings, when applied to care provided within an NICU, offer rationale which enable NICU personnel to better meet the diverse needs of mothers and fathers whose infants are NICU patients.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore whether preschool teachers’ self-reported beliefs could predict their self-reported practices about developmentally appropriate practices (DAP). A related purpose was to examine whether classroom size and teachers' experience are significant predictors of their self-reported beliefs and practices. A total of 264 preschool teachers completed the Teachers’ Beliefs Scale (TBS) and the Instructional Activities Scale (IAS). Most of the teachers endorsed beliefs about child-initiated learning beliefs and integrated/social/cultural curriculum. For self-reported practices, most of the teachers embraced broad integrated activities. Overall, low-to-moderate correlations were found among the TBS and IAS subscales. The hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis showed that teachers’ DAP beliefs (integrated/social–cultural curriculum and child-initiated learning) explained 13% of the variance in teachers’ self-reported practices. Also, teachers’ experience and classroom size were significant predictors of teachers’ practices. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

AB  - Despite major improvements in the cure rate of childhood acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), 5-15% of patients still die from treatment-related complications. In a historical prospective cohort study, we analysed the frequency, clinical features and risk factors for early deaths (ED) and treatment-related deaths (TRD) in 525 children included in the Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology (NOPHO)-AML-84, -88 and -93 trials. Seventy patients (13%) died before starting treatment or from treatment-related complications. The death rate rose from 11% in NOPHO-AML-84 to 29% in -88, but then fell to 8% in -93. Sixteen patients (3%) died within the first 2 weeks, mainly from bleeding or leucostasis. Hyperleucocytosis, age <2 or ≥10 years were risk factors. After day 15, 10% of patients died from treatment-related complications with infection as the main cause of death. Risk factors were age <2 or ≥10 years and treatment according to the NOPHO-AML-88 protocol. The number of EDs and TRDs in AML is high. Therefore optimal antifungal prophylaxis is essential, and studies on the benefit of antibacterial prophylaxis and individual risk factors for ED and TRD are needed.

AB  - Explored the relationship between caregivers' perception of supervisory behaviors and caregivers' observed behaviors, including amount of staff turnover, in the childcare setting. Ss included the supervisors and staff of 22 of one state's department of human resources childcare programs, each of which served 40–200 children and had a staff size of 5–20. The Leadership Behavior Description Questionnaire was used by staff to describe their supervisors' behavior. Results show little relationship between perceived supervisory style and caregiver behavior. As there was little or no staff turnover, it was concluded that no relationship existed between supervisory style and staff turnover. Implications for the role of the supervisor in childcare and how the behavior of the supervisor affects the behaviors of others involved in caring for the very young are discussed.

AB  - The IEA Preprimary Project is a longitudinal, cross-national study of preprimary care and education designed to identify how process and structural characteristics of the settings children attended at age 4 are related to their age-7 cognitive and language performance. Investigators collaborated to develop common instruments to measure family background, teachers' characteristics, setting structural characteristics, experiences of children in settings, and children's developmental status. Data from 10 countries are included in the analysis; in most countries, the sample of settings is representative of preprimary settings in that country. For the analysis, a 3-level hierarchical linear model was employed that allowed decomposition of variation of child outcomes into three parts--variation among children within settings, among settings within countries, and among countries. Four findings are consistent across all of the countries included. Age-7 language improves as teachers' number of years of full-time schooling increases and the predominant type of activity teachers propose in settings is free choice rather than personal/social. Age-7 cognitive performance improves as children spend less time in whole group activities and the variety of equipment and materials available increases. There were also a number of findings that varied across countries depending on particular country characteristics. The findings support child-initiated activities and small group activities and are consistent with developmentally appropriate practices promoting active learning.

AB  - A child's demonstration of his conceptual understanding of number bodes well for his future success in school mathematics. As youngsters' thinking becomes more logical, they apply one-to-one correspondence relationships to quantification. Yet, reliable assessment of young children's mathematical ability is difficult because of social and emotional factors related to their development. The Arlitt Preschool Curriculum-Based Measure for Math (APCBM-Math) can be used for required monitoring of children with diagnosed disabilities as well as for program accountability. It is an interactive game that is played between assessor and child. The game consists of a basket of teddy bear counters and a deck of cards, prearranged in a standardized order for consistency. The use of concrete objects is an important component of the assessment because it allows the assessor to document that children understand underlying number sense concepts, such as set representation and comparison (NCTM 2000). In this article, key number sense concepts that teachers should look for as they interact with young children are mentioned. (Contains 1 table and 2 figures.)

AB  - In Israel, the Office of the Medical Director of the Ministry of Social Affairs is responsible for the medical service in residential-care centers for persons with intellectual disability (ID). Because of a lack of data on medical services for people with ID, a questionnaire was developed in 1997-1998 and the first national survey study conducted in 1998. This present paper presents the findings of the fourth national survey in 2001, for which the following information was gathered via questionnaires: information on the age, gender, and level of intellectual disability of persons served at the residential care center in question, status of the population served, profile, nursing, medical, and allied professional staff, number of annual examinations, preventive medicine aspects, medications, number of annual cases of infectious disease, annual unintentional injury, number of deaths, number of hospitalizations, internal residential center hospitalization, ambulatory out-patient use, use of outside laboratory examinations and dental care. In 2001, 6,370 persons were served in nine government, 33 private and 12 public centers. The average number of persons per center was 117.96 (range 25 to 398). Of the patient population, 78% were between 20 and 60 years old, 52% had severe or profound intellectual disability, and 40% moderate disability. 25% were nursing patients, 19% were confined to a wheelchair, 30% suffered from epilepsy. Of the total population, 78% were receiving medication daily for chronic illness and 51% received psychotropic medication.

AB  - Today an increasing number of teachers have successfully implemented blogging with students ranging from kindergarten through high school (Hungerford-Kresser, Wiggins, & Amaro-Jimenez, 2012). Although research on blogging is scant, existing studies suggest it can benefit students in various ways (Meinecke, Smith, & Lehmann-Willenbrock, 2013). For example, some teachers have designed blogging projects to promote dialogue, reflection, social networking, and improvement in reading and writing (McGrail & Davis, 2011). Additionally, blogs can help teachers stay organized and use less paper (Richardson, 2010). Allowing students to blog is a way for teachers to integrate new literacies into the curriculum, helping them adhere to the recommendations and standards of important educational organizations. The International Reading Association (2009), for example, urges teachers to use information and communication technologies (ICTs) to prepare students for successful participation in today's digital environment. The National Council for Teachers of Mathematics likewise encourages teachers and students to use technology to enrich student learning (Hossain & Wiest, 2013). This article first discusses how blogging helps students collaborate and improve academically. Then, to help educators interested in integrating this technological method into their teaching, it presents ideas, strategies, and guidelines for starting a classroom blog.

AB  - Background: Although child mental health problems are among the most important worldwide issues, development of culturally acceptable mental health services to serve the clinical needs of children and their families is especially lacking in regions outside Europe and North America. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), which was developed in the United Kingdom and is now one of the most widely used measurement tools for screening child psychiatric symptoms, has been translated into Japanese, but culturally calibrated norms for Japanese schoolchildren have yet to be established. To this end, we examined the applicability of the Japanese versions of the parent and teacher SDQs by establishing norms and extending validation of its psychometric properties to a large nationwide sample, as well as to a smaller clinical sample. Methods: The Japanese versions of the SDQ were completed by parents and teachers of schoolchildren aged 7 to 15 years attending mainstream classes in primary or secondary schools in Japan. Data were analyzed to describe the population distribution and gender/age effects by informant, cut-off scores according to banding, factor structure, cross-scale correlations, and internal consistency for 24,519 parent ratings and 7,977 teacher ratings from a large nationwide sample. Inter-rater and test-retest reliabilities and convergent and divergent validities were confirmed for a smaller validation sample (total n = 128) consisting of a clinical sample with any mental disorder and community children without any diagnoses. Results: Means, standard deviations, and banding of normative data for this Japanese child population were obtained. Gender/age effects were significant for both parent and teacher ratings. The original five-factor structure was replicated, and strong cross-scale correlations and internal reliability were shown across all SDQ subscales for this population. Inter-rater agreement was satisfactory, test-retest reliability was excellent, and convergent and divergent validities were satisfactory for the validation sample, with some differences between informants. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that the Japanese version of the SDQ is a useful instrument for parents and teachers as well as for research purposes. Our findings also emphasize the importance of establishing culturally calibrated norms and boundaries for the instrument’s use.

AB  - Unintentional injury constitutes a major health risk for young children, with many injuries occurring in the home. Although active supervision by parents has been shown to be effective to prevent injuries, evidence indicates that parents do not consistently apply this strategy. To address this issue, a randomized controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the impact of the Supervising for Home Safety program on parent supervision practices in the home and when unobtrusively observed in a naturalistic laboratory setting. Using a participant-event monitoring procedure, parents of children aged 2 through 5 years completed supervision recording sheets weekly both before and after exposure to the intervention program; Control parents completed the same measures but received a program focusing on child nutrition and active lifestyles. Unobtrusive video recordings of parent supervision of their child in a room containing contrived hazards also were taken pre- and post-intervention. Results indicated that groups did not differ in demographic characteristics. Comparisons of post- with pre-intervention diary reported home supervision practices revealed a significant decrease in time that children were unsupervised, an increase in in-view supervision, and an increase in level of supervision when children were out of view, with all changes found only for the Intervention group. Similarly, only parents in the Intervention group showed a significant increase in attention to the child in the contrived hazards context, with these differences evident immediately after and 3 months after exposure to the intervention. These results provide the first evidence that an intervention program can positively impact caregiver supervision.

AB  - This paper addresses, in two parts, some issues in the staffing of early childhood services. Taking an international perspective, the first part of the paper discusses: (1) the structure of the early childhood workforce; (2) the social construction of the early childhood worker; (3) gender; (4) staff to child ratios; (5) processes of transition in the reform of staffing; (6) the relationship between the staffing of early childhood services and other services for children; and (7) family day care. This part concludes with a series of questions about the staffing of early childhood services, especially concerning training and education, and presents, as a basis for discussion, a set of targets for staffing drawn from a larger set of 40 "quality targets" produced by the European Commission Childcare Network, an expert group drawn from the European Union's member states. The second part of the paper consists of accounts of staffing in center-based early childhood services in six case countries. This part provides detailed material to illustrate the general points made in part one. The six countries selected for special attention are Denmark, France, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. They were selected because they illustrate most of the range of diversity outlined in part one, with the exception that five of the six have integrated responsibility for all early childhood services within one system and government department, while most countries continue to divide responsibility between education and welfare systems.

AB  - Develops a model of the child-care environment, concentrating on how child-staff ratios, group size, and caregiver ability influence amount of time children spend on-task and intensity of caregiver-child interactions. The model clarifies these variables' roles and explains regulation's potential costs and benefits. Regulation alone cannot improve overall child care quality. (18 references) (MLH)

AB  - Early childhood care and education is an important stage in preparing children for primary schooling. Research indicates that participation in this phase has beneficial effects on later schooling particularly at the primary school level. Early diagnosis of special educational needs and intervention are essential in this stage if a child is to effectively function at primary school level and other later cycles. Unfortunately the sector is beset with a number of problems such as poor quality, low access, inadequate training of teachers, assessment problems, high pupil/teacher ratios, insufficient funding and lack of strong commitment from the public. The system needs to be more inclusive and made part of the overall education-for-all objectives in each country to benefit more children. The study discusses these advantages and disadvantages with respect to Swaziland and Brunei Darussalam. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

AB  - This study focuses on psychology of pre-adolescent children in war time and young child’s experience in war time. This acute ambivalence probably expressed not only the mixed feelings about war to which many children have been exposed in this era of rapidly shifting opinion, but his deeper sensitivity to ambivalence rooted in conflicting family relationships. The study discusses briefly to some of the character effects of war on children in this country whose mothers are working. The study explores that nursery schools are crucial, not just to provide a safe environment, but to provide an environment that is emotionally sound, in which young children can have the warmth, freedom from compulsive pressures, and joy, which are necessary for normal personality development. Some teachers report that children do not talk about the war; it is not reflected in their play or behavior in any way. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Childhood education is crucial in the life of a child because it lays the foundation of intellectual and physical development. Concerns have been raised over the state of the ECDE programmes with regard to the negative teacher attitudes towards selection and use of instructional resources due to low remuneration, lack of time and demotivation. The study adopted the descriptive survey design and was carried out in Kericho Municipality Zone, Kericho County. The fact that class one pupils cannot read or perform simple arithmetic shows that they did not acquire the skills in ECDE. This aroused concern to the researcher and raised questions that begged for answers. The study findings can benefit the young children to acquire the skills of reading, manipulative, numeric, interpersonal skills and positive attitude towards education. The objective of the study was to assess the influence of teacher preparedness in the use of available instructional materials in the teaching and learning and to explore the attitude of teachers and its influence on the selection and use of instructional in ECDE centres in Kericho County. The study adopted mixed research methods (qualitative and quantitative). Simple random and stratified sampling techniques were used to select respondents who comprised of a target population of 84 head teachers and 180 pre-school teachers to get the sample size of 25 head teachers and 54 pre-school teachers from the selected ECDE centres. Data was collected using questionnaires, interviews and observation, and was analyzed using descriptive statistics; this included frequencies and percentages. Majority of the pre-school teachers 75 (94.9%) agreed that they used available IR in teaching and learning in ECDE centres, however the status of the available materials in the centres were either inadequate, obsolete, dilapidated or unsuitable for use. From the study findings it was concluded that teachers were well prepared to use the available IR though they did not maximize the use of IR in teaching and learning.

AB  - Telephone nurse lines help callers to select the most appropriate site and level of care for acute conditions. We examined whether compliance with nurse recommendations was associated with lower average health care expenditure, and identified the employer characteristics associated with higher than average savings. Telephone calls to a nurse-led help line made by commercial health plan members who worked for large employers were identified. The callers’ intention before calling and the nurse recommendation regarding site/level of care were recorded. Compliance was determined using medical claims during a 30-day post-call observation period and was based on adherence to nurse recommendations. A total of 132,509 calls during 2012 were identified for the study. Nurse recommendations were that 31% of the callers seek a higher level of care than mentioned at the start of the call, 25% use a lower level of care and 44% pursue their originally intended level of care. After regression-based adjustment, the average medical expenditures were compared between compliers and non-compliers. Overall, 57% of callers were compliant with nurse recommendations. The average expenditures were $328 lower among compliant callers. A logistic regression analysis identified employer characteristics positively associated with achieving higher than average savings. These were having a low employee-to-dependent ratio, a headquarters in the Western region of the US, a low prospective health risk score, and participation by the employer in a targeted communication campaign. Compliance with the triage recommendations resulted in lower average health care expenditures, and several characteristics were positively associated with achieving higher savings.

AB  - In a previous report, 2013, results from questionnaires and interviews showed how a new middle leader role among preschool teachers and teachers had been implemented 1,5 years after a course focusing on leading processes. The course took place in one school district in the city of Helsingborg, Sweden. The present report tells the story of what has happened within the 13 schools and 13 pre- schools and with the 62 middle leaders three years after the first report. The middle leaders were originally called process leaders. Their main function was to stimulate and guide their colleagues in developmental work, in close co- operation with principals. They have been working as administrative assistants, mentors to colleagues, leaders of improvement projects and consultants for larger school development. During the years an emphasis on micro tasks to- gether with colleagues, have further developed to include an emphasis on macro tasks for the whole units. The preschools are all still using the process leaders, while nine of the schools have chosen other options. Some schools use first teachers (a government sponsored teacher role) as middle leaders instead. Some schools have stopped using middle leaders all-together since they do not fit principals’ view of an efficient and strict organisation. The staff at half the units do not consider process leaders as useful as before, while the staff at the other half of the units view them as just as or even more useful. Middle leaders are one facet of organisational change in the school district. The introduction of process leaders correspond with an increased tendency for staff to engage in different change projects. This coincides with the organising of a task and process driven organisation for both routine work and development. During interviews at four sites, we noticed and named the emergence of such organisations. Teachers are assigned tasks (communicated with the rest of the staff) directly from the principal. Most preschool teachers and teachers have had tasks within specific areas, in which they are resources for their colleagues. Middle leaders, more often than their colleagues, have coordinating tasks. The four sites show considerable improvements in staff attitudes in relation to cooperation, perceived job relevance of in-service training, developmental projects and evaluation, and most of all support when having problems in class and needing help in order to achieve change. There is also an increase in the perception of empowerment in work correlated with an increase in taking on tasks. This was registered by staff questionnaires, which also measured individ- ual teacher efficacy, and collective efficacy within staffs. Over the three years, these two measures have got a higher correlation, especially for preschool teach- ers. Thus, teachers let their own self-efficacy be more influenced by cooperative achievement at the sites, or vice versa. No special factor was especially outstanding in influencing collective effi- cacy. Instead, the numbers and direction of change played the most important role. Many negative changes in attitudes correlated with decreased collective efficacy. Both positive and negative changes correlated with no change in col- lective efficacy, while many improvements in measured factors predicated im- proved collective efficacy. What worked as enhancing or depressing on collec- tive efficacy seems to be a contextual and local affair. Certain generative mechanisms were found to have important impact on the emergence and growth of task and process driven organisations. The generative mechanisms are: staff opens for visibility, cooperation across borders, im- proved deliberative structure of meetings, better coupling between leadership and staff, getting staff ownership from many tasks and wide participation in activities, more systematic developmental processes, improvements visible for children and students, in-take of news from other sites and research. These mechanisms also express meaning to staffs’ use of the concept ‘process driven’. In many of these processes especially process leaders used artifacts and tem- plates learned during the course. Our analyses indicate that an important facet of task and process driven organisations were that a temporary developmental organisation was drawn up and modelled. Similar structures were not in place, or malfunctioned, in the operative organisation for routine work.

AB  - One way to help preservice teachers to articulate and advocate their teaching stance is by developing their knowledge, skills, and confidence in their ability to carefully, didactically, and strategically plan for instruction. The Integrative Research Project (IRP) is a planning process that enables the preservice teacher to incorporate not only developmentally appropriate practices in an authentic inquiry-based planning process but also incorporate goals, objectives, and standards for learning. The IRP begins with the development of a research question. Then brainstorming is done to generate a secondary list of questions but using different viewpoints such as those of scientists, anthropologists, sociologists, researchers, teachers, musicians, artists, athletes, or kindergarten children. Preservice teachers also use the Internet and library in order to access a broader range of content information. A visual display, such as a table, curriculum wheel, or topic web, is developed in order to visually understand the flow of the project. The IRP incorporates different content areas--reading, writing, mathematics, science, social studies, art, music, physical growth, and fieldwork. Learning goals, corresponding objectives, and standards are chosen that best express the learning that will occur during the teaching of the IRP. The preservice teachers then develop core activities that will enable the students to find answers to the questions. Motivational and culminating activities or events for the IRP are developed to enhance learning. A resource and reference are also generated and included in the final write-up that is turned in to the professor. The IRP provides the preservice teachers with the kind of long-term planning that is so necessary to become an effective teacher. This long-term planning allows the preservice teacher to understand the flow of the project and enables the preservice teacher to have the rationale and logic necessary to explain to others what is taking place in the classroom and more importantly why these experiences enable children to learn.

AB  - Widespread concern has been expressed about the persistent low mathematics achievement of students in the US, particularly for students from low-income and minority backgrounds and students with disabilities. Instructional gaming technology, when designed and fictionalized well, has the potential to improve the motivation and mathematics achievement of students with or at-risk for mathematics difficulties (MD). Despite these potential advantages, the research base is scant for efficacious technology tools in early mathematics. This paper describes development and testing of the NumberShire intervention, and discusses results from feasibility studies in kindergarten, first, and second grade classrooms. Project NumberShire supports the development of in-depth knowledge of whole number concepts for students with or at risk for MD in grades K-2, a focus recommended by mathematics education experts. NumberShire is a browser-based, educational video game in which players build an idyllic fairytale village by learning and applying whole number knowledge in three domains of the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics. To test the initial feasibility and usability of NumberShire, researchers aimed to answer four research questions: (1) Is NumberShire reliably efficient and easy for students and teachers to use?; (2) Are students able to focus on and benefit from mathematics content in the game, rather than being distracted by other features?; (3) Are students operating the game as intended?; and (4) Are students engaged in NumberShire mini-games and activities? In fall 2012, 125 students participated in feasibility testing, 50 of which teachers identified as being at risk for difficulties in mathematics on the basis of student performance on screening measures (e.g., EasyCBM) and other classroom assessments. Classrooms were located in three elementary schools in Oregon and Massachusetts. This study used design experiment methodology and iterative end-user testing trials to examine initial feasibility and usability of the NumberShire intervention. Mixed methods research design was also employed to study initial student learning during the feasibility test and guide program revisions in preparation for a formal, rigorous, small scale RCT pilot study to assess intervention promise. Feasibility data were collected in fall 2012 and spring 2013, from a variety of assessment, game, and interview activities. In winter 2013, research staff summarized data from all observations and interviews conducted in second grade classrooms. Results from the first half of the feasibility study suggest second grade students were engaged in and able to use NumberShire with general ease. Second grade teachers perceived the NumberShire intervention as being aligned with important skill objectives and found the features of the intervention useful. Preliminary results suggest NumberShire may support student achievement for second grade students working to demonstrate proficiency with whole number concepts aligned with the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSO 2010). Tables are appended.

AB  - Interviewed the parents and teachers of 60 5–15 yr old disabled students to determine (a) whether the home or school first suspected the problem, (b) the age of the child at that time, (c) the first impressions of the problem as reported by both home and school, (d) the nature of any communication between home and school, and (e) the age of the child at the time of application for a psychoeducational evaluation. Among results it was found that (1) there was no significant difference between the number of parents and the number of teachers who were first to note a problem, (2) problems first observed by parents were likely to be observed at an earlier age, and (3) the delay between observation and application for evaluation was significantly greater for children whose difficulties were first observed in the home than for children whose teachers noted a problem. It is suggested that professionals who work with parents should stress the importance of early identification and intervention to minimize the effects of learning disabilities.

AB  - Child care research is traditionally interested in the effects of the child care experience on child development. This article examines a different question: Who shapes state child care policy in the United States? The study, based on 49 states, shows that contrary to expectations, women’s political representation, governor’s party affiliation, and state wealth are not related to regulatory requirements for higher standards of care. The results, however, indicate a negative association between the size of ethnic minority groups and two of the standards of care indicators relating to number of staff. There is also some support for the influence of state opinion liberalism. If the findings are indeed robust, they represent important policy implications for the well-being of children.

AB  - Too few Americans are aware of the radical changes in kindergarten practice in the last ten to twenty years. Children now spend far more time being instructed and tested in literacy and math than they do learning through play and exploration, exercising their bodies, and using their imaginations. Many kindergartens use highly prescriptive curricula linked to standardized tests. An increasing number of teachers must follow scripts from which they may not deviate. Many children struggle to live up to academic standards that are developmentally inappropriate ... At the same time that we have increased academic pressure in children’s lives through inappropriate standards, we have managed to undermine their primary tool for dealing with stress—freely chosen, child-directed, intrinsically motivated play.

AB  - Förskolan i Sverige har blivit en del av skolväsendet och begrepp från skolans värld överförs till och ska gälla även för förskolan, däribland undervisning och utbildning. Undervisning definieras i skollagen som målstyrda och lärarledda processer. Vi vill med artikeln bidra till kunskapandet om hur undervisning i förskolan kan förstås. Med begreppen iscensättning och målrelationella- kontra målrationella lärandeprocesser analyserar vi delar av ett årslångt utforskande- och lekprojekt i en förskola. Baserat på analysen argumenterar vi för en målrelationell ansats för att tänka kring och arrangera för målstyrda processer i förskolan.

AB  - Studied the effects of situational settings and teacher intervention on interactions between normal children and mentally retarded children. Ss were 8 normal preschool-age children (aged 2 yrs 9 mo to 5 yrs 10 mo), 8 mentally retarded preschool-age children (aged 2 yrs 9 mo to 5 yrs 1 mo) with a mental age of 3 mo to 1 yr 4 mo, and their teachers. Eight pairs of normal/retarded children were matched based on daily interactions. Teachers' intentional interventions were aimed at producing interactions in which normal children, acting as tutors, taught retarded children how to act and play.

AB  - This First Look presents national and state level data on student enrollment by grade and by race/ethnicity within grade, the numbers of teachers and other education staff, and several student/staff ratios for the 2007-08 school year. It uses data from the State Nonfiscal Survey of Public Elementary/Secondary Education of the Common Core of Data (CCD) survey system. The CCD is an annual collection of data that are reported by state education agencies to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) through the U.S. Department of Education's EDFacts data collection system. Among the findings were that public elementary and secondary schools had 49.3 million students in membership in school year 2007-08. This was a decrease of less than 0.1 percent from student membership in school year 2006-07. Summing across grades, 34.3 million students were enrolled in pre-kindergarten through grade 8 and ungraded classes; 15.0 million students were enrolled in grades 9-12 in the 2007-08 school year. When examining students for whom race/ethnicity was reported in the 2007-08 school year, 55.8 percent were White, non-Hispanic; 21.1 percent were Hispanic; 17.0 percent were Black, non-Hispanic; 4.8 percent were Asian/Pacific Islander; and 1.2 percent were American Indian/Alaska Native (table 2). The percentage of students who were White, non-Hispanic decreased from 56.5 percent for White, non-Hispanic students in school year 2006-07. In school year 2007-08, public elementary and secondary schools and local education agencies employed a total of 6.2 million FTE staff. This was an increase of less than 1 percent from the number of FTE staff employed in school year 2006-07. Of the FTE staff in the 2007-08 school year, 51.1 percent were teachers, 15.3 percent were instructional aides, instructional coordinators and supervisors, guidance counselors, or librarians, and 23.1 percent were student and other support staff. About 3.5 percent were school or district administrators and 7.0 percent were administrative support staff. The student/teacher ratio in public schools in school year 2007-08 was 15.5 (i.e., there were about 16 students for every FTE teacher employed). The ratio ranged from a high of 23.7 in Utah to a low of 10.7 in Vermont. The elementary student/teacher ratio was 20.1, while the secondary student/teacher ratio was 11.9. The category of other instructional and student support includes instructional aides, instructional coordinators and supervisors, librarians, library support, and student support services staff. In the 2007-08 school year, there were about 43 students for every instructional and student support staff member. Appended to this report is (1) Methodology and Technical Notes; and (2) Common Core of Data Glossary. (Contains 4 tables and related data files.

AB  - This ethnographic study explores kindergarten children's emergent motivation to read and write, its relation to their developing concepts of reading and writing, and to their teachers instructional goals and classroom norms. Teachers and students together constructed legitimate literate activity in their classrooms, and this construction framed the motivation of students who were at risk for developing learning disabilities in reading and writing. Specifically, the kinds of reading and writing activity that were sanctioned in each class and the role of student-student collaboration colored students' views of the purposes of literacy and their own ability to learn. Findings extend our understanding of how young children's literacy motivation influences, and is influenced by, their classroom literacy culture. Implications for early literacy instruction for children with learning disabilities, and for their continuing motivation to read and write, are discussed.

AB  - Obtained parent and teacher reports of behavior and social competence for children who were survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). At followup, children were 5–18 yrs of age, 48 mo postdiagnosis, in 1st continuous remission, and off chemotherapy. Each child had been randomized to receive either 1,800 cGy whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) plus intrathecal methotrexate (IT MTX), or IT MTX alone as central nervous system prophylaxis, and 1 of 4 chemotherapy regimens that varied in treatment intensity. Scores on standardized measures (CBCL-P/T and PIC) were generally similar to instrument norms. Parents, but not teachers, reported heightened child somatic concerns. Results indicate minimal psychosocial morbidity among long-term survivors of ALL and suggest that the stressful life events associated with cancer and its treatment do not cause significant behavioral or emotional difficulties.

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine honor-related dilemmas that principals encounter in daily practice. Such dilemmas illustrate how special demands from parents can collide with the school's democratic mission.Design/methodology/approach –In total, 53 principals who participated in an in-service program, which aimed to enhance consciousness and knowledge concerning honor-related issues, were asked to describe their experiences of honor-related dilemmas. The paper uses the understanding of the honor culture as an analytic probe in studying and understanding the dilemmas and how these collide with the school's inner work in accordance with democratic values.Findings – The major findings illustrate that the participating principals have to deal with honor-related issues in their daily practice. The dilemmas include parents’ demands for restrictions affecting girls, young women, boys, and young men from preschool up to adult education. These restrictions limit their right to participate in all school subjects and activities and to live a life free of oppression.Practical implications – The paper reveals the importance of enhanced consciousness and knowledge concerning honor-related issues. Principals must have the ability to identify and recognize at-risk students and organize the necessary support for those students without stigma and exclusion. How the school's structure and culture support intercultural practice and inclusion is important to avoid a contribution to marginalization and a rejection of the school's value base.Originality/value – A number of research studies have been done regarding culture clashes in the multicultural school context. This paper identifies dilemmas that can be related to the honor culture and how these are expressed in the principal's office.

AB  - Which pedagogical support, methods and programs are applied in preschool for children in need of special support and grey zone children? The aim of this study was to investigate, identify and describe different ways of pedagogic support, methods and programs children in need of special support obtain in preschool today and if the support matches the individual child’s needs.In Sweden, most children spend time at preschools from an early age. About 76% of Swedish children in the age range 1-5 years spend several hours at preschool or in family child care every weekday. Also the majority of young children in need of special support spend several hours every weekday day in preschools. Thus, besides the family setting, preschools is the natural environment in which most early intervention services to children in need of special support are provided. Preschool includes both general early childhood education provided to all children and special interventions provided to children in need of special support (Björck-Åkesson &amp; Granlund, 2005). By law the preschool has a special responsibility for children in need of special support. The community should offer the child a placement in a preschool and to adapt the education to all children in the preschool. The number of children in need of special support has increased since 1999, and 55% of the communities in Sweden mean that the support to those children is not sufficient (Skolverket, 2004).The data collection in this study consists of interviews from 34 preschools teachers. The study consists of both qualitative and quantitative analyzes.The data suggest that pedagogical support include five categories related to direct and indirect support: attitudes, language support, physical support, child support and support in the environment. Six categories of methods were found, language, motor activities, more adult time, expression activities, professional and pedagogical programs.

AB  - This symposium is exploring how research and theoretical recourses reveal structures that constrain, enable or force changes in educational practices. In an uncertain time, when for example democratic values are at stake in Europe, schools democratic fulfilling, and the professionals’ possibilities to explore and change their practices are fundamental.In a number of different empirical studies, across different educational settings, from preschool to higher education in Sweden, we address two fundamental questions: What is happening in this educational practice? How can we understand it? The theory of practice architectures (Kemmis &amp; Grootenboer, 2008; Kemmis et.al, 2014) was applied to explore the educational practices and the conditions that enabled and constrained them in their sites. Practice is here understood open and changeable and are activities hanging together in time and space (Schatzki, 2002).According to the theory, practices are shaped and hold in place by three kinds of overlapping arrangements: Cultural-discursive arrangements such as how discourses and languages affect what is possible to sayin and about practice (e.g., deficit discourses, critical discourses, discipline-specific discourses, languages). Material-economic arrangements, how material, technological, financial, organisational, and other resources affect what it is possible to doin practice (e.g., buildings, schedules, workload calculators, funding). Social-political arrangements are arrangements that affect the ways in which it is possible for people to relateto others (and things and places) in practice (e.g., organisational rules, mandates, solidarities, hierarchies).In this symposium, we would like to first: present the theory and discuss it as a methodological, theoretical and analytical resource for professionals in educational settings (Nicolini, 2012), and second: discuss some of the results from the empirical cases, which highlight how practices in different ways can be understood from the lens of the theory of practice architectures e.g. how practices are hold in place from cultural-discursive, material-economic and social-political arrangements. How these arrangements enable and constrain practices at the site. And finally, the studies will show how the theory gives an understanding on how to be able to change practices, often in dialogue with teachers/leaders.ReferencesNicolini, D.

AB  - Background: Claims about what improves or harms our health are ubiquitous. People need to be able to assess the reliability of these claims. We aimed to evaluate an intervention designed to teach primary school children to assess claims about the effects of treatments (ie, any action intended to maintain or improve health). Methods: In this cluster-randomised controlled trial, we included primary schools in the central region of Uganda that taught year-5 children (aged 10–12 years). We excluded international schools, special needs schools for children with auditory and visual impairments, schools that had participated in user-testing and piloting of the resources, infant and nursery schools, adult education schools, and schools that were difficult for us to access in terms of travel time. We randomly allocated a representative sample of eligible schools to either an intervention or control group. Intervention schools received the Informed Health Choices primary school resources (textbooks, exercise books, and a teachers' guide). Teachers attended a 2 day introductory workshop and gave nine 80 min lessons during one school term. The lessons addressed 12 concepts essential to assessing claims about treatment effects and making informed health choices. We did not intervene in the control schools. The primary outcome, measured at the end of the school term, was the mean score on a test with two multiple-choice questions for each of the 12 concepts and the proportion of children with passing scores on the same test. This trial is registered with the Pan African Clinical Trial Registry, number PACTR201606001679337. Findings: Between April 11, 2016, and June 8, 2016, 2960 schools were assessed for eligibility; 2029 were eligible, and a random sample of 170 were invited to recruitment meetings. After recruitment meetings, 120 eligible schools consented and were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (n = 60, 76 teachers and 6383 children) or control group (n = 60, 67 teachers and 4430 children). The mean score in the multiple-choice test for the intervention schools was 62·4% (SD 18·8) compared with 43·1% (15·2) for the control schools (adjusted mean difference 20·0%, 95% CI 17·3–22·7; p < 0·00001). In the intervention schools, 3967 (69%) of 5753 children achieved a predetermined passing score (≥ 13 of 24 correct answers) compared with 1186 (27%) of 4430 children in the control schools (adjusted difference 50%, 95% CI 44–55). The intervention was effective for children with different levels of reading skills, but was more effective for children with better reading skills. Interpretation: The use of the Informed Health Choices primary school learning resources, after an introductory workshop for the teachers, led to a large improvement in the ability of children to assess claims about the effects of treatments. The results show that it is possible to teach primary school children to think critically in schools with large student to teacher ratios and few resources. Future studies should address how to scale up use of the resources, long-term effects, including effects on actual health choices, transferability to other countries, and how to build on this programme with additional primary and secondary school learning resources.

AB  - Rational Emotive Behavior Theory and Therapy (REBT; A. Ellis, 1973) is a form of humanistic psychology that helps individuals live happier, more productive, more self-actualizing and more creative existences. Under what has been called Rational Emotive Education (REE), REBT has been applied in various educational settings. Having been successful in clinical settings and in reducing both undesirable student behavior and teachers' stress, additional innovative applications of REBT are now being explored and used. This paper describes the incorporation of REBT into yet another unexplored setting within REE: teacher education. Undergraduate Education majors, taking a psychological foundations course and prior to their Student Teaching Practicum, learned REBT principles and methodology and applied them in both learning and teaching contexts. The learning context included situations the Undergraduate Education majors encountered in their college lives. The teaching context included situations they encountered while participating in their preschool field placement. The application of REBT to both contexts allowed the Education majors to address their personal and professional development, including their effectiveness as teachers in training.

AB  - Presents results from the Lasting Benefits Study (LBS) which followed up on the pervasive effects of small classes on student achievement and development for primary-grade students in Tennessee's Student/Teacher Achievement Ratio (STAR) Project. Project STAR, a randomized, longitudinal, statewide experiment, demonstrated that students in small classes (with a teacher–student ratio of 15:1) had statistically significant and educationally significant advantages over students in other classes. Ss in STAR classes for at least the 3rd grade participated in LBS. Analyses used pupil test scores and behavioral indicators of school efforts. The 4th-grade analysis included 4,230 Ss and the 5th-grade analysis included 4,649 Ss. Results reveal that statistically significant achievement benefits from participation in small K–3 classes remained after Ss returned to regular-size 4th and 5th grade classes. These findings were consistent for all measures across all locations. In conclusion, the authors present Project Challenge which extends class-size results more widely as a policy initiative.

AB  - Viden fra forskningen skal gøres tilgængelig og anvendelig for alle, der træffer beslutninger om dagtilbud, uanset om du er lovgiver, kommunalbestyrelsesmedlem, embedsmand, institutionsleder eller pædagog i et dagtilbud. Meget taler for, at der er et behov for at indsamle og vurdere kvaliteten af det pædagogiske arbejde i dagtilbud. Det kan ske gennem forskningsbaserede og afprøvede vurderingsredskaber og metoder, som på sigt sætter det pædagogiske personale i stand til på egen hånd at dokumentere og vurdere kvaliteten i det pædagogiske tilbud. Samtidig skal redskaberne og metoderne tilvejebringe viden, der gør beslutningstagere på de forskellige politiske og administrative niveauer i stand til at træffe beslutninger på et kvalificeret grundlag. Pædagogisk kvalitet skal vurderes af fagets professionelle – og af forskningen – og formidles i en sådan form, at det kan kvalificere politiske beslutninger inden for området. Når pædagogisk kvalitet ikke er endegyldig, og når der ikke findes endegyldige mål for kvalitet i dagtilbuddene, kan det føre til, at vi accepterer en meget stor spredning og store forskelle i kvalitet på alle niveauer. Det taler for, at der bør være en række nationale standarder, som siger noget om, hvad betingelserne for god kvalitet er. På nuværende tidspunkt er der megen forskning, der viser, at normeringer, antal af uddannede pædagoger, pædagogernes faglige viden, systematik i arbejdet og deres tilgang til børnene, er vigtige forudsætninger for høj kvalitet. Men der er også forskning, der viser, at disse betingelser endnu ikke er til stede overalt – der er med andre ord stadig meget at tage fat på, før vi er i mål. Denne hvidbog er et bidrag til dette arbejde.

AB  - The first legislative control over early education services in Ireland came into place in 1996, in the form of the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations (Department of Health, 1996). The research hypothesis of this study was that the implementation of the Regulations would have had an impact on quality of early childhood care and education (ECCE) services in Ireland. The specific objectives of the study were: to examine a sample of pre-schools to investigate both structural and process aspects of quality; to examine the possible relationship between these elements of quality; and to interview both Supervisors of these pre-schools and a small sample of Pre-school Officers to investigate their attitudes towards the Regulations. It was acknowledged at the outset that related factors, such as increased level of investment and improved levels of training, may have affected quality of provision. The baseline data used for the purposes of this study were gathered in 1994/1995 during Phase II of the IEA2 Preprimary Project (IEA/PPP). This was a large cross-national study that investigated the quality of care and education that children from various countries received at four years of age. Full details of the Irish aspect of Phase II can be found in A Window on Early Education in Ireland: the First National Report of the IEA Preprimary Project (Hayes, O'Flaherty, & Kernan, 1997). Use of these data allowed comparison of both structural and process elements in ECCE provision before the implementation of the Regulations, and six years after their implementation in 2002. The methodology of the present study involved revisiting a subsample of the original IEA/PPP national sample, undertaking structured observations and administering questionnaires to teachers and supervisors. A number of key issues emerged from the research. First, improvements were found in the quality of the pre-school provision in the present study as compared with that of the original study, although it is not dear the extent to which these improvements relate directly to the Regulations. The results also suggest that the need for training is becoming more widely accepted in the sector in Ireland. As predicted, increased awareness of training for ECCE professionals, and increased levels of funding appear also to have had an effect on quality. A third issue emerging from this study was the changing role of the pre-school teacher. The findings of this study also provided information regarding the nature of the relationship between regulation and quality provision. Related to this was the interaction between structural and process variables in quality ECCE provision. Full details of the study can be found in O'Kane (2004a). This paper concentrates on how the findings relate to two of the themes identified: interaction between structural and process aspects of quality, and training.

AB  - 38 students in Scotland's day schools, aged 9–12 yrs, of normal intelligence, and with visible physical handicaps affecting movement, were compared with 38 nonhandicapped controls matched for age, sex, IQ, family composition, social class, and home environment. A modified version of L. Centers's and R. Centers's (1963) Social Discrimination test was administered. Results show that handicapped Ss were not as well accepted by their peers as were controls. The only characteristics that were positively related to social acceptability of the handicapped were certain components of emotional adjustment, extraversion, and teachers' estimates of their mathematical ability. It is suggested that peer acceptance might be enhanced by greater dissemination of information and advice to both teachers and the normal peer group.

AB  - Prior research documented a number of factors pertaining to employees or to organisational cultures that can prevent employees from accessing employer-driven work–life policies (WLP). Our study focuses on factors originating in the jobs themselves. We conducted 98 in-depth employee interviews in two multinational companies based in Europe and led feedback sessions with human resources executives. Three mechanisms explained the observed stratification of access to WLP across jobs: (1) the intra-organisational digital divide prevented ‘less digital’ employees from collecting information about WLP on the intranet and thus impaired awareness of the policies; (2) the divide in worksite size prevented employees on smaller worksites from accessing childcare centres, sports or health facilities and (3) the divide in job types restricted access to WLP for specific occupations. The stratification of access to WLP was not strategically driven by human resources; rather the divides were largely unintentional. Our study uncovers inequalities of access originating in the jobs themselves and provides a theoretical integration of the various sets of factors that may promote or hinder employee awareness of WLP. Our findings suggest that organisations should strive to identify these inequalities and to provide ways to cope for these, for instance by offering other forms of support.

AB  - Early childhood programs strive to provide good-quality care and education as young children develop their physical, emotional, social, and intellectual skills. In order to provide children with positive, developmentally appropriate learning opportunities, educators ensure the safety and security of children, indoors and outdoors. The outdoor learning environment is an important element of the total care and education of young children. Outdoor spaces can enhance curriculum, especially when teachers responsibly supervise children who are engaged in unstructured play. Supervision is far more than just assuring sufficient teacher/child ratios. This article explores supervision practices that deal with two primary issues: (1) preparation of the outdoor learning environment; and (2) watchful guidance of young children by educators.

AB  - Early Childhood Education (ECE) is the education given in educational institutions to children prior to entering the primary schools. Recently, there have been heightening concerns raised by stakeholders concerning the quality of education in Early Childhood Development and Education (ECDE). This paper assesses the level of implementation of ECE in Chanchaga local government area, a local government in one of the north-central states in Nigeria. The sample size was 32 teachers, selected from 10 schools (out of 31 in the local government area). Questionnaire, interviews, and observations were used as research instruments. The study found out that while the enrolment level is high and, appreciably, there are teachers who specialize in ECE, basic teaching/learning and other basic resources are sparsely available, and most of the ECE centers are overpopulated. Employment of more ECE specialist teachers, training/retraining of caregivers/teachers, and provision of necessary resources would go a long way to actualize effective implementation in the local government.

AB  - Learning through picture books is a method which is widely used in preschools to teach mathematics. However, the research findings on the benefits of using picture books in learning mathematics remain inconclusive. This study aimed to i) investigate the effects of a picture book entitled "What Are the Numbers?" (a picture book made up flora and fauna in Borneo) on early mathematics achievement (reading and writing numerals up to 20) and ii) to get feedback on how appropriate the use of "what are the numbers" from teachers and parents. The book consists elements of critical thinking, communication, collaboration and creative thinking. The effects were measured by comparing the change in early mathematical ability of children in reading and writing numerals up to 20 by using the Rasch measurement model. The mean of the pre-test achievement was -1.99 logits and the mean of the post-test achievement was 1.75 logits which shows a difference of 3.74 logits. The effect size of the difference between the post-test and pre-test achievement was 1.4, which is considered large. Teachers and parents gave positive feedback on the use of the picture book. They commented that the picture book is able to attract children's attention, enhance their thinking skills and nurture creativity among children. In conclusion, the picture book based on the 4C approach enhanced early mathematics achievement of children.

AB  - Background: Evidence of treatment foster care (TFC) and group care's (GC) potential to prevent delinquency and crime has been developing. Objectives: We clarified the state of comparative knowledge with a historical overview. Then we explored the hypothesis that smaller, probably better resourced group homes with smaller staff/resident ratios have greater impacts than larger homes with a meta-analytic update. Methods: Research literatures were searched to 2015. Five systematic reviews were selected that included seven independent studies that compared delinquency or crime outcomes among youths ages 10-18. A similar search augmented by author and bibliographic searches identified six additional studies with an updated meta-analysis. Discrete effects were analyzed with sample-weighted preventive fractions (PF) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: Compared with GC, TFC was estimated to prevent nearly half of delinquent or criminal acts over 1-3 years (PF = 0.56, 95% CI 0.50, 0.64). Two pooled study outcomes tentatively suggested that GC in homes with less than ten youths may prevent delinquency and crime better than TFC, p = 0.08. Study designs were non-equivalent or randomized trials that were typically too small to ensure controlled comparisons. Conclusions: These synthetic findings are best thought of as preliminary hypotheses. Confident knowledge will require their testing with large, perhaps multisite, controlled trials. Such a research agenda will undoubtedly be quite expensive, but it holds the promise of knowledge dividends that could prevention much suffering among youths, their families and society.

AB  - How children understand the psychology of a story (i.e., the intentions and experiences of its characters) is pivotal to comprehending its point. In this study we investigate empirically how 5-year-old children in a Japanese kindergarten manage mental state verbs and adjectives when collaboratively retelling a tale heard. The tale, an example of a kitsune trickster story about anthropomorphized foxes interacting with humans, contains a number of critical events concerning expected and actual discrepancy between intentions/expectations and outcomes of actions. The empirical data consist of collaboratively retold stories. These have been recorded and transcribed. Theoretically, the study is informed by a sociocultural perspective, emphasizing the appropriation of the intramental function of cultural tools (importantly, in this case, of mental state discourse) through intermental communication, such as joint storytelling. The findings show how the children make use of mental state verbs and adjectives denoting psychological (intellectual and emotional) processes when retelling the story as well as afterwards for rendering their impressions of the story.

AB  - De siste tiårene har det skjedd en omfattende profesjonalisering av barnevernets arbeid. Langt utover i forrige århundre ble det kommunale barnevernsarbeidet utført av barnevernsnemnda. Gjennom etableringen av sosialkontor i kommunene med lov om sosial omsorg av 1964 ble barnevernsarbeidet etter hvert overført fra barnevernsnemnda til sosialkontoret, og deretter til separate kommunale barneverntjenester. Det ble slutt på at «arkivet lå i en eske under formannens divan» (NOU 2000: 12 s. 366). En profesjonsutdanning har blitt en selvfølge for å arbeide i barneverntjenesten. Samtidig fortsetter diskusjonen om hva slags kompetanse de som arbeider i barnevernets førstelinje bør inneha, og hvordan denne best kan tilegnes. I barnevernfeltet er det mange ulike aktører. Hvordan de vurderer kompetansebehovet gir et uttrykk for hvilken kompetanse som er sentral. Målet med artikkelen er å formidle noen av disse aktørenes synspunkter og knytte dem til perspektiver på læring og tilegnelse av kompetanse.

AB  - A concept that lies at the heart of political rhetoric is that of ‘workfare’. The issue, however, is what types of arguments have been invoked to assert the value of the concept. During the 1960s and 1970s, extensive criticism emerged towards a working life that was said to hinder women’s emancipation; a working life that wasted resources and had a negative impact on the environment; a working life that sought material consumerism rather than quality of life. The demand for a work time reduction also received much support. In this article, we have studied the use of language that The Swedish Employers’ Confederation used when publicly formulating their stances on the work time issue in 1975. We have chosen to highlight the argument contained in a discussion pamphlet published by Swedish Employers’ Confederation, in a situation where the use of language was determined by the left-wing movement, and solidarity, international aid and daycare places were keywords, rather than growth and consumption. The arguments employed in the discussion pamphlet were based in the idea that non-work entails a lack of solidarity for social development. Those who desired a work time reduction were portrayed by Swedish Employers’ Confederation as environmental villains and opponents to the liberation of both oppressed women and the impoverished of the third world. Swedish Employers’ Confederation’s pamphlet can be regarded as an example on how capitalism may handle major criticism. By reversing the meaning of the core concepts of the criticism, opponents’ arguments were assimilated, which contributed to a new rationalization of the capitalism. One of the major contributions from our study to the research field is an improved understanding of how this process developed.

AB  - The In-service Training Department of the Ministry of National Education is responsible for the teachers' in-service training at the preschool, primary and secondary education levels in Turkey. Important developments in in-service training have occurred since 1960: the foundation of the In-service Training Department. In 2000, 4292 in-service training activities were held locally as well as centrally. A total of 213,444 teachers attended these activities. However, in a survey, it was found that although most of the teachers stated they needed professional development, only a small number of teachers attended in-service training programs willingly. Today, in spite of the developments, there are still some important problems to be solved and essential measures to be taken about the in-service training of teachers in Turkey. (Contains 1 note.)

AB  - Examined prospectively the impact of family transition on deviant development in a sample of 427 French-Canadian boys participating in a longitudinal study from kindergarten onwards. During the course of the study some boys experienced family transition. The boys were grouped by developmental period and number of marital transitions they experienced: divorced between ages 6-11; divorced between ages 12-15; remarried between ages 6-11; and remarried between ages 12-15. From ages 11-15 the author's assessed boys' delinquency and their family processes (parental supervision, punishment, and communication) annually. The results suggest that boys who experienced remarriage between ages 12-15 are at greater risk for delinquency. In particular, they showed evidence of comparatively more theft and fighting at earlier ages than their peers from families that had remained intact. At similar points in development, they perceived less expressive parent-child relationships. Finally, these boys also perceived less monitoring by their parents, both overall and at different points in adolescence.

AB  - Swedish preschools and schools are welfare institutions required to achieve and demonstrate high quality. The teachers’ extensive responsibility for quality development and evaluation is stated in the national curriculums. Many studies have contributed with quality definitions and suggestions on how quality can be achieved and measured. This paper discusses how discourse analysis can contribute to the studies of quality and quality work in school. Short extracts of data from the on-going project Quality work in Swedish pre-school are used in order to give an insight in the method’s potential and limitations. Our methodological framework is inspired by Foucault’s theories of discourse and knowledge relations, in which discourses are regarded as more or less systematic statements about how we should think about the world. According to Foucault discourses shape and created meaning systems which may gain the status of 'truth', and hereby dominate how we define and organize ourselves and our social world. Some discourses can constrain and dissent the production of knowledge, while others may enable 'new' knowledge. Discourses lead to mechanisms that control us, by construing some manners of speaking [or writing] and behaving as appropriate, true and good, while others are construed as inappropriate, untrue and undesired. Consequently the study of discourses is closely related to the study of power relations, focusing on how these relations are operating in the spoken [or written] words. The questions that arise within this framework are e.g. How do some discourses maintain their authority? Why do some 'voices' get heard whilst others are silenced? Who benefits and who does not? Critical discourse analysis is a method used to study discourses and their relations to sociocultural practices, which allows for a critical perspective on the society. Critical discourse analysis is especially suitable for studies of texts such as steering documents, interview transcripts etc. The analyses focus on how discourses express themselves, e.g. in teachers’ statements about quality. The method provides a number of analytical tools such as: Normalization [What is expressed as a ’truth’? What does this ‘truth’ encompass?]; Pronouns used [Who are made responsible?]; and Modality [How forceful are the statements?]The short extracts from our analyses demonstrate how language contributes to create, consolidate and sometimes change the perceptions of quality in socio-political institutions such as the Swedish municipal preschool. We exemplify how power relations coexist or concur within this discourse, and illustrate the discursive shift which seems to have occurred.Conclusively, discourse analysis neither describe quality nor prescribe how it can be achieved. It contributes to our knowledge about the ‘truths’ and power relations that are embedded in the spoken and written ‘talk’ about quality. This knowledge is not merely of academic interest. It can also prove useful for teachers trying to understand and relate to the circumstances under which they are expected to create and evaluate quality in a school setting.

In general, more staff in the unit was associated with a larger proportion of educational activities and a smaller proportion of basic care activities.

AB  - Bilingual preschool education is under researched compared with bilingual school education. There is also a lack of research on bilingual preschool teachers’ agency and how they negotiate between two languages in the classroom. We examined the language practices of five bilingual preschool teachers working within three different sociolinguistic settings, in Finland (Finnish–Swedish and Russian–Finnish contexts) and Israel (an Arabic–Hebrew context) and interviewed the teachers about their use of languages in the classroom. We found that in each context the teachers reported modifications to an initial bilingual education model over time: from a strict separation of languages, to flexible bilingual practices. A thematic analysis of the contents of the teacher reflections as they emerged through interviews revealed five shared categories: (a) the flexible use of two languages; (b) responsible code-switching; (c) contextual and linguistic supports; (d) adjustments for individual children; and (e) role-modelling. Despite the different settings and socio-linguistic conditions, the similarities in teachers’ practices and the rationale they gave for applying flexible bilingual practices were significant. The shared practices across contexts may have important implications for bilingual education. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

AB  - L�rlingsutbildningen v�cker allt st�rre intresse b�de i Sverige och i andra europeiska l�nder. I boken fokuseras svenska erfarenheter och initiativ p� l�rlingsutbildningsomr�det mot bakgrund av forskning p� omr�det och erfarenheter av l�rlingsutbildning i Danmark, Norge, Nederl�nderna, England och Tyskland. Boken utg�r fr�n f�ljande huvudfr�ga: vilka �r f�ruts�ttningar f�r att etablera en omfattande l�rlingsutbildning i Sverige? Erfarenheterna fr�n l�rlingsl�nderna visar att det ofta kr�vs l�ngtg�ende regleringar f�r att skapa f�ruts�ttningar f�r samverkan och f�r att reducera de risker som annars h�mmar enskilda f�retags beredskap att rekrytera och utbilda l�rlingar. F�r att st�rka de institutionella f�ruts�ttningarna f�r l�rlingsutbildning i Sverige borde mer av parts- och branschsamverkan uppmuntras. De nationella programr�den b�r f� beslutande funktioner n�r det g�ller programmens �mnesplaner och kurser. Olika parter b�r ha ett gemensamt ansvar f�r att lyfta yrkesutbildning som positivt och utvecklande, inte bara f�r n�ringslivet utan f�r individen och det demokratiska samh�llssystemet. Ska intresset f�r utbildningen �ka, f�ruts�tts effektivare insatser i form av studie- och yrkesv�gledning i grundskolan. Ett nytt �mne b�r introduceras f�r grundskolans elever i �rskurs �tta och nio: arbetslivskunskap. Boken avslutas med ett f�rslag att inf�ra en utbildningsgaranti f�r att erbjuda utbildningsm�jligheter f�r arbetsl�sa unga utan relevant yrkesutbildning och f�r ungdomar som inte har lyckats fullborda en grundskole- eller gymnasieutbildning.

AB  - This paper considers perceptions of children's learning and classroom practice to support learning in the Pakistani early years educational context. In Pakistan, there is a growing focus on quality provision of early childhood education and building early childhood education teacher capacity. Over the course of one academic year, data were collected from kindergarten teachers in a Pakistani urban school through interviews and classroom observations as part of a larger study. Findings presented in this paper are based on the interview data of two teachers in the sample, a novice and an experienced teacher. Data analysis examined their perceptions of kindergarten children's learning and of their practice to support kindergarten children's learning, taking into consideration the gender perspective. The results showed tensions in the teachers' perceptions which contrasted between a constructivist approach and a teacher-directed skills approach. Perceptions of their practice reflected a formal, teacher-directed approach rather than a constructivist approach and a teacher-directed skills approach to teaching. Several factors, including deep-rooted perceptions as well as curriculum structure, time, number of staff and resources, contributed to this.

AB  - Purpose: While adult daycare (ADC) is considered a culturally acceptable model of long-term care in countries with a tradition of family-oriented caregiving, Korea is struggling as soaring needs for ADC outpace qualified staff and regulatory systems. This study aimed to describe Korean daycare nurses’ perceptions of key daycare services and their working experiences with stroke patients and their families. Design: A mixed-method design was used. First, we conducted a cross sectional descriptive survey to assess Korean nurses’ perceptions about the importance of daycare services. Then focus group interviews were performed to explore the nurses’ experiences at ADC. Methods: Seventy of a total of 96 nurses at ADC that specialized in the care of stroke patients responded to the survey (response rate 72.9%) and rated the importance of 11 key daycare service items on a visual analogue scale (0–10). Using a purposive sampling design, 16 eligible nurses were interviewed as a group. The qualitative data from focus group interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis to classify common themes into larger categories. Findings: Survey data revealed that the nurses perceived “skilled nursing services,” “functional recovery,” and “general health counseling” as the most important daycare service areas. Focus group data resulted in five themes: “Providing the same, standard care,” “Lack of partnership with family caregivers,” “Conflict with other staff: ambiguity of the roles and tasks,” “Lack of proper education and training,” and “Need for quality control and monitoring.” Conclusions: Daycare nurses fully recognized the importance of direct nursing care services that are keys to adequate recovery and rehabilitation of older patients with stroke. However, they experienced substantial barriers to carrying out these services due to role confusion, insufficient number of qualified nursing staff, and lack of partnership with family caregivers. Clinical Relevance: The results provide insight into changing healthcare policy to support daycare nurses in a country with limited resources and regulations. Strategies such as better quality control and monitoring of daycare services, provision of continuing education, and prioritizing key services should be considered as a way to address challenges experienced by daycare nurses.

AB  - The purpose of this research was to examine the impact of the Maryland School Performance Assessment Program (MSPAP) and the Maryland Learning Outcomes (MLOs) in a number of areas including teacher, principal, and student beliefs, classroom practices, and student learning in reading and writing. A statewide sample of 90 elementary and middle schools in Maryland participated in the study. Questionnaires were administered to principals, teachers, and students. Additionally, classroom instruction and assessment materials were collected from teachers, and student performance on MSPAP over 5 years was obtained. Results indicated that principals and teachers tended to be supportive of MSPAP, reading and writing classroom practices were somewhat aligned with the goals of MSPAP, and greater performance gains in reading and writing tended to occur in schools that reported increased use of reform-oriented instruction. The methodology and interpretive outcomes in the study contribute to the growing literature base on the effects of high stakes testing.

AB  - Background: No specific psychotherapy for adult anorexia nervosa (AN) has shown superior effect. Maintenance factors in AN (over-evaluation of control over eating, weight and shape) were addressed via Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). The study aimed to compare 19 sessions of ACT with treatment as usual (TAU), after 9 to 12 weeks of daycare, regarding recovery and risk of relapse up to five years. Methods: Patients with a full, sub-threshold or partial AN diagnosis from an adult eating disorder unit at a hospital were randomized to ACT (n = 24) and TAU (n = 19). The staff at the hospital, as well as the participants, were unaware of the allocation until the last week of daycare. Primary outcome measures were body mass index (BMI) and specific eating psychopathology. Analyses included mixed model repeated measures and odds ratios. Results: Groups did not differ regarding recovery and relapse using a metric of BMI and the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q). There were only significant time effects. However, odds ratio indicated that ACT participants were more likely to reach good outcome. The study was underpowered due to unexpected low inflow of patients and high attrition. Conclusion: Longer treatment, more focus on established perpetuating factors and weight restoration integrated with ACT might improve outcome. Potential pitfalls regarding future trials on AN are discussed. Trial registration number ISRCTN 12106530. Retrospectively registered 08/06/2016.

AB  - Examined a means of evaluating and increasing leisure choices within a senior day program for older adults with severe disabilities. An observation system was developed to measure the frequency and content of leisure choice opportunities including the manner in which each of 3 participants with profound mental retardation (aged 50–68 yrs) made choices. The process initially involved training staff to provide choice opportunities in accordance with participants' choice-making skills. Following training, 7 staff members (aged 19–53 yrs) received spoken and written feedback regarding the number and type of choice opportunities provided by staff and the number of choices made by participants. The choice provision program was accompanied by an increase in the number, and to a lessor degree the diversity, of choice opportunities provided by staff including an increase in the number of choices made by each participant. Results suggest that the increase in choices made by 2 participants was not only due to an increase in choice opportunity but also potentially to an improvement in choice-making skill.

AB  - Purpose of review: We review recent evidence regarding risk factors for childhood posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and treatment outcome studies from 2010 to 2012 including dissemination studies, early intervention studies and studies involving preschool children.Recent findings: Recent large-scale epidemiological surveys confirm that PTSD occurs in a minority of children and young people exposed to trauma. Detailed follow-up studies of trauma-exposed young people have investigated factors that distinguish those who develop a chronic PTSD from those who do not, with recent studies highlighting the importance of cognitive (thoughts, beliefs and memories) and social factors. Such findings are informative in developing treatments for young people with PTSD. Recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) confirm that trauma-focused cognitive behaviour therapy (TF-CBT) is a highly efficacious treatment for PTSD, although questions remain about effective treatment components. A small number of dissemination studies indicate that TF-CBT can be effective when delivered in school and community settings. One recent RCT shows that TF-CBT is feasible and highly beneficial for very young preschool children. Studies of early intervention show mixed findings. Summary: Various forms of theory-based TF-CBT are highly effective in the treatment of children and adolescents with PTSD. Further work is needed to replicate and extend initial promising outcomes of TF-CBT for very young children. Dissemination studies and early intervention studies show mixed findings and further work is needed.

AB  - Discusses techniques believed to be effective with both internalized overcontrolled and externalized undercontrolled victims of child abuse in a group setting with normal children. Techniques are described for use in facilitating communication, defining appropriate behavior, stimulating language, and encouraging skill development (i.e., social, emotional, motor, cognitive skills). Appropriate staff training, support, and child–staff ratio are also addressed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The psychometric properties of the revised Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale (ECERS-R) were examined using 202 Colorado child care centers. A factor analysis revealed that the ECERS-R does not measure seven distinct aspects of quality, as asserted by the developers of the ECERS-R, but instead measures one global aspect of quality. This suggests high redundancy among the 43 items in the ECERS-R. We selected subgroups of items randomly, by identifying easy-to-administer items, and by having practitioners select items they deemed to be especially important to child-care provider quality. Comparison of scores on these different subgroups of items to the overall ECERS-R scores revealed that the subgroups provided highly similar measures of quality. Relationships between scores based on each of the subgroups of items and the overall ECERS-R scores to staff credentials and staff-to-child ratios were comparable. Results suggest that much smaller subgroups of items provide information that is very similar to information generated by administering the full ECERS-R. Findings are interpreted in light of growing use of the ECERS-R in high-stakes settings.

AB  - Research Findings: The amount and quality of communication between staff and guardians in child care centers was examined using extensive naturalistic observations. Interactions between staff and more than 1,000 guardians who dropped their child off at their child care center were captured through a series of 20-s time-sampled observations. Structural quality indicators (ratios, staff education, etc.) were used to predict communication. Associations between staff–guardian communication and other aspects of quality were also examined. Results: Guardians spent an average of 63 s in their child's classroom during morning drop-off. Communication between staff and parents was limited, with staff providing child-related information to or soliciting it from approximately 15% of guardians. Out of several structural quality indicators, only greater professional development hours among staff in a classroom increased the likelihood of staff providing guardians with information about the program. Drop-off communication between staff and guardians and between staff and children was somewhat related to other measures of process quality. Practice or Policy: Results are discussed in terms of the importance of connecting families and centers, implications for rating center quality, and the accuracy of the drop-off period as parents’ lens into the quality of their child's classroom.

AB  - Child-staff ratios are a key quality indicator in early childhood education and care (ECEC) programs. Better ratios are believed to improve child outcomes by increasing opportunities for individual interactions and educational instruction from staff. The purpose of this systematic review, and where possible, meta-analysis, was to evaluate the association between child-staff ratios in preschool ECEC programs and children's outcomes. Searches of Medline, PsycINFO, ERIC, websites of large datasets and reference sections of all retrieved articles were conducted up to July 3, 2015. Cross-sectional or longitudinal studies that evaluated the relationship between child-staff ratios in ECEC classrooms serving preschool aged children and child outcomes were independently identified by two reviewers. Data were independently extracted from included studies by two raters and differences between raters were resolved by consensus. Searches revealed 29 eligible studies (31 samples). Child-staff ratios ranged from 5 to 14.5 preschool-aged children per adult with a mean of 8.65. All 29 studies were included in the systematic review. However, the only meta-analysis that could be conducted was based on three studies that explored associations between ratios and children's receptive language. Results of this meta-analysis were not significant. Results of the qualitative systematic review revealed few significant relationships between child-staff ratios and child outcomes construed broadly. Thus, the available literature reveal few, if any, relationships between child-staff ratios in preschool ECEC programs and children's developmental outcomes. Substantial heterogeneity in the assessment of ratios, outcomes measured, and statistics used to capture associations limited quantitative synthesis. Other methodological limitations of the research integrated in this synthesis are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

AB  - Early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI) may result in improved cognitive, adaptive and social functioning and reductions in autism severity and behavioral problems in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). For a subset of children, normal functioning may be the result. However, due to the intensity (20–40 h per week for 3 years with a low child staff ratio) implementation costs are high and can be controversial. Estimated costs for education, (supported) work and (sheltered) living for individuals with ASD in the Netherlands are applied in a cost-offset model. A compelling argument for the provision of EIBI is long term savings which are approximately €1,103,067 from age 3 to 65 years per individual with ASD. Extending these costs to the whole Dutch ASD population, cost savings of €109.2–€182 billion have been estimated, excluding costs associated with inflation.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the current state of pre-kindergarten classrooms in the state of Indiana through the perspectives of public and private pre-kindergarten program directors. Survey results revealed a high concentration of female pre-kindergarten directors within the state of Indiana. Although directors rated their teaching staffs with a high level of early education background, they themselves felt less confident about their backgrounds in this field. Descriptive data also revealed that private student-teacher ratios are smaller, their instructional days are longer, their programs have been established for longer periods of time, and their directors have had longer tenures than their public counterparts. Statistical testing found that directors of public urban schools reported a higher quality rating than suburban and rural pre-kindergarten programs, based on the quality composite score. It was determined that student-teacher ratio and school type ("public, private") both served as significant predictors of the quality composite score. It was revealed that as student-teacher ratio increases, the perceived pre-kindergarten quality decreases. Results also showed that pre-kindergarten directors' perceived quality is less within the private setting than in the public setting, based on the composite quality score. The overarching purpose of this study was to provide an awareness of the potential benefits that "quality" pre-kindergarten programming could yield for the future citizens of Indiana as a whole and if perceived quality exists to some degree.

AB  - Examined the relationship between preschool children's development and the quality of child care, group size, adult-child ratio, caregiving style, and caregiver child interactions in child care centers in Athens, Greece. Found that development could be predicted by the overall quality of the child care center, with smaller effect from group size. Lower quality centers were associated with higher adult-child ratios and more controlling attitudes among caregivers. (JPB)

AB  - The authors examined which support characteristics are associated with the quality of life (QOL) of people with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities (PIMD). The authors invited parents and direct support staff of people with PIMD to adopt the perspective of their child or the person with PIMD for whom they care. Some 76 parents and direct support staff of people with PIMD were interviewed, and to obtain data, transcripts were analyzed in-depth. The respondents mentioned: (1) characteristics with regard to the structure of the setting (physical environment, staff ratio, staff turnover, group size, and group composition); (2) characteristics with regard to the internal organization of the support (partnership, teamwork, interdisciplinarity, and support planning); and (3) characteristics with regard to the support staff (experience, sensitive responsiveness, commitment and motivation, physical strength, knowledge and skills, and self-reflection). The respondents considered structural as well as operating features of the support setting to be important for the QOL of people with PIMD. The authors conclude that their main emphasis, however, was on the central role of direct support staff in supporting people with PIMD.

AB  - The study aims to describe variation in the expression of students’ mathematical ability and the various ways in which their mathematical aptitude is acknowledged and supported by their teachers, parents and peers in a Swedish context. Ability is defined as a complex of various abilities each of which may be more or less pronounced in a given individual. The study is based on ten case studies of highly able students (ages 6-19). Six of the studies are longitudinal, ranging from three to six years. In order to validate the results of the case studies, two survey studies were carried out involving 180 teachers (preschool to Grade 9 in Swedish compulsory school) and 284 mathematics developers from 229 Swedish municipalities. The survey studies raised questions concerning the teachers’ personal experience of identifying and supporting highly able students, the nature of their everyday teaching, and the support given to able students. The results show that mathematical abilities can take many different forms and there is great need for pedagogical support for this group of students. Since extra resources are rarely available for the benefit of nurturing talent and since there are, as yet, no Swedish national or local policy documents that specifically address the support of talent in students, teachers are on their own in figuring out how to best help able students develop mathematically. The study points to the importance of the social norms that influence the interaction between teacher and student(s): everyday social norms as well as socio-mathematical norms, i.e. norms specific to the subject of mathematics. The latter place considerable demands on the teachers’ mathematical knowledge and competence. The benefits of early interventions, of supportive teaching environments, and of providing the students with challenging tasks and questions are also discussed.

AB  - The topic of this article is how preschool teachers understand democracy and the significance of this for children's democratic participation in kindergarten. The data set consists of 15 interviews with 32 preschool teachers. The preschool teachers refer to three different ways of understanding democracy when they talk about how they work to facilitate children's contribution in developing a democratic practice. In the article, I argue that the reference to deliberative democracy represents a higher potential than the two others because it make it possible for children to get valuable experiences taking part in the kindergarten community. The aim of this study is to contribute to the discussions about what kind of conditions have to be present in order to strengthen the kindergarten as a democratic forum.

AB  - Examined effects on the quality of children's child-care environments of (1) the stringency of state child-care regulations, (2) voluntary compliance with proposed federal child-care standards, and (3) the legal auspice of the center. Quality of care was assessed in 227 child care centers in 5 metropolitan areas, using observational and interview data. Centers in states with more stringent child-care regulations tended to have better staff–child ratios, staff with more child-related training, and lower staff turnover rates. Similarly, centers that more fully complied with the ratio, group size, and training provisions of a set of proposed federal child-care standards had significantly lower staff turnover rates, more age-appropriate classroom activities, less harsh and more sensitive teachers, and more teachers with specialized training. For-profit centers offered children less optimal care. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Multicultural early childhood education is necessary in a culturally diverse country like Malaysia. Preschool teachers play an important role in implementing multicultural education in the classroom. This paper reports the findings of a self-report questionnaire involving 854 preschool teachers in Malaysia. The preschool teachers disclosed their current multicultural education practices as well as the challenges they encountered when implementing multicultural education. While the majority of teachers claimed that they implemented multicultural education, a closer examination revealed that most of them used the tourist or contribution approach which focuses on only the outward manifestations of a culture when dealing with multicultural education. The transformation or anti-bias approach was used by only a small number of teachers. The teachers identified some challenges in multicultural education implementation, such as lack of instructional resources and the lack of stakeholder support. Thus, it is important to ensure teachers develop more critical understandings of multicultural education through teacher education training and programs. Other efforts to help teachers overcome challenges in implementing multicultural education include producing and developing more instructional materials and learning aids, which are suitable for young children and appropriate for the local context. Preschool teachers also need stakeholders to give more support and to acknowledge the importance of implementing multicultural early childhood education.

AB  - Information was obtained from a large national sample of 3,595 public school kindergarten teachers on changes in classroom membership for the 1995–1996 school year. On average, 26% of kindergarten classroom membership changed over the school year with frequency increasing as schools were more urban, in higher poverty districts, or with higher minority representation among students. School district policy allowing children to remain in the same classroom when they moved was related to slightly higher frequencies of new student enrollment and relatively higher class size. Teachers in classrooms with high turnover believed a high percentage of entering children had many adjustment problems, problems in communicating, following directions, academic skills, little formal preschool experience, and came from disorganized homes. These data provide teacher-reported national estimates for kindergarten classroom enrollments indicating substantial change over the course of the year and associated teacher beliefs.

AB  - Examined the relationship between the quality and teacher, school, classroom, and family characteristics and teacher-reported and observed child outcomes in kindergarten. The authors observed 223 public school kindergarten classrooms in 3 states to describe classroom activities and child-teacher interactions involving 1 child per classroom. Also observed was the global classroom quality and assessed its relation to teacher, school, classroom, and family characteristics and target child outcomes. Classrooms were observed once for 3 hrs. Time sampling of activities, teacher behaviors, and child behaviors as well as global ratings of teacher-target child interactions and the classroom environment were obtained. The most frequently observed forms of activity were structured teacher-directed activity and whole-group instruction. There was tremendous variation in the occurrence of these activities across classrooms. Global ratings of teachers' positive interactions with the target child, classroom, instructional climate, and classroom child-centered climate were lower when the concentration of poverty in the school was high, when the target child's family income was low, and when the number of staff available to work with the children in that classroom was low.

AB  - This study draws from the National Center for Early Development and Learning's Multi-State Pre-Kindergarten Study to examine the extent to which program, classroom, and teacher attributes of the program ecology predict observed quality and teacher-child interactions in a sample of 238 classrooms representing 6 states' pre-kindergarten programs. Quality was assessed observationally at the global level and for specific teaching practices. Quality was lower in classrooms with more than 60% of the children from homes below the poverty line, when teachers lacked formal training (or a degree) in early childhood education, and held less child-centered beliefs. Program and teacher attributes were statistically significant, albeit quite modest, predictors of observed quality. Location of the program in a school building, child:staff ratio, and length of day had no relation to quality. State-level factors not attributable to the teacher, program, and classroom factors examined accounted for the majority of explained variance in observed quality. Results suggest that the association between distal features of programs and teachers and quality in pre-kindergarten is more similar to elementary school settings than to child care settings and that quality appears most closely related to proximal teacher and child characteristics.

AB  - Background: Recent curriculum studies raise a number of questions concerning teachers' implementation fidelity, including the extent to which fidelity to multiple curriculum components is achieved and measured and the extent to which fidelity serves as a mechanism for impacting children's learning. Objective: Within the context of a language and literacy curriculum supplement designed for use at scale, we investigated (1) teachers' fidelity across the multiple dimensions identified in the literature (e.g., Dane and Schneider in "Clin Psychol Rev" 18(1):23-45, 1998) and interrelations among these dimensions and (2) associations between measures of fidelity and the language and literacy gains made by children. Method: We examined the fidelity of 74 preschool teachers implementing" Read It Again!". Multiple measures of adherence, exposure, quality of delivery, and participant responsiveness were collected across the year of implementation, and children's (n = 295) language and literacy gains were directly measured. Results: Descriptive statistics demonstrated generally high implementation fidelity across all dimensions. Correlational analyses showed few interrelations among fidelity measures and few associations with child gains. Conclusions: Findings suggest that teachers can exhibit fidelity to multi-componential language and literacy curricula designed for wide-scale use. Findings also support fidelity as a multidimensional construct and suggest that researchers utilize multiple measures to capture both within- and between-teacher variation in fidelity, while also pursuing additional studies to better understand the measurement and functioning of fidelity to inform future work.

AB  - Chronic illness may be a risk factor for low self‐esteem; however, previous meta‐analyses are inconclusive whether children with a chronic illness have lower self‐esteem than their healthy peers. The goal of the present study was to summarize available research in order to compare the self‐esteem of children and adolescents with a chronic illness with that of healthy children. Random‐effects meta‐analysis was used to integrate the results of 621 empirical studies that compare levels of self‐esteem of children with a chronic physical illness with healthy peers or general test norms. Studies were identified via the electronic databases Adolesc, Embase, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, PSNYDEX, PSYCINFO, and cross‐referencing. Children with chronic illnesses have lower self‐esteem than healthy peers or test norms ( g=−0.18 standard deviation units). The lowest levels of self‐esteem were observed in children with chronic fatigue syndrome and chronic headaches. Lower levels of self‐esteem in children with a chronic illness were found in girls than in boys, in adolescents than in children, in children from developing or threshold countries, when results were collected from observer ratings rather than child reports, in studies published in the 1990s, and when children with chronic illnesses were directly compared with healthy children instead of test norms. Paediatricians, parents, and teachers should promote experiences of success and positive peer‐relations, which are important sources of self‐esteem. In addition, psychosocial interventions for children with chronic illnesses should be offered for children with reduced self‐esteem.

AB  - To ensure reliable, accurate, and timely data capable of monitoring the progress of education in the United States, Congress has mandated that the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) produce an annual report, "The Condition of Education." This year's report presents 46 indicators of important developments and trends in U.S. education. These indicators focus on participation and persistence in education, student performance and other measures of achievement along with the environment for learning and resources for education. The indicators represent a consensus of professional judgment for which accurate data are available. In the 2009 the 46 indicators are organized in five main areas: (1) participation in education; (2) learner outcomes; (3) student effort and educational progress; (4) the contexts of elementary and secondary education; and (5) the contexts of postsecondary education. Five appendices are included: (1) Supplemental Tables; (2) Supplemental Notes; (3) Glossary; (4) Bibliography; and (5) Index. (Contains 82 figures and 103 tables.) [For "The Condition of Education, 2008," see ED501487. For "The Condition of Education 2009 in Brief," see ED505416.]

AB  - A study has shown that staff do not generally perceive challenging behaviour in people with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities (PIMD) as being of serious consequence. In this study we aimed to gain a better understanding of the causal explanations that direct care and support staff give for challenging behaviour in this group. The purpose of this study was twofold: (1) to determine the way staff attribute challenging behaviour in children and adults with PIMD; and (2) to analyse whether more experienced staff attribute challenging behaviour in children and adults with PIMD differently than less experienced staff. In total, 195 direct support staff and an equal number of children and adults with PIMD participated in the study. Direct support staff filled out the Challenging behaviour Attribution Scale (five causal explanatory models of challenging behaviour) to explain challenging behaviour in one individual that they supported. The results show that direct support staff as a whole report the biomedical model as the most plausible explanation for challenging behaviour in children and adults with PIMD. However, in the present study the mean scores on all models are low. This might indicate that a large number of staff found none of the models particularly useful as possible explanations of challenging behaviour in people with PIMD. This could mean that staff have difficulties stating the cause of challenging behaviour in this group. Another possible explanation could be that there is little scientific knowledge about causing and maintaining factors of challenging behaviour in people with PIMD. It could also mean that staff have additional explanations for challenging behaviour in this target group that are not mentioned in the instrument used. Future research should address these issues. No differences were found between more experienced and less experienced direct support staff. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

AB  - Observed 6 preschool classrooms in daycare centers serving 3-, 4-, and 5-yr-olds to determine how teachers evaluate young children's work. Results show that achievement standards and the need to cope with the success and failure they engendered were a pervasive feature of preschool classrooms. However, teachers did not usually discuss the standards in any detail. Analysis showed that variations in standard-setting events across classrooms were due more to the nature of the task (and to some extent the age of the child) than to teacher personality differences. It is suggested that teachers who give rationales for their evaluations help children develop a vocabulary of standard-setting. Acknowledging their own failures and areas of ability helps teachers to demonstrate standards to children. (7 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Examines the difficulties that emerge when a teacher tries to apply "normal" teaching strategies to meet the needs of autistic students. Case examples of 4 students (aged 4–16 yrs) are provided, and for each, issues arising and their implications for pedagogy are discussed. The kinds of learning that typify pupils with autism are distinct from those that fall within the nonautistic continuum inasmuch as they have origins in a pattern of development that deviates in fundamental ways from the normal. Without an appreciation of the nature of the learning difficulty involved, mainstream teachers may not only be at a loss in providing solutions but may also add to the pupils' difficulties. Psychologists need to increase their own understanding of those difficulties and the kinds of teaching strategies that can be used to overcome them.

AB  - In recent years the OECD has undertaken the evaluation of early childhood education and care (ECEC) on behalf of ministers of education in a number of countries in order to support quality improvement in this field. This article is based on a workshop for the national coordinators of early childhood policy in Sweden, 2003, which dealt with Curriculum and Pedagogy in Early Childhood Education. The five curricula presented were Reggio Emilia, Te Whãriki, Experiential Education, High/Scope and the Swedish National Curriculum for Preschool. The aim of this article is to compare these curricula, establishing similarities and differences discussing quality aspects and problematising the general and the cultural specifics of each curriculum per se and in relation to the others. A further aim is to raise awareness of curriculum questions in connection with children’s learning and development. The article is based on a pedagogical perspective of quality, which takes the perspective of the child and focuses on what is best for a child’s learning and development in a specific culture. The results of the analysis show that the five curricula are of high quality in relation to each country’s culture. High quality in preschool means giving the children a good start in life. The unique and competent child has rights of its own and should be treated with respect. In focus are the individual child’s opportunities for building up knowledge and expressing their understanding of the surrounding world. High quality is also related to the competent and professional teacher with theoretical and pedagogical knowledge.

AB  - Around 70% of consultants in Old Age Psychiatry currently have access to day hospital facilities. We have developed a Fast Track Day Hospital to provide rapid assessment and intensive management of behavior problems and have evaluated the outcome from attendance. We report results of the first 84 attendees, 21 men and 61 women. This preliminary report indicates clear benefit to carers and patients from clinical intervention in the fast track facility, with objective behavior rating, cognitive functioning and carer problems/stress all showing improvement. We believe the reasons for the fast track day unit's success are the targeting of interventions, good communication with referrers and carers, consistent high staff to patient ratios, and the provision of a suitable day unit environment.

AB  - The author of this article asks: What is readiness for kindergarten? How do we know when a child is ready? Unfortunately, as with many topics in education reform and improvement, policy makers ignore the complex questions about readiness and instead focus narrowly on select variables. The focus for kindergarten readiness is on select literacy and math skills (e.g., the child's ability to recognize letters, blend sounds, count objects, use quantity terms). What can be done about wanting children to be ready but not wanting to focus solely on narrowly defined child outcomes? First, Readiness needs to be defined as children living within ready families, going to ready schools, and participating within ready communities. Readiness for families means access to healthcare, options for housing, adequate nutrition, and quality childcare. Readiness for schools means involvement of families, inclusive classrooms, well-prepared and supported teachers, and manageable class sizes. Readiness for communities means economic stability and growth, safety, civic involvement, valuing of cultural differences, and coordinated social services. Second, parents, teachers, and policy makers need to understand that children's performance in one area of development (e.g., mathematics) is highly related to other areas (e.g., motor, language, social). Finally, the author offers, there are at least five things parents and early educators can do to promote a child's readiness and success: (1) Be consistent, (2) Be predictable, and be responsive, (3) Teach about empathy and support children's ability to exhibit self-control, (4) Capitalize on children's talents by using descriptive praise, encouraging children when they face challenges, and giving them feedback on what they are doing right, and (5) Talk to children often and meaningfully. Children are complex, and efforts should be directed to ensure families, schools, and communities are ready to address these complexities. As Kristie Pretti-Frontczak concludes "It is time to deliver quality education for all children and stop trying to make children "ready" for kindergarten."

AB  - Storybooks are the most frequently chosen genre for read alouds in preschool classrooms. However, growing evidence suggests that genre may influence the quantity and quality of talk produced outside of the text. The current study compared twenty preschool teachers’ extratextual talk across read-aloud sessions with a storybook and an information book. Results revealed that teachers used significantly greater numbers of extratextual utterances during the information book read-aloud compared to the storybook read-aloud after accounting for differences in duration. Teachers’ extratextual utterances also were coded for content, including behavior management, feedback, print and book conventions, and four levels of cognitive demand (with Levels 1 and 2 being concrete and Levels 3 and 4 being cognitively demanding). Rates did not differ across genre in the categories of behavior management, feedback, print, and Level 4; however, rates did differ significantly in the content categories of Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 on the continuum of cognitive demand, with the rates always being significantly higher in the information book read-aloud compared to the storybook. Teachers also reported less favorable perceptions toward reading information books aloud compared to reading storybooks aloud. This may be attributable to differences in how teachers read information books compared to storybooks. Teachers’ level of education and the age of the children in the classroom in some cases were related to the teachers’ talk during the read aloud.

AB  - As a part of its legislated mandate to report on the condition of American education, the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) has surveyed American private elementary and secondary schools several times over the past decade. The most recent survey, conducted in the fall of 1983, revealed that the past few years have been a period of growth for private elementary/secondary education, both with respect to numbers of schools and numbers of students. According to the revised figures 2 for 1980, private school enrollments at the prekindergarten through the 12th grade levels were 11.5 percent of the total enrollment at these levels. By 1983 this percentage had reached 12.6. Taking into account the revised data, the pattern of growth is consistent with data from earlier years. Private education is assuming an increasing share of the American educational effort at the elementary and secondary levels. A similar picture of recent growth characterizes the number and percentage of private schools. Revised 1980 figures estimated the number of private schools at 24,500 or about 22.2 percent of all elementary/secondary schools. By 1983 these figures had reached 27,700 schools and more than 24.6 percent. However, as individual schools, private schools tend to average only about half the enrollment size of their public sector counterparts. Previous NCES surveys of private education used lists of private schools supplied by the Council on American Private Education and the National Catholic Education Association, supplemented by State education agency and other organizational directories, as a basis for the survey universe of schools. However, there has been continued concern that such lists might not be comprehensive. In order to meet this concern, NCES employed a complex new methodology in designing its 1983 survey. In addition to sampling schools from a "list" universe comparable to those used in earlier surveys, NCES constructed an additional sampling frame based on a group of geographic areas selected from among Census units. In addition to providing the basis for a more accurate 1983 survey, the new methodology included provisions for retrospective revision of the previous (1980) survey data. By including a question in the survey as to whether or not the school had been in existence in 1980, it became possible to revise the 1980 survey results. The impact of the revisions is shown in the report along with a disaggregation of the data by religious affiliation. Historically, Catholic private education has accounted for the largest portion of the American private education effort. While this is still true, table 2 shows that by 1983 both "other affiliated" and "non-affiliated" segments of the private education enterprise had assumed considerably larger portions of private education activity.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to examine whether parent-reported short sleep duration and sleeping difficulties are related to behavioral symptoms among pre-school aged children. The study is a cross-sectional survey of 297 families with 5–6-year-old children. The Sleep Disturbance Scale for children was used to measure sleep duration and sleeping difficulties, and the Child Behavior Checklist and Teacher’s Report Form were used to measure attention problems, and internalizing and externalizing symptoms. In multivariate logistic regression models, short sleep duration was according to parental reports related to inattention (adjusted odds ratio 4.70, 95% CI 1.58–14.00), internalizing (adjusted odds ratio 3.84, 95% CI 1.32–11.21), and total psychiatric symptoms (adjusted odds ratio 3.53, 95% CI 1.23–10.17) while according to teacher’s reports it was almost significantly related to internalizing symptoms (adjusted odds ratio 4.20, 95% CI 0.86–20.51). Sleeping difficulties were strongly related to all subtypes of psychiatric symptoms according to parental reports (adjusted odds ratios ranging from 6.47 to 11.71) and to externalizing symptoms according to teachers’ reports (adjusted odds ratio 7.35, 95% CI 1.69–32.08). Both short sleep duration and sleeping difficulties are associated with children’s behavioral symptoms. Intervention studies are needed to study whether children’s behavioral symptoms can be reduced by lengthening sleep duration or improving sleep quality.

AB  - Examined the effects of 1 specific type of childcare regulation. No evidence was found that state and local regulations of child/staff ratios for preschoolers have any significant effect or relationship to the actual child/staff ratios experienced by preschoolers at childcare centers (i.e., regulation did not achieve its intended purpose). Thus regulations may not always be an effective substitute for direct intervention. In addition, regulations may have pervasive unexpected or spillover effects. An example of this is the effect on child/staff ratios at preschool centers of the regulation on the maximum number of children permitted in family child care homes. As the number of children family childcare providers are allowed to care for increases, the actual child/staff ratios experienced by 3–5 yr old children at childcare centers also increases. This type of spillover occurs because service providers, like other types of firms, react to changes in the situation of competing providers. Because spillovers are difficult to predict, it is important to consider the implications of pursuing social policy objectives through regulations. The results obtained through regulations may not be the ones anticipated by the policy makers who establish the regulations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Aims: Social workers report high levels of stress and have an increased risk for hospitalisation with mental diagnoses. However, it is not known whether the risk of work disability with mental diagnoses is higher among social workers compared with other human service professionals. We analysed trends in work disability (sickness absence and disability pension) with mental diagnoses and return to work (RTW) in 2005–2012 among social workers in Finland and Sweden, comparing with such trends in preschool teachers, special education teachers and psychologists. Methods: Records of work disability (>14 days) with mental diagnoses (ICD-10 codes F00–F99) from nationwide health registers were linked to two prospective cohort projects: the Finnish Public Sector study, years 2005–2011 and the Insurance Medicine All Sweden database, years 2005–2012. The Finnish sample comprised 4849 employees and the Swedish 119 219 employees covering four occupations: social workers (Finland 1155/Sweden 23 704), preschool teachers (2419/74 785), special education teachers (832/14 004) and psychologists (443/6726). The reference occupations were comparable regarding educational level. Risk of work disability was analysed with negative binomial regression and RTW with Cox proportional hazards. Results: Social workers in Finland and Sweden had a higher risk of work disability with mental diagnoses compared with preschool teachers and special education teachers (rate ratios (RR) 1.43–1.91), after adjustment for age and sex. In Sweden, but not in Finland, social workers also had higher work disability risk than psychologists (RR 1.52; 95% confidence interval 1.28–1.81). In Sweden, in the final model special education teachers had a 9% higher probability RTW than social workers. In Sweden, in the final model the risks for work disability with depression diagnoses and stress-related disorder diagnoses were similar to the risk with all mental diagnoses (RR 1.40–1.77), and the probability of RTW was 6% higher in preschool teachers after work disability with depression diagnoses and 9% higher in special education teachers after work disability with stress-related disorder diagnoses compared with social workers. Conclusion: Social workers appear to be at a greater risk of work disability with mental diagnoses compared with other human service professionals in Finland and Sweden. It remains to be studied whether the higher risk is due to selection of vulnerable employees to social work or the effect of work-related stress in social work. Further studies should focus on these mechanisms and the risk of work disability with mental diagnoses among human service professionals.

AB  - This study examined how well (i) structural measures which are monitored by the government such as the physical environment, Health/Safety, Staff qualifications and Staff-child ratios; and (ii) management-related measures such as administration/evaluation, and Staff-parent interactions predicted process quality of preschools in Hong Kong. Focusing on provision for 4-year-olds, 60 preschools, representative of the range of preschools in Hong Kong, were observed to determine process quality. Information about structural measures was obtained through interviews of principals/supervisors and complemented by observations. Results indicated significant intercorrelations among structural, management-related and process measures. There was considerable variability in process quality with higher process quality evident in preschools which exceeded government requirements for staff qualifications, space and equipment, and staff-child ratios. Structural and management-related measures significantly contributed to prediction of process quality and accounted for 27% of the variance in it. These findings have implications for increasing the stringency of regulatory requirements and training focusing on the management of preschools in Hong Kong.

AB  - Considers the effects of gender, teacher's specialization, class size, and the interaction between them on children's adjustment to kindergarten as measured by teachers using the Child at School Schedule. The sample consisted of 240 children in kindergarten classes attached to primary schools. Results show that boys were perceived to be less well adjusted to kindergarten than girls. Children under supervision of an unprofessional teacher were perceived to be less well adjusted to kindergarten than children under the supervision of a professional teacher. Children in large size classes were perceived to be less well adjusted to kindergarten than children in small size classes. Lastly, the interaction between teacher's proficiency and class size did have an effect on children's adjustment to kindergarten classes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - 'Norm Struggles' explores and challenges normativity in general and heteronormativity in particular. A common trait in all chapters is the focus on contradictions, changes, disruptions and uncertainties that follow with different norms and structuring forces. The authors discuss and explore how norms are produced, and reproduced but also disrupted, subverted and changed. The chapters are based on observations from different settings such as preschools, schools, universities, factories, social welfare, popular culture, passenger ships, and the fire service. They are also based on observations from different countries - Lithuania, Canada, USA, Sweden, Finland, and Great Britain. The book presents studies of media, policies, machines, organisations, academic sexual theory, and the ongoing constructions of nations and nationalities

AB  - The focus of this paper is to describe and discuss what resources toddlers' use to develop basic mathematical competence in a preschool setting. This development is described from the point of departure of the theory of variation and a Gibsonian view on perception, in terms of differences and similarities in a temporal sequence of situations where toddlers work with concrete materials such as building blocks of different kinds. The data consists of video documentations of children's everyday activities. We argue that we can see that the children have different ways of handling the tasks and situations at hand. The children can often discern where an object should be placed in relation to other objects according to relative size, orientation and rotation. When the task is changed, to a large extent the children has to "start from the beginning" often and has difficulties in generalising previous experiences, and previously used resources when working with other tasks.

AB  - The paper is based on a municipal project with focus on language development which led to a three year long cooperation between a Swedish municipality and Jönköping Universtiy. The target group is eleven municipal preschools, serving 573 children between one and five years of age and divided into 23 child units. Reading aloud and story telling are in focus and the preschools have answered a questionnaire with 15 questions with sub-items. Let's read a book is one out of a number of sub-studies conducted in order to develop and improve the systematic qualitly work in preschool.

AB  - Despite the long tradition in the social welfare field the number of children in Sweden who do not feel well has increased. This statement is based on reports from preschool teachers and includes young children (1-5 years old). The purpose of this chapter is to stress the present situation and what can be done to better work to raise healthy and secure children who also feel well. The aim is to discuss how the quality in preschool affects children’s wellbeing? Quality does not only mean happy children and satisfied parents but also competent staff with positive attitudes and systematic quality work. It appears from research that enough time for pedagogical planning and follow-up, small child groups, high teacher density and low staff turnover are also essential. The results also show that the most critical aspects for supporting children’s health and development are quality improvements based on equality, an efficient value system, a useful curriculum, scientifically based teacher training and a school/preschool for all.

AB  - Though quality in early childhood education and care has attracted last decades enormous research interest there is still not a unanimous agreement about its definition. Yet, almost all definitions attempted include interaction, group size, adult:child ratio and early childhood educators' level of education, as important indices of quality. Relationships are key resources for young children. There is agreement among researchers that the quality of caregiving by professional caregivers in child care centres has been established as an important influence on various aspects of child development. Thus, structural characteristics have been proven to affect programs' quality of services provided. The purpose of this research study was twofold: (1) to explore the quality of interaction between Greek early childhood educators and children; and (2) to record the structural characteristics of Greek child care centres. Correlations among structural characteristics and type of interaction were also examined. Research data indicate that Greek early childhood educators are positive but at the same time detached and permissive during their interaction with children, a finding that disputes their positive interaction. Thus, Greek child care centres have been found to adopt, based on Greek legislation, high ratios and group sizes, a finding which raises questions about the effects on children's well being and development. Limited correlations have been found between the type of interaction and the structural characteristics. Research data highlight the need for further research to undergone and for changes in Greek legislation, concerning the operation of Greek child care centres.

AB  - This study tested societal effects on caregiver/teacher ratings of behavioral/emotional problems for 10,521 preschoolers from 15 societies. Many societies had problem scale scores within a relatively narrow range, despite differences in language, culture, and other characteristics. The small age and gender effects were quite similar across societies. The rank orders of mean item ratings were similar across diverse societies. For 7,380 children from 13 societies, ratings were also obtained from a parent. In all 13 societies, mean Total Problems scores derived from parent ratings were significantly higher than mean Total Problems scores derived from caregiver/teacher ratings, although the size of the difference varied somewhat across societies. Mean cross-informant agreement for problem scale scores varied across societies. Societies were very similar with respect to which problem items, on average, received high versus low ratings from parents and caregivers/teachers. Within every society, cross-informant agreement for item ratings varied widely across children. In most respects, results were quite similar across 15 very diverse societies.

AB  - Conducted 2 investigations to ascertain teachers' expectations for the performance of the younger siblings of learning-disabled (LD) students. In Study 1, 18 regular education teachers were asked to make predictions about the performance of 27 kindergarten–5th-grade students they were currently teaching; these students had older siblings (either LD or normal) whom the teacher had previously taught. In Study 2, 16 teachers rated the expected performance of hypothetical younger siblings of 3rd-grade LD students they were currently teaching. Results of both investigations indicate that teachers held lower expectations for younger siblings of LD than non-LD students. Specific content areas in which lower performance was expected included reading level, general knowledge, visual/auditory perception, and memory skills. Results suggest not only that educators must be wary of the deleterious effects of the LD label on the student but also that they must be aware that this label may taint their expectations for, and therefore their behavior toward, siblings of that student.

AB  - Objectives: Many guidelines and regulations allow children and adolescents to be enrolled in research without the prospect of clinical benefit when it poses minimal risk. However, few systematic methods exist to determine when research risks are minimal. This situation has led to significant variation in minimal risk judgments, raising concern that some children are not being adequately protected. To address this concern, we describe a new method for implementing the widely endorsed "risks of daily life" standard for minimal risk. This standard defines research risks as minimal when they do not exceed the risks posed by daily life activities or routine examinations. Methods: This study employed a conceptual and normative analysis, and use of an illustrative example. Results: Different risks are composed of the same basic elements: Type, likelihood, and magnitude of harm. Hence, one can compare the risks of research and the risks of daily life by comparing the respective basic elements with each other. We use this insight to develop a systematic method, direct comparative analysis, for implementing the "risks of daily life" standard for minimal risk. The method offers a way of evaluating research procedures that pose the same types of risk as daily life activities, such as the risk of experiencing anxiety, stress, or other psychological harm. We thus illustrate how direct comparative analysis can be applied in practice by using it to evaluate whether the anxiety induced by a respiratory CO₂ challenge poses minimal or greater than minimal risks in children and adolescents. Conclusions: Direct comparative analysis is a systematic method for applying the "risks of daily life" standard for minimal risk to research procedures that pose the same types of risk as daily life activities. It thereby offers a method to protect children and adolescents in research, while ensuring that important studies are not blocked because of unwarranted concerns about research risks.

AB  - Using data from the Child Care Supplement to the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, we test associations between the quality of child care and state child care policies. These data, which include observations of child care and interviews with care providers and mothers for 777 children across 14 states, allow for comparisons across a broader range of policy regimes and care settings than earlier research on this topic. Using multilevel linear and logistic models, we found that more generous subsidy policies (that is, greater investment, higher income eligibility) were positively associated with the quality of care in nonprofit child care centers, as well as with the use of center care. The stringency of regulations (that is, teacher education requirements, teacher-child ratios/thresholds) was also associated with both quality and type of care, but in more complex ways. Higher teacher training requirements were positively associated with the quality of both family child care and nonprofit centers, while more stringent regulations decreased the number of children attending center care. No links were found between state policies and the quality of for-profit center care. The implications for policy makers, advocates, and policy analysts are discussed.

AB  - This article describes the frequency, characteristics, and predictors of father-school communication in preschool and kindergarten in a sample of children "at risk" for school failure based on family sociodemographic characteristics. Data were gathered during the implementation of the National Center for Early Development and Learning Transition to Kindergarten Intervention. Preschool and kindergarten teachers used family involvement logs to record the frequency and characteristics of family-school communication for 75 children. Family workers conducted interviews with family members asking questions about family process. In preschool, one-third of fathers had no contact with their child's teacher, a number that exceeded one-half in kindergarten. Father-school communication occurred at a rate of 10% of family-school communication with other caregivers. Most typically, fathers participated in school-initiated school visits lasting more than 10 minutes and discussing aspects of the child, not the family. Fathers' presence in the home was related to frequency of father-school communication in preschool, but not in kindergarten. These findings have implications for school psychologists as schools develop family involvement policies and practices in accordance with local and state policies and No Child Left Behind legislation.

AB  - This paper presents data obtained in a one-day census investigation in five European countries (Austria, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia). The census forms were filled in for 4191 psychiatric inpatients. Concerning legal status, 11.2% were hospitalised against their will (committed) and 21.4% were treated in a ward with locked doors. There was only a small correlation between commitment and treatment in a locked ward. More frequent than treatment of committed patients in locked wards was treatment of committed patients in open wards (Austria, Hungary) and treatment of voluntary patients in closed wards (Slovakia, Slovenia). Concerning employment, 27.7% of patients aged 18-60 held a job before admission. The vast majority of patients (84.8%) had a length of stay of less than 3 months. A comparison of these data with the results of a study performed in 1996 and using the same method shows a decrease of rates of long-stay patients. In 1996 the rates of employment were significantly higher in Romania (39.3%) and Slovakia (42.5%) compared to Austria (30.7%). These differences disappeared in 1999 due to decreasing rates of employment in Romania and Slovakia. The numbers of mental health personnel varies between types of institution (university or non-university) and countries, being highest in Austria and lowest in Romania. A considerable increase in the numbers of staff was found in Slovakia. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

AB  - For practitioners in the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) in English schools (ages 3-5), the ethos of learning by "investigating and doing" is a major component of the pleasure of teaching very young children. The "Knowledge and understanding of the world" area of the EYFS (where scientific learning is mainly anchored) places heavy emphasis on curiosity, questioning, exploration, and observation to build the basic skills and attitudes needed for later scientific learning. For many early years teachers, gardening is an effective and relevant context to develop these skills. Growing projects are big news because of their support for the healthy eating agenda, and they are indeed a brilliant way to teach children that vegetables do not just come from a supermarket. The author talked to a number of teachers about their belief in the value of gardening and how they put it into practice at their schools. In this article, she discusses why outdoor learning practitioners believe gardening is such an inspiring context for developing science.

AB  - Investigated rationales for selecting and implementing time out procedures when managing children's behavior. 20 direct care staff (aged 24–49 yrs) of a psychiatric hospital and 20 female undergraduate child development and child care students completed questionnaires. Time out from reinforcement with a rationale was evaluated as more acceptable than without a rationale by both staff and students. Staff rated the techniques as more acceptable than did students, particularly younger staff. Older students regarded the techniques more favorably than did younger students. Nondegree students viewed the techniques as less acceptable than did those with degrees. Knowledge of behavioral principles and age of the child had no effect on acceptability ratings.

AB  - In this article I report on the ways that an educational philosophies course in a performance-based program enables teacher candidates to identify, reflect upon, and evaluate a wide range of educational purposes. The context for the report is an accelerated graduate program in childhood education at a small urban college where intensive fieldwork is required every semester and applied learning is the norm. Using teacher candidates’ reactions to selected texts in the history of educational thought as evidence, I aim to show that an encounter with provocative foundational ideas can promote effective value-formation and reflective analysis of educational practice.

AB  - Compared the services provided to 12 clients (aged 20–49 yrs) with profound and multiple learning disabilities in a special care day center (SDC) and an integrated day center (IDC). Behavioral observations of each S, concentrating on levels of engagement and interaction, were recorded at 4 different times on different days. Observation categories included activity type, social actions, contact by staff/visitors, problem behavior, and the staff-to-client ratio. The main finding was that SDC Ss were more likely to be receiving contact from staff than were IDC Ss. In both the SDC and the IDC, neutral contact occurred more frequently than positive or negative contact. IDC Ss spent a greater proportion of time involved in leisure activities, but SDC Ss spent significantly more time carrying out personal care tasks. Levels of formal programming were very low at both the SDC and IDC. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This book addresses problems and challenges that face educational measurement at a time when multipurpose usage of observational data from educational assessments, tests and international surveys has become a growing global trend. While the construction of educational measures and use of educational data offer many opportunities, they also require awareness of the numerous threats to validity and methods of reducing such threats. Written by leading international scholars, the book demonstrates the complexity of educational measurement by addressing three broad and interrelated topics. The first part discusses cognitive abilities, including studies on fluid intelligence, its improvement and its links to aptitude tests for admission to higher education. The second part focuses on the effects of school and teacher-related factors on school outcomes at individual and group levels, and uses international studies to analyze causes. The third part presents analytical techniques and measurement methods to improve reliability, for example factor analysis using Bayesian estimators, bi-factor analysis, model misfit and solutions, and discusses balance issues in reporting test results. The book provides examples of state-of-the-art analytical techniques for pursuing fundamental research problems, and the latest advances in measurement methods, with a focus on validity improvement. Eminent researchers discuss and provide insights into questions such as: Is it possible to train individuals to think at a higher level than normal for their age? What determines prospective preschool teachers’ skill to perceive mathematics-related preschool situations? Can international indicator design and instruments be improved to use trends and national context variables more efficiently? Can indicator data at national, school and class levels be compared easier? Are value-added measures of teacher effectiveness valid when it comes to hiring and promoting teachers? Is money better spent on teacher training than on smaller class-size? How do theory and empirical statistical data intertwine in building structures of understanding? This book is inspired by the career and personal influence of the Swedish scholar Professor Jan-Eric Gustafsson, renowned for his research on individual differences, especially the structure of cognitive abilities, and on the effects of education on knowledge and skills.

AB  - In Sweden an increasing number of children enter school at the age of six rather than as before at the age of seven. There is an increasing need for cooperation between preschool teachers and school teachers. When these two professional groups meet, they use different professional vocabularies. The concept of teaching (Sw. 'undervisning' close to instruction) is not used by preschool teachers, while it is a central concept for school teachers. With this background the purpose of the investigation is to describe and interpret preschool teacher student's images about the concept of teaching in preschool.Three main questions were investigated:How do preschool teacher students discuss teaching in preschool context?What meaning (signification) do they put into the concept?Do the students change their ideas about preschool teaching during their training?The data collection was carried out from the autumn term of 1991 up to and including the autumn term of 1993 at the preschool teacher training at Högskolan Dalarna.Four groups of students were asked to have leader-less discussions about teaching. As a starting point they were provided with pre-constructed questions. Students' statements were analysed by means of Kansanen's model of three levels of thinking; action level, first thinking level and the second thinking level. In the results was shown that a part of the students changed their earlier ideas. As the project proceeded, two of the groups became able to see the difference between teaching and learning and also accounted for ideas about what preschool teaching might be. While talking about teaching the students created new concepts, they used terms like "forest teaching", "teaching play", "secure play" and "care lesson". The kind of teaching they talked about was called "child teaching".The results also brought forward three comprehensive images, of preschool teaching: Synonymity Images, Traditional School Images and Child Care Images. Synonymity implies that the students understand teaching as synonymous with the occurrence of learning. Traditional School Images imply that the students are of the opinion that the teacher is the one who is active and instructs the pupils what to do. Child Care Images imply an outlook on teaching that it must not be noticed, the child must not be influenced directly, but more indirectly by means of material and playing.The analysis indicates that some of the preschool teacher students have changed their images during the series of discussions about the same concept, from a more restricted to a more expanded and reflective outlook on teaching in preschool. Some students have changed their views, while others have not or only to a little extent. The rapidity of this process differs between students.It seems that the training played a minor part for the students' reflecting on teaching in preschool. The investigation shows among other things that the training does not expose them to challenges that make them develop their thinking and ideas on teaching and learning. It also seems that a conscious and reflective planning is an important prerequisite for seeing the daily teaching in a perspective and being able to reflect upon it. Nothing seems to indicate that the students during their trainee periods have analysed the relationship between teaching and on the other hand learning an the children's activities such as free play.The fact that students only to a limited extent carried out the discussions at the second thinking level indicates that pedagogical and other theories should be studied in the preschool teacher training so that these theories later may function as efficient and forceful tools in the work.

AB  - Aim: To establish an effective and feasible physical activity intervention programme for preschools. Methods: A multicomponent physical activity intervention programme with three components was developed for the preschool setting based on the psychomotor concept: daily structured physical education lessons for the children provided by the kindergarten teachers, physical activity homework for the child and his/her family, and parental education. The kindergarten teachers were invited to two workshops providing information on the background of the intervention and practical training for planning and organising the activity lessons. Regular supervision at the kindergartens was implemented. Results: A manual describing the background and the content of the intervention as well as practical examples for physical education lessons was made available to kindergarten teachers. Furthermore, 183 illustrated cards with about 400 exercises and games were generated to plan the physical education lessons. In addition to describing the exercise tasks, their main focus, and possible modifications, the cards summarised the requirements with respect to space, equipment, and staff. This collection of exercises and games suits the needs of preschools of different sizes, and equipment and staff resources. The focus of the given exercises was on fun and cooperation of the participating children while improving coordination skills, perception, and muscle strength, power and endurance abilities. The cards were organised according to the main focus of the exercise. Likewise, 52 homework cards were generated illustrating games and motor tasks for one participant, as well as for the whole family, and accounting for seasonal requirements. Finally, three seasonal homework cards with further activity games as well as educational material for the parents (focussing, e.g., on the importance of motor abilities and physical activity in preschool children, of healthy nutrition and reduction of media use in childhood) were provided. Conclusion: The programme will now be distributed to preschools in Germany and also—after translation and adjustment to the local requirements—established in Chile.

AB  - Despite the wide usage of Conners' 10-item Abbreviated Parent–Teacher Questionnaire (APTQ), normative data for parental ratings on the APTQ are rare. Moreover, its psychometric properties as a "stand alone" behavioral rating instrument have yet to be examined in detail. Using data from parental ratings for 6,841 children aged 5–14 yrs, this paper reports the psychometric properties of the APTQ and provides normative and prevalence estimates for 4 age cohorts (5– 6, 7– 8, 9–11, and 12–14 yrs) by gender. In presenting the findings, the paper highlights key methodological issues endemic to the design of behavioral rating inventories like the APTQ and the analysis of data derived from them. These issues are illustrated and discussed in terms of their implications for the measurement and determination of prevalence estimates of problem behaviors in child psychology and child psychiatry. The need to revise the design, content, and response formats of child behavior rating inventories is stressed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Research Findings: Continuity of care is a recommended practice in child care intended to promote secure and supportive relationships between infants and toddlers and their caregivers. Toddlers ( N = 115) between 12 and 24 months were observed in 30 continuity and 29 noncontinuity classrooms. The average duration of care for toddlers with caregivers was 14 months in the continuity rooms and 5 months in noncontinuity rooms. Toddlers observed in continuity rooms experienced higher levels of interactive involvement with their caregivers and were rated by their caregivers as having fewer problem behaviors compared with the toddlers in noncontinuity rooms. Toddlers in rooms with higher staff–child ratios also experienced more involved caregiving. We did not find evidence that the level of involved caregiving mediated the association between continuity of care and toddlers’ social competence or problem behaviors. Practice or Policy: Continuity of care may be a promising practice for programs that strive to provide high-quality care for infants and toddlers.

AB  - Background: Little is known about factors that influence home-based child care providers' participation in professional development. Factors that predict participation in activities that are designed to promote the utilization and maintenance of skills taught are of particular interest. Objective: Our aim was to examine factors in the home-based child care context that might influence participation in professional development, including demographic variables, working conditions, preintervention skills and training, perceptions of workshop usefulness, and interpersonal factors such as job-related stress and depressive symptoms. Methods: In this exploratory study, we examined predictors of participation among 67 home-based child care providers in Oregon, USA, who took part in the intervention group of a randomized efficacy study on a multiphase professional development program to promote preschoolers' positive social development. Results: Latent class analysis of participation resulted in three distinct groups: those who participated in the initial three workshops (WS), those who participated in workshops plus maintenance activities (consultation and a booster session, WS+), and those with little to no participation (NP). The NP group was too small to include in further analysis. A multivariate logistic regression model with child care provider education, number of preschool-age children enrolled in care, child-to-caregiver ratio, and self-reported stress included as predictors significantly improved classification in the WS+ group compared to the WS group. Conclusions: These findings offer a preliminary look at the unique factors influencing home-based child care providers' participation in extended professional development. Relevancy of content to child care providers' situations appears to be important.

AB  - Tests were made of 54 children in kindergarten, first and second grades by presenting them with two piles of blocks and asking which pile had the greater number of blocks. In a first experiment all of the blocks were of the same size and in a second experiment two sizes of blocks were employed. From an analysis of the results the author concludes "that the child's first concept of number is a manyness from which the quantity and serial aspects of number differentiate." This differentiation appears to be a gradual process which has not developed at 7 years to the adult's cardinal and ordinal ideas of number. At 7 years the child has developed the concept of most and more, but not that of same and equal. From this the author concludes that it is unlikely that the first and second grade child will be mature enough to "master completely and understand isolated addition and substraction facts."

AB  - Investigated, in 2 experiments, the feasibility of using behavioral techniques to integrate an autistic 5-yr-old girl into a normal public-school class with 1 teacher and 20–30 normal children. In both experiments, initial treatment was given by a therapist who then trained the classroom teacher to continue treatment. Overall results show that (a) during treatment by a therapist in the classroom, the Ss appropriate verbal and social behaviors increased and autistic mannerisms decreased; and (b) training teachers in behavioral techniques was apparently sufficient to maintain the S's appropriate school behaviors throughout kindergarten (Exp I) and the 1st grade (Exp II).

AB  - Describes the successful treatment of a 7th-grade boy who had selective mutism in school since kindergarten. Treatment consisted of systematic desensitization, consultation with school personnel, and training in social speaking skills. The student made significant gains with respect to frequency of verbalizations to teachers and peers, number of individuals spoken to, anxiety related to speaking, school attendance, and involvement in school-based extracurricular activities. At 1 yr follow-up, the student's rate of speech was indistinguishable from his classmates.' Special issues concerning the treatment of long-term selective mutism are discussed.

AB  - Assessment of early mathematics skills in young children is important both psychometrically and practically. The TEMA-3 (Ginsburg & Baroody, 2003) yields a total score (Math Ability Score) and provides useful information on children's overall mathematics performance, but not about performance in specific skill areas that are targeted by state early learning guidelines and by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) and Common Core State Standards for Mathematics as important content for Understanding Number in early childhood. This study examined the factor structure of the TEMA-3 to examine whether items reflect the conceptual categories in the TEMA-3 Examiner's Manual (Ginsburg & Baroody, 2003) or a priori categories reflecting Understanding Number. Longitudinal data from 389 children (182 males), mean age 54.46months at first assessment, were obtained in fall and spring of pre-kindergarten, spring of kindergarten, and spring of 1st grade. Changes in factor structure are examined across measurement points. The a priori factor structure was found by confirmatory factor analysis to better fit the data. The numbers of factors identified increased across time. Subscale scores reflecting children's knowledge of specific mathematics concepts related to number concepts could enable teachers and parents to select activities to strengthen children's mathematical knowledge in those skill areas.

AB  - Lost in Practice offers a further development of the notion of Nordic educational action research (as described in a earlier volume Nurturing praxis 2008), aiming to deepen and enrich understandings of the Nordic educational tradition and its various practices. It explores Nordic traditions and theories, such as bildung, practical knowledge regime and translation theory, with the aim of furthering a seminal conversation between practice theory and action research. Furthermore it illuminates the use of these theories in the context of Nordic countries by presenting a number of case studies on professional development practices, in which specific forms and arenas for enhancing dialogue and meaning making are in focus. The practices of study and research circles, peer group mentoring and dialogue conferences, as developed in the Nordic countries throughout the 20th century, are presented and discussed, both in terms of established traditions and of practices of collaborative development. The book also reflect on the the “regional” traditions and educational practices in the Nordic countries are reflected on in the third part of the book. The volume addresses teachers at all levels in the educational system, particularly those who are interested in understanding educational action research and furthering collaborative forms of professional development, based on insights from different traditions for understanding and furthering the development of educational practices without getting lost.

AB  - The development of Early Childhood Education in Sweden is a central concern for national and local government, and for school districts and preschools. While principals have the responsibility for, and a particular role in, leading education in the preschools, they are somewhat removed from the core work of teachers. In this article, we argue that it is ‘middle leaders’ who are the critical professionals for developing quality in edu‑ cation. The argument is made through examining the leading practices of middle lead‑ ers using a practice theory framework. We specifically draw on the theory of practice architectures to explore and understand the arrangements and conditions that enable and constrain the practices of these leaders in their work. The study draws on survey data and recorded professional Learning Dialogues among participants. Responses revealed a number of enabling and constraining conditions relating to particular cultural–discursive, material–economic and social–political conditions that influenced what was possible in their leading practices. Results further show how the practices of middle leaders were crucial in not only developing but sustaining quality in Early Childhood Education as they coordinate between the educational practices within the preschool and across the city district.

AB  - The Common Core of Data (CCD) is an annual universe collection of public elementary and secondary education data that is administered by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and its data collection agent, the U.S. Census Bureau. Data for the CCD surveys are provided by state education agencies (SEAs). This report presents findings on the numbers of public school students, staff, and high school completers in the United States and other jurisdictions in school year 2005-06, using data from the State Nonfiscal Survey of Public Elementary/Secondary Education of the CCD survey system. More information about the survey content and methodology can be found in appendix A. Appendix B is a glossary of key CCD terms used in this report. Selected findings for school year 2005-06 include: (1) Public elementary and secondary schools had 49.1 million students in membership in school year 2005-06, an increase of one percent from the 48.8 million students in membership in school year 2004-05; (2) In the 2005-06 school year, 34.3 million students (69.9 percent of all students) were enrolled in prekindergarten through grade 8 and ungraded classes; 14.8 million students (30.1 percent of all students) were enrolled in grades 9-12; (3) When examining students for whom race/ethnicity was reported in the 2005-06 school year, 57.1 percent were White, non-Hispanic; 19.8 percent were Hispanic; 17.2 percent were Black, non-Hispanic; 4.6 percent were Asian/Pacific Islander; and 1.2 percent were American Indian/Alaska Native. The percentage of students who were White, non-Hispanic decreased from 57.9 percent for White, non-Hispanic students in school year 2004-05; (4) Almost 2.8 million students were awarded a high school diploma in the 2004-05 school year and following summer. An additional 54,012 received another high school completion credential; (5) The averaged freshman graduation rate (AFGR), an estimate of the percentage of high school students who graduate on time (i.e., within 4 years), was 74.7 in school year 2004-05. The AFGR ranged from 85.1 percent or more in Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, North Dakota, Vermont, and Wisconsin to 64.1 percent or less in Alaska, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, and South Carolina; (6) In school year 2005-06, public elementary and secondary schools and local education agencies employed a total of 6.1 million FTE staff. This was an increase of 1 percent from the number of FTE staff employed in school year 2004-05; (7) Of the FTE staff in the 2005-06 school year, 51.2 percent were teachers, 14.7 percent were instructional aides, instructional coordinators and supervisors, guidance counselors, or librarians, 23.2 percent were student and other support staff, and 10.8 percent were school administrators, school district administrators, and administrative support staff; and (8) The average student/teacher ratio in public schools in school year 2005-06 was 15.7 (i.e., there were about 16 students for every FTE teacher employed). The ratio ranged from a high of 22.1 in Utah to a low of 10.7 in Rhode Island. The average elementary student/teacher ratio was 19.4, while the average secondary student/teacher ratio was 12.9.

AB  - This report presents findings on the numbers of public school students and staff in the United States and other jurisdictions in school year 2006-07, using data from the State Nonfiscal Survey of Public Elementary/Secondary Education of the Common Core of Data (CCD) survey system. The CCD is an annual collection of data that are reported by State Education Agencies (SEA) to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) through the U.S. Department of Education's "EDFacts" data collection system. The State Nonfiscal Survey of Public Elementary/Secondary Education presents counts of students by grade and race/ethnicity. The survey also presents counts of full-time equivalent (FTE) teachers, aides, support staff, and administrators in public schools and school districts.

AB  - This study examined whether children's observed individual engagement with teachers, peers, and tasks related to their school readiness after controlling for observed preschool classroom quality and children's baseline skills. The sample included 211 predominately low‐income, racially/ethnically diverse 4‐year‐old children in 49 preschool classrooms in one medium‐sized U.S. city. Results indicated that children's positive engagement with (a) teachers related to improved literacy skills; (b) peers related to improved language and self‐regulatory skills; and (c) tasks related to closer relationships with teachers. Children's negative engagement was associated with lower language, literacy, and self‐regulatory skills, and more conflict and closeness with teachers. Effect sizes were small to medium in magnitude, and some expected relations between positive engagement and school readiness were not found.

AB  - Physical qualifications of group rooms are highly important in terms of child development during preschool education. First of all, the required space should be provided in order to create ideal conditions in a group room. The standards of the required space for a child in group rooms vary among countries. It is stated that in Turkey minimum 1.5 m2 space per child in group rooms is enough. This paper studies whether this standard rate, which is stated as insufficient according to various studies, is seen enough by the users; hence, 30 children and their teachers from three different kindergartens were interviewed. It is seen that the standards in Turkey which are considered as sufficient are actually not enough according to the comments of children and teachers. The purpose of this study is to present an example constructed on the idea that the standards should be defined according to the experiences of users, so to be able to reach the right solutions which meet the needs of users.

AB  - Although children with a greater number of autistic traits are likely to have other mental health problems, research on the association between earlier autistic traits in preschool children and later emotional/behavioral outcomes is scarce. Using data from 189 Japanese community-based children, this study examined whether autistic traits at age 5 were related to emotional/behavioral outcomes at age 7. The results showed that prior autistic traits were subsequently associated with all emotional/behavioral domains. After controlling for baseline emotional/behavioral scores autistic traits continued to predict later emotional symptoms and peer problems. This study highlights that in addition to clinical ASD, it is also important to focus on subthreshold autistic traits in preschool children for better subsequent emotional/behavioral outcomes.

AB  - This article reports on a comparison of male and female early childhood teachers' beliefs and self-reported practices related to behavior management (BM). The respondents comprised 46 male and 46 female teachers, and independent-samples t-tests were conducted to compare beliefs and self-reported practices about BM strategies across these two groups. There were significant differences between the male and female teachers' self-confidence scores, and the ways in which they interacted with their pupils' parents. However, no significant differences were found between the male and female respondents' beliefs relating to the usefulness of BM strategies, or the frequency of their use of these strategies. Two-way ANOVAs were also conducted to explore the impact of gender/teaching experience, gender/educational level, and gender/class size on teachers' self-confidence; their perceptions of the usefulness of BM strategies; the frequency with which they used such strategies; and their interactions with parents. None of these relationships were statistically significant.

AB  - This study analyses the beliefs and self-reported practices of preschool teachers with regard to the concept of child-centred education, as well as the consistency between these beliefs and practices. Data were collected via interviews with 20 female teachers employed in public preschools in Ankara, Turkey. The results indicated that the participants' beliefs and practices related to developmental domains were not consistent with child-centred education, whereas their beliefs and practices involving the physical environment of the classroom, instructional activities, relationships, behaviour management, assessment, and parental involvement were partially consistent with it. Congruence between beliefs and practices in the sphere of child-centred education was strongest with respect to developmental domains and less strong in the other areas studied.

AB  - Although creativity provides a considerable number of advantages, many teachers have direct and indirect prejudices against creative students since they may display distracting and disruptive behaviors toward teachers and classmates. To determine how teachers’ creativity affects their students’ creative development, 90 preschool and elementary school teachers and 90 pupils were assessed for creative thinking. The children's sex was not correlated with creativity scores. There were small, significant relationships between various measures of preschool teachers’ and students’ creativity.

AB  - The absence of fathers during pregnancy increases the risk of feto-infant morbidities, including low birth weight (LBW), preterm birth (PTB), and small-for-gestational age. Previous research has shown that the Central Hillsborough Healthy Start project (CHHS)—a federally funded initiative in Tampa, Florida—has improved birth outcomes. This study explores the effectiveness of the CHHS project in ameliorating the adverse effects of fathers’ absence during pregnancy. This retrospective cohort study used CHHS records linked to vital statistics and hospital discharge data (1998–2007). The study population consisted of women who had a singleton birth with an absent father during pregnancy. Women were categorized based on residence in the CHHS service area. Propensity score matching was used to match cases (CHHS) to controls (rest of Florida). Conditional logistic regression was employed to generate odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for matched observations. Women residing in the CHHS service area were more likely to be high school graduates, black, younger (< 35 years), and to have adequate prenatal care compared to controls ( p < 0.01). These differences disappeared after propensity score matching. Mothers with absent fathers in the CHHS service area had a reduced likelihood of LBW (OR 0.76, 95 % CI 0.65–0.89), PTB (OR 0.72, 95 % CI 0.62–0.84), very low birth weight (OR 0.50, 95 % CI 0.35–0.72) and very preterm birth (OR 0.48, 95 % CI 0.34–0.69) compared to their counterparts in the rest of the state. This study demonstrates that a Federal Healthy Start project contributed to a significant reduction in adverse fetal birth outcomes in families with absent fathers.

AB  - Studied the longitudinal costs associated with 1 school district's evolution toward more inclusive schooling for students with mild to profound disabilities in kindergarten through Grade 12. Comparative data are presented to highlight the relative costs to a school district over more restrictive placement options. Analysis of archival data revealed that providing integrated and inclusive services within-district was substantially less expensive than out-of-district services. Inclusive practices also resulted in an increase in the number of students with severe disabilities, a doubling of contractual costs, and a significant increase in the number of paraprofessional staff.

AB  - Research Findings: The aim of the present study was to examine classroom quality profiles of kindergarten classrooms using a person-centered approach and to analyze these patterns in regard to teacher and classroom characteristics. Observations of the domains of Emotional Support, Classroom Organization, and Instructional Support were conducted in 49 Finnish kindergarten classrooms utilizing the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (R. C. Pianta, K. M. LaParo, & B. K. Hamre, 2008). In addition, questionnaire data on classroom and teacher characteristics, as well as Early Childhood Classroom Observation Measure (D. Stipek & P. Byler, 2004) observational ratings, were used in the analyses. Latent profiling analysis was utilized to identify different profiles of classroom quality. Four latent profiles of classroom quality were identified that differed from one another most clearly in the domain of Emotional Support. Profile 1 represented a generally high level and Profile 4 a generally low level of classroom quality compared to the other profiles, whereas the medium-quality Profiles 2 and 3 showed varying levels of support in the assessed dimensions of quality. Only a few differences emerged among the profiles in classroom and teacher characteristics: The teachers in Profile 4 provided the least literacy instruction and had the least amount of work experience of all of the teachers. The findings using the Early Childhood Classroom Observation Measure indicated that child-centered practices were predominant among the profiles of higher classroom quality. Practice or Policy: The results of this study can be used to recognize kindergarten teachers' professional strengths and weaknesses and to support teachers' professional development with the aid of pedagogical interventions.

AB  - CHILDREN AT RISK, a nonprofit and nonpartisan research organization, undertook a year-long effort to study the subsidized child care system in Texas. This included an in-depth analysis of the system's local and state partners, as well as the promotion of the study's findings and key recommendations. This report is one of the products of this effort. The purpose of this report is twofold. One purpose is to educate parents, policy makers, and the public about the subsidized child care system in Texas. This report describes the system and challenges confronted by child care providers and those parents who need quality child care. The second purpose is to offer policy recommendations to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the subsidized child care system on behalf of parents, taxpayers, and--most importantly--children. The recommendations emphasize coordination and cooperation among state agencies so that they can avoid duplication and maximize state investments while they serve the large population of children in the subsidized child care system.

AB  - Children all around the world pass through a number of transitions in educational systems. These transitions are organised in different ways in different countries. In Sweden, children pass through three school forms in early childhood education: preschool, preschool class and primary school. In a research project funded by the Swedish Research Council, the Swedish POET group conducted case studies in three municipalities, using participant observations, semi-structured interviews and focus group interviews. The aim has been to deepen the understanding of children's learning journeys from preschool into school. A second aim has been to examine the long-term implications of educational practices across the transitions for children's learning and participation. In this chapter, some findings from the research project are presented. The results show how the complex structure of Swedish early childhood education creates challenges for children and their learning journeys.

AB  - This study investigated questions adults asked to children with autism spectrum disorder in inclusive pre-kindergarten classrooms, and whether child (e.g. autism severity) and setting (i.e. adult-to-child ratio) characteristics were related to questions asked during center-time. Videos of verbal children with autism spectrum disorder (n?=?42) were coded based on the following question categories adapted from the work of Massey et al.: management, low cognitive challenging, or cognitively challenging. Results indicated that management questions (mean?=?19.97, standard deviation?=?12.71) were asked more than less cognitively challenging questions (mean?=?14.22, standard deviation?=?8.98) and less cognitively challenging questions were asked more than cognitively challenging questions (mean?=?10.00, standard deviation?=?6.9). Children with higher language levels had a greater likelihood of receiving cognitively challenging questions (odds ratio?=?1.025; p?=?0.007). Cognitively challenging questions had a greater likelihood of being asked in classrooms with more adults relative to children (odds ratio?=?1.176; p?=?0.037). The findings present a first step in identifying the questions directed at preschoolers with autism spectrum disorder in inclusive classrooms.

AB  - This article highlights how an existing university–school partnership between a university and a kindergarten center was restructured in an attempt to bring academic and practitioner knowledge together in a more synergistic way in support of preservice teacher learning. In an effort to more closely connect a campus-based course that had a small field component with a newer, richer, more time-intensive field experience in a preservice teacher education program, a different epistemological model was envisioned with three major changes to enhance and strengthen the overall partnership: (1) the number of preservice teacher candidates doubled, as did their amount of classroom observation/teaching time; (2) school-based teacher experts were utilized to share their specific areas of knowledge with preservice teacher candidates; and (3) the university professor/partnership liaison provided intensive staff development workshops on topics selected by the classroom teachers themselves to make certain they were viewed as meaningful, interesting, and highly relevant to their daily classroom work. This article explains how this restructured partnership was envisioned and brought to fruition by detailing the goals behind the community partnership, the strengths of the program from both sides of the partnership, the obstacles that were overcome, and testimonials directly from the classroom teachers and the university’s teacher candidates.

AB  - Due to a vastly changing media landscape with new users and usage of media the communicative patterns within the boundaries of family life are transforming. The aim of this extensive review was to investigate studies in peer-reviewed articles that examined the role of the parent’s in the influences that media can assert on preschool children’s (3–5 years) health. Terms and corresponding meanings searched: (media and influence and child) and (parent or health). Databases: ISI Web of Knowledge, EBSCO, Ncom and PubMed. Number of articles that met the criteria (research; peer-review; topic; age; language) for inclusion=46. Results: Media can influence preschool children’s aggressions, obesity, anti-social behaviour, materialism and cognitive skills. The parent can mainly prevent their children from harmful media content and their attitudes towards the media are of primary importance. Contribution is made to parental mediation research and the importance of attitudes by adding knowledge from third-person-effect research and behavioural consequences.

AB  - We examined 25 four-year-old pre-school classrooms from a random sample of 15 schools within a large urban city in southern Spain. Observational measures of classroom quality included the Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale-Revised, the Classroom Assessment Scoring System and the Observation of Activities in Pre-school. Findings revealed that, on average, classroom quality was low in regards to space and materials, developmentally appropriate activities and instruction; however, classrooms were relatively high on positive climate and productivity, and teachers demonstrated positive relationships with families. The observed ratio of children to teachers was high across classrooms. Results from regression analyses indicate that a higher ratio was associated with lower quality language modelling, teacher feedback and personal care routines available in these settings. Qualitative data from teacher interviews highlighted the importance of a pre-school education for children's development and school readiness, but also emphasised the challenges teachers faced with the new government-subsidised, universal pre-school programme, including increased class sizes and a lack of staff and resources. Implications for maintaining high-quality programme standards are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

AB  - This paper investigates whether employees’ assessment of their primary task quality has a significant impact on their well‐being and job satisfaction, respectively. Furthermore, the paper hypothesizes that professional values and norms affect employees’ quality expectations on their work tasks and thus their assessment of primary task quality. The paper proposes a measure for primary task quality and uses it in the analyses of responses from 1,247 preschool teachers and teaching assistants in 94 public daycare centers in Denmark. The results indicate that an important factor for employees is their experience of quality in the job they perform. Moreover, quality expectations can differ between employees performing the same task due to, for example, difference in professional training. This leads us to propose a new research direction for job design theory that addresses employees’ assessment of the quality of their primary task job performance.

AB  - What is the impact of good-quality early education on someone's life? The traditional answer was that children who attended smaller classrooms and had more experienced teachers early in life would have better test scores during elementary school, but that this effect would slowly fade: By high school, no impact was detected on their IQ or test scores when compared with children with "average" early education. However, some new research is challenging this view, pointing toward a more dramatic impact of early education on adult outcomes. From 1985 to 1989 more than 10,000 Tennessee primary school children were randomly assigned to small, regular size, or regular-size classes with a teacher's aide as part of the Student/Teacher Achievement Ratio (STAR) Project. Skills such as self-control, perseverance, and dependability, which are not measured on test scores, can indeed be learned in preschool and may have a major impact on adult outcomes. Investing in early childhood education seems to be a particularly cost-effective way to spend public money, for the benefit of individuals and society as a whole.

AB  - This article focuses on normalization processes within a Swedish family assessment home. It discusses how normality is constructed by personnel working at Family House, a fictive name for an assessment home of parental care. The article focuses on the ways in which meanings of race/ethnicity, class, and gender are an implicit part of the normativity constructed by personnel in these institutional settings and are used to position themselves as different from the families who are there to be evaluated. The term Svensson is shown to be a key term that is imbued with normative understandings of an "orderly life" in the Swedish welfare state.

Assessment measures included Infant and Toddler Environment Rating Scale, Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale, and the Assessment Profile for Early Childhood Programs. Regulatable aspects of quality of child care included ratio of caregivers to children, group size, teacher training in child development or child care, teacher education, highest wage paid to a center teacher, and staff turnover. Process measures proved to be highly redundant, both internally and with each other. Much smaller sets of items, drawn randomly from the instruments' item pools, were found to be perfectly acceptable measures of QOC. Regulatable measures did not prove to be acceptable measures of QOC, except for teachers' wages, which were highly correlated with process measures of quality.

AB  - Project STAR (Student/Teacher Achievement Ratio) was a large-scale randomized trial of reduced class sizes in kindergarten through the third grade. Because of the scope of the experiment, it has been used in many policy discussions. For example, the California statewide class-size-reduction policy was justified, in part, by the successes of Project STAR. Recent (failed) proposals in the Senate that sought federal assistance for class-size reductions were motivated by Project STAR research. Even the recent discussion of small schools often conflates the notion of small schools and smaller classrooms. Because of the importance of Project STAR, it has been studied by many scholars looking at a wide variety of outcomes and even exploiting the randomization to understand variations in inputs and other aspects of the education production function that do not directly relate to class size. This paper provides an overview of the academic literature using the Project STAR experiment. Given the scarcity of large-scale educational experiments like Project STAR, it is important to learn as much as possible from the experiment. Researchers have combed through the experiment to learn not only about the effects of reduced class size on test scores but also to gain insight into classroom dynamics. Overall, Project STAR indicates that reducing class size is a reasonable economic investment: the benefits are sizable and long lasting, especially for black students, and the overall benefits outweigh the costs.

AB  - The German Psychiatry Personnel Act, which went into effect in 1990, has led to a decrease in the number of child and adolescent psychiatry inpatient beds, to a decrease in the length of stay, and to an increase in inpatient psychotherapy. Today, this act is outdated, for a number of reasons, such as changes in the morbidity of the population, the rising number of emergencies, and new professional standards such as documentation. In addition, new legal provisions and conventions (like the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child) necessitate a complete reevaluation. Child and adolescent psychiatry needs a normative act to enable the necessary implementation. Many different rationales are available to support the debate.

AB  - Digital technologies are gaining an ever increasing access into the activities in Danish and Nordic day-care institutions. The traditional critical viewpoint of technologies as being opposed to the well-being of children is challenged in part by substantial access to digital tools in infant life, in part by new technologies designed with an intuitive and inviting user interface. In a one-year research project ’Digital tools in day-care-institutions’ (2015) financed by The Danish Agency for Digitisation and The Ministry of Education we have investigated the role of digital technologies in relation to questions of learning and the agenda of Pedagogical quality in early childhood education. Our part of the project has had a special focus on relations between use of technology and children´s possibilities of participation in learning environments and childrens’ communities. The data in the project are produced in close cooperation with practitioners through case-studies. The pedagogues have formulated assumptions of outcomes of planned activities involving use of technology within the focus areas. The course of activities has been documented through videotaping, and analysed by both practitioners and researchers. Theoretically the study takes its outset from a socio-material grasp of technologies, understanding technologies as a cultural force that takes part in the – pedagogical - interactions. Furthermore, we are occupied with childrens´ perspectives in the exploration of pedagogical quality of learning environments including digital technologies. From this follows a focus on the preferred activity of children: playing. In the paper we will elaborate on two – preliminary - interrelated - findings: 1) Children and adults are handling technologies in substantially different ways 2) The professionals are to a large degree lacking a professional language of technologies in a pedagogical context. Going through the data-material we are getting aware of substantial different ways of using technologies by children and grown-ups. The pedagogues are using technologies to create learning environments with more or less formulated learning goals. The technologies are, for example, included in activities where the participation of the children aims at taking pictures thematized by the pedagogues, producing small films or developing knowledge of numbers and concepts. In other words, the technologies are inscribed in performances of dominant cultural ways of acting and thinking. Also, most often the pedagogues’ use of technologies follow the immediate possibilities offered by the technologies. From the videos of these activities it appears that the children follow two tracks of participation. Either the children work on mastering the expected cultural forms and codes with more or less enthusiasm or they take sideways, creating their own communities of playing with the cultural forms involving a playful use of body, language and technology. Taking this observation as a starting point, we will describe the different uses of technology among children and pedagogues. We hereby hope to contribute to the development of professionalism in the use of digital technologies in day-care institutions comprising curiosity, investigation, and critique, and a more child-centered pedagogy in the use of digital technologies.

AB  - Like almost everywhere else, the role and the status of the English language have been increasing in Swedish society, including the education system. All students in Swedish schools receive some more or less formal instruction in the English subject by the time they are in third grade, though very many are exposed to the language even earlier, both at school and outside of it.Despite these circumstances, we seem to know very little about the realities of English for young learners (EYL) instruction at Swedish primary schools, e.g. regarding the following aspects: What activities do the teachers organize in their English classes? What materials do they work with and how? In what ways and to what extent do they use the target language, English?The present contribution reports on the results of two small studies addressing precisely these issues, among others. The first study is based on a number of actual observations and recordings of EYL lessons from preschool class to grade 3, followed by interviews with the respective teachers; the second is based on a questionnaire with a broader range of primary school teachers.The results suggest that some commonly promoted recommendations in the literature regarding EYL are not generally followed by many EYL teachers in Sweden. For example, when it comes to the use of English vs. Swedish in the English classroom, the share and quality of the target-language input, not least from the teachers themselves, might well be enhanced. In addition – and this aspect is related to the previous one – EYL instruction and its efficiency could be expected to benefit from contextualizing the classroom activities and communication to a greater extent, e.g. by using children’s literature of various kinds and engaging in meaningful interaction about it.

AB  - Poor adherence of children and adolescents to evidence‐based psychosocial interventions remains a fundamental impediment to treatment effectiveness. To maintain client adherence, researchers and clinicians have employed a number of adherence‐promoting strategies, from telephone calls and letters to providing transportation costs and child care to motivational enhancement therapies. However, the influence of adherence promoters on intervention outcomes has not been reported. This study examined the moderating effect of adherence‐promoting strategies in a survey and meta‐analysis of randomized clinical trials of cognitive behavioral treatments, interpersonal therapy, and psycho‐education for children and adolescents with mental health problems (k = 33). Results indicated the type and intensity of adherence promoters’ moderated study effect sizes according to client characteristics (age, gender, diagnosis). Preliminary findings suggest that males had higher effect sizes when more intensive adherence‐promoting efforts were employed. Adherence‐promoting efforts were associated with lower effect sizes for youths who were diagnosed with externalizing disorders. Results of this study suggest directions for future research to clarify clinical guidelines to maximize retention in evidence‐based psychotherapy.

AB  - This article presents findings from research on a field experience designed to help elementary preservice teachers learn the practice of teacher questioning during formal and informal interviews to analyze student mathematical thinking in K-2 classrooms. The practice of teacher questioning is framed as choosing a mathematical goal, analyzing student thinking about that goal, and then deciding on a question or prompt. Preservice teachers were specific and accurate in identifying a mathematical goal and analyzing student thinking when responding to a video-taped interview, but were less successful in their explicit discussion about the rationales for particular teacher questions in response to student thinking. More research is needed to understand tasks for preservice teachers in early field experiences that will help them develop intentional use of teacher questioning to facilitate student thinking about mathematics.

AB  - Although numerous programs have been developed for Grade Kindergarten through 12 science education, evaluation has been difficult owing to the inherent problems conducting controlled experiments in the typical classroom. Using a rigorous experimental design, we developed and tested a novel program containing a series of pharmacology modules to help high school students learn basic principles in biology and chemistry. High school biology and chemistry teachers were recruited for the study and they attended a 1-week workshop to learn how to integrate pharmacology into their teaching. Working with university pharmacology faculty, they also developed classroom activities. Students in classrooms using the pharmacology topics scored significantly higher on a multiple choice test of basic biology and chemistry concepts compared with controls. Very large effect sizes were obtained when teachers used as many as four modules. In addition, biology students increased performance on chemistry questions and chemistry students increased performance on biology questions. Substantial gains in achievement may be made when high school students are taught science using topics that are interesting and relevant to their own lives.

AB  - Used the Draw-A-Person (DAP) test to measure the remedial effects of preschool compensatory education on 432 children from a working-class district. In 69% of the cases scores improved, with an average gain of 10 units on the DAP Quality scale. Girls scored higher than boys on the pretest, but the sexes showed no significant differences in treatment effects. In individual cases it often appeared that the lower the initial test scores (and therefore presumably the capacity for learning), the greater the gains from preschool intervention. Test results were affected much less by class size than by the teacher's education, training, motivation to teach, and length of experience in preschool and kindergarten teaching.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate if the Bender test, administered to late preschoolers and evaluated with a neuropsychological scoring system , can identify and predict executive dysfunctions at preschool age and in late adolescence, respectively.Participants and Methods: As part of the longitudinal Stockholm Neonatal Project, 134 adolescents born preterm with very low birth weight (&lt; 1500g) and 94 matched controls born at term, participated in follow-up studies at ages 5 ½ and 18 years. On both occasions, the participants were assessed with an age appropriate intelligence test and tests of executive functions (EF) . Bender Visual Motor Gestalt Test was given at age 5 ½, and scored with ABC neuropsychological system. Stepwise regression analysis was used to investigate how cognitive outcome at age 18 was predicted by the Bender ABC score and EF at age 5 ½, gender, medical risk, birth weight ratio, and parental education. The validity of the Bender ABC neuropsychological score in screening for executive dysfunction was evaluated by Receiver Operating Characteristics-analysis (ROC).Results: Bender ABC neuropsychological scores predicted general intelligence and EF at 18 years almost as well as a more comprehensive battery, in both groups. ROC analysis showed that the Bender ABC had good diagnostic and predictive validity for identifying executive dysfunctions, with AUC-values of .84 in both cases.Conclusion: Bender with ABC neuropsychological scoring is a promising screening instrument for identifying executive dysfunctions before school start.

AB  - A study of 142 children (Grades K-1) indicated that those whose mothers were currently employed chose a greater number of occupations and more masculine-oriented occupations, than did children of nonemployed mothers. Girls whose mothers had selected nontraditional fields also tended to aspire to less sex-traditional careers. (Author/KH)

AB  - Aim: The aim was to explore opinions on individual needs and other factors that may influence nursing staff turnover. Background: High staff turnover is a great problem for many hospitals. It is shown to have a negative effect on the quality of nursing care and to increase hospital costs. Design: In 2004 in a large university hospital in Sweden five focus group discussions (FGDs) including department heads (1), nursing managers (2) and members of nursing staff (2) were carried out. The questions to be addressed were ‘Why do nurses leave?’ and ‘Why do nurses stay?’ In addition, register data of staff turnover for 2002–2003 were analysed in relation to different facts about the units, such as number of employees, type of care and medical specialty. Categories of opinions identified in the FGDs were compared with results of the statistical analyses on the relationship between staff turnover and unit parameters to identify overall factors that may influence on nurse staff turnover. Findings: Four major factors were identified as having a possible influence on staff turnover: ‘intrinsic values of motivation’, ‘work load’, ‘unit size ‘and ‘leadership’. Smaller units had lower staff turnover as well as outpatient units and day care. It was not possible to compare statements from participants from smaller units with those from participants from larger units. Two factors had diverging data, ‘salary’ and ‘spirit of the time’. A surprising finding was the little mention of patient care in relation to staff turnover. Relevance to clinical practice: It is important for managers to ensure that intrinsic values of nurses are met to minimise the risk for high turnover rates. Inpatient care must receive adequate staffing and nursing care could be organised into smaller units or work teams to avoid dissatisfaction and high turnover.

AB  - A pre-school-based dietary survey, using seven-day records, focus group interviews and semi-structured interviews, was carried out in a suburban area of Stockholm. The overall objective was to investigate the individual food and nutrient intake of pre-school children at all meals during the day, as well as factors that might influence children’s intake. The average energy and nutrient intake per day for the whole week was satisfactory for the 109 pre-school children, but the temporal distribution throughout the day was skewed. The energy and nutrient intakes of food at the pre-school were lower than recommended. This was, however, compensated for by meals eaten at home. The children had a more varied food intake during weekdays than weekend days. This study has not provided any evidence to support the selection of water versus milk as a preferable lunch beverage in terms of pre-school children's total milk consumption and general dietary quality. However, the dietary analyses showed that there could be a reason to limit pre-school children’s daily milk and fermented milk intake to half a litre, according to the existing guidelines. The children associated food and eating with rules and norms. They did not categorise food as good or bad, as adults often do, but as ""food"" and ""non-food""; for example, sweets were not food. The method used in this study, the focus group interview, was judged to be a useful tool for exploring how children think about and jointly reflect upon food. The role of the teacher had changed over the past years and they had not yet found a solid ground for integrating food and meals into their everyday work.

AB  - Determined what family-oriented benefits and policy options are being offered by businesses in Louisiana to alleviate working mothers' stress in trying to balance work and family demands, as well as the circumstances or conditions under which such benefits are offered. 178 human resources directors of a stratified random sample of businesses completed a survey reporting the types of benefits they offered. Demographic data on the companies and employees also were collected. Generally, companies offered few benefits, but the number of personnel policies and financial aid programs offered was significantly related to company size and the percentage of women in the company work force. Findings fit the rational-choice model that holds that demographic and workplace factors might lead to employers offering family-related benefits.

AB  - The costs and outcomes of supporting 7 people (aged over 18 yrs) with severe intellectual disabilities and high support needs in part-time employment were compared with those of a Special Needs Unit (SNU) of a day center, both within-subject and against an equal-sized comparison group. The income of those employed was described. Direct observation of the employment activities and representative SNU activities were undertaken to assess S engagement in activity and receipt of assistance, social contact in general and social contact from people other than paid staff. Costs of providing service support were calculated taking account of staff: service user ratios, staff identities and wage rates and service-administrative and management overheads. Employment was associated with greater receipt of assistance, higher task-related engagement in activity and more social contact from people other than paid staff. SNU activities were associated with greater receipt of social contact. Supporting people in employment was more expensive than in the SNU. Cost-effectiveness ratios of producing assistance and engagement in activities were equivalent across the comparative contexts. The SNU was more cost-effective in producing social involvement.

AB  - Examined the effects of a competence development intervention on pedagogical quality of preschools, and presents a competence development model. In Exp 1, an external evaluation of quality was conducted of 20 preschool units using the Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale (T. Harms & R. Clifford, 1980, ECERS). In Exp 2, 9 preschool units of 16–22 preschool students completed a competence development intervention; collected data included ECERS self-evaluations provided at baseline and following program completion. In Exp 3, an external evaluation of quality of the preschool units of Exp 2 was conducted, using the ECERS. In Exp 4, 27 pedagogues completed questionnaires concerning the model of competence development. Results show that the intervention enhanced the pedagogical quality, from an average of 4.50 to 4.98 on the ECERS. The intervention enhanced quality despite a lower staff–child ratio, compared to control schools. It is concluded that preschool quality can be enhanced through competence development at the same time as there are organizational changes and financial cutbacks.

AB  - Using a sample of 647 Canadian children in kindergarten to Grade 3 (325 boys, 322 girls), the present study evaluated the perceived effectiveness of Skillstreaming (McGinnis & Goldstein, 2003), a widely known social skills program implemented to target the development of four skill sets, i.e., listening, following directions, problem-solving, and knowing when to tell. Results indicated significant postprogram improvements in all skills as well as in ratings of overall prosociality obtained from both classroom teachers and mental health staff, with medium to large effect sizes obtained from teachers' and mental health professionals' ratings, respectively. Additional analyses yielded significant but weak moderator effects of grade and preprogram prosocial functioning for teacher ratings but no consistent moderator effects for children's sex or school location (i.e., urban versus rural) regardless of rater.

AB  - Research topic/Aim: In this presentation we share a snapshot of findings from a recent ECERSV3 evaluation in Sweden. The purpose of this study is to investigate the factors that influence the quality of Swedish preschools as well as explore a perceived understanding about preschools from preschool teachers, parents and children. In recent years, the OECD (2015) has reported that the quality of Swedish preschools has declined, moving from first place within the OECD countries to now number 3. Much angst has also been reported on increasing group sizes within preschools, high stress amongst preschool teachers, increasing child stress as well as many other issues (Sheridan, et al., 2014; Swedish National Agency for Education, 2016; Williams, et al., 2016). From a quality perspective, group size is closely linked to the conditions for preschool teachers to work professionally and children's opportunities to learn according to the intentions of the curriculum. Methodology/research design: During 2016 we collected data from 130 preschools in Sweden with children aged 3V5 years. Data was analysed with descriptive statistics as well as drawn on Bronfenbrenner ́s theory to examine the variation of available conditions for wellbeing, learning and knowledge formation. Our intention was to explore examples of high quality, mid quality and low quality. Theoretical framework: From a theoretical perspective of quality we discuss the findings in terms of the four interacting dimensions constitute pedagogical quality). The four quality dimensions are derived from a metaVanalytical process of deconstruction and reconstruction of research on quality in preschool (Sheridan, 2007, 2009). Each dimension is constituted by qualities that are unique to that dimension and that can be related to structures, processes, contents and results (Donabedian, 1980; Sheridan, 2009). Depending on how the dimensions interact with one another, learning environments of different quality are created. Thus, from a pedagogical perspective of quality the learning environment in preschool can be seen as a complex system of interplay between policy, people, material resources and pedagogical processes. Expected conclusions/Findings: The results indicate a big variation regarding quality in early education in Swedish preschools. High quality is vulnerably and affected by various factors, which in turn influence the conditions for children's wellbeing and future learning. The study follows the Swedish research council guidelines and ethical rules in social science research. Ethical aspects of the research were taken into consideration, including in particular requirements for confidentiality, consent, information and autonomy, along with the emphasis that participation in the study was voluntary.

AB  - The most important benefits of international comparisons are the indications that make hidden national characteristics visible and shed new light on the system in each country. From a comparative perspective, this article explores what Swedish and Norwegian preschool teachers emphasise as important to preschool student teachers about preschool as an arena for children's language learning. The theoretical framework of the study is based on ecological system theories (Bronfenbrenner in "The ecology of human development," Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 1979; Bronfenbrenner in "Dev Psychology" 22(6):723-742, 1986) and socio-cultural theories concerning language learning (Vygotsky in "Thought and language," MIT Press, Cambridge, 1986). The data are produced through interviews with 69 Swedish and 35 Norwegian preschool teachers. The analyses focused on what the preschool teachers stated to be the most important elements to work with concerning children's language learning, how and why they worked like this, and what rationales may have led to their pedagogy. The two countries seem quite alike in terms of the values embedded in early childhood education and political ideas concerning a rich childhood based on play and democratic ideals. By comparing the two countries, the results reveal differences that can lead to a deeper knowledge of cultural concepts that are often taken for granted, such as pedagogical approaches, and how these create different conditions for children's preschool language learning.

AB  - Examined the educational background and teaching experience of 54 child care teachers (CCTs), 58 private kindergarten teachers (PKTs), and 45 public kindergarten teachers (PUKTs) in Seoul, Korea. The relationships between the beliefs and practices of these teachers were also examined. Demographic information about the early childhood programs, such as type of program and class size was also investigated. Teachers completed several measures including a version of The Teacher Questionnaire (R. Charlesworth et al, 1989) which was adapted for the Korean early childhood programs. Results show that child care programs were full-day programs and were available 6 days a week. A majority of the public and private kindergarten programs were half-day programs and were offered 5 days per week. The number of children enrolled in public kindergartens was greater than for the child care centers and private kindergarten. Early childhood teachers varied in their academic preparation and years of teaching experience. PUKTs had more education and teaching experiences than PKTs and CCTs. CCTs had the least amount of teaching experience of the 3 types of programs. Overall, PUKTs had the most academic preparation and teaching experience.

AB  - The present study examined the relationships between teacher structure, teacher behaviors, and child care quality. Participants included 72 female teachers from 44 preschool classrooms. Both a global measure of quality and a measure of teacher-child interaction were utilized. Results showed that a co-teacher structure was associated with higher quality child care and more positive teacher behaviors than a hierarchical two-teacher structure or a single-teacher structure. Comparisons between lead and assistant teachers in a hierarchical structure also revealed that teacher behaviors of lead teachers and assistant teachers were very similar, although their education levels were significantly different. Lower ratios and smaller group size were associated with more positive teacher behaviors. Implications for professionals and future research areas are discussed. (Contains 4 tables.)

AB  - This article addresses three questions: Does reduced class size cause higher academic achievement in reading, mathematics, listening, and word recognition skills? If it does, how large are these effects? Does the magnitude of such effects vary significantly across schools? The authors analyze data from Tennessee’s Student/Teacher Achievement Ratio study (STAR) of 1985, where students and teachers are randomly assigned to a small or regular class. The authors propose a three-level multivariate simultaneous equation model with an instrumental variable (IV) and estimation via maximum likelihood (ML) to analyze the data under an assumption of data missing at random (MAR). The IV, random assignment of students to a small or regular class, reduces class size which, by hypothesis, improves academic achievement in these domains. The authors extend Rubin’s Causal Model (RCM) by involving a modified Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA), requiring no interference between classrooms and intact schools. The method accommodates data with a general missing pattern and extracts full information for analysis from the STAR data. The authors investigate both homogenous and heterogenous causal effects of class size on academic achievement scores across schools. The results show that reducing class size improves reading, mathematics, listening, and word recognition test scores from kindergarten to third grade, although the effects appear relatively small in second grade. The authors find no evidence that the causal effects vary across schools. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

AB  - Does reduced class size cause higher academic achievement for both Black and other students in reading, mathematics, listening, and word recognition skills? Do Black students benefit more than other students from reduced class size? Does the magnitude of the minority advantages vary significantly across schools? This article addresses the causal questions via analysis of experimental data from Tennessee’s Student/Teacher Achievement Ratio study where students and teachers are randomly assigned to small or regular class type. Causal inference is based on a three-level multivariate simultaneous equation model (SM) where the class type as an instrumental variable (IV) and class size as an endogenous regressor interact with a Black student indicator. The randomized IV causes class size to vary which, by hypothesis, influences academic achievement overall and moderates a disparity in academic achievement between Black and other students. Within each subpopulation characterized by the ethnicity, the effect of reduced class size on academic achievement is the average causal effect. The difference in the average causal effects between the race ethnic groups yields the causal disparity in academic achievement. The SM efficiently handles ignorable missing data with a general missing pattern and is estimated by maximum likelihood. This approach extends Rubin’s causal model to a three-level SM with cross-level causal interaction effects, requiring intact schools and no interference between classrooms as a modified Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption. The results show that, for Black students, reduced class size causes higher academic achievement in the four domains each year from kindergarten to third grade, while for other students, it improves the four outcomes except for first-grade listening in kindergarten and first grade only. Evidence shows that Black students benefit more than others from reduced class size in first-, second-, and third-grade academic achievement. This article does not find evidence that the causal minority disparities are heterogeneous across schools in any given year.

AB  - Because numerous studies show that early child-adult attachment significantly affects a child's socio-emotional and cognitive development, we propose that establishing attachment-based child care can contribute to a healthy and happy childhood. This proposition is part of a new theoretical and experimental field and, thus, research is limited. There is a lack of clarity in definition, criteria, and common terminology of this type of child care. By synthesizing the literature around the attachment-based interventions in early child care centres, this review provides a conceptualization of attachment-based child care. Based on research findings, major components of this type of child care are: training for caregivers on attachment theory and sensitivity; employment of an appropriate policy, such as the appointment of a key person; a small child-adult ratio; and collaboration with parents that includes education about secure attachment and sensitivity.

Information about the daycare centers' structural and procedural characteristics was obtained through interviews with center directors. Comparisons between parental answers and the data provided by the directors revealed significant gaps in parental knowledge of daycare. On average, parents answered only 45% of questions correctly, and reported a lack of knowledge regarding both general center characteristics (i.e., turnover rates, caregiver training, and hiring practices) and specific group characteristics (i.e., group size, adult-child ratio, and child's daily schedule). Parental knowledge increased with length of involvement with the center, but other variables such as parent education and the number of hours the child spent in care per week did not contribute to prediction of parental knowledge.

AB  - Federal and State Governments provide childcare subsidies for low-income working families. This study compares the encountered issues and working environments of family home providers of subsidized and non-subsidized childcare. Questionnaires were distributed throughout a southeastern state in the United States to 548 family home childcare providers. Differences between subsidized and non-subsidized providers with regard to their perspectives on training, staff sizes and availability of care are discussed.

AB  - The Nuffield Early Language Intervention is designed to improve the spoken language ability of children during the transition from nursery to primary school. It is targeted at children with relatively poor spoken language skills. Three sessions per week are delivered to groups of two to four children starting in the final term of nursery and continuing in the first two terms of reception in primary school. Children in primary school also attend an additional two 15-minute individual sessions per week. All sessions focus on listening, narrative and vocabulary skills. Work on phonological awareness is introduced in the final ten weeks. The intervention was developed by researchers from the University of York with funding from the Nuffield Foundation. The communications charity I CAN was enlisted to train teaching assistants and nursery staff to deliver the programme. This report evaluates the I CAN-led model for the 30-week programme described above and also a shorter 20-week version delivered only in reception year. The impact of these two programmes on the language skills of 350 children in 34 schools was tested using a randomised controlled trial design. Schools with attached nursery schools or nursery classes in Yorkshire and the South East were recruited to the trial in 2013. Children identified as having relatively low language skills were randomly allocated to the 30-week programme, the 20-week programme or standard provision. The qualitative fieldwork carried out as part of the project involved interviews with a total of 12 staff in 8 of the 34 participating schools. Key conclusions include: (1) The Nuffield Early Language Intervention had a positive impact on the language skills of children in the trial. This is true for both the more expensive, 30-week version, starting in nursery, and the 20-week version, delivered only in school; (2) Children receiving the 30-week version experienced the equivalent of about four months of additional progress, compared with about 2 months additional progress for the 20-week version. Both results are unlikely to have occurred by chance, though results for the 30-week version are more secure; (3) The evaluation did not provide reliable evidence that either version of the programme had a positive impact on children's word-level literacy skills; (4) Teaching assistants delivering the programme reported that they found it difficult to devote enough time to it, and that support from senior staff was required to protect the programme time; and (5) Staff in participating schools reported that the programme had a positive impact on children's language skills and confidence. They thought that the factors which contributed to this included the small-group format, the activities covered, and the focus on narrative and vocabulary work.

AB  - PURPOSE: We investigated whether the treatment of bladder dysfunction in infants with congenital high grade vesicoureteral reflux could influence the spontaneous resolution rate of the reflux and the number of recurrent urinary tract infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 115 infants with high grade vesicoureteral reflux were included in a followup study of bladder function and reflux resolution between 1993 and 1999. The present study deals with 20 of these infants with mainly grade V reflux, most of whom had recurrent urinary tract infections in combination with high post-void residual and high bladder capacity. Treatment with clean intermittent catheterization was instituted during infancy in these 20 patients and continued until a median age of 4 years. RESULTS: Bladder capacity was high at presentation and at all followup investigations in the clean intermittent catheterization treated group. Moreover, residual urine was high at presentation and especially between ages 1 and 2 years. However, after bladder control was achieved this residual decreased and consisted mainly of reflux urine. In only 1 girl did reflux resolve spontaneously during the 4-year followup period. A total of 18 patients were treated surgically at the end of this period, and clean intermittent catheterization could be stopped a few months later in all but 2. Urinary tract infection recurrences were uncommon after the institution of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment of bladder dysfunction characterized by a high capacity bladder with poor emptying in infants with congenital high grade reflux does not influence the rate of spontaneous resolution. On the other hand, the tendency toward recurrent urinary tract infections appears to decrease with treatment.

AB  - A recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a dual parent and trainer-delivered qigong massage intervention for young children with autism resulted in improvement of measures of autism as well as improvement of abnormal sensory responses and self-regulation. The RCT evaluated the effects of the parent-delivered component of the intervention. Forty-seven children were randomly assigned to treatment and wait-list control groups. Treatment group children received the parent-delivered program for 4 mo. Trained therapists provided parent training and support. Improvement was evaluated in two settings—preschool and home—by teachers (blind to group) and parents. Results showed that the parent-delivered program was effective in improving measures of autism (medium effect size) and sensory and self-regulatory responses (large effect size). Teacher data on measures of autism were confirmed by parent data. Results indicate that the parent-delivered component of the program provided effective early intervention for autism that was suitable for delivery at home.

AB  - Used a model based on process data (data generated by the program); context (the ecology of therapeutic systems); input (the identification of what is different between 2 therapeutic systems); and product (the consequence of different inputs, taking account of context) evaluations to assess the progress of 12 Down's syndrome and 12 multiply handicapped children. Ss attended 2 therapeutic systems operated by the New Zealand Society for the Intellectually Handicapped (Auckland branch/outside Auckland branches) and were assessed 3 times at 6–8 mo intervals over 20 mo. Results show that the progress of Auckland Ss was significantly better in a number of areas than for those outside Auckland. This improvement in progress is attributed to input differences that reflected the Auckland branch's policy of service development. Findings suggest that the most important determinants of a successful program are not staff–student ratios, time in class, or specialist assistance (all of which favored the outside Auckland groups), but the degree of structure, detail of programs and assessments, and quality of parent contact (in which Auckland seemed superior). Results for Down's syndrome Ss compared favorably with those from other Down's syndrome programs. (45 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - There is international recognition of the importance of high quality services for young children with a consensus that three pillars contribute to quality improvement: adult: child ratios, staff qualifications and group size. In Australia over the past 5 years, early childhood policy has attempted to drive improvements in early childhood service quality through national regulations for both adult: child ratios and qualifications. However, a review of early childhood history demonstrates that service quality in the past tended to depend more on the dedication of staff who were expected to be emotionally rewarded through their caring roles rather than from the pay and status associated with their work. The current political direction in Australia is now tending again towards this latter position. We review the literature associated with both positions in relation to quality improvement and flag our concerns for the future.

AB  - Due to the prevalence of ADHD, there is a need for early intervention at the preschool level to improve children's chance of academic success in later years. Yet few preschool teachers are trained to meet the challenges children with ADHD present. This paper gives a rationale and curriculum for teacher training in ADHD, with an emphasis on Social Emotional Learning, Parent Training, and Field Experience with a Mentor.

AB  - In this review the empirical and theoretical literature on children’s autobiographical statements about child sexual abuse and other forms of maltreatment is discussed. It is concluded that experiences of child sexual abuse seems to be associated with a number of negative psychosocial outcomes. It is further concluded that even though children may remember experiences from the first and second years of life there is no reliable way by which details of childhood experiences can be reconstructed on the basis of preverbal memories. The literature on the suggestibility of preschool children suggests that children are capable of providing reliable testimonies about highly salient personal experiences such as sexual abuse, though a substantial proportion of children may choose not to when asked by professionals. However, suggestive interviewing practises, particularly when used with younger children will increase the risk of false allegations.

AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate norms and constructions of children in previous research concerning preschool children and digital technology. Digital technology is an important part of preschool activities. The number of children and preschool teachers who have access to computer tablets and clever boards in their everyday practice has increased in recent years (e.g. Couse &amp; Chen, 2010, Edwards, 2013). This development has led to the need of extended knowledge concerning the critical contextual factors of digital technology use in preschool context (e.g. Lindahl &amp; Folkesson, 2012). In the analysis of the material, social constructionism and discursive psychology (Wheterell &amp; Potter, 1992, Potter, 1996) were used. This paper is based on a critical integrative literature review (Torraco, 2005) regarding research on preschool children and digital technology. The review draws from a number of scholarly research articles conducted between 2000-2015. Ethical considerations were met by showing respect and responsiveness to other researchers work (e.g. codex.vr.se). Preliminary results indicate that children often are marginalised in research and focus is more likely to be on an adult's point of view (such as the teacher or the parent). In this sense, children have a weak ""voice"" in research regarding digital technology use in preschool, therefore, the lack of the child's perspective is evident. The results, we argue, have important implications for researchers, preschool teachers and teacher educators in further discussions of how, when and for what purposes digital technology should be used in preschool children's activities.

AB  - During recent years in Sweden the number of complaints regarding hearing related disorders from employees working in the preschool (kindergarten) has increased. It is often assumed that the size of the child group is the crucial factor associated with the high noise levels. However, the association between the noise levels and the size of the child group is not fully understood. Further, it is likely that the gender balance and the age of the children have an effect on the noise levels in the preschools. The aim of the study was to investigate the association between noise in the preschool and the constitution of the child group in terms of number of children, gender balance and the children’s age. Noise levels were recorded at 34 preschool sites in Sweden using stationary sound level meters with an external microphone mounted in the ceiling in the dining room and the play halls at each site. Sound level measurements were carried out during 2-3 days in each room during the entire workday. Data regarding the constitution of the child group for every day was collected at the end of the week from the enrollment list.

AB  - Historically, changes in preschool policy have been legitimized in relation to ideas about the preschool child and the various problems that the education of this child is supposed to be able to “solve”. From an early age, children have been considered the most effective tool for dealing with a variety of social, economic or environmental issues of central importance for maintaining and developing society.Against this background, the purpose of this thesis is to examine representations of the preschool child in different policy texts (textbooks, research- and educational policy) related to changing requirements and targets affecting contemporary Swedish preschools. Discursive constructions of the preschool child are considered as important central aspects, used to legitimize political reforms in accordance with pedagogical ideas and prevailing social contexts. The thesis focuses on the tensions within contemporary constructions of the preschool child in the so-called “knowledge economy”: i.e. the tensions between a competent child, who is both able and willing to take advantage of education, and a “newcomer” – the vulnerable child – in need of obtaining the benefits of education in order to be able to cope with the future.The simultaneously competent and vulnerable preschool child is thus an efficiently designed target for the interests of economic transnational organizations viewing education mainly in terms of human capital development, as well as an important factor for economic competitiveness.In the thesis’ final analysis, I study how the OECD, EU and IEA are developing methods for measuring and evaluating the results of preschool education, with the intention of being able to "streamline" it by finding universally successful concepts that are both cost-effective and of high quality. The construction of the preschool child as simultaneously competent and vulnerable is used to legitimize shifts in power over the definition of the Swedish preschool agenda, the fundamental ideas of what preschool is about, what its aims are, and for whom it is intended. As these ideas are disguised as being the result of supposedly "objective" forces far from the ideological contradictions of the political sphere, a critical discussion concerning the goals and aims of early childhood education becomes almost impossible to achieve.

AB  - In 2005, Scotland became the first nation to make breastfeeding in public a legal right, but current breastfeeding targets and maternity leave allowance do not acknowledge the conflicting demands women face when juggling employment and motherhood. This paper explores how employment and maternity leave relate to breastfeeding duration among mothers in Scotland. The Growing Up in Scotland national longitudinal cohort study of 5,217 babies born in 2004–2005 was used. Multivariate proportional hazards regression models were specified using one cross-sectional wave of data to predict breastfeeding duration. Mothers working as employees, full-time (Hazard Ratio 1.6) or part-time (HR1.3), had a higher risk of earlier breastfeeding cessation than non-working mothers. However, self-employed mothers did not differ significantly from non-working mothers in their breastfeeding patterns. Mothers who took longer maternity leave breastfed for longer. The relationships between employment, maternity leave and breastfeeding duration were significant when controlling for known predictors of breastfeeding. Younger mothers, those with less formal education, single mothers, those of white ethnic background, and first-time mothers were more likely to stop breastfeeding sooner, as has been noted in previous research. Employment and early return to work are both factors associated with a shorter duration of breastfeeding. More flexible working conditions and more generous employment leave could help to prolong breastfeeding among working mothers. Current health and employment policy in Scotland and the UK could be better coordinated so that working mothers have the adequate support to meet the conflicting demands of employment and motherhood.

AB  - The overall aim of this study is to contribute with knowledge about newly arrived children’s participation in communicative events and the communicative tools that are being practiced by them. The study takes its starting point in a sociocultural perspective on learning and is informed by Vygotsky´s (1896-1934) thoughts on development, which is learning taking place in interaction between people in a sociocultural context.Through participant observation combined with use of interaction analysis, a number of children´s interactions were observed and analyzed. Two newly arrived children were observed during their daily child-to-child interactions during a period of five months. Ethical considerations according to the Swedish research council have been addressed and the study has been approved by the Swedish Central Ethical Review Board.The result shows how newly arrived children participate by combining different communicative tools as speech, bodily language and materials when they shadow, mix languages, invent languages, use their voice, meta-communicates and use surrounding structures in interaction. The result also shows how the newly arrived children’s practice of communicative tools change from a salient bodily form to a more verbal form in a period of five months. This change in their practice of communicative tools leads to changed participation in communicative events in Swedish preschools. The study contributes with knowledge about how newly arrived children use various ways of approaching a new language (Swedish) and a new cultural context but also children´s informal learning which take place in interaction.

AB  - The overarching aim of the studies in this dissertation is to contribute knowledge about children’s shared social knowledge in their preschool peer cultures, regarding both content and how it is established and maintained. An ethnographic approach has been used to study the shared activities of children, aged 3-5, in the preschool. During 1 ½ years, one preschool setting was visited on a regular basis. One hundred hours of observation have been made and documented through video camera recordings and field notes. The theory of children’s peer cultures (Corsaro, 2005), positioning theory (Harré &amp; Langenhove, 1999a) and social representation theory (Moscovici, 2001) have been used as theoretical tools in the analyses. The empirical results are presented in four articles (articles I-IV) and are all illustrations of the children’s shared social knowledge. The findings are that children’s shared social knowledge involves two main aspects of knowledge about relations; how to establish and maintain relations vis-à-vis various tokens or social resources (articles III and IV), and how to create distance to relations (articles I and II). Another find is that there seems to be a tension between the children’s social knowledge and the social norms explicitly formulated in the studied preschool context.

AB  - The relationship between structural quality and process quality in early childhood education and care (ECEC) has been addressed in several studies. However, the findings are not conclusive. The present study was conducted in the Netherlands, which has a strongly regulated mid-quality ECEC system regarding structural aspects, with still considerable variation in process quality. The study employed a multi-method approach and extended the existing research in two ways. First, both observations of teacher–child interactions as well as teacher-reported developmental and educational activities were included as indicators of comprehensive emotional and educational process quality constructs. Second, to examine the relation between process quality and structural quality, commonly studied structural quality characteristics were complemented by less frequently studied measures of the professional development activities and education programs implemented at the centers. Results indicate that group size and child-to-teacher ratio are not related to emotional and educational process quality in the Dutch ECEC system. Teachers’ formal pre-service education has a positive, but small association with emotional process quality. The use of an education program and professional development activities at the center show the strongest associations with emotional and educational process quality. Implications for policy and practice are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

AB  - The present study investigated the measurement properties of the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS) Toddler using data from 276 classrooms and 375 teachers in Dutch early childhood education and care provisions. First, confirmatory factor analyses based on the CLASS Toddler indicators confirmed the eight-dimension structure of the instrument. Second, a three-domain structure, involving Emotional Support, Behavioral Support and Engaged Support for Learning, fitted the data better than the commonly found two-domain structure that combines Emotional and Behavioral Support into one domain. Third, using Item Response Theory (IRT), we found good item difficulty and discrimination parameters of the CLASS Toddler indicators. Finally, significant associations were found between the CLASS Toddler domains and children-to-staff ratio, teachers' work experience and provided play and literacy activities, supporting the criterion validity of the instrument. Taken together, these results showed adequate measurement quality of the CLASS Toddler. Implications for practice are discussed.

AB  - This report concerns the results of Phase III of the National Day Care Study (NDCS). Phases I and II were preparatory to the experimental manipulations conducted in Phase III, and are reported elsewhere. Thirty-two day care centers in Atlanta and 16 each in Detroit and Seattle were selected for participation in the study. NDCS resources allowed for the selection of three cities: Atlanta, Detroit, and Seattle. These sites were chosen because they showed sufficient variability on the main independent variables to allow for the logical generalization of study effects to day care centers not included in the study sample. A consistent pattern of results emerged across different data sets and indicators of quality. The quality of the day care experience for young children was found to be significantly affected by the way in which both the psychological and physical environment is organized. NDCS results have helped to clarify the dynamics of center-based care for young children. Previously, staff-child ratio was thought to be the prime structural ingredient in assuring a good experience for young children in day care. The study concludes that federal regulations governing day care center subsidies should (1) tighten the ceiling on group size while relaxing the stringency of caregiver-child ratios, and (2) require caregivers to have child-related training/education. Since only ratio is strongly related to cost, implementing these conclusions would result in better care for children at lower cost. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Describes the nature of children's oral language experiences in Head Start and other preschool programs serving low-income families and relates those experiences to broader features of the classrooms' programs. Finds that small class size, teacher education levels, and developmentally appropriate curricula are positively associated with high levels of teacher-child interaction and child language development.

AB  - Identified kindergarten through third grade teachers' perceptions of factors related to success of inclusive classrooms. Found that teachers shared a strong belief in the fundamental value of inclusion. Themes affecting perceptions indicated a need for more adequate and focused training, better consideration of classroom load factors, more reliable support, and more time to meet increased planning and collaborative demands.

AB  - The 2011 edition of the "Digest of Education Statistics" is the 47th in a series of publications initiated in 1962. The "Digest" has been issued annually except for combined editions for the years 1977-78, 1983-84, and 1985-86. Its primary purpose is to provide a compilation of statistical information covering the broad field of American education from prekindergarten through graduate school. The "Digest" includes a selection of data from many sources, both government and private, and draws especially on the results of surveys and activities carried out by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). To qualify for inclusion in the "Digest," material must be nationwide in scope and of current interest and value. The publication contains information on a variety of subjects in the field of education statistics, including the number of schools and colleges, teachers, enrollments, and graduates, in addition to data on educational attainment, finances, federal funds for education, libraries, and international comparisons. Supplemental information on population trends, attitudes on education, education characteristics of the labor force, government finances, and economic trends provides background for evaluating education data. Although the "Digest" contains important information on federal education funding, more detailed information on federal activities is available from federal education program offices. The "Digest" contains seven chapters: All Levels of Education, Elementary and Secondary Education, Postsecondary Education, Federal Programs for Education and Related Activities, Outcomes of Education, International Comparisons of Education, and Libraries and Adult Education. Preceding these chapters is an Introduction that provides a brief overview of current trends in American education, which supplements the tabular materials in chapters 1 through 7. The "Digest" concludes with three appendices. The first appendix, Guide to Sources, provides a brief synopsis of the surveys used to generate the "Digest" tables; the second, Definitions, is included to help readers understand terms used in the "Digest"; and the third, Index of Table Numbers, allows readers to quickly locate tables on specific topics. (Contains 29 figures and 450 tables.) [For Appendices, see ED544581. For "Digest of Education Statistics, 2010. NCES 2011-015," see ED518987.]

The publication contains information on a variety of subjects in the field of education statistics, including the number of schools and colleges, teachers, enrollments, and graduates, in addition to data on educational attainment, finances, federal funds for education, libraries, and international comparisons. Supplemental information on population trends, attitudes on education, education characteristics of the labor force, government finances, and economic trends provides background for evaluating education data. Although the "Digest" contains important information on federal education funding, more detailed information on federal activities is available from federal education program offices. The "Digest" contains seven chapters: (1) All Levels of Education; (2) Elementary and Secondary Education; (3) Postsecondary Education; (4) Federal Programs for Education and Related Activities: (5) Outcomes of Education; (6) International Comparisons of Education; and (7) Libraries and Adult Education. Preceding these chapters is an Introduction that provides a brief overview of current trends in American education, which supplements the tabular materials in chapters 1 through 7. The "Digest" concludes with three appendices. The first appendix, Guide to Sources, provides a brief synopsis of the surveys used to generate the "Digest" tables; the second, Definitions, is included to help readers understand terms used in the "Digest"; and the third, Index of Table Numbers, allows readers to quickly locate tables on specific topics. (Contains 493 tables and 29 figures. Individual chapters contain footnotes) [For Appendices, see ED544579. For "Digest of Education Statistics, 2011. NCES 2012-001," see ED544580.]

AB  - The 2014 edition of the "Digest of Education Statistics" is the 50th in a series of publications initiated in 1962. The Digest has been issued annually except for combined editions for the years 1977-78, 1983-84, and 1985-86. Its primary purpose is to provide a compilation of statistical information covering the broad field of American education from prekindergarten through graduate school. The Digest includes a selection of data from many sources, both government and private, and draws especially on the results of surveys and activities carried out by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES).

AB  - New approaches to examining the language environment are putting greater emphasis on the use of highly naturalistic audio recordings and questions about cross-cultural differences in children’s real-world language experiences. These new approaches and questions require careful examination of different kinds of variables that may influence children’s language experiences. The current study examines the influence of the number of adults and adult:child ratio on the number of words heard by young children across three childcare settings (home, home daycare and daycare centre). The home setting was characterized by a high number of one-on-one interactions, while children in daycare centres were exposed to larger numbers of adults present. While a linear relationship was found between the number/ratio of adults and words heard in the home setting, these relationships were more complex in daycare centres, and no relationships were found in home daycares.

AB  - Understanding the effects of class size reduction (CSR) has been an enduring issue in education. For the past 3 decades, Project STAR has stimulated research and policy discussions regarding the effects of CSR on a variety of outcomes. Schanzenbach (2007) reviewed STAR studies and concluded that small classes improved student academic outcomes. Since her review, however, some research has challenged this conclusion. This paper reviews these recent challenges, comparing past and recent studies. This review is considered together with studies on large-scale CSR policies in the US and CSR studies outside the US. We conclude by suggesting a direction for future research.

AB  - In secondary analyses of National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development data, multiple indicators of quality (caregiver wages and turnover; child/staff ratio; caregiver education and professionalism; positive caregiving) were compared between child care centers by sector (for-profit/nonprofit) and subsector (for-profit independent/chain, nonprofit church/nonchurch) at multiple points from infancy through prekindergarten. Nonprofit centers evidenced higher caregiver wages and education at most ages and better quality child/staff ratios, turnover, caregiver professionalism, and positive caregiving for toddlers and preschoolers. Subsector differences in preschool classrooms were more complex. In general, quality was higher in nonprofit non-religiously affiliated centers, intermediate in nonprofit religiously affiliated and for-profit independent centers, and lower in for-profit chains, but differences were not found on every indicator or between every group. Further, for-profit chain status predicted lower quality positive caregiving, controlling for family characteristics, staff, and structural quality, at 54 months, but not 36 months. Results support and extend prior research by controlling for family characteristics. Policy implications regarding supply- and demand-side quality-improvement strategies that address market competition and parent choice across subsectors are discussed.

AB  - Building on prior variable-oriented research which demonstrates the independence of the associations of child care quality, quantity, and type of setting with family factors and child outcomes, the current study identifies four profiles of child care dimensions from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development. Profiles accounted for 73% of total variance in 10 child care variables measured for 489 6-month-olds in nonparental child care including type of setting, quantity of care, and structural/process quality indicators. Dominant marker variables were used to label the four profiles which revealed complex patterns. Lower family risk, especially higher maternal education, was associated with profiles marked by features associated with better child outcomes, but only maternal belief in the harm of maternal employment protected against child care profiles with features associated with poorer child outcomes. By allowing child care characteristics to correlate freely with dimension profiles using a person-oriented approach, results facilitate examination of the contributions of each individual characteristic to each profile, suggesting ways to improve child care provision and to examine child care selection.

AB  - The racial mismatch between teachers and students has become a salient issue in efforts to counter the historical failure of children of Color in American (pre)schools. To address this mismatch, scholars have argued for the critical need to recruit and retain teachers of Color. In this article, we propose that to successfully prepare teachers of Color so that they remain committed to the profession, we must learn from their experiences during their preservice preparation and their first years of teaching. Against the backdrop of normative institutional discourses shaping teachers and teaching, we sought to learn from the ways in which six early career early childhood teachers of Color reconciled their preservice teacher education experiences, identities, and beliefs about education with the construction of their identities as teachers. To do so, we asked: How do the discursive spaces of early childhood teaching and teacher education shape the practices, beliefs, and identities of early childhood teachers of Color during their teacher education programs and within their three first years of teaching? Through Critical Narrative Analysis of in-depth interviews, we sought to unveil the discourses that shape and are shaped by the experiences of early career early childhood teachers of Color. Findings indicate that instead of being colonized by institutional discourses and oppressed by others' perceptions, to remain in the profession, these early career early childhood teachers challenged and appropriated institutional discourses, reauthoring them agentively. Implications underscore the responsibility of teacher education programs in preparing teachers of Color to negotiate the ever-so-normative discursive space of early childhood teaching and teacher education, if they are to enter and remain in the profession.

AB  - Background: Racism remains a deep-rooted and pervasive feature of U.S. society. Racist ideas, defined by Ibram X. Kendi as "any concept that regards one racial group as inferior or superior to another racial group in any way," are major topographies in the current landscape of teacher education. Focus: Rejecting the production of racial inequities as an unavoidable outcome of teacher education, in this article, a university-based teacher educator of color and an early childhood teacher/teacher educator of color unveil the complex sociospatial dialectic of teacher education across settings. Positioning mapping as a possible pathway for coauthoring a counternarrative that rejects teacher education's first spaces, characterized by the overvaluation of White ontologies, Eurocentric epistemologies, and ideologies that deem university-based knowledge superior, they identified and mapped inequities across the physical, relational, and pedagogical locations where teacher education occurs. They considered the following questions: (a) How are teacher education programs positioning intersectionally minoritized students of color, their families, and communities? (b) What are the spaces in which power has been--and continues to be--inscribed and reinforced by Whiteness as the norm in teacher education programs and practices? (c) How can teacher educators of color across teacher education settings interrupt inequities in teacher education by disrupting the location of teacher education? Research Design: Through a three-year collaborative participatory research project, the authors engaged with critical race spatial analysis to read the landscape of teacher education, naming its sociospatial injustices--writ large and as situated within their immediate contexts and lives--in addressing the first two research questions. Then, they sought to interrupt these mapped realities by re-mediating teacher education, understanding that perhaps it is the tools and artifacts, and/or the learning environments, that must be reorganized in ways to foster deep, meaningful, and transformative learning, thereby addressing the third question. Practice: Working to transform the inequitable status quo of teacher education, they worked to build a horizontal collaboration marked by intellectual interdependence and shared expertise across physical, relational, and pedagogical spaces, thereby moving to transform teacher education through the re-mediation of its traditional first space and the design of a third space. The kind of horizontal partnership they negotiated was in stark contrast to dominant and prevalent vertically organized teacher education partnerships, which position universities as having more importance, expertise, and legitimacy than schools--in disconnected ways. Conclusions: This article unveils the ways in which current models of teacher education continue to pathologize intersectionally minoritized populations and produce inequities as design features. The collaboration the authors codesigned enabled pedagogical third spaces for transformation and offers an example of what is possible in and through teacher education. In a situated way, it offers insights into how teacher educators and schoolteachers can collaboratively work toward equity and justice in and through teaching and teacher education.

AB  - Aim: To determine if a suitable method of measuring nursing workload could be developed in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). Background: Nursing is a multifunctioning activity and previous methods measuring the demand for nurses do not put enough emphasis on the individual capabilities. The reporting of NICU activity has traditionally been related to bed occupancy and the number of infants requiring ventilator support. A classification system based on activity, hours of care and nursing staff ratios has been used; however, it does not consider the clinical ability of the individual nurses. Methods: A 5-month prospective study was undertaken in which nurses in two NICUs scored their patients' level of dependency and professional assessment of the level of intensity of care required by the infants in each shift. In addition, serial measures of severity of illness scores for each patient were collected. Key issues: The study identified methods of measuring workload that consider the individual nurse's ability and contributing organizational factors. We found that the estimates of nursing hours using the two traditional dependency measures did not match the current practice or take into account the skill of the nurses. A method in which the nurses indicated the intensity of nursing care required by their patients was suitable one for capturing their individual capabilities. System factors were also found to contribute to the nursing workload. Conclusions: It is not sufficient to use patient acuity or severity of illness alone. Other factors such as the nurse's assessment of the intensity of care required and the organizational factors are important components of workload estimates.

AB  - Conducted a study to estimate the validity of and obtain norms for the Hyperactivity Rating Scale. Teachers rated 1,337 children (Whites, Blacks, Orientals, and Chicanos) in kindergarten through Grade 4. Teacher ratings of 45 hyperactive children (of kindergarten through Grade 7 age) referred by physicians were also obtained. Although hyperactive and norm means were clearly separated, a nontrivival portion of hyperactive children had teacher ratings within the normal range. Norm data were factor-analyzed, and a hyperactivity factor was identified. Behaviors with the highest loadings on the hyperactivity factor yielded the largest differences between hyperactive and norm groups. Within the norm group, Blacks had the highest hyperactive ratings and Orientals the lowest. Hyperactivity ratings were slightly higher for boys than for girls.

AB  - Described service provider perspectives regarding outcome goals of children's day treatment and their ideas for how to make day treatment programs successful in achieving stated outcomes. Respondents were 73 direct service staff from 10 day treatment programs. Data were obtained through nominal group process methods. The primary outcome goals of day treatment were community re-integration, improved adaptive functioning skills, psychological growth, and improved family functioning. Aspects of day treatment that may help achieve outcome targets included team quality; comprehensive programming; a consistent, safe, accepting program environment; an individualized developmental approach; links with other services; family involvement; and a low staff-to-client ratio. Outcome goals are discussed relative to those described within the research literature on children's mental health services. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Research on environmental education and education for sustainable development is an expanding field in educational research in Europe, as well as worldwide. With EERA celebrating 20 year, and the Decade for Education on Sustainable Development (DESD) in its final year, it is possible to make a halt for discussions of the present with perspectives of both the past and the future. Based on empirical findings on Eco-School teachers’ and instructors’ views on the appropriateness of including different sustainability-promoting actions in their teaching practices, this paper will discuss actions in relation to the Action Competence perspective, and tensions that manifests in educational settings between educational ideals of socialisation and educational ideas of liberal autonomy (Bildung), as well as, what is seen as private matter and what it is seen as part of the educational commission. From the perspective of Action Competence, and the educational ideal of Bildung, it has been claimed, as one of the dominating standpoints in the academic ESD-debate concerning the purpose of sustainability-promoting actions in education, that the actions are there, not to solve the unsustainability problems in the world, but to educate the students. The importance in ESD of learning critical decision taking in choices of actions as a citizen in a democratic society, nationally and globally has been stressed. The study is based on the premise that the inclusion of actions in teaching practices depends on teachers’ choices of lecturing, which to some degree is in turn dependent on their experience during teacher training, and explores Eco-School teachers’ and instructors’ views on the appropriateness of including different sustainability-promoting actions in teaching. As the importance of action for sustainability is highlighted in the Eco-Schools’ curricula, there are incitements for teachers at Eco-Schools to consider the inclusion of different sustainability-promoting actions in their teaching, either in terms of information and discussions about possible actions or in terms of student participation in actions. However, critique has been raised from the perspective of the need for education not to neglect the urgency of solving sustainability issues. Also, the Action Competence perspective, although based on a Bildung perspective, has been criticised for being just another form of socialisation. In addition to this, the liberal ideal of autonomy has been questioned. This paper will discuss how Eco-School teachers and instructors relate to different forms of actions, indirect/direct and individual/collective, that may take part in the private or the public sphere and be seen as personal or political. In relation to this, the Action Competence perspective will be discussed in perspectives of the present, past and future and the tensions that manifests in educational settings between educational ideals of socialisation and educational ideals of liberal autonomy (Bildung), as well as, what is seen as private matter and what it is seen as part of the educational commission. Method Interviews with 24 Eco-School teachers at a dozen schools in southern Sweden, from pre-school to upper secondary school, and 9 Eco-School instructors employed by the Green Flag organisation at different locations in Sweden, were conducted based on a semi-structured interview protocol. Informants were asked to grade from 1-6 the appropriateness of 16 different sustainability-promoting actions to include in their teaching practices. The actions were chosen to grasp a diversity in types of actions, as well as motives for preferences for specific actions in teaching. More than 20 hours of interviews were transcribed verbatim, and were analysed with a mixed method approach including both quantitative and qualitative analyses. Mathematical and statistical analyses were made in Excel and SPSS for the groups of teachers and instructors respectively, and as a comparison between the two groups. A qualitative content analysis was made (in Nvivo) on the informants reasoning when justifying their ratings of each of the sustainability-promoting actions from the question: ‘What do the teachers refer to when they justify their positions? Expected Outcomes Preliminary results show that different direct actions, and actions which take place in the private sphere were viewed by Eco-School teachers and instructors as the most appropriate actions to include in teaching practices. However, actions related to individuals as consumers were seen by teachers as less appropriate than by the instructors, and have consequently been included less in teaching practices. The actions that were deemed least appropriate by both groups were two indirect actions occurring in the public sphere and aiming at solutions on a structural level, engaging with political parties and engaging with NGOs. They did not seem to have a repertoire of teaching approaches that would allow them to work with issues where social norms diverge strongly. This paper will discuss how Eco-School teachers and instructors relate to different forms of actions, indirect/direct and individual/collective, that may take part in the private or the public sphere and be seen as personal or political. In relation to this, the Action Competence perspective will be discussed in perspectives of the present, past and future and the tensions that manifests in educational settings between educational ideals of socialisation and educational ideas of liberal autonomy (Bildung), as well as, what is seen as private matter and what it is seen as part of the educational commission.

AB  - This article reports on collaborative action research in twelve northern rural and Indigenous communities in four Canadian provinces. Pre-kindergarten, kindergarten, grade one, and Aboriginal Head Start teachers worked with university researchers in three universities to create action research projects with the aim of supporting children’s oral language and writing through play in their classrooms. Inductive analysis of focus group data shows that teachers gained understandings about play as a context both for supporting and for authentic assessment of young children’s oral language. The building of trusting relationships, built through ongoing collaboration with colleagues within their schools and across four provinces, in addition to collaboration with university researchers over a number of years, was viewed as particularly influential to teachers’ professional learning. Additionally, teachers talked about the value of opportunities to contribute to the development of teaching and assessment tools. Participating teachers came to see themselves as making valuable contributions to professional knowledge beyond their northern communities. The 4R’s for conducting research in Indigenous contexts (reciprocity, respect, relevance, and responsibility) provide a framework for deriving implications from this collaborative research. It is important that the results of collaborative action research conducted in rural and Indigenous schools be widely disseminated to provide alternative perspectives to curriculum, research and practice that tend to be urban-oriented.

AB  - 32 male and 32 female kindergartners interacted with a female E who was either warm and friendly (nurturance) or neutral and task oriented (no nurturance). The E then went into an adjoining room, either to help a child there in response to mild distress cues (modeling) or to check on a child there (no modeling). Subsequently all Ss heard sounds of severe distress from the adjoining room while they were alone. Modeling and nurturance significantly increased attempts to help the distressed child. It is suggested that nurturance has an independent effect on behavior, and may have decreased fear of disapproval by Ss for possibly inappropriate behavior. Helping behavior was negatively related to family size. Correlations between teachers' ratings of Ss and their helping behavior were positive for boys and negative for girls. (28 ref.)

AB  - The use of controversial practices unsupported by research is a concern in special education, especially for students with high support needs. Internet sites of Australian schools enrolling students with moderate to severe intellectual disability (moderate to severe learning difficulties) were located and reviewed to determine the kinds of controversial practices employed and the number of schools reporting their use. Almost half the sample reported utilising at least one unsupported practice and in general there were few convincing rationales provided for the adoption of these practices. The use of unsupported practices in schools may be related to the inaccessibility of research, teacher mistrust of research, teacher reliance on more informal and personal sources of information, and teacher desire to achieve results and build positive relationships. More research is needed to understand why these practices are adopted and the ways in which they are used. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

AB  - In its political ambitions and pedagogical spirit to address an increasingly diverse population, the Swedish national curriculum for the preschool contains contradictory or even conflicting goals. On the one hand, the curriculum stipulates openness to, tolerance for and appreciation of cultural, ethnic, religious and social differences, and respect for the unique background of children. On the other hand, it stresses universal human rights and the fundamental values of Swedish society. How preschool teachers work with and make sense of such contradictory or even conflicting goals in everyday practice is the focus of this text. The research questions are: (1) How do preschool teachers describe the challenges they face in their daily work when they attempt to honour the stipulations of the curriculum? (2) Which strategies do they describe as using to manage these challenges? The empirical material consists of 14 focus group interviews with 41 preschool teachers from two highly ethnically and culturally diverse urban areas of metropolitan Stockholm. Results suggest that there are a number of recurring preschool situations where cultural and religious differences lead to dilemmas and potential friction between children, preschool teachers and parents. Results also show that the preschool curriculum provides little guidance and instead the preschool teachers must develop their own strategies to handle children’s and parents’ expectations and demands, for instance by using the children as cultural intermediaries. Overall, the preschool teachers adopt strategies that enable them to avoid “difficult” situations, which in effect risks placing the challenges on the shoulders of the children.

AB  - Denne oppgaven omhandler verdikonflikter i barnehager i Bodø. Vi har ønsket å se nærmere på hvordan økonomiske verdier påvirker barnehagens kvalitative innhold, og da med særlig fokus på hvilke verdikonflikter som oppleves av de som står i fenomenet, samt hvordan slike konflikter blir håndtert i praksis. For å belyse problemstillingene har vi innenfor en teoretisk fortolkningsramme sammenlignet barnehagens verdigrunnlag med verdier som ligger til grunn for henholdsvis nyklassisk og økologisk økonomisk teori. Dette har så dannet grunnlag for fortolkningen av innhentede empiriske data, der vi har sett på verdikonflikter og prioriteringer med hensyn til tid og effektivitetshensyn driftsmidler, bemanning og økonomisk handlingsrom kosthold og måltider samt barnehagens ytre politiske og økonomiske kontekst. Vårt teoretiske rammeverk har vært basert på relevant økonomisk teori, samt kritisk systemteori, paradigmeteori og moralfilosofisk teori. I tillegg har vi tatt utgangspunkt i sentrale skriftlige publikasjoner som barnehagelovens formålsparagraf og rammeplan for barnehagens oppgaver og innhold. Vi har valgt en kvalitativ metode og en ontologisk hermeneutisk tilnærming til datainnsamlingen. Vi har benyttet semistrukturerte samtaler, med fokus på åpen og likeverdig dialog. Utvalget har bestått av styrere i seks ulike private og kommunale barnehager i Bodø, og vi har tolket deres uttalelser i lys av det teoretiske rammeverket. Gjennom vår studie mener vi å ha funnet bevis for at barnehagens verdigrunnlag i langt større grad samsvarer med verdier i økologisk økonomi, enn med verdier i nyklassisk økonomi. Videre har vi funnet at samtlige styrere opplever verdikonflikter knyttet til økonomiske hensyn, om enn i noe ulik grad. Det er særlig i forhold til tidspress og effektivitetshensyn, bemanning og økonomisk handlingsrom at slike konflikter erfares, og i mange tilfeller får dette negative følger for både barn og ansatte. Verdikonfliktene må derfor kunne sies å ha stor påvirkning på det kvalitative innholdet i barnehagen. I forhold til effektivitetskrav ser vi at de ansatte ofte kjenner tidspress på kropp og sinn, og at arbeidsdagen oppleves hektisk og til tider kaotisk. De har sjeldent dager der de har tid til å snakke med alle barna, og også de små påvirkes av høyt stressnivå. Stadige brudd i rutinene forsterker problemet. Langtidsplanlegging og utviklingsarbeid vil ofte svekkes eller utgå. For å møte effektivitetskravene prøver styrerne å spare tid ved å løse arbeidsoppgaver på kreative måter. I mange sammenhenger blir det imidlertid valgt harelabb, noe som blant annet gjør at de ikke får gått så dypt inn i rammeplanen som de hadde ønsket. Det kommer tydelig frem at styrerne ønsker seg flere hender og fang til barna. Det er ikke nødvendigvis det at de har veldig få ansatte, men det høye barnetallet gjør at det blir for få voksne i forhold til å klare å ivareta alle de små på en god nok måte. Noen ønsker seg derfor først og fremst færre barn i barnehagen, men de aller fleste ville gjerne hatt flere ansatte. Sykefravær fører til stadige behov for vikarer, men dette blir et kostnadsspørsmål som styrerne må vurdere nøye opp mot for eksempel innkjøp av utstyr til barna. Generelt oppleves det økonomiske handlingsrommet som trangt. Videre har vi sett at effektivitets- og økonomiske hensyn ofte påvirker barnehagens forhold til kosthold og måltider. Det er innført mange tidsbesparende tiltak som omfatter innkjøp av matvarer og måltidenes innhold. Alle barnehagene unntatt én lager egen lunsj til barna, men utover brød og pålegg kan dette ofte bli kjappe og billige løsninger, som ikke nødvendigvis er det mest sunne og næringsrike. Vi har også oppdaget at det ytre politiske og økonomiske systemet oppleves som begrensende, urettferdig og lite realistisk. Da særlig med hensyn til bemanningsnorm og rammen for offentlige tilskudd, men også i forhold til manglende forståelse for det som foregår i barnehagene, og det som er mulig å gjennomføre innenfor de gitte rammene. En del styrere opplever å ta valg som strider mot deres egne verdinormer, og dette oppleves som vanskelig. I de fleste barnehagene tas imidlertid også valg på tvers av lønnsomhetshensyn, blant annet i forhold til innkjøp av kvalitetsmateriell, samt utflukter og andre kostnads- og bemanningskrevende aktiviteter med barna. Økonomiske verdier må totalt sett kunne sies i stor grad å ha negativ innvirkning på det kvalitative innholdet i barnehagen. Samtidig foregår det mye kreativ problemløsning i barnehagene for å imøtekomme aktuelle verdikonflikter i praksis. En del styrere har fokus på samarbeid med andre styrere gjennom kollegiale nettverk, og erfarer at dette både kan dempe opplevelsen av konflikt, i tillegg til at de på denne måten kan oppdage nye og konkrete forslag til løsninger. Vi mener det er grunnlag for å si at det generelt er behov for en økende grad av helhetlig tenking rundt problemkomplekset for å redusere negative konsekvenser av økonomiske rasjonalitetshensyn med hensyn til barnehagenes kvalitative innhold. Dette innebærer tettere dialog mellom barnehagene og omgivelsene, gjennom styrking av eksisterende nettverk, og videre mener vi det er behov for økt grad av transdisiplinære tilnærminger.

AB  - During the 1970s the day care centrs expanded in Sweden. Since then a large number of children have attended such centers. For the first time in western history peiople grew up in two systems: the family home and the day care center. The aim of the present study is to find out how young people look upon growing up in a day care center. The children´s perspective is related to the perspective of adults to find out if and in what respects they differ. The study is based upon Bronfenbrenner´s ecologiacal theory of human development. Stern and Emde are used as complementary authorities.Forty young people, 16-17 years old, from middle and lower classes in Stockholm participating in the Family Support and Development (FAST) project from approximately four years of age, were interviewed about their memories of their childhood in daycare centers. They were asked about their pshysical, social and emotional environments and their daily schedule.their narratives are related both to observations from the time when they were approximately four years old and to their situation today including school results, interests and views of the future. Their memories agree with the observations and their school results are good. They have a great belief in their future. They memorize according to strong positive or negative emotions. Situations in which they are personally involved are most important.The results show that three young people dislike the day care center mostly because of their experience of loss of interest and lack of affecrton from the pre-schoolteachers. The remaining 37 young people see the day care center as a complement to their family home. None of the youngsters would like to grow up "only" at home. The childhood is looked upon ass a whole and not as being part of two systems. Most important are the companions and playing together with them. In their own world and in the hidden curriculum the children explored the world. In addition there is a demand also for learning to read and write. They look upon the pre-school teachers as significant adults - not having the same importance as the parents - but serving as models. Adults are sorted out according to those who understand children and those who do not. Humor is of great importance as well as the adult´s grasping ofthe child´s wish to perceive reality from a child´s perspective. Most important is the grown up´s ability to comprehend the child and to let the child be the person he or she feels himself to be.

AB  - In the present study, we present analyzed profiles of observed classroom experiences in terms of emotional and instructional dimensions of quality. Over 800 first-grade classrooms across the United States were included, selected by virtue of having a student participating in the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development’s Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development enrolled in the classroom. Our aim was to present a typology of first grades. We examined correlates of classroom profiles in terms of teacher (years of experience, education, and beliefs), child (gender, ethnicity, family socioeconomic status, maternal education, and preschool achievement), and school (public vs. private, class size, presence of teachers’ assistants) characteristics. Data were collected via teacher and parent questionnaires, classroom observations conducted by trained data collectors using the Classroom Observation System for First Grade, and individually administered child assessments (Woodcock Johnson Psycho-educational Battery Revised Tests of Cognitive Ability and Tests of Achievement). Findings indicated discernible, replicable types of first-grade classrooms (descriptively titled high quality, mediocre quality, low quality, and positive emotional climate/lower academic demand) that demonstrated different levels of emotional and instructional support and were related to several of the characteristics of children, families, teachers, and schools listed above. Of note, characteristics such as teachers’ years of experience and class size were not differentially related to the four classroom types.

AB  - This thesis is a total coverage survey of the municipal preschool management structure. In the late 90's the preschool in Sweden became the first step in the overall educational system. It became a pedagogical activity similar to school with respect to form and content. Although the focus was on education, political voices reclaimed the unique nature of preschool i.e. educare. It became a preschool in transition between its own tradition and modernization. The idea is that the educational management structure should support a pedagogical leadership that directs the pedagogical activity towards preschool objectives. The local authority sets the structure for management in pre-school; a municipality that in itself is an institution with its own goals and objectives. These objectives can place the municipalities in the cross pressure between their own objectives and the ones for preschool. The question in this respect is; How is the management structure formed and why? Is it a structure formed with the intention of creating educational management for the local preschool or are there other factors that guide the design? A framework based on the historical background of the preschools and theoretical terms such as steering, leading, management, pedagogical leadership, educational activity, etc. was constructed. Results are based on an online questionnaire survey. 180 municipalities out of 290 answered the questionnaire, which gives a response rate at 62 %. The response rate is evenly distributed across municipal categories, categories that the municipalities were aggregated into, formed by The Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions. The categories were handled as survey units, to support a part of the analysis and to allow a comparison between the municipalities by municipality size, both demographic and geographic. The material was analysed using the SPSS statistical program and compiled and reported with descriptive statistics. Descriptive statistics were used to demonstrate the material's characteristics and the central tendency.The results show that the municipalities’ structure of management is varied. Different municipal categories do not change this varied picture of the management landscape significantly. Although the management structure varies regarding how many levels with formal titles and which positions and functions they should have, there is a consistency in which title that the formal leader for the preschool have. The municipalities primarily utilise a principalship with mixed responsibility for both preschool and school. In light of these results, do municipalities mould a structure for the educational management for the pedagogical activities in preschool? Yes and no: the municipalities do not form a structure for preschool alone. Results show that the municipalities' main purpose is not to create a line of management specifically for the preschool. The municipalities form a management structure for educational purposes dealing with an educational activity from preschool to elementary school. The new Education Act (2010:800), is a step toward distinguishing preschool leadership from school leadership and turns the leadership of preschools into a title solely for the position and function of preschool educational activities.

AB  - Reflecting on the field of feminist science studies, one can see several glaring patterns emerge. The metaphor of the pipeline has endured as the metaphor in discussions of the recruitment and retention of girls and women in science. The metaphor invokes a long pipe leading from kindergarten to the scientific laboratory with leaks as a figure for the attrition of women and students of color. It is common to hear of leaks along the entire pipeline. The metaphor travels into retention issues, with strategies to plug the leaks, therefore pouring more women and students of color into the laboratories of science. If feminist science studies teach us anything, it is that metaphors and language are powerful and evocative; they embody dreams and visions. In comparison to a liberal feminist model of feminism, a perusal of feminist science studies shows a diversity of feminism(s). As I elaborated earlier in this essay, feminists have employed a number of analytic tools, in addition to the tools of gender equity, in their analysis of science. Reducing feminism to the goal of equity misrepresents feminist studies of science. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - "Success for All" ("SFA")[R] is a comprehensive school reform model that includes a reading, writing, and oral language development program for students in pre-kindergarten through grade eight. Its underlying premise is that all children can and should be reading at grade level by the end of third grade and then remain at grade level thereafter. Classroom reading instruction is delivered in daily 90-minute blocks to students grouped by reading ability. Immediate intervention with tutors who are certified teachers is given each day to those students who are having difficulty reading at the same level as their classmates. A full-time "SFA"[R] facilitator employed by the school supports classroom instruction by training teachers, overseeing student assessments, and assisting with decisions about group placement and tutoring. Family Support Teams work on parent involvement, absenteeism, and student behavior. This intervention report focuses on the reading instructional component of "SFA"[R], which is often implemented in the context of the highly structured "SFA"[R] whole school reform program. Although the whole school reform program has key components that are implemented in each school, school sites may vary considerably in the number of personnel used to implement "SFA"[R], particularly tutors and family support staff. The reading curricula are essentially the same at all schools, with each school receiving the same training, coaching support, and materials. Ratings presented in this report are not disaggregated by the variations in implementation of whole school reforms. Reading outcomes from all studies included in this report are examined together and formed the basis for a single effectiveness rating for each outcome domain. What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) reviewed 74 studies on "Success for All"[R]. One of these studies met WWC evidence standards; six studies met WWC evidence standards with reservations; the remaining studies did not meet WWC evidence screens. Based on the seven studies, the WWC found potentially positive effects in the alphabetics and general reading achievement domains, and mixed effects in the comprehension domain. The evidence presented in this report is based on available research and may change as new studies emerge. (Contains 26 footnotes.)

AB  - This study examined characteristics of child care centers associated with preschoolers' moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and sedentary behavior while in child care (MVPA-C, SB-C), and attributes of outdoor play areas associated with the same behaviors during outdoor time (MVPA-O, SB-O). Participants were 89 children (3 -5 years) recruited from 10 child care centers in Brisbane, Australia. Children's activity was measured by accelerometer over a 3-day period. Center characteristics and outdoor play area attributes were identified through survey and observation. We found that children were mostly sedentary while in child care. Lower child-staff ratios and using indoor play areas for motor activity were associated with more MVPA-C and less SB-C. Fixed play equipment in outdoor areas was conducive to more MVPA-O and less SB-O. This study suggests the possibility of enhancing preschoolers' activity levels through changing these attributes. Further research with more centers from diverse settings is needed to test these findings. (Contains 4 tables.)

AB  - This study focused on small and large class sizes and the impact these classes had on four teachers’ self-efficacy during the 2011-2012 school year, and was conducted in a suburban elementary school. The study was qualitative and used triangulation of data sources to determine whether teachers had high or low efficacy levels, depending on their small or large class sizes. Two of the teacher participants were kindergarten teachers teaching small class sizes (nineteen to twenty students each), and two of the teacher participants were first grade teachers teaching large class sizes (twenty-four students each). All four teacher participants were female with experience teaching both small and large class sizes in their past years of classroom teaching. This study used data collected from interviews, observations, and journal entries of each of the four teacher participants. Common to all four teacher participants, twelve important trends emerged from the data collected. The participants’ data were compared and categorized according to positive or negative thoughts, feelings, attitudes, and actions in each trend. After comparing all four teacher participants’ data and identifying their statements, actions, and writing as positive or negative, it was determined that both teacher participants in the small class sizes displayed high (positive) teacher efficacy levels, and both teacher participants in the large class sizes displayed low (negative) teacher efficacy levels. The results of this study target the importance of school administrators to create teacher in-service workshops focusing on strategies to help teachers who teach large size classes. Learning and practicing efficient ways to implement curriculum, conduct assessments, effectively teach small groups, manage behavior, and utilize teacher assistants and parent volunteers would be helpful strategies for school administrators to offer to teachers prior to the year’s beginning. Extending teachers intensive training on how to manage large class sizes may help with teacher retention, as teachers may have more self-confidence, feel better about their teaching, and display successful and positive attitudes towards their students which may encourage them to continue teaching in the classroom and continue in the education field in general. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) This study focused on small and large class sizes and the impact these classes had on four teachers’ self-efficacy during the 2011-2012 school year, and was conducted in a suburban elementary school. The study was qualitative and used triangulation of data sources to determine whether teachers had high or low efficacy levels, depending on their small or large class sizes. Two of the teacher participants were kindergarten teachers teaching small class sizes (nineteen to twenty students each), and two of the teacher participants were first grade teachers teaching large class sizes (twenty-four students each). All four teacher participants were female with experience teaching both small and large class sizes in their past years of classroom teaching. This study used data collected from interviews, observations, and journal entries of each of the four teacher participants. Common to all four teacher participants, twelve important trends emerged from the data collected. The participants’ data were compared and categorized according to positive or negative thoughts, feelings, attitudes, and actions in each trend.

AB  - During the last two decades, transnational organizations and agreements are increasingly important as actors, networks and shaping forces in curriculum-making, and this also applies to the formation of the Swedish curriculum. The international education policy movement towards standards-based curriculum has been characterized by top-down accountability and linear dissemination (Andersson-Levitt 2008, Sivesind &amp; Karseth 2011). However, several research studies reveal how the translation to national cultural education traditions also implies tensions and contradictions. Differences between different levels of curriculum has been theorized in for example distinctions between intended, implemented and enacted curricula (Conelly 2008). A major issue facing externally mandated reform is the ‘implementation gap’. In this paper we will address factors in how curriculum is contextualised and reconceptualised (Bernstein 2000, Wahlström &amp; Sundberg 2012) as it translated from transnational curriculum scripts to national and local school curriculum development and innovation. The paper draws on a “classical” theoretical framework of curriculum theory (i.e. the frame-factor theory), with its different levels of analysis – the societal/ideological level, the curriculum level; and the teaching and classroom level (cf. Lundgren 1989). With reference to Bernstein (2000), the three different discursive levels can be related to each other, by the concept of recontextualisation. The concept of recontextualisation – how meanings travel between contexts - addresses crucial assumptions of curriculum reform. First, it challenges an assumption of curriculum as a means for direct policy control and secondly, it challenges the assumption that larger global macro-social contexts have unmediated impact on the local context. From Michael Fullan’s seminal study on educational change follows that to implement educational changes, the educational process must be studied and analyzed in relation to both its external and its internal conditions (Fullan 2001). Recent debate in the field of curriculum studies suggests that centrally initiated curriculum change is unlikely to be successful unless it actively engages the practitioners who are the local change agents. In mediating curriculum reform, the intrinsic logic of the curriculum policy is significantly modified to match the institutional logics of the setting where it is enacted (Meyer 2006). This paper draws upon empirical data to explore school-based curriculum development in response to the new curriculum policy, Lgr 11, in Sweden (the National Agency for Education 2011, Government Bill 2007:28). The purpose is to explore how the curriculum reform, Lgr 11, is reconceptualised, understood and related to school development by the local authority, school management and teachers in some selected municipalities. By questionnaires and interviews with local curriculum actors, the contextual adaptations in order to manage and organise new curriculum policies are analysed. The following research questions are addressed in the paper: 1. What are stakeholders’ understandings of the room for manoeuvre in curriculum innovation in implementing the new curriculum policy, Lgr 11? 2. How, and with what arguments is the selection of content areas for curriculum development made in implementing the new curriculum Lgr 11? 3. What change and improvement strategies have been used to meet the demands of the new curriculum policy, Lgr 11? Methodology, Methods, Research Instruments or Sources Used In order to explore and analyse how the curriculum Lgr 11 specifications are translated by the local authorities/schools into a school curriculum, local documents analysis, surveys and interviews with curriculum developers, school leaders and teachers have been conducted. The mixed-method approach followed a three-step procedure. In the first step, nine local educational authorities were selected representing a broad variety of municipalities in terms of population sizes, socio-economic conditions and educational achievement levels. Empirical data were collected by in a semi-structured questionnaire to key curriculum actors. In this, qualitative and explorative survey, key issues in implementing and adapting to the curriculum policy was identified. Based on these answers four cases for further investigation were selected. In the second step, follow-up, in-depth interviews with four informants (local authority development officers) from different local education authorities were conducted. In the semi-structured interviews the strategies for curriculum innovation and change was further elaborated and conceptualised. In the third step a teacher survey was constructed and conducted in one of the selected municipalities (n= 277). In this online questionnaire teacher’s perception of the intended curriculum, the implementation process of the new curriculum and; the relation between curriculum implementation and local development work was investigated. Conclusions, Expected Outcomes or Findings The results of the empirical analysis (question 1 and 2) will be presented in terms of patterns of arguments among key curriculum actors. The case studies show how different key players in local curriculum implementation raise arguments and prioritize areas for curriculum innovation variously due to local needs, national ambitions as well as international trends and future social and cultural scenarios. The results of the case studies also highlight central features of how central curriculum actors navigate in local change processes under the enactment of the curriculum Lg11 (question 2). The case studies indicate a wide variety of strategies used in trying to adapt and merge the local development work with external pressures on accountability. The results points to some central dilemmas in steering, organizing and drive local curriculum innovation. In addition, the investigation of curriculum recontextualisation also highlights mismatches between the intrinsic logics of the curriculum policy and the institutional logics when it comes to describing, valuing and judging the outcomes of curriculum innovation (question 3). There are, the results indicate, tensions between external expectations on short-term results on the improvement of pupils’ achievements and long-term improvement outcomes acknowledging the complex relations between institutional mechanisms and emerging practices.

AB  - In this chapter we elaborate on how science encounters can be used within education for sustainability (EfS) in preschool practice as a means of empowering children to engage with sustainability. We acknowledge recent research arguing for a rethink of what science teaching in preschool can be. Such rethinking involves a shift from viewing science in preschool as mainly nature experiences towards introducing young children to science inquiry. By doing so, the interplay between knowledge, values and the ways in which humans build and make use of new knowledge can become visible thus, laying a foundation for EfS. Implementation of science inquiry processes in preschools would, however, necessitate changes in preschool teachers’ personal and professional views of science, nature and pedagogy. In our research we have explored how competence in inquiry-based teaching may, or may not, develop during pre-service preschool teacher education. We have also observed how competence can develop, but still not be realized in practice due to culturally and historically grounded attitudes and notions about science and about teaching. Drawing on these findings, we initiate discussion about how pre-service and in-service teacher education can support a broader view of teaching and science to fit the ‘community of practice’ of preschools and hence make a contribution to EfS. Our suggestions highlight the need for pre-service and in-service education to explore the historical/cultural contexts of preschool practices and teachers’ roles in raising children’s awareness of their own scientific observations and science learning processes. We also stress the need for stronger co-operation between teacher educators and teachers in practicum settings to ensure that pre-service students experience preschool environments where they have opportunities to challenge norms and practice inquiry teaching skills that are foundational for EfS.

AB  - Examined the effects of program auspice (nonprofit vs. profit child care), adult-to-child ratios (1:4.6–1:8.7), and age span of the child care class on teaching and children's social and cognitive achievement. The sample included 394 children (aged 3–5 yrs) from 32 child care centers. Results show that the profit child care centers had larger child groups than nonprofit child care centers, a lower adult to child ratio, and a positive staff attitude toward teaching goals. Age, gender, social background, and age span of the child care class were significant predictors of children's social and cognitive achievements. Adult-to-child ratio and teaching style did not prove to be good predictors of children's social or cognitive achievements. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This article highlights initial findings from a qualitative research study in Aotearoa/New Zealand exploring the discursive production of children's sexuality in early childhood education. The article draws attention to teacher talk about and around sexuality. Drawing from heteronormative, developmentalist and biological discourses and discourses of children as asexual and innocent, this article shows that such talk acts to normalize or minimize children. Teacher resistance towards and silencing of sexuality, the functions the silences serve and the ways in which silences mark the borders of "normal" and "abnormal" are uncovered. The article suggests that the marking of borders jeopardizes teacher acknowledgement and celebration of difference and diversity. Gaps between the rhetoric of celebrating difference and diversity and the reality of practice are emphasized.

AB  - To Grade or not to Grade Motivation and Effort: Swedish PE Teachers’ Grading Practice in Relation to National Grading StandardsGeneral description There has been an international trend to turn to standard-based grading in order to obtain accountable and consistent grades. Countries have different solutions to meet the challenge to find a balance between curriculum regulation and providing space for adjustment to local context and student populations (Kuiper &amp; Berkvens, 2013). In Sweden a national standard-based grading system has been in use for the last 20 years. Nevertheless, the validity of grades has been questioned in Sweden as elsewhere. PE teachers’ internalized criteria or gut-feeling (Annerstedt &amp; Larsson, 2010; Hay and MacDonald, 2008; Svennberg, Meckbach &amp; Redelius, 2014), as well as standard irrelevant factors such as motivation and effort (Chan, Hay &amp; Tinning, 2011; Larsson, Fagrell &amp; Redelius, 2009), have been identified to influence the grades. Curriculum regulation has been employed in Sweden to improve the validity of the grades and the grading standards have been reformed in 2011 (Swedish National Agency for Education [SNAE]) to make clear that only specified knowledge requirement are to be considered when grading. But will the implementation of more specific standards be enough to keep the teachers’ judgment focused on knowledge only? Our intention is to study PE teachers’ alignment with national grading criteria when exposed to a government’s attempt to prescribe the knowledge requirements for different grades. More specific, this is done by enlightening the teachers’ use of nonachievement standard irrelevant factors before and after the implementation of more specific standards and more support. The results will be discussed in light of Bernstein’s three interrelated message systems of curriculum, pedagogy, and assessment (2003). Several scholars have discussed assessment as an important message system of what count as important knowledge and the influence of assessment on learning (Chan et al., 2011; Hay and Penney, 2013; Redelius &amp; Hay, 2009; Thorburn, 2007). To better understand teachers’ grading practices, we are also interested in how the interrelation works in the other direction—how curriculum and pedagogy influence assessment and grading. We take a starting point in our study of the teachers grading practice before and after the implementation of more specific grading standards and relate the results to the Swedish national curriculum and Bernstein’s definition of a pedagogic discourse. The official message in the Swedish curriculum is that both knowledge and values and norms are important in order to reach the overarching goals of education and the goals for PE (SNAE, 2011). However, only knowledge is to be graded and no attention is to be given to values and norms in the grades. To bring light to the influence of values and norms in the teachers pedagogic work we turn to Bernstein’s (1996) pedagogic discourse that comprise both an instructional discourse, which creates specialized skills (knowledge), and a regulative discourse that creates order and relations (values and norms). In Bernstein’s (1996) concept of the pedagogic discourse, the instructional discourse is embedded in the regulative discourse, with the regulative discourse being the dominant of the two. They are to be considered as one inseparable discourse (Bernstien 1996). Applied in a classroom situation this is illustrated by Lund and Veal (2008): “Student teachers know that if they lose control of a class from a managerial standpoint, desired learning will not occur” (p. 503). Method To enable the teachers to verbalise the explicit as well as the implicit criteria they use when grading, the Repertory Grid (RG) interview technique was employed. The RG technique can be used to reveal a person’s perception of a specific topic that the person has experienced and is familiar with by examining the similarities and differences between well-known elements (Fransella, Bell &amp; Bannister, 2004). For instance, even if the teachers find it difficult to express what they find important to get a high grade they can still tell the difference between a student with a high grade and another student, if it is their own students that they know well. George Kelly (1955), who first developed the technique, believed that our behavior can be understood through personally constructed patterns that we use to explain how the world works. These patterns are called constructs, and they enable us to predict our surroundings and choose a direction of our behavior. The method helps us to reveal not only the presence of standard irrelevant constructs but also their content. Three PE teachers, one woman and two men, were interviewed in 2009 and in 2013, before and after the implementation of the new curriculum. Each of them was grading a class of students, 15 to 16 years of age, in different compulsory schools. All grades were represented in the class they were teaching and they had all received a teacher education in PE. In total, 45 students were discussed during the six interviews. The RG interviews lasted for about 90 minutes. In the first step, the teacher was asked to select seven to eight students from the same class that he or she was teaching and grading in PE. The selected students must represent all possible grades (Fransella et al., 2004). In the second step, the names of three of the students at a time were presented to the teacher who was asked in what way, relevant for the grades, two of the students were similar and different from the third (Fransella et al., 2004). By letting the teachers generate their own constructs around a topic they are familiar with, the risk to direct the interview with questions based on another precondition than their own is minimized. The RG interviews generated 125 constructs about aspects that teachers thought were relevant for grades in PE. Results The use of national grading standards in Sweden illustrates how professional judgment is not reliant on the stated standards only. The results indicate that more specific criteria guide the teachers to pay less attention to what Hay and Penney (2009) label “irrelevant factors such as students’ dispositional and behavioral characteristics” (p. 398). Standards seem to be important but not enough. All three teachers still valued standard irrelevant criteria that reflect the norms and values in the curriculum and the goals for the subject. The standard irrelevant criteria used by the teachers also put focus on their concern of the impact of the regulative discourse on the students learning. Since the regulative discourse is always present in the pedagogic discourse (Bernstein, 1996) and values and norms are important goals of the curriculum and of the PE subject, it can cause confusion in teachers’ interpretation of the alignment of curriculum, pedagogy, and assessment in a grading system in which the regulative discourse is not to be graded. Future research is needed about how to achieve valid grades while simultaneously acknowledge the need to give value to the regulative discourse. Grades are often regarded as a reward for achieving knowledge requirements in the curriculum, but what are the rewards for achieving norms and values? References Annerstedt, C. &amp; Larsson, S.

AB  - Research Findings: The study examined the beliefs of kindergarten teachers (K-teachers) regarding the goals of kindergarten. We asked K-teachers to reflect on their own beliefs, their understanding of parents’ beliefs, and their understanding of the beliefs that guide agents of the education system. We further examined differences between K-teachers based on the type of kindergarten in which they worked (religious or secular) and the socioeconomic status of children’s families (middle-high or middle-low). A total of 120 K-teachers responded to closed questionnaires, and 12 teachers also participated in a semistructured interview. The results revealed an incongruence between K-teachers’ perspectives and their understanding of the positions of parents and of agents of the education system. K-teachers evaluated fostering children’s positive self-esteem as the most important goal and promoting literacy and mathematics skills as the least important. They believed, however, that parents and agents of the education system regard children’s advancement in literacy and mathematics skills as the most important goal. Practice or Policy: Recognizing this incongruence facilitates understanding of the rationale behind K-teachers’ actions and their relationships with parents and professional partners. It enables identification of topics that need to be addressed by the professional education community in order to create a dialogue among K-teachers, families, and policymakers.

AB  - The present study aims to identify patterns for use of medication given pro re nata (PRN or “on an as needed [preordered] basis”) or statim (STAT [a new order] or “at once, immediately”) and their efficacy in controlling aggressive behavior in the mental health (MH) services environment. PRN and STAT medication data were combined and referred to as PRN throughout this article, as the data were not collected in a manner required to differentiate between PRN and STAT medication administration. Analyzed data were extracted from the clinical records of a sample of children and youth admitted for the first time to a tertiary MH center. MH Program patients (characterized by at least one Axis I psychiatric diagnosis [Axis I group]) were compared to Dual Diagnosis Program patients (characterized by an Axis I diagnosis in addition to an Axis II diagnosis of mental retardation [Axis II group]). Age, gender, Program (Axis I or II group), and the length of stay for treatment produced significant differences in the use of PRNs between the two groups. Further, the study investigated the precipitating factors leading to use of PRNs, in conjunction with the level of supervision and the de-escalation techniques used to avoid the use of PRNs. Axis I patients were more likely to endanger others, whereas Axis II patients were more likely to endanger themselves. Both groups of patients demonstrated a need for an increased level of supervision prior to the crisis. Olanzapine, chlorpromazine, and lorazepam were effective in calming patients and preventing further aggressive outbursts.

AB  - Although links have been found between parents’ and teachers’ (caregivers’) attitudes about aggressive behavior, their responses to aggressive behaviour in children, and those children’s own use of aggressive behaviour, most research has focused on primary and secondary school contexts and has examined the influence of parents and teachers separately. The current study explored both parents’ and teachers’ beliefs and intervention strategies for relational and physical aggression in early childhood settings. Teachers ( N = 18; Mage = 34.8 years) and parents ( N = 68; Mage = 32.2 years) were presented with vignettes portraying relational and physical aggression. Following each vignette, their perceptions of the seriousness of the act, empathy for the victim, likelihood to intervene, and intervention strategies used to respond to each vignette were assessed. Teachers were also interviewed about examples of aggression that have been seen in preschool age children. Results indicated that caregivers viewed relational compared to physical aggression as more normative, and had less empathy for, and were less likely to intervene in instances of relationally aggressive behaviour. They also recommended more passive intervention strategies towards relationally aggressive children and more direct strategies towards physically aggressive children. Interview responses indicated that teachers perceived the primary cause of aggression to be related to developmental characteristics of the child. Implications for how these findings about adult–child interactions impact the development of relational and physical aggression are discussed.

AB  - Framveksten av velferdsretten som fag er nært knyttet til utviklingen av rettig­ hets­ og rettssikkerhetsbegrepet. Når det åpnes for bruk av tvang i behandling og omsorg utenfor den tradisjonelle institusjonsomsorgen, blir det viktig både å avgrense mulighetene for slik tvangsbruk og å etablere gode rettssikkerhets­ garantier for å hindre overgrep. De seneste tiårene er det i en viss utstrekning gitt lovhjemler som åpner for slik bruk av tvang i omsorg og behandling, også i private hjem.

AB  - This is a licentiate dissertation consisting of a summarizing section and two free-standing but coherent articles, one of which has previously been published in ascientific journal while the other is accepted for publication. The unifying link is the theme of attempting to establish the kernel of outdoor education, as it isunderstood by teachers active in the field. The study depicts with the help of semi-structured interviews the respondents’ conceptions of teaching and outdooreducation. The first article is a survey (accomplished in A - School and B - School) of teachers’ perceptions of learning and teaching outdoors in preschool – (to) thefirst year of the compulsory school. The second article is a study of teachers’ perceptions of the possible special nature of outdoor education after having experiencedan educational intervention in the subject (preschool to first year). Both articles treat the special nature of outdoor education coupled with learning and outdoorteaching in light of the overall research question, what perceptions do teachers have of learning and teaching outdoors? The summarizing section which discusses thetwo articles is divided into five different parts.Chapter I comprises a social and environmental analysis and indicates the need for research in the field of outdoor education. Chapter II deals with the aim, issuesand theoretical perspectives of learning which are tied to knowledge through action, ecological readability and bodily learning. A number of restricted examples areselected among theoreticians and representatives of these three perspectives within the reform pedagogy movement, American pragmatism, the environmental studymovement and theories of the phenomenology of the body, the learning body in movement.The methodological basis for the analysis of the two articles is phenomenographic and is described in Chapter III. In Chapter IV the possible special nature ofoutdoor education is analysed, noting what stands out as especially prominent in the respondents’ answers and in what way, proceeding from questions such as what isoutdoor education for you, what is the difference between learning outdoors and indoors, and why teach outdoors? Four categories of response can be distinguished: aplace for learning, a way of learning, an object of learning and bodily learning. At the end of Chapter IV the results of both articles are summarised. Finally, Chapter Vcomprises a discussion proceeding from a metacategorisation of all descriptive categories from both articles. The discussion has led to the identification of threethematised perspectives, namely the place perspective, the environment perspective and the body perspective. These perspectives, place, environment and body, arelinked back to the technical frame of reference in Chapter II.The result of the two part studies, the survey study in article 1 and the educational intervention in article 2, indicates a multiplicity of varied perceptions of thespecial nature of outdoor education and can thus be said to characterise this as richly diversified. As regards teachers’ notions of the principal reasons for learning andteaching outdoors, the following four aspects are foregrounded:the place for learningthe object of learningthe way of learningbodily learningTwo main categories were identified in article 2 which are treated in education in the subject after a five-day course (10 half study days), teachers who perceive aspecial nature in outdoor education and teachers who do not. Both main categories crystallised out after the educational intervention was implemented in Byskolan andStadsskolan (the Village School and the Town School), the latter being the reference school. One year after the completion of the educational intervention mostteachers in the Village School associated the special nature of outdoor education with a more authentic, body and sensory experience related, movement intensive and health promoting learning than traditional learning in the classroom.Proceeding from a metacategorisation the three above-mentioned thematised perspectives are described in Chapter V. These reflect the identified responsecategories in articles 1 and 2.The analysis of the empirical material of the investigation reveals that the special nature of outdoor education from the respondents´ perspective is related to place,to the environment and to the body.

AB  - The mathematical ideas that emerge in children’s free and guided play can be both complex and sophisticated, and if they are linked to formal mathematics, they can be a powerful basis for mathematical development. To form such links, one needs knowledge of how children use and express these ideas. This is especially true in the intersection of arithmetic and geometry, where the intermingling of numerical and spatial concepts and skills is not yet fully understood. This study aims to gain understanding of children’s mathematical practices by describing the interplay of key mathematical ideas, and more specifically how young children exercise mathematical competencies in the intersection of early arithmetic and geometry. The results show that children can use spatial representations when reasoning about numbers, and that they are able to connect spatial and numerical structures. Furthermore, it is shown that children not only use and invent effective procedures, but also are able to explain, justify and evaluate such procedures.

AB  - Education and children’s schooling can be said to be a place where time, and especially the future, is present. This is a consequence of how education is organized, and is partly due to the fact that the purpose of education is change. This makes expectations of the future an important part of schooling and of transitions in and between types of schooling. The aim of this presentation is to understand what expectations children express about the future in preschool class and how these expectations are used when children make sense of preschool class and the transitions to and from preschool class. The point of departure is to study how socializing activities contributes to transition, and to show how children act and shape their own and each other’s everyday-life (James, Jenks and Prout, 1998) in the preschool class. Preschool class is a voluntary type of schooling that Swedish children attend the year they turn six, between preschool and compulsory school. It is a type of schooling with a specific assignment to work with children’s transitions. The Swedish National Agency for Education (2014) stresses that this must be connected both to what children should be prepared for (compulsory school) but also to their past experiences (preschool). In an institution with such a clear preparatory mission, it is important to understand ideas about the future and the past and how these ideas are used in the everyday work with transitions. In a previous study Lago (2015) has demonstrated how temporal aspects, such as the future, is an important part of children’s schooling and that future and other temporal aspects are used by the children to create meanings about the specific context of preschool class. Future and change were present throughout the transition process. In this presentation this is studied further by using the concepts of socialization and anticipatory socialization to understand what expectations children have of the future and how these expectations is connected to past experiences and used by children to shapes activities in preschool class. To analyse transition an interpretive approach to socialization is used where socialization can be described as processes through which people understands and give meaning to their social contexts. The focus is on how they gain knowledge about norms of conduct and how they negotiate, as well as adapt to such norms (Corsaro 2005; Gaskins, Miller &amp; Corsaro 1992). The specific activities that contribute to socialization are analysed, and the focus is on how socialization is done rather than on the result of socialization (Wentworth 1980). The notion of anticipatory socialization except this also includes how people adjust their conducts to expectations of the future (Corsaro &amp; Molinari 2005; Wærdahl 2005) and how such expectations are connected to social practice and the expectations of others. The concepts of future orientation and children as “becoming” are also used to analyse the progression of school and transition (Adam, 1995; Hockey &amp; James 1993). Methods: To study the transition process, ethnographic methods were used, mostly participant observations and interviews, while following a group of children during their transition from preschool class to first grade. This presentation primarily draws on the interview material since children’s expectations and experiences are in focus, but observed situations of how the children talked about their expectations with each other and their teachers are also used. With ethnographic methods come ethical considerations due to the closeness of the method and research with children. It is important to be sensitive to what the participants express and to the imbalance of power between researcher and participant as well as between adult and child. The closeness is, thus, crucial for an ethnographic approach, since it leads to a better understanding of, for example, how the processes of giving meaning to transitions is done and allows for thick descriptions of the field. Results: Being a preschool class child, having been a preschool child, becoming a first grader and doing transitions is not a matter of conforming to already existing contexts. Instead, the transition can be said to concern the creation and re-creation of social practices. Because the transition between preschool class and first grade was marked in different ways, transition became something that must be made sense of. The future and expectations as well as the past and experience become a part of this meaning-making. In the transition children expressed different expectations of how school could or should be like. The results show that although the children expressed excitement about starting school they also talked about school as difficult and boring. When interacting with the children, the teachers more often reinforced negative ideas than they draw on children’s excitement for school. This meant that the future in school was more often constructed as something difficult and boring which also reflected in the children’s ways of dealing the transition from preschool class to school. In line with this preschool was talked about as easier and more fun than preschool class. The children constructed a picture of a schooling that was constantly becoming more difficult and boring. The construction of the transition to and from preschool class is thus related to what school is and what it is expected to be. Understandings of children’s expectations are important to be able to work with children doing transition. Knowledge about children’s overall expectations of school is important to be able to work with negative expectations and reinforce children’s positive expectations since this may affect long-term results and attitudes towards education.

AB  - The present study investigated the perceptions of parents and teachers on the use of the mother tongue and their preferred medium of communication and instruction for preschool children at home and in school. The sample was made up of a cross-section of parents and teachers (N=120, Female=80% for teachers and 55% for parents) of children (between ages 2 and 5) in a suburb of the Greater Accra Region, Ghana. A structured questionnaire was administered to the respondents to elicit information on their perceptions on the use of mother tongue in communicating with the children. The results indicated that both parents and teachers appreciate the importance of the mother tongue, with reasons including the promoting of cultural identity, the easy understanding of concepts and for effective communication. An appreciable number of teachers and parents also support the use of mother tongue as the language of instruction in school alongside English language. The two main arguments against the use of the mother tongue in schools are (1) the importance of English language for future learning and status growth and (2) the paucity of teaching and learning materials in the local languages. Parents support the use of mother tongue at home because it enhances children's connection to their family, relatives, culture, history and identity. Recommendations made, include the provision of instructional materials and trained teachers in local language usage.

AB  - Evaluated whether corpus callosum (CC) injury indicates the depth of shearing lesions in the central brain structure and the clinical severity of diffuse axonal injury. A simple and objective procedure for semiquantitative analysis of magnetic resonance images (MRI)--the maximum signal intensity ratio (MSIR)--was employed prospectively in 21 Ss (aged 5-65 yrs) with diffuse axonal injury but without apparent injury to the ventral pons. All were diagnosed using serial combination MRI scans of fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and T2 weighted gradient echo imaging during the initial 2 wks after the injury. The signal intensity ratio between the 2 regions of interest--the CC and the normal appearing ventral pons--was calculated serially in mid-sagittal and parasagittal FLAIR image sections in each S. The MSIR was determined as a semiquantitative index of CC injury in each patient. The correlations between MSIR and the duration of unconsciousness, Glasgow outcome scale at 6 mo, and the presence of apparent midbrain injury were investigated. The mean MSIR value was 1.12 at 7.4 (3.1) days after the injury (N=21). MSIR correlated with the duration of unconsciousness, and was higher in Ss with both an unfavorable GOS outcome and apparent midbrain injury.

AB  - This study explored the stakeholders' construction of quality of Pre-primary Education (PPE) based on the various dimensions of PPE in Tanzania with special attention being paid to policy as discourse. The study involved a total of 129 informants sampled differently. The study sampled parents through convenience sampling technique, while teachers and experts were sampled through maximum variation technique. The study used descriptive cross-sectional design underpinned by interpretive paradigm. It generated data through semi-structured interviews employed to primary school inspectors, public PPE teachers, curriculum developer and policymakers. Meanwhile, FGDs were conducted to parents on the quality of PPE. Furthermore, documentary analysis was conducted to determine the extent to which stakeholders' construction on the quality of PPE was reflected in the TETP of 1995 as well as other related curricular documents. The findings indicate that stakeholders viewed the quality of PPE in three perspectives: i) quality as expectations; ii) quality as process or practice; and iii) quality as programme structure. Overall, stakeholders viewed PPE as an important early childhood provision for the future school life and participation in all walks of life. Although PPE seemed to be important, the study findings suggest that, the quality of public PPE in Tanzania is poor. Specifically, stakeholders identified important indicators constituting the quality of PPE as: i) furnished and safe learning environment; ii) well-qualified, committed and loving teachers; iii) smaller class-size; iv) provision of nutrition services; and v) good relationship among teachers, the teacher and parents, and with the head teacher. The study concluded that physical visits by primary school supervisors and making PPE independent are essential for quick and close monitoring for solving problems hindering provision of quality services in PPE in Tanzania.

AB  - For a sample of low-income, Spanish-speaking Mexican-American families (n = 72), we investigated associations between family involvement in school-based activities and children's literacy in their preferred language (English or Spanish) during early elementary school. We gave special attention to the potential moderating role of teacher fluency in Spanish. Between kindergarten and third grade, family involvement in school-based activities increased for children who displayed early literacy problems. The rate of increase was greater for children who consistently had bilingual teachers than for children who did not. In turn, increased family involvement predicted better literacy skills at third grade, particularly for children who struggled early. We discuss these results in light of recent recommendations to increase the number of elementary school teachers who are fluent in Spanish and English. (Contains 4 figures and 4 tables.)

AB  - Reports an experimental program in which 4-12 yr. old psychotic children are taken from a state hospital to nursery schools in the community. The purpose of the program is to aid the Ss in establishing direct contact with adults and children in the "normal" world. Schools provided teachers, classrooms, and equipment; the nursing staff and a group of volunteers also participated. Problems centered on the concern of the nursing personnel regarding the Ss' behavior, and the feelings of the nursery school personnel and the nursing staff towards one another. Similar problems occurred between parents and the nursing staff. Each group communicated and constructively resolved many of the problems. Findings indicate a close relationship between individual children and volunteers and teachers, with both groups benefiting by the experience.

AB  - Reviews selected issues relevant to the provision of mental health services in pediatric primary care settings for disadvantaged children and families. Multiple sources of data suggest that pediatricians constitute a de facto mental health service for many disadvantaged children and that it is critical to undertake efforts to enhance and functionally integrate this resource into the existing system of care. The problems faced by disadvantaged families in need of mental health services include arbitrarily established eligibility floors, regional inequalities, variation in breadth and depth of coverage, long waiting lists, and poor staff–client ratios.

AB  - Examined age and gender effects across different subscales of a modified version of the Child Behavior Rating Form (CBRF; C. S. Edelbrock, 1985), the Nisonger CBRF, an informant behavior rating scale consisting of teacher and parent versions assessing problem behaviors and social competence in children and adolescents with mental retardation. 114 girls and 212 boys (aged 3–16 yrs), referred to interdisciplinary diagnostic clinics for children with developmental disabilties between 1988 and 1994, were rated on the Nisonger CBRF by their parents and teachers. Normative data (means, T scores, and percentiles) are presented, and subscale scores are analyzed as a function of age and gender. Results show that age influenced 3 of 8 subscales on the parent ratings and 1 subscale on the teacher ratings. Gender did not influence subscale scores.

AB  - Pre-school as a Meeting Place – Children’s Access-strategies and Exclusions in Play and ConversationThe research reported in this thesis attempts to understand what happens when children interact with each other in the context of activities in a pre-school setting (here called Daggkåpan) when adults are not involved. By using ethnographically inspired methodology, in combination with conversation-analysis, this project has been analysing everyday interaction between children who are three to five years old. The aim of the project was to understand how children at Daggkåpan create relationships and how they defend and protect their interactional spaces. I have studied how children shape, maintain and interrupt relationships and interactions with one another. I have studied and analysed what kinds of access-strategies the children utilize and create and also how these children exclude one another in play activities and everyday conversations. Sociocultural and interactionistic perspectives have been used. Findings suggest that it is very important for these children to maintain interactions with peers and gain access to play groups. The children of Daggkåpan create and use several different strategies for gaining access. The results also indicate that gaining access to play groups is particularly difficult in preschool settings since young children tend to protect shared spaces and ongoing play activities from children outside the realms of these spaces and activities. Children also co-construct a number of strategies for excluding peers from their interactional spaces. Steering clear from the dominating perspective that categorizes children and focuses on the individual child, I have in contrast focused children during their interaction with one another in peer group activities. In other words I have discussed peer-relations, peer-socialization and peer-perspectives from an interactional view. Studying peer-interactions through microanalysis allows for understanding what is meaningful for children in their peer-culture in preschool.

AB  - The Office of the Medical Director of the Ministry of Social Affairs in Israel is responsible for the medical service in residential care centers for persons with intellectual disability (ID). A standard annual questionnaire was developed during 1997-1998, and the first national survey study was conducted in 1998. The present paper presents the findings of the 2009 national survey, for which the following information was gathered via questionnaires: age, gender, and level of ID of persons served at the residential care center in question, status of the population served, functional profile, nursing, medical, and allied professional staff, number of annual examinations, preventive medicine aspects, medications, number of annual cases of infectious disease, annual unintentional injuries, number of deaths, number of hospitalizations, internal residential center hospitalization, ambulatory out-patient use, use of outside laboratory examinations, and dental care. In 2009, 7067 persons were served in nine government, 41 private, and 13 public centers. The average number of persons served per center was 112.17 (range 21 – 324). The survey in 2009 showed that 78% of the population with ID in residential care in Israel was between the ages of 20 and 60 years old, 45 % with severe or profound ID, 41 % with moderate, and 13% with mild ID. In total, 25 % were nursing patients, 19 % were confined to a wheelchair, 33 % had epilepsy, 87 % were found to be receiving medication daily for chronic illness, and 54 % received psychotropic medication for psychiatric illness.

AB  - Data from an Israeli project shows higher proportion of insecurely attached infants in center care as compared with noncenter care (Sagi, Koren-Karie, Gini, Ziv, & Joels, 2002). The present study was designed to assess structural and emotional aspects characterizing infants' experiences in center care, aiming to explain, in part, the high incidence of attachment insecurity among center-care infants. In the present study, we focus on 151 center-care infants who were observed in the Ainsworth Strange Situation (Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters, & Wall, 1978) with their mothers. Sixty-one percent of them were coded as securely attached to their mothers while 39% were coded as insecurely attached. In addition, 56 directors and 120 caregivers in 56 centers were videotaped throughout a full-day observation. The Assessment Profile of Early Childhood Program (Abbott-Shim & Sibley, 1987) was also employed. Results indicated that the centers in Israel are of low standards: Large group size, high caregiver–infants ratio, inadequate professional training, and minimal attention to individual emotional needs. No associations were found between infants' attachment and various aspects of the settings. The low quality of the Israeli settings may explain the higher rate of attachment insecurity in center-care infants. ©2005 Michigan Association for Infant Mental Health.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the stability of development in general intelligence (IQ) and executive functions (EF), and to identify predictors of cognitive development from preschool age through adolescence, in a cohort of preterm and term-born children.Participants and Methods: As part of the longitudinal Stockholm Neonatal Project, 134 adolescents born preterm with very low birth weight (&lt; 1500g) and 94 matched controls born at term, participated in follow-up studies at ages 5 ½ and 18 years. On both occasions, the participants were assessed with an age appropriate Wechsler IQ test and tests of executive functions (EF). Stability in cognitive outcome was tested with Pearson correlations. Stepwise regression analyses were used to investigate how cognitive outcome at age 18 was predicted by EF at age 5 ½, parental education, gender, medical risk, and birth weight ratio.Results: IQ was quite stable form preschool age through adolescence (r =.78 in whole group, r = .84 in preterm and r= .61 in controls), as were EF (r = .65 in whole group, r = .64 in preterm and r = .53 in controls). In controls, EF at age 5 ½ and parental education predicted IQ (R² = .205) and EF at 18 years (R² = .249). In the preterm group, EF at age 5 ½, parental education, medical risks and birth weight ratio predicted IQ 18 years (R² = .508), and EF at age 5 ½ and medical risks predicted EF at18 years (R² = .432).Conclusions: Stability in cognitive outcomes from preschool through adolescence was high, particularly in the preterm group. EF at 5 ½ strongly predicted cognitive and executive functions at 18 years, in both groups. Over the same period, parental education had a continued positive effect on cognitive development. Among preterm children, perinatal medical risks predicted a less favorable continued cognitive development, especially in EF, and a low birth-weight ratio had a negative impact on general intelligence.

AB  - The management model Lean, originating from the car industry, has in recent years spread like wildfire in the public sector. One important component in the model is to set targets that are measurable to show results, visualising how taxpayers' money is used. The article examines how Swedish public-sector preschool staff handle evaluative techniques in the form of numbers and colours within the Lean model. The article shows their eagerness to comply with the ethics of evaluation, while at the same time resisting what they understand as hard-core statistics by, for example, introducing monitoring that includes feelings and experiences.

AB  - Människors sätt att se varierar. Samtidigt verkar det vara av betydelse att medarbetare i skolan och förskolan utvecklar gemensamma sätt att se åtminstone vissa aspekter av verksamheten. Att bygga upp och fördjupa förståelsen av en gemensam idé framställs i skolutvecklingsforskningen som en viktig aspekt av skolans och förskolans ledarskap.I den här avhandlingen beskrivs variationen i sättet att se verksamhetsidéer, och arbetet med sådana, som den framträder i en grupp skolchefer med övergripande ansvar för pedagogisk verksamhet. Variationen diskuteras sedan i relation till olika sätt att se skolutveckling och ledarskap, samtidigt som avsaknaden av koppling mellan specifika sätt att se verksamhetsidéer och specifika sätt att se arbete med sådana problematiseras. I den avslutande diskussionen framhålls särskilt betydelsen av att de som befinner sig i skolans eller förskolans praktik utvecklar kunskap om variationen och använder sig av den för att bygga upp ny kunskap med relevans för verksamheten och arbetet i den.Till grund för de resultat som presenteras ligger en intervjuundersökning genomförd i en större svensk stad, i vilken det vid tiden för studiens genomförande pågick ett arbete med att bygga upp en, för all pedagogisk verksamhet i staden, gemensam verksamhetsidé.

AB  - The presentation discusses preliminary findings from a newly initiated research project on professionals’ Work with child well-being in Danish daycare institutions. Child well-being is a familiar focus in pedagogical work. Although terminology and approaches may be different, most (if not all) pedagogical traditions that have played a role in Danish and Nordic pedagogical discussions, are concerned with children’s well-being, and the term is central to practitioners’ professionalism. The political interest in well-being is often linked to concerns about social mobility, early interventions, health, and learning. This results in the Development and use of large numbers of tools, surveys, and Measurement instruments that aim at shaping practitioners’ Work and qualifying political intervention: Well-being Work is increasingly institutionalized.

AB  - Evaluated the multivariate relationship between several predictor variables (age, gender, SES, family structure type, adoptive status, and neurological status) and response to medication in 336 3–16 yr olds with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). All children underwent a 3-wk, double-blind trial of methylphenidate and placebo consisting of administration of 3 conditions assigned to each child: (1) 1 wk of placebo, (2) 1 wk of 0.5 mg/kg daily of methylphenidate in 2 divided doses, and (3) 1 wk of 1.0 mg/kg daily of methylphenidate in 2 divided doses. The Child Behavior Checklist and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children--Revised (WISC--R) were completed before initiation of the drug trial. Conners Abbreviated Symptom Questionnaires-Parent and Teacher Forms and narratives regarding the child's functioning were collected daily during the medication trial for the determination of response. Neurologic status, inattention, and overactivity were found to be most likely to predict good response to psychostimulants, whether rated by parents or teachers. Although a number of variables predicted a positive psychostimulant response, the strength of the predictive associations suggests only minimal clinical usefulness.

AB  - Poor executive functioning has been shown to be of central importance in disruptive behavior disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and a large number of laboratory measures of executive functioning have been developed. There are, however, few available questionnaires tapping executive functioning and those that exist also include items focused directly on the symptom criteria for ADHD, which makes it difficult to draw conclusions regarding executive functioning per se. In the present study, a new rating instrument, the Childhood Executive Functioning Inventory (CHEXI) was therefore introduced. This instrument was shown to have good test-retest reliability. Using factor analysis, two factors tapping working memory and inhibition emerged using parent ratings and these two factors were replicated using teacher ratings. Modest, yet mostly significant, relations to laboratory measures of working memory and inhibition were found. Ratings on the CHEXI were also found to be significantly related to ADHD symptoms as well as early academic achievement. Interestingly, ratings on the CHEXI and laboratory measures of working memory and inhibition were shown to explain independent variance in ADHD symptoms and academic achievement, which point to the importance of using a multi-assessment strategy when studying executive functioning.

AB  - Concern to ensure that all children have access to high-quality educational experiences in the early years of life has instigated policies to increase the qualifications of staff in the childcare workforce, and in particular, to increase the number of degree qualified teachers. However, existing data suggests that employment in childcare is viewed less favourably than alternatives in the education sector by those undertaking Early Childhood Education degrees. For most, childcare is not a preferred place of employment. This study asked whether a practicum in a childcare setting would improve attitudes towards childcare and willingness to work in childcare settings. In a study of a cohort of Bachelor of Education (Early Childhood) students, measures of attitudes to childcare and willingness to work in childcare were taken before and after practicum. Additionally, students provided accounts of their practicum experiences. Results indicate a trend in which there was a group increase in positive attitudes and willingness to consider work in childcare, but considerable individual differences influenced by the quality of the practicum experience. The relationship with, and model provided by, centre directors and group leaders in the practicum class was identified as a key influencing factor. Results are discussed in term of models of pedagogical leadership. (Contains 1 table and 2 figures.)

AB  - Movement Skills Assessment Tools: Aims, Content and ContextIntroduction and TopicTo master a broad repertoire of gross movement skills in the early school years seems to contribute to better physical self-esteem and represents a basis for engagement in physical activity and an active lifestyle later in life (Haywood &amp; Getchell, 2005; Stodden, Langendorfer &amp; Robertsson, 2009; Oakley, Booth &amp; Patterson, 2001; Barnett, Van Beurden, Morgan, Brooks &amp; Beard, 2009). Motor development in children has been of interest both in research and in practice. Over the last three to four decades, many motor development assessment tools have been developed to address various questions and for different contexts (Cools, De Martealer, Samaey &amp; Andries, 2008). The overall aim of this study is to explore the purposes of different movement assessment tools used in research and practice. Questions of interest are; what is the purpose of the tool? In which context is the assessment tool employed? Which movement skills are in focus? Are the movements assessed in a quantitative or a qualitative way?MethodMethods To examine 10-15 movement skills tools which often are referred to in research. Investigate the settings and contexts in which they are used. Examine the assessment tools in terms of aims, number and character of the selected items, reference system and measure structure. The tools and tests will be selected by review articles, research articles in the areas of physical education, physical activity, health, motor and movement skills and sport.Expected OutcomesThere appears to be a change in the purposes of motor skills testing in the last ten to fifteen years. The tests have changed from mainly identifying deficiencies or motor impairments to screening children with the purpose to get “all on the right track”, to be physically active. The study is ongoing and there will be additional findings to discuss further on. Preliminary findings indicate that there have been many different reasons to study children’s movement skills. One question of interest has been to examine if the child is behind their peers in their motor development or if the child suffers from any disease or impairment. (Davis, 2003; Cools et. al., 2008) Other questions addressed are whether a child or student has reached the objectives in the Physical Education curriculum in terms of mastering movement skills (Tidén &amp; Nyberg, 2004). Most of the tests are quantitative but some use a combination of both quantitative and qualitative assessment (Cools et. al., 2008; Tidén &amp; Nyberg, 2004). Purely qualitative assessments are rare. Still most of the assessment tools are developed to be used for detection of irregular motor behavior (e.g. BOT-2 and KTK; Bruininks &amp; Bruininks, 2005; Kiphard &amp; Shilling, 2007).ReferencesBarnett, L.M., Van Beurden, E., Morgan, P.J., Brooks, L.O. and Beard, J.R.

AB  - This paper focuses on how 'ability' is conceptualised, configured and produced in movement assessment tools. The aim of the study was to critically analyse assessment tools used for healthy and typically developed children. The sample consists of 10 tools from 6 different countries. In the study, we pay special attention to content and evaluation methods. The theoretical analysis explores and discusses what kind of movement ability the tools construct. The theoretical framework is inspired by Bourdieu's concepts of habitus, capital and field which are used as analytical tools to explore how the testing processes and content shape what is regarded as ability. Our findings show both a great variation of concepts and evaluation methods and a narrow view of what is regarded as valuable to assess. The assessed movements are strongly related to traditional sports and construct a specific form of physical capital. None of the tasks assessed take place in natural outdoor environments. Open skills, rhythmical movements to music or tasks including a wider range of flexibility are also absent in the assessment tools. The explored tools and tests assess a limited number of decontextualised movements and produce a narrow view of 'ability'. Hence, the testing process itself often promotes a child who is physically mature and benefits those who have experience of traditional sports. In other words, the assessed 'taste for sport' and the 'embodied physical capital' construct what is considered to be legitimate knowledge in relation to movement and physical culture. Accordingly, the social construction of movement ability through assessment tools is far from a neutral concept and could affect how children see themselves and their 'ability'.

AB  - The current study compared the effects of choice and no-choice reinforcement conditions on the task responding of 3 children with autism across 2 single-operant paradigm reinforcer assessments. The first assessment employed simple fixed-ratio (FR) schedules; the second used progressive-ratio (PR) schedules. The latter assessment identified the differential strength of choice-making conditions in promoting task responding relative to no-choice conditions for 2 participants; no differential findings were obtained during the FR assessment.

AB  - I use examples from my ethnographic work on early childhood education and care settings in Japan and France to demonstrate that quality standards are cultural constructs and to question the universality of such core U.S. standards of quality in ECEC as low student-teacher ratios and multicultural curricula. My argument is that quality standards should reflect local values and concerns and not be imposed across cultural divides. In a heterogeneous society such as the U.S., notions of quality should arise out of conversations in local communities among early childhood educators and parents.

AB  - There are 25 million displaced children worldwide, and those receiving schooling are often educated in overcrowded classrooms. Montessori is a child-centred educational method that provides an alternative model to traditional educational approaches. In this model, students are able to direct their own learning and develop at their own pace, working with materials rather than in supervised groups or with direct teacher instruction. Because most children are working alone, teachers have more time to work one-on-one with children even when student-teacher ratios are quite large. This gives teachers increased opportunity to tailor their teaching to the specific needs and strengths of each student. We conducted an evaluation of Montessori classroom conversion for displaced students on the Thai-Myanmar border. We administered the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ) to 66 children before and after classroom conversion and across treatment and control classroom conditions. We then conducted difference in difference testing. All domains showed meaningful improvements in ASQ scores, with the Montessori students gaining 18 points relative to the traditional students (p = 0.33). However, only the personal-social domain of the ASQ was statistically significant (8.8 point gain for the Montessori students relative to the control, p < 0.05) in our underpowered sample.

AB  - Determining the factors that affect teachers' competences has a decisive role in revealing the quality of teaching process. In this context, it is important to identify professional variables affecting the self-efficacy of preschool teachers. For this reason, it is aimed to investigate which professional variables influence preschool teachers' sense of efficacy. In the research, a descriptive research model was adopted. The working group of the study is composed of 191 preschool teachers participating in public nurseries and kindergartens in the TRNC, and also those participating to the research as a volunteer. The Professional Information Form and the Teacher's Sense of Efficacy Scale were used as data collection tools in the study. Statistical analyses suitable for the analysis of the data were applied by applying the normality tests to the collected data. According to the findings obtained from the analysis made, except for the school type the preschool teachers graduated and the number of children, factors such as the graduated department, the place of residence, the duration of professional experience, the economic competence, and the educational environment were found to affect the self-efficacy of preschool teachers. As a result, it can be said that preschool teachers' self-efficacy is influenced by professional variables.

AB  - Research Findings: Data from a national sample of Portuguese preschool centers were used to examine the relationship between age of start and number of hours in child care and levels of externalizing and prosocial behaviors with peers. Participants were both parents and teachers of 543 children (mean age = 4.5 years, 50.6% girls). Children started child care between 3 and 64 months and were attending child care 1–9 hr per day. The child care centers’ classrooms had adult–child ratios between 5 and 8.7 and group sizes between 15 and 26 children. Externalizing and prosocial behavior with peers was assessed with the Social Competence and Behavior Evaluation Scale–Short Form completed by the 3 adult informants. Control variables included family sociodemographics and education level, maternal parenting style assessed with the Parenting Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire, and maternal stress assessed with the Parenting Experiences questionnaire. Practice or Policy: Both the number of hours per week in child care and an earlier start of center-based child care had modest but significant associations with dimensional scores from teachers’ reports of externalizing behavior but not with mothers’ or fathers’ reports, suggesting that externalizing behavior with peers could be regarded as context specific to peer relationships in group child care. There was no evidence that the quantity of exposure to child care per se could be a substantial risk factor for severe levels of externalizing behavior. Prosocial behavior with peers was not significantly associated with the number of hours in child care or with the age of entry into group child care.

AB  - Objectives: Environmental characteristics within preschools that influence children’s motor competence are largely unknown. The purpose of the present study was to examine the contribution of various preschool environmental characteristics to children’s locomotor, object control, and total gross motor scores. Design: Cross-sectional, observational study of 3–5 year-old children ( n = 229) from 22 preschools in South Carolina. Methods: The Children’s Activity and Movement in Preschool Study (CHAMPS) Motor Skills Protocol assessed MC. Preschool directors provided information regarding policies and practices. The research team measured playgrounds and classrooms, and the Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale-Revised assessed preschool quality. Time spent in open space and electronic media use were also assessed using direct observation. The aforementioned variables predicted children’s object control, locomotor, and total gross motor scores. Results: Classroom size/child ratio, teacher education, playground size, electronic media use, and trips to outside organizations emerged as significant predictors of locomotor score and total motor score. The object control model was non-significant. Conclusions: Preschools may be able to promote motor competence by allowing children more time in open spaces, structured activity experiences, and by expanding existing outdoor playground space whenever possible.

AB  - This article describes a study that investigates preschool teachers' knowledge of their young students' number conceptions and the teachers' related self-efficacy beliefs. It also presents and illustrates elements of a professional development program designed explicitly to promote this knowledge among preschool teachers. Results indicated that teachers' knowledge of students' number conceptions improved and that their related self-efficacy increased. Furthermore, prior to participating in the programs, a significant negative correlation between knowledge and self-efficacy was reported. However, no significant correlation was found after the program.

AB  - Children and adolescents with disabilities (CAD) frequently engage in inappropriate sexual behaviors. In Indonesia, the need for sex education for CAD remains unclear. This study investigated teacher attitudes toward providing sex education in special schools to clarify the gender differences among teachers providing sex education. Questionnaires were sent to 180 teachers. The response rate was 72.2%. Eighty-three percent of responders were Muslim. Our findings revealed that teachers in special schools considered sex education to be important. However, the number of sex education contents was limited, and female teachers were more positive about teaching sex education than male teachers. Equally, female teachers taught a greater number of sex education contents than did male teachers. These findings were consistent with reports from developed countries although cultural and religious background differed from those of Indonesia. Sex education for CAD was accepted by teachers in Indonesia; however, materials and tools for education should be developed further.

AB  - Required 120 5-, 7-, 9-, and 11-yr-old children to predict the next card for 100 trials under 1 of 3 ratios and 1 of 2 information conditions. In one condition, information on the ratio employed and the randomness of the sequence was available; in the other it was not given. The effects of information varied according to age and to ratio. Five- and 7-yr-olds showed little difference in their behavior when they were aware of the ratio and the randomness of the sequence. Nine-year-olds modified their behavior but were relatively insensitive to ratio differences, and it was only with the 11-yr-olds that differentiation between ratios was clearly apparent. Results indicate a developmental trend and are in general agreement with the views of Piaget and B. Inhelder (1951). (13 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Cultural values and identities remain the bench mark for national identity, cohesion, patriotism and harmonious coexistence in any society. The introduction of western education into West Africa created a weak bridge between the indigenous education and the western education which needs to be properly linked using curriculum harmonisation. This paper examines how far the curriculum of early childhood education in Nigeria link with indigenous education which is the child first point of learning. Four research questions guided the study. The study adopted a descriptive survey design with a population of 655 public primary schools that house early childhood centers spread across the 23 local government areas of Rivers State. A sample size of 164 head teachers in early childhood centers was drawn using stratified random sampling technique representing 25% of the population. Questionnaire which was validated was used as the instrument and the reliability yielded an index of 0.81. Mean and rank order scores were used to answer the research questions. The findings revealed among others, that methodologies that used gamification can be linked with early childhood education and indigenous education. These include storytelling, riddles, animal clowning, demonstration, stone counting, and local farm tools by the teachers. This implies that the teachers are aware of the ways gamification can be used to link early childhood education with indigenous education but do not use most of these methods probably it is not highlighted in their scheme of work. Based on the findings, the researchers recommended that the western curriculum should be developed base on an indigenous knowledge of early childhood in teacher training institution curriculum for early childhood education.

AB  - This study aims to analyze the student and school level variables that affect students’ self-efficacy levels in mathematics in China-Shanghai, Turkey, and Greece based on PISA 2012 results. In line with this purpose, the hierarchical linear regression model (HLM) was employed. The interschool variability is estimated at approximately 17% in China-Shanghai, approximately 22% in Turkey, and approximately 23% in Greece. This study showed a positive association between variables of self-confidence, teacher support, and attitude toward school, all of which are among Level 1 variables, and mathematics self-efficacy in all three countries. A negative association was observed to exist between the variables socio-cultural index and educational opportunities at home and mathematics self-efficacy in all three countries. While pre-school education in China- Shanghai and Turkey were negatively associated with students’ mathematics self-efficacy levels, the same variable was positively associated with students’ mathematics self-efficacy in Greece. While the variable mathematical anxiety was negatively associated with students’ mathematics self-efficacy in China-Shanghai and Greece, it was positively associated with students’ mathematics self-efficacy in Turkey. The variable interest in mathematics, in turn, was negatively associated with mathematics self-efficacy solely in China- Shanghai. Regarding the association between mathematics self-efficacy levels and the school level variables, a near-zero positive association was found between class size, deemed significant for Turkey, and self-efficacy levels. The association between teacher to student ratio in school and self-efficacy levels was found to be negative in all three countries. The variable teacher’s morale, however, was positively associated with self-efficacy level in China-Shanghai and Turkey.

AB  - This paper shows the implications of children (age 6) working with challenging mathematical problem-solving tasks in statistics.Historically mainly arithmetic has been taught in preschools (Saracho &amp; Spodek, 2008) and Sarama &amp; Clements (2009) state numbers and quantitative thinking as the main area of research for young children.The study presents results of a design-research project with the purpose of innovating and improving classroom practice (Cobb &amp; Gravemeijer, 2008). The design was both process and utility oriented (van den Akker, Gravemeijer, McKenney, Nieveen, 2006) aiming at developing design theories regarding the learning in these designed settings.The task was to determine; What will the outcome be when I draw two beads out of a bag with two red and two yellow beads? First the children were to predict the outcome resulting in a bar-chart. The beads were then drawn thirty times while they, based on own strategies, documented the outcome. Finally the mathematical outcome was discussed and an explanation was found. Furthermore the documentation per se was focused on.The ethical regulations for research in Sweden where followed, where guardians and children approved the participation.The results of the documentation showed the following: The children had used a diversity in their documentation, corresponding to levels of abstraction. Few children managed to document both outcome and number of draws. During the discussion, they explored and tried to understand each other’s documentation. This task and children’s documentations supports the idea that challenging mathematical problem-solving tasks can (ought to) be used in early childhood mathematics education settings.

AB  - Examined differences between school classes with respect to three aspects of psychosocial adjustment at school, namely the extent that children in the class liked to play with each other, the number of teacher-reported behaviour problems, and children's feelings of well-being at school. The sample consisted of 1,282 4–5-year-olds from 94 school classes and 51 schools. Multilevel analyses showed that on average 87 % of the variance was at the child level, 11% at the class level, and 3% at the school level. This indicated that a non-negligible amount of variance could not be accounted for by factors at the child level. Furthermore, this variance was mainly associated with differences between classes instead of differences between schools. Social network indices yielded substantial correlations, showed consistent trends across the different adjustment measures, and fulfilled the necessary requirement that to explain differences between school classes the predictor variables themselves should differ for classes within the same school. These results suggested that aspects of the interpersonal relations of children in the classroom such as proximity, integration, and the amount of contact could be determinants of differences between school classes in psychosocial adjustment.

AB  - Background: The extraordinarily high incidence of grammatical language impairments in developmental disorders suggests that this uniquely human cognitive function is "fragile". Yet our understanding of the neurobiology of grammatical impairments is limited. Furthermore, there is no "gold-standard" to identify grammatical impairments and routine screening is not undertaken. An accurate screening test to identify grammatical abilities would serve the research, health and education communities, further our understanding of developmental disorders, and identify children who need remediation, many of whom are currently un-diagnosed. A potential realistic screening tool that could be widely administered is the Grammar and Phonology Screening (GAPS) test—a 10 minute test that can be administered by professionals and non-professionals alike. Here we provide a further step in evaluating the validity and accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of the GAPS test in identifying children who have Specific Language Impairment (SLI). Methods and Findings: We tested three groups of children; two groups aged 3;6–6:6, a typically developing (n = 30) group, and a group diagnosed with SLI: (n = 11) (Young (Y)-SLI), and a further group aged 6;9–8;11 with SLI (Older (O)-SLI) (n = 10) who were above the test age norms. We employed a battery of language assessments including the GAPS test to assess the children’s language abilities. For Y-SLI children, analyses revealed a sensitivity and specificity at the 5 th and 10 th percentile of 1.00 and 0.98, respectively, and for O-SLI children at the 10 th and 15 th percentile .83 and .90, respectively. Conclusions: The findings reveal that the GAPS is highly accurate in identifying impaired vs. non-impaired children up to 6;8 years, and has moderate-to-high accuracy up to 9 years. The results indicate that GAPS is a realistic tool for the early identification of grammatical abilities and impairment in young children. A larger investigation is warranted in children with SLI and other developmental disorders. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

AB  - Studied interactions between the preschool teacher's evaluation of a student's learning behaviors and the quality of student–teacher interactions during a learning test. Human Ss: 11 normal female German adults (aged 24–39 yrs) (nursery school or day care teachers). 30 normal male and female German preschool children (aged 32–43 mo) (nursery school or day care students). The teachers were asked to select students with a low interest in developmental games and to evaluate these students with regard to their learning behaviors and language development. Correlations between the teacher's evaluation and the quality of teacher–student interactions during a learning test were analyzed, and the effects of the teacher's professional experience, the learning setting (nursery school vs day care), and the student's intelligence test scores and gender were determined.

AB  - International reports on early childhood education and care tend to attach increasing importance to workforce profiles. Yet a study of 15 European countries reveals that large numbers of (assistant) staff remain invisible in most international reports. As part of the CoRe project (Competence Requirements in Early Childhood Education and Care) we conducted a cross-national survey among experts in Belgium (Flemish- and French-speaking communities), Croatia, Denmark, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the UK (England and Wales). The survey explored professional and training profiles not only for formal "teaching" staff, but also for the entire workforce, making visible the assistants who are often omitted from international reports. The proportion of assistant staff varies from a very small percentage in some European countries to half of the entire workforce in many others. Whereas job profiles for higher qualified staff often focus on "education", profiles for assistants typically focus on "care". Consequently a divide between care and education can be observed, both in split systems and in integrated systems. In these cases, the concept of "education" may be narrowed down to schoolified learning and "care" may be regarded as subordinate to education. In several cases, assistants also have less entitlement to ongoing professionalisation than educational staff. Consequences of the findings for practice as well as policy are discussed.

AB  - This study deals with the relationship between the effectiveness of preschool centers and contextual factors, i.e. the way in which centers are organised and the family background of participating children. A comparison was made between the school achievements (more specifically, the literacy scores) of children that had participated in centers and a control group (N = 73 and N = 43, respectively). This comparison revealed effects on the total scores on an 'emergent literacy' observation form, and on teacher judgements of metalinguistic awareness and literacy orientation. Preschool teacher interviews were used to gather data on the 28 centers that had been visited by the children in the sample. Analyses showed a relationship between certain organisational features (especially adult-child ratio) and effectiveness of participation. Parent interviews were used to obtain information on children's family backgrounds. Analyses indicated a relationship between center effects and the extent to which immigrant children receive Dutch language input at home.

AB  - Executive functions (EFs), important cognitive processes that enable goal-directed behavior, develop due to maturation and environmental stimulation. The current study systematically reviews and synthesizes evidence on the association between teacher-student interactions and EFs. The search resulted in 28 studies, from which 23 studies provided sufficient data to be included in the calculations. Overall effect sizes indicate that teacher-child interactions are related to general executive functioning, working memory, and inhibition but not cognitive flexibility. Relationships were stronger for studies including children at the beginning of elementary school, studies with higher socioeconomic status participants and more boys, and studies measuring teacher-child interactions at the dyadic level. This study shows that qualitative teacher-child interactions are important for performance in EFs in children. This suggests that teachers can promote the cognitive processes that are essential in children's learning by changing their behavior to create an emotionally positive, structured, and cognitively stimulating classroom environment.

AB  - The quality of handwriting curriculum and instructional practices in actual classrooms was investigated in an in-depth case study of four inner city kindergarten classrooms using quantitative and qualitative methods. The handwriting proficiency of students was also evaluated to assess the impact of the instructional practices observed. The findings suggest that even though teachers employ a number of effective strategies, there is room for improvement in implementing effective, research-approved handwriting instruction. In particular, daily, explicit instruction, writing for fluency, writing from memory, and use of self-evaluation are areas that need improvement. Results indicate that the lack of emphasis on these practices impacted the quality of teaching and learning of handwriting skills. Future research is needed on the impact of teacher training, use of an assessment tool that objectively assesses students’ handwriting, use of reading and handwriting curriculum that complement and reinforce one another, and the effectiveness of research-based strategies in practice.

AB  - Children's participation in the early childhood education context is a multidimensional issue and educators have a significant role in enhancing participation. In this paper, we focus on the existing challenges to children's participation and the ways that child care educators can work as teams to meet those challenges. The data were collected with a questionnaire from 1,114 child care teams working in the Helsinki metropolitan area. These teams consisted of almost 4,000 educators who took care of almost 20,000 children. Through ESEM factor analysis, the variables were organized into five factors: Adult-Child Ratios, Professional Skills; Managing Work; Work Practices and Special Needs. The team members felt they had a varying impact on the different challenges: highest on professional skills and managing work and lowest on Adult-Child Ratios. The results offer material for reflecting on practices in early childhood education especially when children's participation must be developed.

AB  - In the present study the longitudinal relations between quantity of centre-based child care (in months) and teacher reports of internalising and externalising behaviour in the first and second grades were examined for 325 Slovenian children. The socio-political context of affordable, accessible and homogenously high-quality child care is quite different compared to the context in countries from which many child-care studies originate (e.g. the USA). In Slovenia quality standards are regulated (child:staff ratio, teacher education, curriculum), the service is subsidised and children are guaranteed a place after the end of parental leave (i.e. at 11 months). In the described socio-political context a beneficial effect of child care quantity was found for internalising behaviour, while there were negative effects for externalising behaviour. Children who spent more time in child care exhibited less internalising behaviour and more externalising behaviour in the first grade of school, both with small coefficient sizes. Our study shows that even in the context of progressive child care some positive as well as less positive effects of child care participation on child development occur.

AB  - A recent study documented the efficacy of the Early Start Denver Model (ESDM) delivered in a 1:1 fashion. In the current study we investigated the effectiveness and feasibility of the ESDM in the context of a long-day care community service, with a child-staff ratio of 1:3. Outcomes of 27 preschoolers with ASD undergoing 15-25 h per week of ESDM over 12 months were compared to those of 30 peers with ASD undergoing a different intervention program delivered in a similar community long-day care service. Children in both groups made gains in cognitive, adaptive and social skills. Participants in the ESDM group showed significantly higher gains in developmental rate and receptive language.

AB  - This study observed the extent to which teachers supported the inclusion of children with disabilities into mainstream classrooms and involved monitoring 52 mainstream preschool settings in Greece. The association between programme quality, context and teacher characteristics was also tested. Findings showed that the quality of inclusion ranged from "low" to "minimal," with teachers more frequently implementing practices that only partially promoted participation for children with disabilities in academic and social classroom activities. The analysis also revealed that the quality of programming was not influenced by the model of special education provision, the group size, the number of children with disabilities, the training teachers had in special education or their teaching experience. The results are discussed both at a national and international level, revealing areas that need further examination into preschool inclusion quality.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to investigate and understand the roles and missions of SENCOs and Special Teachers by using the perspectives of Habermas’ linguistic philosophical role theory and Karen Barad´s theory of agential realism. The aim is also to investigate how special needs education develops when the two professions encounter the realities of pedagogical practice. What ideas do SENCOs and special teachers have about their missions? How do they handle their missions? How do the preschool/school principals experience the similarities and differences between the two professions? How can the missions be handled when the two professions encounter the reality of pedagogical practice?The methodology framework is based on Habermas´ theory of argumentation (Habermas, 1995/1981; Ahlefeld Nisser, 2009, 2011) while the theoretical framework used, to analyze the empirical data, is post humanistic (Lenz Taguchi, 2012). Two different scientific disciplines are brought together; (1) Habermas’ linguistic philosophical role theory (Habermas 1995/1981, p. 152 part II; 2007) and (2) Karen Barad´s theory of agential realism and intra-acitity (Barad, 2003, 2007; Lenz Taguchi, 2012, 2011)The findings show that there are similarities in roles and missions but that it also is possible – and necessary - to draw out differences in roles and missions in order to improve inclusion and to develop ethical values and attitudes in special education. Keywords: SENCO, special teacher, theory of argumentation, role theory, agential realism, intra-acitity ReferencesAhlefeld Nisser, Désirée, von.

AB  - There are a small number of binding legal standards requiring Europe or the international community at large to implement intercultural education. However, global actors such as UNESCO, the European Union, and the Council of Europe have raised the agenda and “inspired” national changes through reports, recommendations and action plans. However, research show that the newly formulated curricula in Sweden as well as all over the world, are under pressure of globalization and Europeanisation, leading to denationalization and an instrumental view of knowledge (Ball, Goodson &amp; Maguire 2007; Wahlström 2014).The aim of this paper is to discuss the subject Religious Education in the Swedish curriculum out from a critical discourse analytic perspective (Fairclough 2003). Religious Education in Sweden is a subject for all students from grade one in primary school right through to grade three in upper secondary school. This model is sometimes categorized as an “integrative model” of Religious Education (Alberts 2007) and has always been so in Swedish compulsory schools (von Brömssen &amp; 2Rodell Olgaç 2010; Hartman 2000).However, the subject has changed considerably over the years. It is currently stated in the curriculum that teaching in the subject of religion in Sweden should “aim at helping students broaden, deepen and develop knowledge of religions, outlooks on life and ethical standpoints, and where applicable different interpretations of these” (Lgr 11).As religion and Religious Education usually works as part of the national formation of a citizen, it is interesting to analyse potentially intercultural framework in the Swedish curriculum for Religious Education (cf Gruber &amp; Rabo 2014). Thus, there will be a focus in the paper on the question whether the Swedish curriculum of Religious Education can be said to encompass intercultural perspectives and intercultural competencies or not. ReferencesAlberts, Wanda (2007) Integrative religious education in Europe- a study of religions education approach.

AB  - General description This research deals with tutoring in the mother tongue to support newly arrived students in Swedish elementary schools. Although Sweden has received many migrants for a long time, educational policies and organization for these students have been fragmented and poorly developed (Bunar, 2010, 2015; Nilsson, 2013). Students with a 'foreign background' have on average lower school results than pupils with a Swedish background (OECD, 2010; The Swedish National Board of Education, 2016). The proportion of students with 'foreign background' has gradually increased since the beginning of the 1990s. Also, in recent years there has been a marked increase in students who immigrated after school start (7 years of age). Many newly arrived students in Sweden don't obtain grades to continue to upper secondary school after grade 9. The proportion of students in this group increased from 37 percent in 2006 to 50 percent in 2015 (The Swedish National Agency for Education, 2016). These results are especially challenging as it is stated in The Swedish Educational Act that "All children and youths shall have equal access to education". It is further stated that "teaching should be adapted to each pupil's circumstances and needs. It should promote the pupils' further learning and acquisition of knowledge based on pupils' backgrounds, earlier experience, language and knowledge." (The Curriculum for the Compulsory School System, the Preschool Class and the Leisure-time Centre, Lgr 11; cf. Guadalupe, 2013). Thus, the Education Act stipulates that the education provided in each school form and in the recreation centre should be equivalent, regardless of where in the country it is provide. Until recently, the most common way to receive newly arrived students in elementary schooling in Sweden have been introductory classes, with the aim of learning Swedish and getting an introduction into Swedish society (Avery, 2017; Simola &amp; Hansson, 2017). This organization have left students with very heterogeneous backgrounds (language, age, capabilities) in the same classroom, which led to uneven equality and arbitrariness in the education (Bunar 2010; Nilsson &amp; Axelsson, 2013). As a consequence of school results and a growing criticism of education for newly arrived students from professionals and researchers, new rules were introduced in the Education Act concerning the this group on January 1, 2016 (Andersson, Lyrenäs &amp; Sidenhag, 2015; Swedish National Agency for Education, 2016). As it is the responsibility of the municipality to implement and organize education for newly arrive students, the local organization differs widely (Avery, 2017). Thus, several models of organizing education for newly arrived students have been added (Avery 2017) and new models are developed. Currently models of direct inclusion in regular classes with language support from tutors in the newly arrived student's mother tongue is given in the Swedish ordinary classroom seem to increase. However, research on school organization for newly arrived students and their actual support in their local schools are scarce. With this research we want to make a contribution to the ongoing European discussion on how to make education available and with a good quality to all newly arrived students (cf. Avery, 2017; Bukus, 2016; European Commission, 2015; Terhart &amp; von Dewitz, 2017; Torbjørnsen, 2017).ObjectivesThe objective of the study is to explore organizational models of receiving and supporting newly arrived students in two Swedish municipalities. The study will provide opinions and perspectives of different supporting models for newly arrived students from headmasters, teachers, student tutors as well as from newly arrived students themselves.Theoretical frameworkTheoretically, our contribution builds on a theory of practice developed by O'Reilly (2012) where external structures as well as internal structures in the researched compulsory schools are taken into account. Practices take place in a perspective or "horizon of action" and involve active agency, communities of practice and conjuncturally-specific external structures (O'Reilly, 2012). The concept of situated learning proposed by Lave and Wenger (1991) is used to analyze how wider structures are both preconditioning and limiting variables for outcomes of action. Also a perspective of culturally responsive teaching inspired by Gay (2010) is of importance when analyzing teaching practices.Methods/methodology The project draws on qualitative data from seven elementary school and two reception units. These case studies explore arrangements and organizational models of receiving newly arrived students and their support. The data includes interviews with headmasters, teachers, tutors and newly arrived students as well as ethnographic data from observations.Expected outcomes/resultThe analysis show that elementary schools, even within only two Swedish municipalities, varies widely in their organization and support for newly arrived students. This seems to have a background in the school's history and habit of receiving newly arrived students, in the school's leadership and their interest and knowledge of policies and research in the field as well as opportunities for recruiting competent staff. Several of the schools have altered their organizational models for supporting newly arrived students during the last year (2016-2017), working towards involving student tutors in the mother language to support students in their regular classes. These students' tutors have the task of supporting pupils' knowledge development in different subjects and helping the students to the extent possible to the goals of the education. In order to do so they are supposed to plan together with the class-teachers and the subject matter teachers, an organization that is complex and seems quite difficult to accomplish. Our research show that the student tutors' qualifications vary significantly, their position and status and opportunity for participation in the schools vary, their assignments and awareness of the assignment vary, as well as the teachers understanding of what study supervision is and can be and their will and ability to interact as well as the organizational conditions. Under certain conditions the student tutors' have great potential to work as a significant professional, making a positive difference for new students' chances in the education system, and under other conditions more like an assistant. Student tutors in the mother tongue demonstrate concern for the students' emotional and physical conditions, thus creating a caring climate. However, questions on the tutors' language competency and their knowledge level in subject matter areas can be raised in relation to these arrangements.

AB  - The study examined the applicability and generalizability of the Classroom Assessment Scoring System Pre-K (CLASS Pre-K; Pianta, La Paro, & Hamre, 2008) and the associated conceptual Teaching through Interaction framework to understand classroom processes in the German early education system. Three broad domains describe effective teacher–child interactions: Emotional Support, Classroom Organization, and Instructional Support. In the present study, we observed teacher–child interactions in 63 classrooms drawn from 26 different preschools using the CLASS Pre-K. Consistent with research from the United States, CLASS Pre-K scores demonstrated that the quality of teacher–child interactions varied widely. Data indicated that the levels of Emotional Support and Classroom Organization were moderate. In contrast, the level of Instructional Support was rather low and even decreased over the course of the morning. Furthermore, Emotional Support was found to decrease over the day in classrooms with a higher child–teacher ratio. Results have important implications for policy and practice with regard to the quality of care and education in German preschools.

Policies being developed and promoted by Elizabeth Truss predate her appointment as a minister and are consistent with the radical neo-liberal agenda pursued by Secretary of State Michael Gove. The author draws on news articles and policy announcements and calls into question the misuse and abuse of international comparisons to justify changes to early years policy in England.

AB  - This paper explores the ways preschool teachers orchestrate instructional environments to promote mathematical play related to early number and, how they intervene during play to promote children's engagement with early number. We highlight these practices to identify resources for the growing numbers of early childhood teachers. This is important as many prospective and practicing teachers do not have access to the knowledge of teaching that supports young children's math learning because of the constraints of mathematics methods courses and the dearth of research on early childhood mathematics in mathematic education journals -- particularly in-depth attention to early number and teaching mathematics in play.

AB  - Objective: The aim was to examine referral pathways to child and youth consultation-liaison (C-L) services to identify patterns associated with demographic characteristics of patients, referral sources, the presenting problem and models of service. Method: A case record review with a cross-sectional design. Data were extracted from the records of all patients referred to the C-L service for a 3 month period. Results: Adolescents were more likely to access mental health services through informal liaison services. Medical specialty areas that were inclusive of nursing and allied health, in both the request for service and initial response to the request, had higher frequencies of referral. There was no difference between the disciplines of medicine and social work in the frequency of referrals. However, medicine, social work and nursing differed in the number of staff who initiated the request for consultation, and the types of problems that were presented as reasons for referral. Conclusions: Inclusive multidisciplinary models may facilitate the development of service relationships in paediatric hospital settings, due to the stability of staffing arrangements. The wider participation of allied health and nursing staff within paediatric hospitals may extend opportunities for the identification of mental health problems and enhance timely management of referrals.

AB  - Framed by a social practice perspective, this article presents a theoretical, political, and practical rationale for implementing and expanding water, sanitation and hygiene education (WASH) in preschools throughout the world. Every day thousands of young children die, while others suffer serious illness or stunting from water-, sanitation-, and hygiene-related causes. Many of these consequences could be prevented with low-cost interventions. Although there is little peer-reviewed research on preschool WASH, justifications and ideas for action can be found in the results of WASH studies in primary schools. Pre-primary education and WASH are priorities within the global Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) for 2015–2030. Numerous materials and methods from school-based WASH can be used or adapted for preschool. However, early childhood and WASH professionals and advocates must launch preschool initiatives and also advocate for incorporation of WASH curricula into pre-service and in-service teacher education. More research needs to be conducted on outcomes of WASH-focused experiences in preschool. Advocacy actions with governments, UNICEF, NGOs, and other organizations can ensure that aspirations and good intentions for WASH initiatives are realized, but such progress will require adequate funding.

AB  - Impaired self-awareness is a common consequence following a brain injury that affects engagement in rehabilitation and results in poor long term functional outcomes. Literature regarding self-awareness following a brain injury in childhood is lacking. The aim of this research study was to understand the self-awareness of deficits from a developmental perspective. Methods: A multiple case study design with fully integrated mixed methodology (QUAN + QUAL). Fifteen children/young people (CYP) with traumatic brain injury (TBI) (5–17 years; 10 male) were recruited and data were collected from CYP, their parents and teachers. Self-report measures included Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and Harter Scales. Interview measures included Self-Understanding Interview and Knowledge Interview for Children. A novel method of analysis compared CYP report to parent/teacher report and to normative children’s data. Three exemplars showcase this methodology. Results: Within-case and cross-case analysis identified interrupted development of self-awareness following TBI. CYP ratings differed most from parent/teacher ratings in the social and behavioural domains. In relation to the school/learning and physical domains, CYP ratings differed most from normative children’s data. The younger children had greater degree of ratings discrepancy across all domains. Seven key themes were aspirations, beliefs, being different, brain injuries, characteristics, participation, and interpersonal interactions and relationships. Conclusion: This study is among the first to describe the complexity of self-awareness across a range of functional domains following a brain injury in childhood. New theoretical and clinical perspectives are presented from understanding the importance of typical development and the child’s age at injury.

AB  - Assessed perceived self-efficacy in kindergarten teachers and examined whether there was a negative relationship of perceived self-efficacy with anxiety. 120 female kindergarten teachers (aged 19-56 yrs) in Guangdong province, China, were assessed with the Chinese adaptation of the General Self-Efficacy Scale (J. X. Zhang et al, 1995), the self-designed Self-Efficacy Scale for Kindergarten Teachers, and the Chinese version of the State-Trait Scale. Correlation analysis was used to study the relationship of kindergarten teachers' specific self-efficacy and general self-efficacy and the relationship of general self-efficacy with state-trait anxiety. The results show that kindergarten teachers had high scores in self-efficacy, especially in specific self-efficacy; that the levels of anxiety of kindergarten teachers were in the normal range, however, at least 15% of the teachers had higher levels of anxiety; and that there were negative correlations of teachers' general and specific self-efficacy with state-trait anxiety.

AB  - This paper scrutinises the challenges facing the implementation of Early Childhood Development and Education policy in Bungoma County, Kenya. The study used a mixed research design and study population comprised of the QASOs, the Head teachers, ECDE teachers and the non-teaching staff in respective ECDCs. The sample size of the study comprised of 9 QUASOs, 27 head teachers, 81 teachers of ECDE and 27 non-teaching staff from selected public primary schools in the study region. The study utilised simple random sampling, stratified and purposive sampling. The tools for data collection comprised of the questionnaire, focussed group, interview schedule, observation and document analysis schedules. The quantitative data was analysed using descriptive statistics while qualitative data used content analysis procedures. The study identified a number of challenges including: inadequacy of teaching and learning resources, financial constraints, and lack of government good will, poor training of ECDE teachers, insecurity, high pupil-teacher ratio, poor teacher remunerations and the introduction of FPE. The study recommends that: the Counties and Central government should fund the ECDE, the central government should hire ECDE teachers on permanent and pensionable terms; QASOs should be facilitated to cover vast areas with ease and increase the number of visits to the ECDCs; the Education and lastly, the government should train non-teaching staff on safety operations and above all hire a qualified nurse for every ECDE centre.

AB  - This study was conducted in order to help children to shift smoothly from kindergarten to elementary school. On that occasion, it was focused on differences between the points of views of kindergarten teachers on children and elementary school teachers, and their irrational beliefs, particulary obsessive ideas. Three points of the following became clear mainly as a result of this study. (1) Irrational beliefs of elementary school teachers were more in number with comparison to kindergarten teachers. (2) Two points of view of "the initiative" and "observance of the rule and the subject" were seen in common with both teachers, but the point of view of "uniqueness of the child" was seen only by kindergarten teachers. (3) Rational elementary school teachers had the point of view of "the uniqueness of the child" but also they saw children by multiple points of view. From the above, (1) The possibility was suggested that the difference of the points of view between kindergarten teachers and elementary school teachers would be resolved and children would shift smoothly from the kindergarten to the elementary school if elementary school teachers stood at the side of children. (2) The possibility was suggested that teachers could vary on their points of view on the matter but also they could pay more attention to the children's various sides by reducing irrational beliefs.

AB  - This research explores some of the social processes apparently underlying notions of 'normality' and 'deviance' as teachers identify and operate the boundaries of the 'normal' social world of school and classrooms. It is based on four case studies in primary and secondary schools. The data are derived from semi-structured and unstructured interviews with teachers giving accounts of their attempts to make sense of pupils. Inclusionary and exclusionary processes seem to involve the construction of pupil identities as either sociologically 'normal' or 'deviant'. Inclusivity as an educational goal or as a teacher strategy attempts the normalization of the majority of pupils. By contrast, pressures to exclude pupils from schools invite the identification of some as being fundamentally different 'others', marginal in status or sociologically deviant. Teachers, in effect, appear to be engaged in a societal process of patrolling the boundaries of the 'normal' social world and structuring the careers of children either within schools and classrooms or, in some cases, even manoeuvring them beyond their boundaries.

AB  - This author states that he feels privileged to have been able to contribute to a number of teacher professional associations since the early 1980s at both the local and national levels. His involvement with the Australian Council for Computers in Education (ACCE) was for a period in excess of 18 years as the Computer Education Group of the ACT (CEGACT) representative on the Board, as president for six years, and then as ACCE representative to and chair of the Technology Education Federation of Australia (TEFA) for the period 1992-1999. This has enabled him to be involved in a range of projects over a number of years including; "Gateways: Information Technology in the Learning Process" (Commonwealth of Australia 1996), "Making Better Connections--Models of teacher professional development for the integration information and communication technology into classroom practice" (Commonwealth of Australia 2001), "Raising the Standards: an ICT Competencies Framework for Teacher" (Commonwealth of Australia 2001), and the "Learning Technologies Plan for ACT Government Schools and Preschools 2004-2006" (Australian Capital Territory 2004a). These projects and a range of other professional association related experiences have enabled him to gain some insights into the complex issues around the embedding of ICT into teaching and learning in schools. This article outlines his thoughts (and some from the research literature) about what needs to happen, particularly at the school level, for the full benefits of learning technologies to be realised.

AB  - Presents a symposium which was planned to consider what the orthopsychiatric clinical orientation might have to offer to the field of prevention. What kind of thinking and facts are needed in order to contribute more effectively to preventive work? It is hoped that the symposium will serve to focus the attention anew on the challenge to sort out what have been learned, that is pertinent to prevention and to identify areas for research and for cooperation with others in the pursuit of fostering better mental health. In prevention of mental illness much more data is required than we now have. Medical-and especially pediatric-settings offer a fruitful area for research, particularly in terms of parent-child relationships. Greater numbers of psychiatrically trained personnel are necessary; the exploration of the fuller use of such personnel in medical settings is indicated. The relative shortage of such personnel hampers this exploration at the present time. Certainly psychiatric training per se does not qualify one to consult adequately in the pediatric or public health setting. An opportunity to function in such settings could profitably become incorporated into the training of more psychiatrists. It is also of importance to provide psychiatric training for nonpsychiatric child care personnel. Through such training these workers come to perform a more adequate, insightful job.

AB  - The purpose of this study conducted in 36 infant–toddler centres ( Kinderkrippen) in the city of Munich in Bavaria/Germany was to explore structural characteristics of early child care and education and their effects on child care quality. Stepwise regressions and variance analysis (Manova) examined the relation between quality of care and structural characteristics such as group size, staff competence and preparation time. A multi-respondent approach was employed, including self-report questionnaires of educators ( Erzieherinnen) as well as data on local working conditions collected from the directors of the centres. The findings of this study suggest that different sets of variables can be used to predict quality of education for under-threes. The practitioners’ reported quality of education was found to relate to higher competence (with regard to centre programme, documentation, teamwork and staff qualification), better orientation towards the children’s needs and better working atmosphere. Furthermore there were multivariate effects of the availability of and networking with external specialists, preparation time, and grouping arrangements within the centre such as changing from a home-group approach to an open-group setting. The findings are discussed in terms of their implications for research and the basic impact of education in early childhood.

AB  - Focus group interviews were carried out at 12 preschools. The aim was to investigate children's perceptions and experiences of food, and the possibility of using focus group techniques with children aged 3–5 years. A total of 103 children participated. The children associated food and eating with rules and norms. Most children described these rules and norms as well as what they were and were not allowed to do. They knew very well the difference between acceptable and non-acceptable mealtime behaviour, and were especially aware of what they were not allowed to do. When children were asked to rate foods they 'disliked', they spoke instead about their favourite foods. They did not categorize food as good or bad, as adults often do, but as 'food' and 'non-food', for example, sweets were not food. The method used in this study, the focus group interview, was judged to be a useful tool for exploring how children think about and jointly reflect upon food.

AB  - The physical environment in early years education and care is crucial. This paper examines the Swedish government’s vision of preschool design in the welfare state of the 1970s and the conceptions of children and society upon which it was based. Presenting an investigation of reports, booklets, and study materials published by various branches of the central government, this paper analyses an ambitious preschool design intended to provide children with a diverse and stimulating environment that supported their independence and freedom of choice. Unlike similar designs in postwar Europe, this preschool design was not formulated in response to the experiences of the world wars. Inspired by the theories of Piaget and Erikson and based on the rationality of the Swedish welfare state, this preschool design was instead intended to remedy the shortcomings of a perceived anonymous, sterile and barren modern society. In relation to existing research, this paper contributes to the study of the so-called nursery heritage by examining how it was formulated in the setting of the Swedish welfare state. In so doing, the paper also provides ample ground for a continued critical discussion on contemporary strands of neoliberal preschool design.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a screening instrument (the Swedish Communication Screening at 18 months of age; SCS18), derived from the Swedish MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory, in identification of 18-month-old children who will be severely language disabled by 3 years of age, the authors (a) analyzed which SCS18's component yielded the best prediction, (b) compared the productivity figures of the SCS18 with those of the traditional method of identification, and (c) tried different cutoff criteria of the SCS18. METHOD: Half of the child health care (CHC) centers in a Swedish county were randomly selected to use the SCS18 (e.g., a checklist supporting parents in assessing their child's word production, word comprehension, and communicative gestures). Remaining CHC centers used an informal assessment. Expressive and receptive language was subsequently judged with an observation for 3-year-olds that is routine in the county. An unselected population of 2,080 children participated at 18 months of age and again at 3 years of age. RESULT: Number of spoken words yielded the best prediction, and SCS18 was superior to the traditional method. A sensitivity of 50%, however, was not enough, and a stricter criterion resulted in too many false positives to be acceptable as routine. CONCLUSION: Although the SCS18 has strength, the age of 18 months seems to be too early for identification of severe language disability.

AB  - Conducted an 8-wk intraclassroom within-S comparison of one-to-one and small group arrangements for teaching 8 profoundly mentally retarded children aged 3–9 yrs. Dependent variables were the minutes the teacher spent teaching behavioral objectives, the number of times the teacher left or turned away from S being taught, the number of trials correct per S, and the number of objectives taught per S. A reversal design was used. Based on the 1st 2 variables, the one-to-one instructional arrangement appeared to be superior. (11 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - What does it mean to be a child of our time in a learning society? What role does temporality play for pedagogical relationships in children’s everyday life and learning? In what way might notions of ‘being’ and ‘becoming’ influence children’s ability to create knowledge and meaning? In the contemporary educational debate and policy, demands on higher education constantly increase and younger children’s learning is required to be stimulated. ‘Being’ and processes of learning are often placed in the present moment, while ‘becoming’ can be connected to products of learning placed in the future. Traditionally, grownups and adults represent the human beings while children can be viewed as human becomings. Although we cannot ignore the importance of desire and change in conquering knowledge, focusing mainly the future can lead to an over-emphasis on the value of ‘becoming’. Children’s being and meaning-making in the present moment are likely to be undervalued. A too strong focus on ‘being’, a somewhat stagnant position, may as well limit children’s possibility to learn.The overall aim of this paper is to illuminate and discuss the notions of ‘being’ and ‘becoming’ and what consequences those notions might have on pedagogical relationships and children’s learning in educational settings such as preschool and school. I explore these notions in relation to the philosophy of the life-world, as formulated by the French philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and in some extent to Gilles Deleuze’s theory of time, as well as to voices from a number of teachers in school and preschool. The combination of teacher voice and the associated philosophical discussion, show that it is relevant to continue and broaden the exploration of children as both ‘beings’ and ‘becomings’. The ambiguous relationship between ‘being’ and ‘becoming’ therefore is discussed in terms of an intertwined, chiasmic and ever changing process.The paper offers a philosophical contribution to the field of educational research, but one in which the philosophy is exemplified by, and connected to, teachers’ voices.

AB  - Concerns about the legitimacy, purposes, capability, and effectiveness of Pre-Kindergarten—Grade 12 public schools in the United States are expressed in virtually every sector of society. Although most of the reservations relate to academic achievement, there is increasing awareness of serious and pervasive problems related to student mental health. In response, initiatives to integrate mental health and education systems have been developed which include an expansion of the role of classroom teachers in augmenting mental health services along the continuum from prevention to focused intervention. After establishing a rationale for broadening teacher capacity, data on the mental health needs and characteristics of children and young people are provided, followed by a description of the (currently inadequate) school services required to support all students. Limitations in preparation of teachers to address current student needs are highlighted. We then propose an integrated, comprehensive mental health competencies curriculum framework, consisting of 34 specific dispositions (beliefs, values, and attitudes) and six domains of mental health knowledge and skills that we recommend for inclusion in pre-service and in-service professional preparation programs for all teachers in both general and special education. Finally, conclusions and suggestions for future directions are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

AB  - How broadly will computers be used in PK-12 teaching? Reform efforts have often succeeded in getting many teachers to experiment in modest ways with some aspects of those reforms, although often only temporarily, and have also provided some stellar and enduring examples of transformed teaching (e.g., Dunn, 2000). However, in a century of American educational reforms, "we can produce few, if any, examples of large numbers of teachers engaging in these practices in large-scale institutions designed to deliver education to most children" (Elmore, 1996, p. 308).

AB  - Argues the value of systematically considering previous reviews to determine whether there is a need for future scientific inquiry to understand what is known in a particular area. Using the literature on the efficacy of early intervention, the authors demonstrate the value of systematically analyzing previous reviews of the literature as an initial step in conducting an integrative review. Early intervention is defined as a variety of educational, psychological, or therapeutic interventions provided for handicapped, at-risk, or disadvantaged preschoolers to prevent or ameliorate developmental delays or disabilities or to provide support in cases in which these disabilities exist. 52 previous reviews of the literature were obtained, from which 447 studies regarding the efficacy of early intervention were coded and summarized. Findings suggest that most reviews suffered from methodologic weaknesses. Variables frequently cited included parental involvement, age at which intervention began, setting, type of curriculum, and child/teacher ratio.

AB  - In early twentieth-century Australia, men managed coeducational state training colleges (equivalent to normal schools) but teacher education programmes for kindergartners were initiatives of the free kindergarten movement and firmly in women's hands. The Kindergarten Training College in Adelaide, South Australia, was established in 1907 with Lillian de Lissa as its principal. This article focuses on a proposed amalgamation with the state training college in 1909-1910. During this period de Lissa and her largely female support-base were ranged against male administrators and academics who favoured amalgamation, and gender issues were entwined with those of social class and progressive education. At the height of the controversy de Lissa claimed that the aims of the two institutions were incommensurable and sharply differentiated kindergartners from state teachers on the basis of their social class and pedagogy. De Lissa and her supporters won, and kindergarten training colleges in other Australian states also remained separate from state training colleges until the 1970s. The final section of the article considers some of the long-term consequences of these divisions for the early childhood teaching profession. (Contains 80 footnotes.)

AB  - It has been argued that a key strategy to improve developmental and educational outcomes for young children is to increase the number of childcare staff with early childhood university degrees (Saracho & Spodek, 2007). In order to upgrade the qualifications of staff, a number of Australian universities provide pathways that enable graduates of early childhood diploma programs to complete a degree. Several impediments, including institutional structures and individual contextual and personal factors, may affect these pathways. Although a range of organisations offer diploma programs, TAFE (Tertiary and Further Education) is a major provider. The aim of the present study was to investigate student transition between early childhood programs in TAFE and university. The research drew on several data sources, including a survey of the perceptions of students at various points of undertaking the transition. The current credit arrangement for TAFE Diploma graduates was found to be satisfactory; however, gaps were identified between the TAFE and university teaching and learning arrangements with regard to curriculum structures, teaching styles and assessment. Graduates of both programs considered that the completion of both awards would have a positive effect on their careers.

AB  - In recent years, propensity score matching (PSM) has gained attention as a potential method for estimating the impact of public policy programs in the absence of experimental evaluations. In this study, we evaluate the usefulness of PSM for estimating the impact of a program change in an educational context (Tennessee's Student Teacher Achievement Ratio Project [Project STAR]). Because Tennessee's Project STAR experiment involved an effective random assignment procedure, the experimental results from this policy intervention can be used as a benchmark, to which we compare the impact estimates produced using propensity score matching methods. We use several different methods to assess these nonexperimental estimates of the impact of the program. We try to determine "how close is close enough," putting greatest emphasis on the question: Would the nonexperimental estimate have led to the wrong decision when compared to the experimental estimate of the program? We find that propensity score methods perform poorly with respect to measuring the impact of a reduction in class size on achievement test scores. We conclude that further research is needed before policymakers rely on PSM as an evaluation tool. (Contains 6 tables and 32 endnotes.)

AB  - Phase 1 of this study explores findings from a nationwide survey on computer-assisted language learning (CALL) that was completed by 409 in-service teachers of French, German, and Spanish. These results, in turn, informed specific themes that were explored in greater detail during focus group sessions with 22 in-service K--2 foreign language teachers (Phase 2). The main theme that emerged from the survey and the focus groups was the perceived need (expressed by in-service teachers) for future teachers to learn how to think about, analyze, and integrate new technologies into a foreign language curriculum without having to depend on tool-specific training since prospective teachers will use a number of new technologies--many of which have not yet been developed--throughout their career. Consequently, Phase 3 of this study examines a new component of a foreign language pedagogy course in which 18 prospective teachers studied and applied a faceted classification scheme for analyzing and understanding computer-mediated discourse as a tool-independent approach to CALL training.

AB  - In recent years there has been a debate in the Nordic countries about group size in preschool and how it affects preschool teachers’ work and children’s wellbeing and learning. The aim of this article is to analyse and discuss how preschool teachers’ working with child groups of different sizes view the conditions for children’s learning and development related to different abilities and skills. The survey data consists of preschool teachers’ (N=698) responses to a questionnaire. The results indicated no statistically significant differences between preschool teachers’ views and emphases in groups of different sizes as regards the type of abilities in children’s learning. In all group categories, preschool teachers seem to emphasise a similar set of characteristics and social skills in children’s personal development; to be collaborative, to have respect, to have empathy and a good self-esteem or understanding of oneself.

AB  - • Gruppstorlek i förskolan bör ses i ljuset av samverkande faktorer: arbetslagets utbildning och kompetens, personaltäthet, barngruppssammansättning och fysiska utrymmen. • Barngruppsstorlek är relaterat till interaktionen mellan faktorerna och samspelet mellan dem skapar olika villkor för förskollärare att arbeta professionellt, liksom för barns möjligheter att lära enligt intentionerna i läroplanen. • Antal barn i gruppen har betydelse för förskollärares val och bortval av målområden och arbetssätt. Ökar antalet barn i gruppen som helhet, får även de mindre grupperingarna ett större antal barn, vilket försvårar arbetet med läroplanen. • Den fysiska miljön är en nyckelfaktor då den utgör ramen för vad som är möjligt att planera och genomföra i form av innehåll och aktiviteter. Förskolans rum ska vara avpassade för antalet barn och ge möjligheter både att dela upp och att samla hela gruppen. • Färre barn i grupperna möjliggör högre grad av kommunikation, medan större grupper uppfattas stimulera kreativitet. • Oberoende av gruppstorlek, betonar förskollärare vikten av att utveckla barns sociala förmågor och självkänsla. Kognitiva färdigheter som kritiskt tänkande och en observerande attityd ges mindre uppmärksamhet. • Utifrån ett professionellt perspektiv på förskolans utveckling och kvalitet är det av vikt att systematiskt studera och kartlägga: - barngruppernas organisering i form av storbarns-, åldersblandade och åldersspecifika grupper, - betydelsen av barns ålder, relaterat till innehåll och aktivitet.

AB  - The quality of Swedish preschool varies giving children unequal conditions for wellbeing, to learn and develop. (Sheridan, et al., 2009). In recent years, the OECD (2015) has reported that the quality of Swedish preschools has declined, moving from first place within the OECD countries to now number three. Much angst has also been reported on increasing group sizes within preschools, high stress amongst preschool teachers, increasing child stress as well as many other issues (Sheridan, et al., 2014; Williams, et al., 2016).

AB  - This review examined 29 empirical studies published in peer-reviewed journals from 2002 to 2017 that investigated the use of computers and information and communication technologies during writing instruction and related writing activities. Qualitative content analysis was employed to investigate how technology was used in the writing program, the impact of technology-mediated instruction on students' writing skills, and the barriers teachers faced in integrating technology into the writing curriculum. Results of the review demonstrated that computers and a range of digital technologies, applications, and web-based learning environments have been used to teach writing in K-12 educational settings. Technology-mediated writing instruction yielded improvements in students' composing processes and writing skills as well as their knowledge and use of new literacies. Students designed, produced, and presented a variety of multimodal and digital texts that represented their knowledge and understandings of literary material and contemporary social justice issues. The use of technology motivated student engagement and participation in writing assignments and increased social interaction and peer collaboration. Teachers faced a number of challenges in their efforts to integrate technology into the writing curriculum. Several recommendations are offered based on the results of this review. Relevant, high-quality teacher professional development on pedagogical uses of technology are urgently needed in order to promote technology-mediated writing instruction and build students' 21st century literacy skills. Institutional support is needed to ensure the availability of computers and appropriate applications in every classroom. Future research needs to identify how teachers can use multimedia and digital tools to improve writing instruction in the digital age, meet the objectives of the writing curriculum, and engage all students in the composing process. Continued exploration of how digital writing environments and online writing communities can support students’ competence as writers also is needed. Substantial investigative work is needed in the early childhood program. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

AB  - Inclusion is a federal and state mandate, making it critical that early childhood teachers have adequate preparation in their preservice program for serving young children with disabilities. One of the challenges states face in increasing the availability of high-quality inclusive programs is ensuring adequate numbers of confident, competent personnel. This article provides an overview and lessons learned from Natural Allies, a national project focused on statewide efforts to enhance personnel preparation programs and support faculty who prepare practitioners for early childhood inclusion. The project was developed, implemented, and evaluated in 8 states. State goals set as a result of the project have resulted in some long-term systems level changes. Lessons learned about supporting the development of cross-sector professional development systems and practices include the following: (1) benefits can be accrued from a focused strategic process that includes an outside catalyst cofacilitating planning with a state insider; (2) faculty from 2-and 4-year institutions of higher education are enthusiastic about being part of statewide cross-sector planning to enhance professional development especially if it involves learning about new methods and resources that benefit their professional development efforts; and (3) collaboration takes time, focused attention and both formal and informal support structures. Project findings emphasize the need to provide incentives and supports for those who are willing to involve themselves in collaborative projects that take them away from agency or discipline-specific work.

AB  - Surveys of preschool personnel and teachers of early childhood educators found that mainstreaming of children with disabilities in preschools increased from 1985-90; benefits are widely recognized; that activities are easily adapted for such children; and primary barriers to successful mainstreaming are inadequate training, high student-staff ratios, lack of funds, and lack of professionals with expertise in various disciplines.

AB  - In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, the number of charter schools in New Orleans has rapidly expanded. During the 2012/13 school year--the period covered by this study--of the 85 public schools in New Orleans, 75 were chartered, enrolling more than 84 percent of all public school students in the city in 92 different school campuses. This study explored organizational, operational, and instructional features of New Orleans charter schools serving grades 3-8 that are potential indicators of student achievement growth in English language arts (ELA), math, and science. The organizational characteristic of kindergarten provided as an entry grade was associated with higher levels of [value-added measures] VAM on the ELA test. The operational characteristic of an extended school year also was associated with higher levels of ELA VAM. The instructional characteristics of a lower percentage of teachers with graduate degrees, more experienced teachers, and a lower student/teacher ratio were associated with higher levels of ELA VAM. The analysis revealed fewer potential key indicators of charter school effectiveness regarding VAM in math and science. The inclusion of kindergarten as an entry grade was the only school feature that was statistically significant in its association with math VAM; schools with kindergarten were correlated with higher math VAM scores. Having a lower student/teacher ratio and fewer staff in student support roles were the only school features that were statistically significant in their association with higher science VAM scores. None of these associations between potential key indicators and math and science VAM scores remained statistically significant when estimated using 2013/14 outcome data, indicating that the results are not robust to such an additional analysis. Offering kindergarten as an entry grade and having a lower teacher/student ratio were the only potential key indicators with statistically significant associations with more than one VAM outcome. Having kindergarten as an entry grade was positively associated with ELA and math VAM. Having a lower teacher/student ratio was associated with higher ELA and science VAM. Contains appendices.

AB  - The aims of this article are to explore contemporary challenges to developing play in early childhood settings, and to identify areas of consensus and collision in policy and practice. Contemporary research highlights the effectiveness of mixed pedagogical approaches, including child- and adult-initiated play. Whilst early childhood specialists recognise these approaches as central to high-quality curricula in early childhood settings, play continues to pose a number of challenges to teachers and practitioners. These issues are discussed in the context of contemporary theoretical trends towards developing critical pedagogies, which contest the power effects of free play and free choice in the context of wider concerns about equity and social justice.

AB  - To investigate the role of early context in theory of mind development, institutionalized children living in a boarding home (n = 34) in Turkey were compared to home-reared children coming from low (n = 32) and middle socioeconomic backgrounds (n = 44). Theory of mind was assessed with one deception and three false belief tasks; Peabody PVT and Raven CPM were administered to control for language and nonverbal intelligence. Results indicated a context effect whereby home-reared children performed better than institution-reared children on theory of mind tasks. Hierarchical regression analysis further revealed that institution rearing/adult-child ratio predicted theory of mind performance even after age, socioeconomic background, language and nonverbal intelligence were accounted for. Findings suggest the significance of adult-child interaction for theory of mind development. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

AB  - Studied the reliability and validity of a Japanese version of the Matthews Youth Test for Health (MYTH) by K. A. Matthews and J. Angulo (1980)—a questionnaire that measures degrees of Type A (coronary prone) behavior in children. Human subjects: 23 normal Japanese adults (kindergarten and day-nursery teachers). 482 normal male and female Japanese preschool children (aged 3–5 yrs) (kindergarten and day-nursery students). In Study 1, teachers rated their students using the MYTH. In Study 2, several 4–5 yr olds were subdivided into Type A vs Type B (noncoronary prone) groups and were administered 3 tasks: mailing, discrimination, and putting in chips. The reliability, internal consistency, factor loadings, and construct validity of the MYTH were determined. (English abstract) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This paper investigates the relationship between non-parental care and toddlers' behavioral outcomes using data from Australia. In particular, we explore heterogeneity in the relationship using the unique data on quality attributes: carer/child ratio, share of qualified staff, and expert ratings. The results suggest that full-time non-parental care, particularly center care, is negatively associated with toddlers' behavioral outcomes. The negative association is however mitigated when centers have a larger number of carers per child. The negative association between non-parental care and behavioral outcomes also appears to be larger for children with better-educated parents. (Contains 12 tables.)

AB  - This study examined the overall life satisfaction of personal care workers (PCWs) delivering dementia care in elderly day care centers in Hong Kong. A total of 142 PCWs participated in the present study. Regression analysis results showed that self-efficacy in dementia care was a robust predictor for PCWs' life satisfaction. Female gender, perceived adequacy of training, low staff to client ratio, and high emotional support from colleagues predicted a high level of self-efficacy. To promote a higher level of life satisfaction among PCWs, it is essential for organizations to enhance their sense of self-efficacy. Providing PCWs with adequate training that address areas specific to their perceived needs is of utmost importance in achieving this goal.

AB  - Studied the mental health status of student cadres. 1,289 student cadres and 5,699 students (aged 15–18 yrs) (2,492 males and 4,496 females) from 20 secondary schools in Shanxi province, China, were investigated with the SCL-90. Ss' psychosomatic symptoms were compared between student cadre Ss and student Ss. The symptoms were further studied in special groups, i.e. the student cadres and students of secondary normal schools (kindergarten teachers in training). Incidence rates of psychosomatic symptoms in student Ss and student cadre Ss and student cadre Ss' main psychosomatic symptoms, especially the symptoms of female student cadre Ss are discussed.

AB  - Review of cost-effectiveness studies suggests that rapid assessment is more cost effective with regard to student achievement than comprehensive school reform (CSR), cross-age tutoring, computer-assisted instruction, a longer school day, increases in teacher education, teacher experience or teacher salaries, summer school, more rigorous math classes, value-added teacher assessment, class size reduction, a 10% increase in per pupil expenditure, full-day kindergarten, Head Start (preschool), high-standards exit exams, National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (NBPTS) certification, higher teacher licensure test scores, high-quality preschool, an additional school year, voucher programs, or charter schools. Limitations of the study are discussed and the findings are interpreted with regard to studies of the effect of performance feedback on student motivation and perceptions of control over academic outcomes.

AB  - Children start to develop number sense even well before they start the school. Developing number sense serves as an intermediate tool for learning conventional mathematics taught in schools. This number sense has three key areas: number knowledge, counting and arithmetic operations. As a result, the aim of this study was to examine aged related complexity of number sense development of young children's aged four, six and seven under two key areas: number knowledge and counting. Semi structured task based clinical interviews were employed to examine number sense development. Five different assessment tasks were employed with three children. Children's responses were analysed to identify their level of number sense understanding and difficulties with developing number sense. Findings were reported under two categories: first children's ability to understand number concept and their ability to accomplish number word sequences and second counting. Findings of the study indicated a significant age related complexity and improvement in both two aspects of number sense. Older children with more experience developed better number sense than the younger children.

AB  - Studied 7 children with severe hearing handicaps who were enrolled in kindergarten or nursery school and were receiving hearing therapy. Teachers' ratings and intelligence and achievement tests were used for evaluation. The group experience facilitated general behavior development, especially language skills. Ss' ability in abstraction was at the level of normal children and was significantly higher than that of children in schools for the deaf. Although Ss took active part in all school activities, their reading ability was 1-1.5 yrs behind that of normal children. Teachers reported difficulty in providing special instruction and attention for these children; it was almost impossible to compensate for the time lost from regular classes while they attended special classes for the hard of hearing.

AB  - This randomized, controlled trial, comparing the Comprehensive Autism Program (CAP) and business as usual programs, studied outcomes for 3-5 year old students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Participants included 84 teachers and 302 students with ASD and their parents. CAP utilized specialized curricula and training components to implement specific evidence-based practices both at school and home. A comprehensive set of outcome areas was studied. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to estimate the treatment impact. CAP had small positive impacts on the students' receptive language (effect size of 0.13) and on their social skills as rated by teachers (effect size of 0.19). Treatment effects were moderated by severity of ASD.

AB  - Examined the number concepts and skills of 81 5-yr-old urban New Zealand children. The majority of Ss entered school with considerable understanding of number concepts and skills. Even the least able Ss knew something about numbers. Teachers were accurate in their judgments about the extent of this knowledge. However, there was a tendency to underestimate the Ss' mathematical knowledge, particularly that of the high scorers. During their 1st yr at school, Ss were taught number concepts that they already knew, but were not taught concepts like addition and subtraction with which they were also familiar. Many of the classroom math activities were not well matched to Ss' current level of math attainment. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The purpose of the study was to explore the effectiveness of a program designed to improve the number skills of 5-year-olds. The program involved the withdrawal of children from the classroom in pairs to work with a specialist teacher using number books and games. Participants were 106 children who represented approximately the lower two-thirds of scores on a measure of numeracy. Twenty-three children participated in the program, and 83 served as contrasts. The program increased the numeracy levels of the children in the program and produced significantly greater gains in numeracy than were evident for the children in the contrast groups. Once the intervention program ceased, the magnitude of these effects gradually diminished over time, but the benefits of participation in the program remained statistically significant for more than a year after the program finished.

AB  - Explored differences in maternal, child, and family factors related to the employment status and employment history of single mothers with low-birth-weight (LBW) and full-term preschoolers. 121 female-headed, single-parent families with 3-, 4-, and 5-yr-old LBW and full-term children were recruited through admission records to 3 Level III neonatal intensive care units and birth records of 2 normal newborn nurseries. Results show that the birth of an LBW infant was not related to employment status, number of hours employed per week, or employment history for single mothers. Employed mothers had significantly more education and more positive attitudes toward employment. Controlling for other factors, never being married, and having more children, more federal income, and less positive employment attitudes were predictive of nonemployment. Both employed and nonemployed women expressed preference for employment. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Father–child facial resemblance is an important cue for men to evaluate paternity. Previous studies found that fathers’ perceptions of low facial resemblance with offspring lead to low confidence of paternity. Fathers’ uncertainty of paternity could cause psychological stress and anxiety, which, after a long time, may further turn into trait anxiety. Conversely, females can ensure a biological connection with offspring because of internal fertilization. The purpose of this study was thus to examine the role of parents’ gender in the effect of parents’ perceived facial resemblance with child on their trait anxiety. In this study, 151 parents (father or mother) from one-child families reported their facial resemblance with child and their trait anxiety. Results showed that (i) males tended to perceive higher facial similarity with child than did females and (ii) males’ perceived facial resemblance with child significantly predicted trait anxiety, whereas females’ perceived facial resemblance did not. These findings suggested that the uncertainty of paternity contributed to the trait anxiety of fathers, but not mothers.

AB  - This study explored the effect of parent–child facial resemblance on the parent–child relationship in a traditional patriarchal cultural context in China. We analyzed 177 elementary and secondary school students in China. This study found that the father's perceived facial resemblance with the child significantly affected his relationship with the child. However, this result was not found among mothers. In addition, from a perspective of offspring, the sons' perceived facial resemblance with the father significantly predicted his relationship with the father, but this did not apply to daughters. Finally, this study found a mediating of father-child closeness on the relationship between perceived father-child facial resemblances and mother-child closeness. These findings enriched the theory of parental investment and extended the current model of the parent–child relationship.

AB  - The Swedish national school curricula for pre-school and for the compulsory school system include an explicit focus on gender issues, connected to aspects such as gender equality and sexuality. The overarching aim is to promote all individuals’ opportunities to express themselves in whatever way they want to, without being hindered by implicit or explicit norms and traditions. My aim with this paper is to discuss how these issues can be incorporated in the teacher education, using a particular course at Södertörn University as my starting point. During this course, the students learn basic facts about how the body works, and the didactics for teaching this to small children. But they also learn about societal and cultural aspects of the body. Parallel to learning for instance about x and y chromosomes they have seminars on gender roles and sexuality, and so on. During the practicum period that is included in the course, the students are to create a lesson where they use a children’s book to talk about different kinds of families, and afterwards reflect upon their experiences in a short written paper. The suggested books are selected based on how they show family constellations that in various ways differ from the nuclear family, but the books also open up for discussions around having two mothers or two fathers, and thus the opportunity to talk about LGBT issues. In my paper I will discuss the experiences students have had when doing this assignment, using the written course papers as the basis for my analysis. The theoretical framework used for analyzing these experiences and examples includes the concepts masculinity, femininity and heteronormativity. The preliminary findings show that the students’ experiences differ considerably from each other, and that the focus on gender and sexuality that is present in the national school curriculum is not uncontroversial among the students or among the supervising teachers out in the schools.The paper is of relevance to Nordic educational research since it raises the issue of how gender and sexuality issues can be incorporated in the teacher education also for teachers for the younger age groups.

AB  - This pilot study examined the relations among preschool teachers' attitudes towards the inclusion of children with autism and perceived self-efficacy, as well as demographic characteristics such as teachers' work experience and educational background. The cohort consisted of 21 participants who had degrees in preschool education and worked with children with autism in general preschool/kindergarten settings in central Sweden. Data were collected using the Autism Attitude Scale for Teachers, the Teacher Efficacy Scale and a demographic survey. In general, findings revealed that preschool teachers held positive attitudes towards children with autism, and this was significantly related to the number of credits in special education taken during pre-service education. However, teachers showed neutral attitudes towards the inclusion of children with autism into general preschool classrooms. No relations were found between teachers' perceived self-efficacy and attitudes towards inclusion, although a relationship was found between participation in in-service training and efficacy to make decisions. Implications concerning early childhood education professional development and supervision are discussed.

AB  - This paper discusses the conceptualization and measurement of Parent Child Care Involvement (PCCI) and questions whether PCCI should be included in high-stakes quality ratings. It presents data on several PCCI measures, including one used by the National Association for the Education of Young Children, the Parent Caregiver Relationship Scale (Elicker et al., 1997) and PCCI items from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and the Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale--Revised (ECERS-R). Across these measures parents uniformly describe child care providers as welcoming and supportive even when other quality measures reveal significant problems. Providers display similar positivity when reporting their own PCCI efforts. A new author-devised measure, Family-Provider Partnership, produces similar positivity bias. Nevertheless, Family-Provider Partnership scores were strongly associated with other measures of child care quality, including the ECERS-R Infant-Toddler Environment Rating Scale (ITERS), ratios and staff credentials. Such relationships justify inclusion of PCCI in child care quality ratings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

AB  - Previous researches have shown that people with higher fluid intelligence are more likely to detect the unexpected stimuli. The current study systematically explored the relationship between fluid intelligence and sustained inattentional blindness in children. In Experiment 1, we measured one hundred and seventy-nine 7-to-14-year-old children’s fluid intelligence and sustained inattentional blindness. The results showed that fluid intelligence was negatively related to sustained inattentional blindness only in 7-to-8-year-old children. In Experiment 2, we explored sustained inattentional blindness in sixty children with high Raven’s scores. We found that compared with children who have average Raven’s scores aged 11-to-12 years old, children with high Raven’s scores were unable to better avoid sustained inattentional blindness. In general, this research implies that the relation between fluid intelligence and sustained inattentional blindness is weak. Fluid intelligence could predict sustained inattentional blindness only when children do not have enough perceptual capacities to complete the primary task.

AB  - The main purpose of the study is to investigate how children act and make meaning in art activities in the Swedish preschool. The study is a contribution to the new social studies of childhood. Children are seen as active participants in the construction and reconstruction of society. Pictures are understood as both culturally and socially produced. They are made in social contexts and earlier pictures are used as raw material.The investigation has an ethnographical approach and two preschools were visited for five weeks each. In all 36 children aged four to six years participated. Data were gathered through participant observations and comprise 37 hours of videotaped art activities, videotaped informal interviews, field notes and documented pictures. Both teacher-guided and unsolicited activities were observed, but in both cases the children's meaning making was in focus.The analyses show that the children use a wide range of pictorial genres. The pictures are produced in dialogue with other pictures: primarily pictures produced by other children, but also the staff's pedagogical illustrations and media pictures. The art activities have different purposes such as exploration of materials, making narrative accounts or producing pictures needed in fantasy play. The production of pictures is connected in several ways to the children's play projects. Girls and boys produce largely different pictures - making pictures could be seen as a way of doing gender.Aesthetic purposes seem to be important to the children. They prefer perfectly shaped forms and use a variety of strategies to accomplish such pictures. The admiration of perfect forms could be understood in relation to children's positions in the society. The social category 'child' is constructed in relation to adults and understood as a deficiency in size, age and abilities. There is a strong positive value connected to growing older and being 'big'. The use of methods that allow one to produce pictures similar to those that older children or adults can produce is one way of appearing as 'big' and competent.One paradox is that the methods used to make pictures attractive in the children's eyes make them less valuable in adults' eyes. Copying or using templates goes against central values that traditionally have dominated art pedagogy, where authenticity is valued and thought of as originating from the individual artist (or child). This contradiction is connected to another contradiction concerning individualism and collectivism. While adults often think of art activities as individual, the children mostly engage in art activities collectively. They sit together with other children when making pictures, they interact with each other during the activities and they produce similar pictures. The children's picture production is part of their peer cultures, and they share and practice what could be understood as their own pictorial cultures.

AB  - Previous literature suggests that early number knowledge is important for the development of arithmetic calculation ability. The domain-general ability of verbal working memory also has an impact on arithmetic ability. This longitudinal study tested the impact of early number knowledge and verbal working memory on the arithmetic calculation ability of children in preschool (N = 315) and then later in Grade 1 using structural equation modeling. Three models were used to test hypotheses drawn from previous literature. The current study demonstrates that both early number knowledge and the domain-general ability of verbal working memory affect preschool and Grade 1 arithmetic ability. Early number knowledge had a direct impact on the growth of arithmetic ability, whereas verbal working memory had only an indirect effect via number knowledge and preschool arithmetic ability. These results fit well with von Aster and Shalevs developmental model of numerical cognition (Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology, 2007, Vol. 49, pp. 868-873) and highlight the importance of considering arithmetic ability as independent from early number knowledge. Results also emphasize the importance of training early number knowledge before school entry to promote the development of arithmetic ability.

AB  - Various hypotheses have been advanced regarding the origin of mathematical learning disabilities (MLD). The present study set out to test a number of hypotheses regarding the underlying condition for the development of MLD, namely: the domain general hypothesis, number sense deficit, numerosity coding deficit, access deficit and multiple deficits. These hypotheses were tested on a sample of eight-year-old children that was divided into three groups: MLD (N = 13), typical achievers (TA, N = 57) and high achievers (HA, N = 25) based on a longitudinal approach of stability in performance on arithmetic tests. The development of the three groups was also assessed using data from preschool to grade two. The results revealed support for the hypothesis of multiple deficits that are primarily located in intraparietal sulci (IPS) and manifest themselves as both number sense deficits and deficits in spatial processing. This type of deficit is supported by less developed general abilities in the domains of both phonological ability and nonverbal intelligence, resulting in poorer number knowledge for those children at risk of MLD. The HA group displayed a superior early number knowledge in combination with superior domain general abilities, which support the development of number knowledge.

AB  - Proposal Information In this paper we discuss the physical interaction between teachers and students in Early Childhood Education from a sociological perspective. Physical interaction between teachers and students is an integral component of teachers’ work in preschools, and numerous psychological and neuro-psychological studies have shown that touch benefits children’s well-being (see e.g. Montagu 1986; Field 2003). Research has however also shown that while most teachers are confident that touch is beneficial for children, fewer of them actually use touch in their professional work. According to the teachers this is in part due to fears of being accused of ‘inappropriate’ touching (Owen and Gillentine 2011; cf. Stamatis 2011). Jones (2001) and King (2004) have shown that male preschool teachers are more likely than female teachers to be suspected of inappropriate touching of children (cf. Berill &amp; Martino 2002; Foster &amp; Newman 2005; Sargent 2005; Gilbert &amp; Williams 2008). But this phenomenon also affects women (Andrzejewski &amp; Davis 2007; Åberg &amp; Hedlin 2012a). In an on-going project we are investigating how norms for gender are established, maintained and challenged through physical interaction between teachers and students in preschools. In this paper we will report preliminary results from the project. The study is inspired by Piper and Stronach’s (2007) concept ‘relational touch’. This concept does not presuppose the meaning of touch in teacher-student interactions. Rather, it opens for a dynamic analysis which search for social, cultural, organizational and material factors impacting on how touch is used and interpreted by teachers in relation to the pedagogical practice. The concept of ‘relational touch’ is in alignment with how we use the concept of gender in the study. The concept of gender deals with how verbal, bodily and material aspects of social relations create a dynamic pattern in gender relations, what Connell has called a gender order (cf. Connell 2009). Thus, we understand touch and gender as norms which are created by and create social, cultural and material practices (Butler 2004). Many European and Western societies have seen an expansion of the means to protect children. This has put focus on teachers’ subjectivities. A safe environment for the child demands a ‘safe’ teacher (cf. Johnson 2001; Jones 2004; McWilliam &amp; Jones 2005). Although it has been claimed that the Scandinavian countries has escaped the negative discourse of the ‘safe teacher’ (cf. Cameron 2001) we have indications that this discourse is impacting also on the supposedly gender equal Utopia of Scandinavia. For example, some preschools have regulated physical interaction by prohibiting children’s nudity, and new legislation has been enacted to prevent sexual offenders to work with children (Åberg &amp; Hedlin 2012). To understand touch in preschools it is important to grasp the globalization of this discourse, and in the paper we will relate the developments in Sweden and Scandinavia to the broader European context. We will explore the impact of external and internal governance, i.e. how media reports and changes in educational policies are connected to teachers’ means of reflexivity and self-governance in relation to touch (cf. Alison 2004). Methodology or Methods/ Research Instruments or Sources Used The reserch questions which we investigate in on ongoing project are the following: A) How has physical interaction between teachers and students been discussed in Swedish newspapers and preschool teachers’ professional journals in the last 30 years? B) How have the local policies of Swedish day care centers and preschools in relation to physical interaction between teachers and students changed over time? C) How do Swedish male and female preschool teachers with varying amounts of work experience reflect on touch as part of their work?We answer questions A) and B) through discourse analysis (Howarth 2000) of some 30 years of publications of nationally distributed newspapers and preschool teachers’ professional journals. For question C) we conduct reflexive interviews (Thomsson 2002) with female and male preschool teachers with varying amounts of work experience. Conclusions, Expected Outcomes or Findings Most of the data for this study will be gathered during the spring of 2013. Therefore we cannot yet say that much about the results of the study. However, results from a previous interview study (Åberg &amp; Hedlin 2012; Hedlin &amp; Åberg 2013) with student teachers currently training to be teachers have relevance for this paper. In that study we discovered three different discursively constructed subject positions which students enacted in relation to the risks of ‘inappropriate touching’. The first was a self-disciplining position which men and women entered who felt anxieties that e.g. parents could use ‘inappropriate touch’ as a rhetorical power tool against teachers they didn’t approve of. A second position was individualistic, where students – both men and women – refused to acknowledge that the teacher’s gender had an impact on teachers’ and students’ physical interaction. The third position was a body-reflexive masculine position, entered by male students who had experienced that they had been limited or refused to perform certain ‘sensitive’ work tasks, due to their male bodies (Åberg &amp; Hedlin 2012). In the present paper, we will further develop this analysis. References Andrzejewski, Carey E. &amp; Davis, Heather A. (2007).

AB  - Objective: Sequelae of academic underachievement, behavioral problems, and poor executive function (EF) have been extensively reported for very preterm (≤33 weeks’ gestation) and/or very low birth weight (VLBW) (≤1500 g) children. Great variability in the published results, however, hinders the field in studying underlying dysfunctions and developing intervention strategies. We conducted a quantitative meta-analysis of studies publishedbetween1998and 2008 on academic achievement, behavioral functioning, and EF with the aim of providing aggregated measures of effect size for these outcome domains. Methods: Suitable for inclusion were 14 studies on academic achievement, 9 studies on behavioral problems, and 12 studies on EF, which compared a total of 4125 very preterm and/or VLBW children with 3197 term-born controls. Combined effect sizes for the 3 outcome domains were calculated in terms of Cohen’s d. Q-test statistics were performed to test homogeneity among the obtained effect sizes. Pearson’s correlation coefficients were calculated to examine the impact of mean birth weight and mean gestational age, as well as the influence of mean age at assessment on the effect sizes for academic achievement, behavioral problems, and EF. Results: Combined effect sizes show that very preterm and/or VLBW children score 0.60 SD lower on mathematics tests, 0.48 SD on reading tests, and 0.76 SD on spelling tests than term-born peers. Of all behavioral problems stacked, attention problems were most pronounced in very preterm and/or VLBW children, with teacher and parent ratings being 0.43 to 0.59 SD higher than for controls, respectively. Combined effect sizes for parent and teacher ratings of internalizing behavior problems were small (<0.28) and for externalizing behavior problems negligible (<0.09) and not significant. Combined effect sizes for EF revealed a decrement of 0.57 SD for verbal fluency, 0.36 SD for working memory, and 0.49 SD for cognitive flexibility in comparison to controls. Mean age at assessment was not correlated with the strength of the effect sizes. Mathematics and reading performance, parent ratings of internalizing problems, teacher ratings of externalizing behavior, and attention problems, showed strong and positive correlations with mean birth weight and mean gestational age (all r values > 0.51). Conclusions: Very preterm and/or VLBW children have moderate-to-severe deficits in academic achievement, attention problems, and internalizing behavioral problems and poor EF, which are adverse outcomes that were strongly correlated to their immaturity at birth. During transition to young adulthood these children continue to lag behind term-born peers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

AB  - The aim of the thesis is to investigate how a number of pedagogical supervisors develope their supervisory competence. In order to meet this objective the following issues were important: What sort of learning takes place among the supervisors? In what ways have different frameworks and conditions been important for guiding the talks? Can the patterns of conversation be discerned during the sessions and how do these patterns reflect their learning and skills?The thesis presents two studies of educational supervisors and tutor based learning which were carried out with about five years delay. The first study was conducted with twenty newly trained supervisors and a second follow-up study was conducted with ten of the same supervisors. The analysis of the empirical material of study 1 shows, among others, in which direction the talks evolve during mentor sessions and to what extent they change character to deepen and lead the supervisors to develop new perspectives and ways of looking at their role. The analysis of the empirical data in study 2 illuminate how each supervisor’s learning progresses by analyzing interviews, conversations and reflections. This study analyzes the supervisors’ levels of reflection, the traditions reflected in the supervisors’ way to lead session conversations, the conversation patterns that emerge and how the supervisors’ learning and supervisor competence developed.

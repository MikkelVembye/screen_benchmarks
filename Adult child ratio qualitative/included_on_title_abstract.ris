AB  - This article is based on a collaborativestudy in Iceland, Sweden and Norway of the youngest children in institutional settings, such as preschools. At the present time, preschool curricula and frameworks are changing to include increased learning. However, preschool teacher education lacks sufficient focus on this age group. New preschool organisations depend both on the increased number of very young children in the system and on new versions of pedagogical approaches. This study is based on the voices of preschool staff who work with very young children. The results showed the dilemmas and challenges that these teachers experience in their everyday work.

AB  - I den här kunskapsöversikten redovisas forskningsläget vad gäller sambandet mellan strukturella faktorer och pedagogisk kvalitet i förskolan och grundskolans första år. De strukturella faktorer som belyses är framförallt barngruppens storlek och sammansättning samt personaltäthet och personalens utbildningsnivå. Även andra strukturella förutsättningar av betydelse för verksamheten belyses, såsom den pedagogiska ledningens utformning och funktion samt förekomst av planering och uppföljning av den pedagogiska verksamheten. I kunskapsöversikten belyses två aspekter på kvalitet, dels hur väl verksamheterna uppfyller de mål som läroplanerna för förskolan och skolan förordnar, dels vilka effekter verksamheten har på lång sikt. Framförallt belyses hur väl barnomsorgen eller skolan tillgodoser barnens behov av utveckling och lärande som personalens behov av en god och tillfredsställande arbetsmiljö.

AB  - Observed 15 girls and 15 boys in 3 daycare centers in an attempt to assess the quality of the daycare centers on the basis of their child–staff ratios. In each center a group of 4 infants (aged 18–42 mo) and a group of 6 older children (aged 43–50 mo) were observed in different contexts in which the child–staff ratios varied from 4–2 to 8–2 and from 6–2 to 12–2. Considerable differences were observed across daycare centers with respect to the modalities used to structure the environment. However, changes in child–staff ratios had no consistent effects on either the Ss' behavior or the tasks of the individual staff members. This indicates that the child–staff ratio, by itself, is not a valid criterion for judging the quality of daycare service. The need for each daycare center to explicitly define quality or service criteria is emphasized. (19 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

Caregivers were interviewed and conditions of caregiving recorded. Caregivers in both settings with fewer children in their care, who worked shorter hours, with less housework responsibilities engaged in more facilitative social stimulation, expressed more positive affect, were more responsive, and less restrictive and negative. Family daycare caregivers who worked in spaces specifically designed to be safe and appropriate for children were less restrictive of toddler activity. Adult–child ratio and caregiver training appeared to be the best indicators of quality care in center daycare, while a safe and appropriate caregiving environment and small groups appeared as quality indicators in family daycare.

AB  - Igennem de seneste årtier er der sket en omfattende udvidelse af antallet af daginstitutionspladser. Denne forskningsoversigt opsamler nationale og internationale forskningsresultater om effekterne af daginstitutionens betydning for børns udvikling. Forskningsoversigten viser, at ændringer af de strukturelle parametre såsom normering, gruppestørrelse, personalets uddannelse osv. har indflydelse på dagpasningens kvalitet og børnenes udvikling. Flere forskere konkluderer, at det er interaktionen mellem børn og voksne, der er det allervigtigste for kvaliteten i daginstitutionerne. Derfor har normeringer og gruppestørrelser betydning. Pædagogisk uddannet personale spiller også en væsentlig rolle for børnenes udvikling. Børnehaver, der brugte legeaktiviteter til at udvikle sociale, følelsesmæssige, kognitive og kreative færdigheder, fik de bedste resultater. På længere sigt viser forskningen også gode resultater. De børn, der har gået i vuggestuer og børnehaver af høj kvalitet, klarer sig bedre i skolen og får bedre uddannelse og job. Færre kommer på overførselsindkomster eller ender i kriminalitet. Forskningen viser også, at det især er sårbare eller socialt udsatte børn, der har størst gavn af de universelle tilbud, som daginstitutioner tilbyder. Denne rapport er udarbejdet med økonomisk støtte fra BUPL, Børne- og Ungdomspædagogernes Landsforbund.

AB  - The benefit the outdoor environment has for young children’s development is widely documented. However, there is less literature outlining practitioners’ experiences of assessing learning in the outdoors and factors which impact the level and quality of assessments undertaken. This study, based on a pragmatic mixed methods approach, undertaken in 9 early years’ settings in North Wales, reports the findings of 37 practitioners. The research suggests that assessing children in the outdoors is not used to its potential. Factors impeding the use of the outdoor classroom include: lack of appropriate resources; level of staff expertise; child-staff ratio; adverse weather; and changes to curriculum policy which place emphasis on the formal assessment of children. There appears to be assumptions about learners most likely to benefit from outdoor learning and assessment: boys; children in socio-economically deprived areas; and children with additional learning needs. The paper highlights the need for broader training opportunities for practitioners on planning for learning and assessment in the outdoors that go beyond a single course focus. With creative planning, there is no reason why summative assessments of all areas of learning within the early years’ curriculum cannot be done as effectively outdoors as they may be being done indoors.

AB  - To investigate the effects of child-caregiver ratio on the quality of caregiver-child interaction in child-care centers, 217 caregivers (ages 18-56 years) from 64 child care centers were observed during two structured play episodes: one with a group of three children and one with a group of 5 children. As predicted, a child-caregiver ratio of 3:1 produced a significantly higher quality of caregiver-child interaction than a ratio of 5:1 and particularly for younger children. Significant and meaningful effects were found for both the interactive behaviors of the caregivers and the children's well-being and cooperation. Significant correlations with caregiver-child interaction during lunchtime and throughout the remainder of the morning confirmed the ecological validity of the caregiver-child interactions observed during structured play episodes.

AB  - This study examined infant educators' beliefs about infant language development in the context of early childhood classrooms. Participants were 59 educators who were employed to work directly with under-two-year-old children. Educators were interviewed to determine their understandings of infant language development and Grounded Theory qualitative techniques were used to develop a conceptual model which illustrates their perceptions of the relationships between contextual, personal and teaching and learning components of their classroom contexts. The model provides a means of conceptualising 'insider' practitioner voices on how, as a dynamic system, contextual, individual and pedagogical components mutually interact to bring about the kinds of experiences and interactions that can shape language development. Findings have implications for understanding educators' perspectives on infant room quality, suggesting that issues related to educator-infant ratios, staff consistency, qualifications and professional knowledge about language development processes may impact efforts to provide intentional language development support.

AB  - Since 1960s, preschools have been important parts both of Swedish welfare and of labour market policies. The preschool thus constitutes a very important site for rearing and educating young children. Reforms of the Swedish preschool in the 1990s concerning both accessibility and quality were introduced at a time when the economy of the municipalities dramatically deteriorated because of reductions in State subsidies. The strained economy of the State and the municipalities, has resulted, among other things, in a growing number of children in preschool groups and pressure to change organization and pedagogical content. These changes took place in a time of decentralization where the responsibility for organization of preschools was given to the municipalities. Changes in economy, organization and curriculum form the background for this study. The purpose of the study is to examine and understand how preschool working teams shape and realize the pedagogical practice and how working conditions affect this process. The approach of the study is interpretative, where the interpretative perspective is mainly represented by activity theory and theories of cultural reproduction. Three aspects of the actions are observed: the object of the actions, the instruments mediating the actions and the content of mediating actions. Bernstein’s concepts classification and framing are used as tools in analysing the empirical data. The interpretative, empirical study is based on qualitative data collected mainly by observations and interviews. Three preschools are chosen for the study. The preschools in the study are located in two municipalities in the north of Sweden, representing three different environments. All preschools receive children one to five years old. The personnel consist of preschool teachers and childminders working in teams. Eleven of them where interviewed. The study shows that daily routines both shape and restrict practices in preschools. The work is mainly focused on care giving, where the children are supposed to adapt to and subordinate themselves to the norms and to the existing routines. The children’s influence varies between organized activities, where they have little influence, and play time, where they can choose what to do. It also varies between the preschools, where the preschool with children from more affluent families have more freedom than children from the multicultural, lower-income environment do. The work is collectively oriented toward training adaptation, but also, to a certain extent, training for autonomy and responsibility taking. Organization of learning activities often takes the form of transmitting information. The informants regard themselves as caregivers with the main purpose to mediate security and create conditions for the children to develop socially. The changes in conditions emanating from political decisions have brought new working tasks to the preschools and have reduced the level of resources at the same time as the demands made are experienced as being harder. This creates frustration and tends to result in lower levels of ambition.

AB  - This study investigates the views of pre-school pedagogues towards child development and learning, especially their thoughts on children’s development and experience of learning language, communication and mathematics. Furthermore, the study also examines what pedagogues think about documenting and analyzing children’s development and learning. Additionally, the investigation reflects the opinions of pre-school pedagogues toward the new assignment to document each child´s development and learning and the activities at the preschool. In this respect, any similarities and differences amongst pedagogues and the pre-schools included in the study have been examined.The study is based on interviews with 20 pre-school workers, comprising nine pre-school teachers and eleven child minders and is spread over six pre-schools. Interview analysis was inspired by phenomenographic methodology in which different categories of description have been created. After categorisation of the empirical data, a comprehensive and in-depth analysis was conducted. The analysis process was carried out with the help of the didactic questions: how, what and why. In the final analysis, contextualisation has been attempted. Perceptions of learning and of documentation were set against institutional conditions at the various pre-schools. The education and professional experiences of the staff working in the different pre-schools was taken into account in addition to the socio-cultural conditions characteristic of the area where the preschools are situated.The results show that there are a number of different aspects that the pedagogues in this study believe affect children's development and learning in pre-school. A dominant opinion amongst the pedagogues is that in order to promote the children’s development and learning, it is important that the children feel a sense of safety, well-being and happiness. Likewise, another crucial aspect which was highlighted is the need for present and committed pedagogues. The expertise of the individual pedagogue is also seen as vital for the creation of good pre-schooling. In this study, pre-schools in areas of low resources have the personnel with the highest levels of education. The activities, mentioned by the pre-school pedagogues in this study, to promote language development, can be described as planned and unplanned. As planned activities, group activities can include, for example, reading aloud to groups of children. Unplanned activities described can be pedagogue’s attitudes and behaviors and daily routine situations in preschool. An additional area of review in this study was that of the pedagogues’ thoughts about documentation. The study shows that the pre-school pedagogues express that they document the children and the work carried out in the pre-schools in different ways due to a variety of reasons. For example, all children are documented unconditionally in some pre-schools but in others, only those children who raise the pedagogues' concerns are documented. The investigation also shows that pre-schools based in the areas with fewer resources display the most structured documentation. However, the task of documenting is interpreted differently by the pedagogues, and such differences create anxiety and uncertainty as to how, what and why documentation in pre-school should be carried out.<h1> </h1>

AB  - 42 female child caregivers participated 1 of 6 focus groups to examine how, when, and why they discipline young children. Aggressive behavior, not listening, and sexually-related behaviors were the most likely behaviors to concern caregivers. These behaviors most frequently elicited the disciplinary strategies of time-out, explanations, and redirection. How caregivers respond to misbehaviors was analyzed in terms of the attributions the caregivers make in regard to these misbehaviors. Age, gender, home, family, society, caregiver emotion, and child care setting circumstances were the most frequently mentioned factors to affect caregiver discipline. Results also indicate that caregivers with higher levels of early childhood education and experience, and those working with smaller group and adult-to-child ratios provide more thoughtful answers that are more congruent with developmental appropriateness.

AB  - Examined associations between 3 types of program quality indicators (structural, global, and dynamic/process) and children's play behavior. 14 children with disabilities and 14 without disabilities (aged 33–73 mo) were observed during free play periods in integrated early childhood programs. Teachers' interactions with both groups of children were similar, and the children's play differed only in level of societal play. Teachers were more involved in supporting children's play in classrooms with better teacher–child ratios and when a greater proportion of them had specialized training in early childhood education. Teachers' interactions with children were not related to children's cognitive play level but were related to their social play level. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Rapid development of sustained attention occurs during infancy and toddlerhood, as neurological maturation allows children to increasingly attend to objects and events in the environment (Ruff & Rothbart, 1996). Play experiences during this period can serve as a context during which children's ability to attend can provide an opportunity for learning and development. There is, however limited empirical evidence for how independent play and play guided by an adult may be differentially associated with children's sustained attention. The current study investigates how sustained attention among infants and toddlers differs during play activities guided by a teacher versus activities children engage on their own in the setting of a child care classroom. The investigation was guided by two research questions: (1) To what extent are guided play activities that teachers and children engage in together associated with greater levels of children's sustained attention compared to independent play activities in which children explore activities on their own; and (2) To what extent are there differences by children's age in the association between the type of activity and children's attention? The current study contributes to the understanding of how guide play and independent play activities are associated with sustained attention among infants and toddlers in a child care setting. While children can benefit from independent exploration, they may also benefit from engaging in one-on-one activities with a teacher, a possibility that may be most feasible in settings with low adult-child ratios. Tables and figures are appended.

Forskningsopsamlingen koncentrerer sig om effekterne af dagpasningstilbud målrettet de 0-5-årige. Undersøgelser af dagpasningens betydning for børn viser, at kvaliteten kan være så dårlig at pasningen forstærker den sociale arv. Omvendt kan en høj kvalitet fremme udvikling af kompetencer hos børnene, der kan give børnene et løft i skolen. I vurderingen af dagpasningens kvalitet indgår oplysninger om normeringer, gruppestørrelse, personaleudskiftning, fysiske omgivelser samt mere bløde mål som omsorgskulturen og personalets kvalifikationer.

Cross tabulations were used to explore relationships between child behaviors and language use, type of activity, group size, and adult role. Results show that Ss spent most of their day in small or large groups with 1 adult either observing or directing an activity. Usually Ss were positively involved in tasks and engaged in far more receptive than expressive language. Activity, group size, and teacher role influenced the types and frequencies of the behaviors observed. (9 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This research study examined the challenges faced by early childhood education (ECE) in rural China based on a qualitative study of 217 kindergarten classrooms in a large agricultural, rural province. This study utilised onsite teacher surveys, interviews, and observational field notes. This investigation's findings revealed important information in regard to (a) enrollment, class size, and student--teacher ratios; (b) facilities, basic furnishings, and materials; (c) teacher qualifications; and (d) curriculum and pedagogy. Kindergartens in the rural province of Hebei, typical of Chinese provinces with economically disadvantaged students and inadequate ECE funding, were found to be of poor quality across every ECE indicator measured. For the future improvement and well-being of children and their families in rural China, the authors recommend reform policy to increase ECE quality by affiliating quality kindergartens with existing elementary public school structures and to improve teacher quality by advancing teacher benefits, professional status, and professional development opportunities.

AB  - Research Findings: With a substantial number of young children receiving care in family child care settings, an examination of the characteristics, both structural and attitudinal, that predict program quality is warranted. The current study examines gaps in the research by examining both structural characteristics and provider beliefs that influence observed global quality in family child care homes. Results of this study suggest that belief characteristics can predict the quality of family child care homes above and beyond structural characteristics alone. Practice or Policy: Providing support to help all providers understand appropriate developmental expectations for children and how to effectively guide children is critical for quality improvement efforts. In addition, providing support to decrease job stress and improve professional motivation is highlighted. (Contains 3 tables.)

AB  - This research was carried out during a study which focused upon the rough and tumble play of children in the early years department of a suburban primary school in northern England. The child sample's playtime activities were ethnographically observed over a period of 18 calendar months, during which time interviews were also carried out with the children's class teachers and several other adults taking part in the children's daily school routines. It was found that the narratives created by a cohort of four-and-a-half- to six-and-a-half-year-old boys around their football (soccer) play were socially and symbolically complex, providing evidence that such play is a highly valuable developmental activity. However, the interview data indicated that owing principally to very low adult:child ratios in playground supervision, the focus of the adults was strongly directed towards negative aspects of outdoor free play.

AB  - Children have the right to fulfill and expand on all their potentials and desires to learn. In 2010, the Ontario Ministry of Education introduced Full-Day Kindergarten (FDK) in Ontario and aimed at providing quality Kindergarten programs for children. FDK is expected to be implemented in all Ontario public schools by 2015/16. The literature and research (McCain, M.N. & Mustard, J.F., 1999; McCain et al., 2007; McCain et al., 2011) on early years education affirms that children benefit from quality early years educational programs as they are important in developing neurons in the brain before the age of six. This qualitative study focuses on understanding early years educational philosophies, and examining teachers' perspectives on FDK teaching and learning practices. The case studies are informed by the narratives of eight Kindergarten teachers through data collected from interviews, observations, classroom visits, and artifacts. The most significant findings of the study are that quality FDK teaching and learning practices are based on the following features: (a) learning through play-based, inquiry-based and experiential-based exploration; (b) making the educational experiences child-centred and authentic; (c) building on children's past experiences, nurturing self-expression and identity; (d) strengthening relationships and connections; and (e) creating stimulating environments, both indoor and outdoor, for children's learning and development. Teachers' perspectives and specific practices are described, analyzed, and discussed. Theory informed practice and practice informed theory, as models were developed and designed during this research journey. The theoretical framework served as a lens and was instrumental in examining FDK practices in each case study. The Integrated Child Development Model was created, later modified, and named the Early Years Education Model (EYE Model). The EYE Model, focused on integrated and comprehensive child development, identified important aspects of quality FDK and named developmental domains. The model served as a tool and conceptual framework in evaluating and analyzing classroom practice. Research implications that resulted from this study included improving class size and providing more teacher training. Greater opportunities for quality and varied play experiences were identified as being essential moving forward. The Kindergarten years lay a strong foundation for success in future schooling, and looking closely at teaching and learning practices in the classroom brings awareness to best practices.

AB  - This dissertation provides a case study of the daily experiences of children and teachers in a nonprofit day care center. Located in a middle class suburb of a midwestern metropolitan area, the center serves 54 three- and four-year-olds of varied economic and racial background (20% of the children are black; family incomes range from below $8,000 to $40,000 per annum). Focusing on the orientation of four day care teachers toward children's individual and social experiences, the discussion gives specific attention to teachers' arrangement of environments, teachers' interactions with each other, and children's actions that teachers allow or encourage. It is argued that day care centers in their daily operations actually emphasize individual more than social or collectivist values and experiences. Chapter One describes the conceptualization of the research problem, the origin of the study, and the rationale for implementing the study. Chapters Two, Three, and Four depict at a micro-level how four day care teachers' actions tend to emphasize individual experiences more than social experiences. Chapter Five examines the broader structural context of this field study in order to reflect on how the research findings relate to America's tradition of individualism. Chapter Six concludes by focusing on implications for day care practice that might help promote a balance between individual and social learning for young children. Related materials are appended.

Focusing on the orientation of four day care teachers toward children's individual and social experiences, the discussion gives specific attention to teachers' arrangement of environments, teachers' interactions with each other, and children's actions that teachers allow or encourage. It is argued that day care centers in their daily operations actually emphasize individual more than social or collectivist values and experiences. Chapter One describes the conceptualization of the research problem, the origin of the study, and the rationale for implementing the study. Chapters Two, Three, and Four depict at a micro-level how four day care teachers' actions tend to emphasize individual experiences more than social experiences. Chapter Five examines the broader structural context of this field study in order to reflect on how the research findings relate to America's tradition of individualism. Chapter Six concludes by focusing on implications for day care practice that might help promote a balance between individual and social learning for young children. Related materials are appended.

AB  - The majority of children (84 %) in Sweden enter preschool between the age of 1 and 2 years. A growing number of them communicate in more than one language. These multilingual children are learning two or more languages from an early age in different contexts: one or two languages in the family and Swedish in preschool. Preschool is also the primary environment for communication and learning of Swedish for the 2-year-olds (17 %) who have a first language other than Swedish (Skolverket. Barn, elever och personal—riksnivå 2011 (Rapport nr. 357). Retrieved from http://​www.​skolverket.​se, 2011). The national curriculum for preschool articulates both learning and children’s perspectives as important. This study contributes to an understanding of infants’ and toddlers’ experiences within the lived spaces of the education and care setting by illustrating how the preschool environment can be an arena for language learning. It shows how the organisation and structure of preschool activities, possibilities for participating in activities by using different communicative resources, and play with other children who share the same first language can be understood.

AB  - This study deals with preschool staff's different ways of coping with the extensive financial cutbacks and restructuring of the preschool system that have taken place during the 90's. The overall aim is to increase the understanding of the various ways in which staff members master their daily work. The study emphasizes the actor perspective, practice based knowledge and teachers as reflecting practitioners who more or less intuitively manage a complex reality. The focus is on collegial reflection. The variation in preschool staff's collegial reflection is illustrated in the terminology of Schön (1983).The research approach is described as ethnographically inspired fieldwork. Participant observation, group interviews, individual interviews and document analysis were carried out in three different preschools during a long period of time. Most of the data was gathered through participant observation of formal and informal meetings. Schön's concepts naming, framing, reframing and problem solving were used in structuring and analyzing the data.The study shows that the problematic situations the staff had to deal with could often be described as "messes" or dilemmas. Recurring problem areas were: Concern over pedagogical quality in general, individual children and their parents, and concern related to parental co-operation and staff members working situation. The staff employed three main kinds of problem solving strategies: Adjustment strategies, resistance or fighting strategies and escape strategies. Adjustment strategies without reframing dominated.Different ways of interpreting the results are discussed in terms of context, rationality and a tension between central "wishes" and local reality. A reason for the lack of reframing can be found in deficient knowledge of necessary prerequisites for collegial reflection and possibilities to create these prerequisites.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to discuss young children's depicting of their preschool settings and what those can tell us. What if children get access to digital cameras as documenting tools? Would that alter our understanding of children's everyday life? How can we interpret the practice of looking when the visual perspective of children meets the visual perspective of adults? In the Swedish preschool it is common for the adults to document the learning process of children. Their documentation represents the adult eyes on the everyday life and learning process of children, the children are rarely able to return the adult gaze.The study presented in this paper is a study in progress and it is conducted as an ethnographic study in a number of different preschool settings. The focus is two folded, on one hand what do the children depict, and on the other hand what sort of intra-activity can be seen between the children, the camera and the room in the preschool setting? How can the result of this study tell us something about children´s perspective? Is it possible that visual methods and gaze perspective of small children can show us something in-between the known and the unknown of everyday life in preschool?

AB  - To investigate the current status of group time in early childhood centers, a small-scale exploratory study was designed and executed. Results of interviews with 35 teachers and observations in five classrooms serving children ages 2 1/2 through kindergarten revealed that all classrooms had at least one group time or circle time, usually in the morning. Of 14 broad categories of resources noted by teachers, books and stories, and music and songs were most frequently mentioned; poetry, nursery rhymes, and relaxation activities were least frequently mentioned. Teachers' written plans and observations revealed the actual use of a much narrower range of activities. Immediate concerns, such as "themes" and children's interests and needs, were primary determinants of what teachers did. Detailed written plans were seldom made. Teachers reported that their major problems involved disturbances of group time by students and balancing the needs of the individual child with those of the group. Teachers ascribed such problems to factors beyond their control; these included children's developmental level, home backgound, and group size. Observation revealed much inattention during group time, with teachers using relatively few techniques for monitoring, maintaining, and guiding children's attention and behavior. Implications for teacher educators, administrators, and teachers are discussed. Teachers are urged to take an active classroom leadership role by: (1) planning more systematically; (2) using group time to introduce new ideas and skills and develop positive attitudes and behavior; (3) expand their repertoire of materials and activities; (4) enlarge their techniques of monitoring and guiding behavior; and (5) coaching other adults in the classroom how to behave during group time. Measures used are appended. (Author/RH) To investigate the current status of group time in early childhood centers, a small-scale exploratory study was designed and executed.

AB  - The aim of this thesis is to study the interaction that occurs among one- and two-year-olds in preschool. Today there are many toddlers in Swedish preschools but few Swedish studies of the interaction among children of this preschool age. Existing research on the interaction of toddlers, children’s culture and child-child socialization has been used as background. A qualitative method has been used to describe the content and form of the interaction. Data has been gathered using video observations from five toddler units on twelve occasions. The interaction sequences have been analysed as to content, expression of emotion, duration, age-related factors, gender and the number of children involved.The interaction mood, joy and conflict have been noted. The interaction process in the long sequences has been particularly described and analysed. The results show that interaction often begins around an active child. The animated behavior of a peer is discussed as social affordance for other children. The interaction mood is most often supportive and interest is the most predominant emotion. In the interaction sequences, joy is mostly expressed in connection with big body movements. The children also express joy when something turns out unexpected, rowdy or surprising. Conflicts are brief and relatively few. The interaction process in the long sequences is characterized by creativity, common understanding and positive affects. The mutual creating and understanding that characterizes some of the interaction sequences allow for these to be considered expressions of children’s culture. The interaction where children imitate, adapt and coordinate themselves to each other can furthermore be considered peer socialization. In common activities when practicing interaction norms they learn about what counts in peer interaction. Experiences of a supportive or rejecting interaction mood is also regarded as crucial for the child’s self image in the role as peer.

AB  - This study examined the relationship between pre-primary educational policy and actual practice in Tanzania. Policy relevant to pre-primary education was analyzed and 15 pre-primary lessons from two urban and two rural schools were videotaped. Although the national educational policy specifies the same standards for pre-primary education regardless of location, there were considerable differences across schools. Compared to urban classes, rural ones had considerably less space, larger group sizes, less favorable teacher/pupil ratios, fewer instructional resources and less qualified teachers. Teacher professional qualifications appeared to influence the quality of classroom interaction more than the physical setting and resources. (Contains 3 figures and 2 tables.)

AB  - Many young children spend a significant amount of time each day in preschool settings. It is important to understand how teachers create and maximize opportunities for children’s social and emotional learning (SEL) in the classrooms. This research was conducted in Singapore and explores how SEL is supported by teachers in areas identified in the national curriculum (self-awareness and positive self-concept, self-management, social awareness, relationship management, and responsible decision-making). The qualitative analyses draw on observations across six preschool classrooms. There were 32 instances identified in which teachers provided support for SEL across three aspects of interactional situations: group size, type of activity, and type of teaching opportunity. More opportunities for SEL were afforded in small group versus whole group activities and more often in outdoor play and planned lesson times than when children were in learning centers, at mealtimes, or making transitions between activities. Intentional teaching also afforded more opportunities for SEL as compared to incidental teaching. Teachers adopted a variety of verbal and non-verbal strategies to support SEL that included setting a positive tone, suggesting solutions, allocating tasks, and extending on responses. This research provides knowledge about how, and in what interactional situations, teachers demonstrate SEL support to individuals and groups of children in kindergarten classrooms.

AB  - Denne forskningsoversigt er bestilt af BUPL. Den giver et overblik over de nyeste danske og internationale forskningsresultater på dagpasningsområdet og perspektiverer til tidligere resultater på området. Forskningsoversigten følger således op på SFI’s tidligere udgivelse: Effekter af dagpasning – en redegørelse for nationale og internationale forskningsresultater fra 2002. Rapporten belyser, hvordan kvalitetsforskelle i dagpasningstilbud kan påvirke børns kognitive, emotionelle og sociale udvikling. Rapporten redegør blandt andet for, at pasning af høj kvalitet – målt ved gode normeringer, relevant uddannet personale, ordentlige plads- og hygiejneforhold, stimulerende aktiviteter og en god kontakt mellem institution og hjem – gavner børn kognitivt, socialt, helbreds- og følelsesmæssigt både på kort og lang sigt. De bliver blandt andet mere intelligente, selvsikre og nysgerrige i forhold til at lære og dermed mere skoleparate og dygtige i skolen. Der er i særdeleshed dokumentation for, at børn fra belastede familier klarer sig bedre, hvis deres pasning har været af høj kvalitet. De bliver fx mindre kriminelle, får en højere uddannelse, får højere indtjening og har et bedre helbred. Der er altså store samfundsøkonomiske gevinster ved at investere i børnepasning af høj kvalitet.

School 1 had a child-teacher ratio of 3.5:1; School 2 had a ratio of 7:1. Findings indicate that inthe setting with more adults present per child, Ss interacted significantly more with adults and less with peers. Different factors for interaction were found for the schools, but patterns were similar over both settings with Ss high in adult interaction tending not to interact with peers and, conversely, Ss low in adult interaction tending to interact more with peers. Observations showed the groups to be similar in overall frequency of dependency; however, Ss in the high-adult setting made proportionally more adult-directed dependency bids. Frequencies of social behaviors were compared with previous results. Principal findings for frequencies of social interaction, dependency, and patterns of interaction are attributed to the effect of the child-teacher ratio.

Variations in observed patterns of activities and social interactions could not be explained only by referring to variations in child/staff ratio. More adults per child increased child-oriented activities and close interaction with the children only if the staff agreed on goals and methods in their work. Results agree with the view that the roles of, activities of, and relationships between teachers, children, and parents are influenced by the manner in which each person defines and experiences the ratio of adults to children in the day-care center.

AB  - Föreliggande delstudie redovisar forskning som behandlar relationer mellan förskolepersonal och barn i förskolan. I delstudien kartläggs och analyseras forskning om relationers betydelse för barns lärande och utveckling. Syftet med denna forskningsöversikt är att få ny kunskap om relationers betydelse i förskolan och de villkor som påverkar dem. Särskild uppmärksamhet riktas mot de studier som a) belyser betydelsen av pedagogiska relationer för barns utveckling och lärande b) anlägger ett teoretiskt perspektiv för att förklara och förstå relationens kvalitet c) som formulerar vilka villkor som är viktiga för att utveckla de pedagogiska relationerna och förskolans kvalitet. Ambitionen är att utifrån en analys av dessa kunna formulera strategier för en utveckling av de pedagogiska relationerna i svensk förskola. Följande forskningsfrågor ska besvaras:  Vad säger forskningen om relationens betydelse för barns lärande och utveckling?  Vilka teoretiska perspektiv och begrepp används för att förstå relationen mellan förskolepersonal och barn?  Vad säger forskningen om villkoren för relationens kvalitet? Tidigt har forskningen konstaterat att nära kontakter mellan vuxna och barn i förskoleverksamhet har positivt samband med barnens självständighet, positiva uppfattningar om skola och hur de lyckas i skolämnen och att goda relationer mellan barn och förskolepersonal leder till färre beteende- och lärandeproblem senare i skolan. Denna forskningsöversikt bekräftar i stort dessa slutsatser. En hög processkvalitet - de pedagogiska relationerna mellan förskolans personal och barn - har stor betydelse för barns lärande och socio-emotionella utveckling, på kort och på lång sikt. Med de pedagogiska relationerna som kvalitetens brännpunkt ses strukturer (barngruppernas storlek, personaltäthet mm) som stödjande eller hindrande för förskolans och de pedagogiska relationernas kvalitet. Flera av de här refererade studierna poängterar att en förskola och pedagogiska relationer av hög kvalitet innebär en sammanflätning av omsorg och undervisning, oftast betecknat som Edu-Care i den internationella diskursen. Den övergripande frågan om varför de pedagogiska relationerna mellan förskolepersonal och barn har betydelse för barnets lärande och utveckling på kort och lång sikt har besvarats teoretiskt på olika sätt i de forskningsstudier som refererats här. Ett multiteoretiskt närmande beskrivs i forskningsöversikten för att förstå och förklara de kortsiktiga och långsiktiga effekterna. En teoretisk utgångspunkt inom den tillämpade utvecklingspsykologin är att barn som kan reglera sina impulser och öka sin uppmärksamhet har större möjligheter att lära. Självreglering och Self-efficacy är analytiska begrepp som används för att förstå betydelsen av dessa förmågor. Forskare som använder ett socio-kulturellt perspektiv på lärande menar att lärande är en betydelsefull aspekt av alla sociala praktiker. Lärande, tänkande och vetande är relationer mellan människor genom deras interaktiva aktivitet. Lärande blir då någonting som man gör i relation till varandra. Begreppen ”expansivt lärande” och ”delat hållbart tänkande” används för att analysera lärande som en pedagogisk process i dialog. Forskare poängterar också att barns utveckling får ses i relation till alla de miljöer som barn vistas i och de olika erfarenheter som barn får i olika miljöer. Begreppet Social ekologi, med inspiration från Bronfenbrenners ekologiska modell, tar just barns vardagserfarenheter som utgångspunkt för att förstå hur barns olika miljöer samvarierar och påverkar varandra. De kanske viktigaste villkoren för en hög kvalitet i de pedagogiska relationerna berör förskolepersonalens formella utbildning och möjlighet till kvalificerad fortbildning och kompetensutveckling. Forskningslitteraturen pekar på att förskolepersonalens kunskaper, pedagogiska medvetenhet, engagemang och förståelse av sitt uppdrag är relaterat till deras utbildning och möjlighet till kompetensutveckling. Andra villkor som forskningen indikerar som betydelsefulla för de pedagogiska relationerna är: organiseringen av barnens vardag, jämvikten mellan vuxenstyrda och barninitierade aktiviteter i förskolan samt barns och föräldrars inflytande. Sammanfattningsvis indikerar forskningen att strukturella faktorer som personaltäthet och barngrupper har störst betydelse för de yngsta barnen och för de utsatta barnen men att det måste sättas samman med andra parametrar. Slutsatsen blir att strukturella kvalitetsfaktorer kan ses som stödjande eller hindrande för utvecklingen av de pedagogiska relationerna. Slutligen sammanfattas forskningsöversikten i ett antal teser som konkluderar att förskolan har behov av att utveckla ett eget undervisningsbegrepp och att pedagogiska relationer innebär en sammanflätning av omsorg och undervisning.

AB  - This book describes the results of film study of every day events in day care. It focuses on teacher and child behavior as they interact at meals, naps, and play, and proposes that minute examination of what actually happens to children in specific situations is necessary to identify the kinds of positive behaviors caregivers want to build on, as well as to help them identify the negative behaviors they need to avoid in children's day care experience. Following a brief introduction to changing demand for group child care, chapter 1 provides a rationale for the use of film in this exploration and outlines the chapters in the book. Chapter 2 then lays out the background and structure of the day care environment, covering topics such as space, curriculum, time, and routines. Chapter 3 discusses the abilities of young children to control themselves, learning through rhythm, repetition, and imitation. Chapters 4 and 5 deal with the ways in which communication is learned in the early years, discussing topics such as hair pulling, biting, and crying. The sixth chapter examines the variety of adult values that are transmitted by interactions between teachers and children in day care by comparing a suburban center and an urban center. Chapter 7 provides an infant-toddler teacher's perspective with a description of the teacher's understanding of what constitutes good care and her feelings about her work. Chapter 8 is a general discussion of how children learn, and covers cognitive, social, and emotional learning. Contains 32 references.

AB  - In this study, qualitative analysis of focused interviews with 24 nursery teachers indicates that many of the teachers faced a number of dilemmas in implementing a nursery curriculum, and in relating theory to practice. A curriculum placing heavy emphasis on sound relationships is evident at every level of nursery life. Teachers make both long- and short-term plans within the nursery while at the same time seeking to extend children's interests in a variety of ways. They also strive to observe and record children's development and progress as effectively as possible. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In Sweden, preschool has been noted as being of a high quality compared to many other countries. However, dramatic changes in the preschool sector are taking place. A recent law states that it is a child's right to get a preschool place within a few months. As a consequence, the number of children in preschool has increased, which could influence group sizes since there is no state regulation of the number of children in a group. This article based on the project "The impact of group size on children's affordances in preschool" aims to describe and analyse preschool teachers' ideas of what an ideal preschool group is. It is a qualitative study based on a questionnaire with mainly open-ended questions, answered by preschool teachers. The results show that preschool teachers define a well-functioning group as having a balance between gender, age and ethnicity. The preschool teachers stress that they prefer a group with fewer children than they have today. A key aspect of having a well-functioning group is also the preschool teachers' competence and the preschool environment. Preschool teachers' ideas of what constitute an ideal group of children may contribute to why they perceive the group size too large.

AB  - This paper on day care services presents: (1) an examination of aspects of home care for children which characterize it as a behavior setting independent of the mother-child bond; (2) a comparison of these home aspects with several common types of day care; and (3) an evaluation of current day care types based on similarities to a good home. Research methodology is not included, but subjects chosen for observation included 14 children in 14 family day care homes, 84 children attending 14 group care centers, and 14 children who attended nursery school part-time and were cared for individually in 14 private homes and also attended nursery school part-time. Differences among types of day care are discussed. Other topics include: (1) child-initiated and teacher-initiated activities, (2) adult-child ratio during activities, (3) number and kinds of people in the setting, (4) kinds of adult input and (5) the physical setting. A final section discusses the logic of behavior settings and the home as a workable model for day care.

AB  - The aim is to deepen the understanding of how nurturing is performed in preschools with a specific focus on teachers' verbal utterances in preschool practice. Swedish preschool teachers are tasked by the National Agency for Education (2016) to ''provide children with good pedagogical activities, where care, nurturing and learning together form a coherent whole'' (p. 4) which is commonly referred to as Educare. However, in my research, preschool teachers do not talk about their practice as nurturing, instead parents are said to be responsible for nurturing the children. At the same time, when preschool teachers' everyday practice is observed, they do practice what appear as a nurturing of the children (Dolk, 2013; Emilsson, 2008). How can their practice, that seem to function as nurturing but, still, is not acknowledged as such, be understood? The research's overall theoretical perspective is based on Foucault's theories of power (Foucault, 2003). Important concepts are discipline and normalisation, which is conceptualises as guidance. To explore this matter, 37.5 h video observations were thematically analysed with a critical approach. This study was approved by Swedish Ethics Committee for Research. All participants have given verbal (children) or written (children's parents and preschool teachers) consent. All participants are anonymised. The result reveal two ways of guiding children, direct guidance and indirect guidance. The result also shows that power, discipline and normalisation are common elements in everyday preschools practice. This research has implication for preschool practice and contribute for a better understanding regarding reproduction of norms in preschools practice.

AB  - This study examined kindergarten teachers' perceptions of the impact of changes in group-size policy on 3- and 4-year-old children in New Zealand's Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association. Data were collected through a series of interviews of Wellington kindergarten teachers from 54 kindergartens and focused mainly on the perceived effects of changing group size with regard to parent-teacher relationships, staff and child turnover, and adult-child ratios. The findings show that the changed policy had had a direct impact on children, programmers, teachers, and families. The major issues presented by the teachers are as follows: (1) they had less time to work with individual children and small groups; (2) even though the adult-child ratio remained constant at 1:15, the larger group size had a marked impact on the type of activities teachers were able to offer; (3) teachers were being forced toward a supervisory role; (4) increased roll numbers had an adverse, diluting effect on teachers' relationships with parents; (5) in some kindergartens children were being admitted at a younger age, which placed extra demands on teachers; and (6) there had been little training or support for teachers to cope with the consequences of the new policy. (Two appendices include the kindergarten group size project questionnaire and the interview schedule. Contains 44 references.)

AB  - Compared the frequencies of peer and adult social interactions, the mean durations of social interactions, and the amounts of negative behaviors of 3-, 4-, and 5-yr-old children of both sexes (N = 131) in a Montessori nursery school, a university laboratory preschool, and a parent cooperative nursery school. The total amount of social interaction, the amount of peer interaction, and the duration of the average social interaction increased with age. The Montessori Ss differed from the Ss in the other 2 schools in amount of peer interaction and in duration of the average interaction in the same direction as older Ss differed from younger Ss. This finding suggests that teacher ratio and age distribution factors enhance the development of social interaction skills in Montessori nursery school children. (18 ref.)

AB  - Manipulated numbers of children in 27 preschools to produce a low child–staff ratio (7.7:1), an average ratio (9.2:1), and a high ratio (11.2:1). Observations were carried out so that only 1 person (child or staff) was observed at any given time. Results showed a greater effect of ratio on individual child behavior than on individual staff behavior. Children annoyed and teased others more and were less absorbed in what they were doing under higher ratios. When the behavior of the whole group was considered, it was evident that (1) staff were confronted with a substantial increase in problematic child behaviors as the ratio went up (even by 2:1) and (2) the child's access to staff on an individual or tiny group basis was considerably reduced with the high ratios.

AB  - Background: There is a limited amount of research about group size in preschool, and how it impacts on teachers’ working conditions and their ability to support children’s learning and knowledge development in line with curriculum intentions. Purpose: From a perspective on quality, this article examines the organisational conditions for children’s learning in preschool in relation to group size. The questions at issue are: how do teachers explain how they organise the child group and the learning environment in preschool, and why? Sample: The sample consists of 12 preschools from different parts of Sweden. The preschools selected for the study are stratified in order to represent small and large group sizes in Swedish preschools as defined by the Swedish National Agency for Education. The sample contains both urban and rural regions and represents districts that differ geographically, demographically, ethnically, and which include varied socioeconomic structures. The 12 preschools had children in three age groupings: 1–3, 3–5 or 1–5. The number of children in the participating preschools ranged from 12 children to 45 children, with seven of the preschools having more than 30 children in their groups. Design and method: The article is based on interactionist perspectives, Bronfenbrenner’s ecological systems theory, a critical ecology of the early childhood profession, theories of children’s learning, and four dimensions of pedagogical quality. Together, these theoretical perspectives contribute to an understanding of the relationships between policy issues, educational goals, group size and teachers’ competence in organising and creating conditions for children’s learning. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with two teachers from each of the 12 preschools. The interviews lasted between 40–60 minutes and were recorded and transcribed verbatim. The analytical process was conducted in three steps and can be described as an analytical process of abduction. The four dimensions of pedagogical quality were used as analytical lenses to discern and understand critical aspects related to the teachers’ understanding of group size. Result:Irrespective of group size, most of the children participate in different group constellations throughout the day, some organised by the teachers and some by the children themselves. Teachers’ competence to organise the children in such ways that good conditions for learning were created, differed between preschools, and depended on the teachers’ approach, which can be described as either intentional or unintentional learning. Conclusion:Teachers’ organisational approaches influence the quality of the preschool and conditions for children’s learning in distinct ways.

Background: There is a limited amount of research about group size in preschool, and how it impacts on teachers’ working conditions and their ability to support children’s learning and knowledge development in line with curriculum intentions. Purpose: From a perspective on quality, this article examines the organisational conditions for children’s learning in preschool in relation to group size. The questions at issue are: how do teachers explain how they organise the child group and the learning environment in preschool, and why? Sample: The sample consists of 12 preschools from different parts of Sweden. The preschools selected for the study are stratified in order to represent small and large group sizes in Swedish preschools as defined by the Swedish National Agency for Education. The sample contains both urban and rural regions and represents districts that differ geographically, demographically, ethnically, and which include varied socioeconomic structures. The 12 preschools had children in three age groupings: 1–3, 3–5 or 1–5. The number of children in the participating preschools ranged from 12 children to 45 children, with seven of the preschools having more than 30 children in their groups. Design and method: The article is based on interactionist perspectives, Bronfenbrenner’s ecological systems theory, a critical ecology of the early childhood profession, theories of children’s learning, and four dimensions of pedagogical quality. Together, these theoretical perspectives contribute to an understanding of the relationships between policy issues, educational goals, group size and teachers’ competence in organising and creating conditions for children’s learning.

AB  - Frågan om vad som är en lämplig storlek för barngrupper i förskolan är komplex och behöver ses i ett socialt och kulturellt sammanhang. Forskningen visar att några avgörande faktorer att ta hänsyn till är personalens kompetens, personaltäthet, barngruppens sammansättning och den fysiska miljön.

AB  - This qualitative case study explored how an infant teacher provided meaningful learning experiences for infants through play and the teacher’s educational rationale behind these experiences. Findings were based on multiple sources of data, including classroom observations (natural observation and videotaped observation) for approximately 12 weeks and a teacher interview. The findings confirmed that infant play is critical for infant learning and development and portrayed the process through which the infant teacher created play spaces for infants and supported infants’ play through both pre-planned, teacher-directed, intentional activities, and child-initiated, emerging play activities. Our study highlighted that the designing of infant play and the learning process needs to be flexible and based on careful observation and reflection in order to meet the rapidly changing needs and interests of a group of infants as well as individual infants.

AB  - The current study examined the effect of a friend’s presence on toddlers’ behavior in high child-to-staff-ratio daycare settings. Toddlers (N = 38) were video-observed in the presence or absence of a verified friend in two situations that burden staff: morning separation and lunchtime (overall, 152 video observations). Higher levels of positive social engagement, fewer agonistic behaviors toward peers, and fewer occurrences of distress were observed in the friend’s presence. The duration of morning separations decreased by half and toddlers contacted the caregiver less during separations and exhibited more prosocial behaviors. Overall, toddlers demonstrated greater empathic concern when their friend was present. During lunchtime, they also displayed greater concern toward peers other than their friend. Friendship, even at a very young age, can constitute a meaningful emotional resource for soothing and security.

AB  - Investigated how the introduction of a 3rd teacher influences the quality and quantity of staff/child interactions in kindergarten classrooms. It was predicted that addition of a 3rd teacher would increase the amount of interaction between children and teachers, increase positive interactive play between peers, and reduce negative interactive play between peers. Ss were 35 kindergartners (aged 3 yrs 2 mo to 4 yrs 5 mo) and 13 teachers from 8 kindergartens (4 that had introduced a 3rd teacher and 4 contrast centers). Data were collected from each classroom over 3 occasions in an 8-mo period. Results show that the introduction of a 3rd teacher was followed by an increase in the number of interactions that children had with teachers and in more prosocial play between peers. Most categories of child/teacher interactions (verbal, nonverbal, affective, play) increased from baseline to the 2nd and 3rd observations in 3-teacher kindergartens. Positive interactions with peers increased and negative interactions decreased after the arrival of the 3rd teacher. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - An evaluation was made on the effects of an improved staff ratio in New Zealand kindergartens. Aspects of four typical kindergartens staffed by two teachers were compared with aspects of four kindergartens that were provided with a third teacher. Data were collected from teachers, kindergarten children and parents. Findings indicated that the introduction of a third teacher was associated with a statistically significant reduction in children's negative behavior in relation to peers. Children had more positive play with peers, talked more, and interacted more with teachers after the third teacher arrived. After the third teacher was introduced, teacher behavior showed fewer changes than did child behavior, but teachers in the third-teacher kindergartens made more nonverbal initiations to children, talked more to parents, were more involved in children's play, and talked more to each other. Teachers believed that the introduction of a third teacher needed to be accompanied by considerable in-service work on leadership and management, and some findings lent credence to that belief. Adult-child ratios did not improve as much as expected in kindergartens with three teachers. It was concluded that the third teacher was a valuable addition, and that transition support should be provided.

AB  - Described 25 early childhood teachers' behaviors when they became involved in children's naturally occurring peer interactions in the context of free choice activities. Relationships of these teacher interventions to adult/child classroom ratio, teacher education, teacher beliefs, and program quality were also examined. Results indicate that teachers became involved in an average of 5.5 peer interaction episodes in each 30-min observation period. The most commonly observed interventions were statements of rules and commands, and interventions in which the teacher terminated a peer interaction. Overall program quality, high adult/child ratio, teachers' beliefs about developmentally appropriate practice, and teachers' level of education were related positively to a variety of interventions having the potential to help children become autonomous in negotiating successful peer interaction. Greater specialized preparation in early childhood education was associated with more frequent intervention in peer interactions.

AB  - Little is known about the quality and characteristics of the language used by childcare staff when interacting with infants in non-parental group care settings. This qualitative study analysed the manner in which staff used language when interacting with ten children aged between 9 and 20 months in four different long day care centres in Sydney, Australia. Each infant was audiorecorded for one whole day using a small recording device attached to her/his clothing, which captured all the language spoken directly to, or in their presence of, the infant. The infants and staff were simultaneously videorecorded as they went about their everyday activities, to provide additional contextual information. Using systemic functional linguistics as the theoretical underpinning, the study found that staff members tended to talk to more than one child at a time, limiting their potential to engage in the types of sustained conversations with individual children that have been shown to promote language development. Staff also tended to use language primarily to manage children's behaviour and provide physical care, rather than using language to encourage children to use their own developing language to represent their experiences in a variety of contexts. The findings have implications for group size, early childhood teacher education and inservice professional development.

AB  - This article explores parents' perspectives on, and experiences of, home and preschool collaboration. The data consist of in-depth interviews with 10 parents with one or several children attending preschool. The research process of gathering and analyzing data follows the procedures of constructivist grounded theory. The results show how parents seek to practice remote parenting' in order to shoulder their parental responsibilities for their child's well-being and care while they are away from their child. Parents approach situations they find difficult at preschool in different ways, including staying in the preschool and appreciating the collaboration with practitioners, working for change, coping with the situation, or changing preschools. Parents' experiences of home and preschool collaboration differ in significant ways, and there is, therefore, a need to visualize and discuss norms and values that shape the conditions for parental collaboration. The results might be useful for stakeholders and policy-makers on different levels.

AB  - Over the last decade, group size in preschool has become an important issue for Swedish preschool teachers. In Sweden 87 per cent of children in the ages of 1 and 5 are enrolled in preschool. A key issue related to the education of these children is the impact of group size. This study aims to investigate the impact of group size on the affordances available to children in relation to the intentions instantiated in the curriculum and to children´s learning and knowledge formation. The research questions we address is: How do teacher´s express views on group sizes in preschool? In relation to the preschool curriculum and depending on group size, what kinds of affordances are available to children? The study takes an interactionistic perspective based on Urie Bronfenbrenner´s ecological systems. Methods used are interviews, video observations, interplay between teachers and children, stimulated recall with teachers, and walk-and-talk sessions with the children. Analyses will be conducted drawing on Urie Bronfenbrenner´s ecological system theory and development pedagogy to examine similarities, differences and the variation of available affordances. The study follows the Swedish research council guidelines and ethical rules in social science Research. The study is expected to generate knowledge of the perspectives of teachers and children on the impact of group size in preschool and the affordances available to children in relation to curriculum goals depending on the size of their group.

AB  - Over the last decade, group size in preschool has become an important issue for Swedish preschool teachers. In Sweden 87 per cent of children in the ages of 1 and 5 are enrolled in preschool. A key issue related to the education of these children is the impact of group size. This study aims to investigate the impact of group size on the affordances available to children in relation to the intentions instantiated in the curriculum and to children's learning and knowledge formation. The research question we address is: In relation to the preschool curriculum and depending on group size, how do teacher's express views on group sizes in preschool? Despite a long preschool tradition in Sweden and a preschool system that is nearing completion, there is limited research and knowledge about how large groups impact teachers’ working conditions including their ability to meet curriculum intentions and support children’s learning and knowledge formation. There are even fewer studies that focus on the relationship between the youngest children and group size in preschool. These needs make the size of preschool groups important foci for research in Sweden as well as in the other Nordic countries. The study takes an interactionistic perspective based on Urie Bronfenbrenner´s ecological systems. Methods used are interviews, video observations and interplay between teachers and children. Analyses will be conducted drawing on Urie Bronfenbrenner´s ecological system theory and development pedagogy to examine similarities, differences and the variation of available affordances. The study follows the Swedish research council guidelines and ethical rules in social science research. Ethical aspects of the research were taken into consideration, including in particular requirements for confidentiality, consent, information and autonomy, along with the emphasis that participation in the study was voluntary. The results is expected generate knowledge of the perspectives of teachers on the impact of group size in preschool and the affordances available to children in relation to curriculum goals depending on the size of their group.

AB  - This study combines ecological theories with a developmental pedagogy approach. It is a qualitative study based on interviews and a questionnaire, answered by preschool teachers. Analyses is drawn on Bronfenbrenner´s theory and development pedagogy to examine the variation of available affordances. The study follows the Swedish research council guidelines and ethical rules, including requirements for confidentiality, consent, information and autonomy and emphasis voluntary participation. The main findings describes that group size is a complex issue depending on the integration of different aspects such as teachers’ competence, staff/child ratio, children’s age, activities, contents for learning and physical space interact. The results show the impact of group size in preschool and the affordances available to children in relation to curriculum goals depending on the size of their group.

AB  - This paper aims to investigate children’s participation and influence in preschool, in relation to group size and the intentions in the curriculum. What does preschool teachers’ ideas about children’s participation mean for every-day work in preschool, in relation to the number of children in the group? Swedish preschool has been pointed out as having high quality. Simultaneously there are changes going on and the number of children has increased in each group. The mixed methods design takes an interactionistic perspective based on Bronfenbrenner´s ecological systems and a sociocultural approach, based on interviews and a questionnaire, answered by preschool teachers. Analyses are conducted drawing on ecological system theory and sociocultural theories, to examine similarities, differences and the variation of available affordances. The study follows the Swedish research council guidelines and ethical rules in social science research. Ethical aspects of research have been considered. Autonomy was guaranteed to all participants. The parents of the children consented to the project. Teachers and children participated voluntarily. Results show that preschool teachers consider children’s participation and influence as most important values to work with, although they express that it is not an easy goal to fulfil in a large child group. Children’s participation in preschool is expressed as: listen to children, guide them, free play, to make choices, vote and decide about activities. The results generate knowledge of the perspectives of teachers on the impact of group size in preschool and the affordances available to children in relation to curriculum goals depending on the size.

AB  - According to the Swedish National Agency for Education, 2014, the number of children enrolled in preschool has increased during the last ten years. In Sweden, the majority of children, approximately 84 per cent, are enrolled in preschool, which constitutes the first step of the educational system and embraces children from one to five years of age. There is a limited amount of research about how group size impacts on preschool teachers’ working conditions and their ability to support children’s learning and development in line with the curriculum intentions. From a perspective on quality, this paper aims to describe conditions for children’s learning in preschool in relation to group size. Question at issue is: How do preschool teacher’s express views on group sizes in preschool? The study is based on Urie Bronfenbrenner ́s ecological system theory. Methods used are semi-structured interviews and a survey answered by preschool teachers. Analyses are drawn on Bronfenbrenner ́s theory to examine similarities, differences and the variation of available conditions for learning and knowledge formation. The study follows the Swedish research council guidelines and ethical rules in social science research. Ethical aspects of the research were taken into consideration, including in particular requirements for confidentiality, consent, information and autonomy, along with the emphasis that participation in the study was voluntary. The results indicate that group size in preschool is depended of interacting factors, such as: preschool teachers competence and qualifications, indoor and outdoor environment, number of children per adult and the composition of the child group. Preschool teacher express that fewer children in groups allows for greater communication and interaction and more opportunities to meet and stimulate children’s learning and development.

AB  - This study explores how group size influences children's conditions for wellbeing, learning and development in preschool in relation to the intentions in the revised (2010) Swedish preschool curriculum. The study is based on qualitative methods generated from interviews and open-ended questions in a questionnaire. Group size is dependent on three dimensions of preschool teacher's experiences of group size, constituted of various aspects: preschool teacher qualifications and competence, physical indoor and outdoor environment and the composition of the child group. The dimensions and aspects affect the critical number of children for it to function in a qualitative good manner. If these dimensions and aspects do not interact constructively, teachers and children experience the group as large.

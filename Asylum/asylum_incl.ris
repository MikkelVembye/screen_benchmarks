AB  - The article reports that asylum-seeking women whose claims are fast-tracked at Yarl's Wood detention centre are not being given enough time to present evidence of traumatic experiences in Great Britain. Under the fast-track system, initial decisions have to be served within three days, after which claimants have two days to appeal, leaving many women with insufficient time to prepare, according to the study of 31 cases by charity Bail for Immigration Detainees

AB  - The Children's Commissioner has a statutory duty to promote awareness of the views and interests of children, particularly regarding their physical and mental health and emotional well-being, their education, training and recreation and protecting them from harm and neglect. This paper summarises the report resulting from the Commissioner's third visit to Yarl's Wood Immigration Removal Centre to examine the progress made in addressing concerns raised regarding children's experience of the immigration removal process and detention, which sets out the children's perspective of their experiences following any changes arising from the previous report. It covers the report's findings on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the decision to detain, preparation for removal, the arrest process, children's concerns during detention, healthcare, safeguarding children, reviewing detention, and arrangements for pregnant and nursing mothers and their babies and infants. It concludes by reiterating the Commissioner's contention that arrest and detention are inherently damaging to children, and that Yarl's Wood is no place for a child, and summarising the key recommendations of the report

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this investigation was to describe asylum seeking children's social and family situation, health status, strain factors connected with migration, and to unveil practice relevant indicators, which can furthermore delimit children with special needs MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross section investigation of asylum seeking children, who in the first half of 1997 were accommodated in The Danish Red Cross Reception Centre and examined by a doctor and/or a public health nurse according to the rules laid down by The Danish Red Cross Social and Health Department. If language problems occurred, an interpreter was present at the examination. Data were collected from the medical record of the child and the parents RESULTS: The investigation included 364 children. 59% of the children had 306 diagnoses or symptoms, 17% of the diagnoses or symptoms were referred to a specialist or a psychologist. The children came from 25 different countries. 43% came with both parents. The most frequent symptoms in the children were tooth and skin problems and enuresis DISCUSSION: On the background of disease prevalence, asylum seeking children do not seem to be more frequently ill than children living in Denmark. It is considered that the present investigation could successfully be repeated with a view to universal validity. In the medical records, asylum seeking children's physical health situation is well described, whereas symptoms arising from the flight and experiences are sparsely described. It is recommended that an investigation is carried out, in which both the children's physical and mental health situation is described

AB  - Case files for a random sample of 100 separated asylum seeking children entering Ireland in 2003-2004 were scrutinised. The findings indicate that separated children seeking asylum (SCSA) are not a homogeneous group; they face a multitude of different risks, and although some experience significantly poor outcomes, some SCSA actually thrive in their new environment and even excel upon settling in a new country. It was possible to distinguish distinct patterns of need reflecting different types of experience and difficulty, which in turn require different types of service response. The children in the study were categorised into four groups: traumatised children with health problems needing high support; children in good health, likely to go missing; children who appear resilient and who are highly motivated; and girls who arrive pregnant, likely to be victims of sexual assault

N1  - Date revised - 2013-06-12 SuppNotes - The U.S. detention system for asylum seekers is fundamentally flawed. These flaws reflect an underlying lack of fairness that is inconsistent with international law and with U.S. traditions of fairness. For instance, the initial determination to detain an asylum seeker is not the result of an individualized determination, but is instead mandatory. Subsequent parole decisions are entrusted to the INS, which is the detaining authority, rather than to an independent authority. In short, the system lacks the kinds of safeguards necessary to promote due process and to guard against unfair and arbitrary detention. Reform is possible. The detention system for asylum seekers can be improved so that it is consistent with the values of fairness that the United States strives to meet Last updated - 2013-09-16 SubjectsTermNotLitGenreText - 1357 11229; 10695; 1279; 10691; 6751 8040; 6743 7253; 433 293 14

AB  - In recent decades, the criminalization of immigration and the use of private prisons have increased in popularity. The criminalization of immigration and the privatization of prisons work hand in hand in shaping the American criminal justice response to immigration. Privatization creates a powerful opportunity for the social construction of the undocumented immigrant into a powerful potential source of revenue for for- profit corporations. Private prison corporations, such as Corrections Corporation of American and The GEO Group, stand to profit significantly from the private immigration detention center. Several investigative reports have focused on how these companies stand to profit, but little attention has been given to the psychosocial consequences that impact immigrant detainees and their families.

This project work was aimed to provide learning opportunities for students of public health. Many academic staff felt that facilitating medical student projects represented a diversion from research work. The research project was performed by means of evaluating the relationship between socio-economic status and seatbelt use, and a survey of public opinion on banning smoking in public places

AB  - "Besieged, Displaced and Detained" documents the desperate plight of an estimated 230,000 to 300,000 ethnic Tamil civilian trapped in the Vanni region of northern Sri Lanka, where fierce fighting is raging between the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and the Sri Lankan security forces. Based on research conducted in northern Sri Lanka, this report documents how individuals and families fleeing fighting in the Vanni are being indefinitely detained in poor conditions in military-guarded detention camps. The government's detention policies violate the basic human rights of displaced persons. The report also criticizes the Sri Lankan government for ordering the United Nations and humanitarian organizations to close down their operations in the Vanni in September 2008. Currently hundreds of thousands of civilians face severe shortages of food, shelter, and other essentials. The Sri Lankan government contends that government humanitarian aid is filling the gap caused by the forced humanitarian withdrawal, but the evidence makes it clear that this is not accurate -- as aid agencies and government civil servants confirm as they have repeatedly warned of a humanitarian crisis. Human Rights Watch calls for an immediate lifting of the near total ban on non-government humanitarian operations in the Vanni and an immediate end to the illegal policy of detaining civilians feeling from the Vanni. -- back cover

T1  - An investigation into the psychological health of older Greek-Cypriot refugees
JF  - Australian Journal of Psychology
A1  - Costa A
KW  - eppi-reviewer
AB  - Although numerous refugee groups reside in Australia, research into the psychological health of Greek-Cypriot refugees is nonexistent at present. Research conducted into all other refugee populations however, has concluded that refugees are more susceptible to developing mental illnesses, as a result of both premigratory (e.g., exposure to trauma) and post-migratory factors (e.g., difficult acculturation). The maladaptive events that preceded emigration by Greek-Cypriot refugees include forceful exodus, false imprisonment, and long term accommodation in concentration camps. Post-migration factors that commonly impact the quality of the acculturative process include age, the degree of family and social support available in the host country, English language proficiency, socioeconomic status, degree of perceived racism and discrimination, and the degree of incongruence between pre-migration expectations and post-migration reality. The traumata endured by many Greek-Cypriot refugees and the adverse psychological effects that are likely to have resulted require immediate investigation. Therefore, the aims of this study are (a) to measure the current psychological health of Greek-Cypriot refugees living in Australia, (b) to measure the prevalence, types, and severity of traumatic life events, and (c) to investigate the impact of family support on the psychological health of traumatised individuals. The specific hypotheses include: (a) there is a positive correlation between the degree of traumata suffered in Cyprus and the level of psychopathology currently experienced; and (b) the degree of psychopathology suffered is related to the level of family support, type of coping strategies adopted, and the quality of the acculturative experience in the host country

AB  - This report examines the situation of asylum seekers and refugees from an equality and human rights perspective. It aims to contextualise measures taken towards asylum seekers and refugees within the broader range of measures relating to migrants and visitors to the UK, arguing that the government has itself increasing sought to integrate the measures taken towards asylum seekers and refugees within broader migration policy. After considering the policy area, the report describes the disadvantages for asylum seekers and refugees with relation to: health status, health and social care; education, training and the labour market; poverty, destitution and access to accommodation and financial support; and the legal and criminal justice system. It goes on to consider issues relating to integration and cohesion, such as racism and discrimination. The geographic distribution of asylum seekers and refugees and the situation in Scotland and Wales are considered. Finally, the report discusses implications for data collection, key strategic issues, and the scope for intervention. The report concludes that the ongoing tension between policies relating to immigration control and those concerned with welfare lies at the heart of many of the concerns regarding the equality and human rights of asylum seekers and refugees

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the general health status of asylum seekers and their access to health services. DESIGN: Prospective questionnaire survey. SETTING: A community-based asylum seeker centre in Sydney from March to September 1994, before the Limited Health Care Assistance Scheme had taken effect. PARTICIPANTS: 40 of 57 eligible asylum seekers from 21 different countries attending English language classes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Results on the traumatic events section of the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire, a postmigratory problem checklist, the COOP Functional Health Assessment charts, the Duke-University of North Carolina Health Profile, and a structured interview to assess difficulties in accessing health care in Australia. RESULTS: More than 30 of the 40 participants reported exposure to past trauma. Asylum seekers were more impaired in their emotional health than a normative group of patients with minor (P < 0.001) and serious (P < 0.001) medical illnesses, and more impaired in role functioning than those with minor medical illnesses (P < 0.001). 20 or more reported symptoms of nervousness, headache, and/or depression; 28 reported having pain in the previous 4 weeks. 27 reported major difficulties in accessing dental services. The same number reported problems in obtaining general medical care; the most important reason cited was not having a Medicare card. CONCLUSIONS: Although a selective sample, the asylum seekers in our study appeared to be suffering substantial levels of emotional and somatic symptoms, yet, for most, access to health care was a major problem. The effectiveness of recent sequential changes to the provisions covering welfare and health care for asylum seekers needs to be closely monitored. [Author Abstract]

AB  - As a �_~total institution�_T as well as a tool of government policy in limiting and promoting human mobility, prisons serve important migration-related functions in contemporary society. The social structure of prisons as well as their roles in incapacitating potential migrants and deterring migration contribute to mental health problems amongst the incarcerated. A major consequence of high prevalence of mental illness in prisons is suicide. Irrespective of complex intertwined factors such as harsh penal regime and the psychological impact of arrest an incarceration which increase the risk of prison suicides, mentally ill prisoners are significantly more likely to commit suicide during incarceration and within the first year following release from custody. The author examines the contributions of prison mental health promotion policies and programs in England and Wales to preventing prison suicides, and concludes that Britain�_Ts recent initiatives in this sector have a strong potential to sustainably reduce prison suicides as well as improve prisoners�_T mental health.

AB  - Between 1910 and 1940 the Angel Island Immigration Station was the primary port of entry for Asians into the United States, the place of enforcement of the Chinese Exclusion Act and other anti-Asian immigration policies. Even in the absence of substantiating data, it is frequently asserted that almost all entering Chinese were detained at Angel Island and that they were detained for weeks, months, even years. This article presents the first empirical evidence on how long people arriving at San Francisco were detained at the Angel Island Immigration Station. The use of newly discovered data on passengers of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company (PMSS) for the period 1913-19 adds an empirical basis to our understanding of how immigration laws were administered in classifying and detaining aliens seeking to enter the United States, which arrivals were detained at Angel Island, and for how long. Results show that many Chinese were not detained at all; there was great variation in length of detention for Chinese who were detained; only some of this variation can be explained by the type of `exempt' status claimed for admission under the Chinese exclusion laws; Japanese arrivals had an even higher incidence of detention; and many detainees were either non-Asian, had come on ships from Central or South America, or were not `immigrants' at all.

AB  - Australia's acceptance of refugees from Vietnam was unique in that never before had such a sizeable non-Caucasian intake occurred from such a markedly different cultural background. In fact, the Australian Government's dealings with this particular population led it into policy development in two new arenas: (i) refugee policy, as distinct from general immigration policy, was formulated for the first time, and (ii) settlement policy was finally recognized as being necessary for newcomers to this country, especially when language and cultural differences were pronounced. Yet the relevance of these policies and related programs to the life experiences of refugees, and their impact on the outcomes achieved in resettlement have been poorly understood. In this thesis a model is developed to explain relationships between refugees' life conditions, policies and programs that influence those life conditions, and resettlement outcomes. Three levels of analysis are encompassed by the model: societal, psycho-social and intra-psychic. Three corresponding bodies of theory (theory of refugee resettlement; socialization, role and identity formation; and loss and change) underpin the model. The model is then applied to a particular sub-group of Vietnamese refugees who have been accepted for resettlement by Australia: unaccompanied minors, the majority of whom have been sent out from Vietnam by their parents to build new lives in a 'free' country. Documentation of the life conditions these youngsters have experienced in their home land, during the transition period in refugee camps, and after their arrival in Australia is consolidated in terms of a range of relevant elements specified in the model. The policies and programs that have impacted on their lives in Australia have also been described and analyzed according to dimensions specified in the model. This descriptive and analytic base, in conjunction with the underpinning theories, provided the foundation for the development of a series of general propositions and more specific predictions of likely outcomes of these youngsters' resettlement in Australia. Policy implications of each of these outcome predictions are identified, and prescriptions are developed for the consideration of those with a social planning mandate for this population group. The thesis concludes with a consideration of contributions such a holistic perspective of refugee resettlement can provide for social planners, and the direction and context it provides for a range of future research undertakings

AB  - The impetus for developing this monograph came from the conference, "The Refugee Convention: Where to from here?", held at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in December 2001 under the auspice of the UNSW Refugee Research Centre, the Refugee Council of Australia, and the Australian National Council of Refugee Women. Many of the issues addressed in conference presentations were considered at the time to need urgent attention, and one avenue for raising awareness and sparking community and professional involvement was the publication and dissemination of presented material. The Transcultural Mental Health Centre (TMHC) agreed to publish a monograph encompassing those presentations that were particularly relevant to mental health issues concerning refugees and asylum seekers. We still have children languishing in detention, we still have asylum seekers and people on temporary protection visas who have no idea what their futures hold, and we still have a settlement process that is seriously flawed for many refugees who have been afforded permanent protection in this country. Chapters in this monograph draw attention to mental health implications of these situations, some arguing for changes to immigration policy to minimise the development of mental health problems in the first place and others arguing for greater sensitivity and more appropriate responses to existing mental health needs within current immigration policy. An introductory chapter provides an overview of the laws, policies, and procedures that govern Australia's response to refugees and asylum seekers. The chapters that follow are in two clusters, based on the immigration status of the particular refugee/asylum seeking communities that are the focus of concern. The first cluster of four chapters addresses the plight of those who have sought asylum in Australia without having been assessed as refugees prior to their arrival. The second cluster of chapters concerns people from war-torn backgrounds who have been granted the right to stay in Australia permanently. Collectively, this compilation of chapters contributes to the knowledge-base of mental health workers in a number of ways: it points to the importance of understanding the background of trauma from which refugees and asylum seekers come and the mental health legacy that results from these experiences; it points to the link between formal immigration status and particular sources of emotional stress that refugees and asylum seekers encounter in Australia; and it points to the long-term nature of some of the mental health implications of resettlement. Individually, the chapters each provide more specific insights into mental health issues of particular groups. Armed with the information contained within this monograph, mental health workers will be well prepared, not only to respond more appropriately to refugees and asylum seekers they encounter as clients/patients, but also to join the growing push for legislative and policy change that can promote mental health in a more positive way from the outset.

It cites the important role played by detention centers in the development of mental health issues for the asylum seeker and refugee. Individual risk and protection factors play significant contributions in the ability to survive the rigors of emigration. It details the stress-like behaviors exhibited by children seeking asylum or experiencing war or civil conflict

N1  - Date revised - 2013-06-12 SuppNotes - The Australian system of mandatory detention of asylum-seekers has become increasingly controversial. Insofar as commentary on detention has been framed historically, critics have pointed to Australia's race-based exclusionary laws and policies over the twentieth century. In this article, we suggest that exclusion and detention are not equivalent practices, even if they are often related. Here we present an alternative genealogy of mandatory detention and protests against it. Quarantine-detention and the internment of `enemy aliens' in wartime are historic precedents for the current detention of asylum-seekers. Importantly, in both carceral practices, non-criminal and often non-citizen populations were held in custody en masse and without trial. Quarantine, internment and incarceration of asylum-seekers are substantively connected over the twentieth century, as questions of territory, security and citizenship have been played out in Australia's histories of detention Last updated - 2013-09-16 SubjectsTermNotLitGenreText - 1357 11229; 10695; 5574 10472; 10555 6091; 6234 7253; 6235 11888 10472 9874 5574; 5873 971; 34 309

AB  - Abused, neglected, and abandoned immigrant youth face numerous obstacles to physical safety, including potential repatriation (deportation) to abusive caretakers from whom they fled. In recognition of the special needs of abused children, Congress enacted Special Immigrant Juvenile Status (SIJS) to provide a previously unavailable child welfare defense to deportation. The remedy is contingent upon a State court declaration that the youth is, in fact, in need of protection. However, unlike their counterparts in foster care or guardianships, youth detained by the federal government face numerous practical and legal roadblocks to accessing the necessary State court declarations. This article identifies several gaps in State laws which impede detained youths' access to State court declarations, and proposes several remedies which would enable the States to carry out Congress' intent that detained youth have access to SIJS, regardless of detention status.

AB  - Effects on mental health of the stress of being interned in a refugee camp were assessed in a community survey of 1348 Southeast Asians. The impact on depressive mood proved significant but short-lived. Social support derived from the ethnic community and from an intact marriage moderated the risk of developing depressive symptoms, apparently by enhancing a sense of identity and belongingness. A psychological coping mechanism--avoidance of the past--buffered the impact of camp stress on depressive symptoms. While refugees brought into the country under private sponsorship were expected to have a mental health advantage compared to those admitted under government sponsorship, this hypothesis was not confirmed. Private sponsorship, carried out by individuals or groups whose religion differed from the refugees they were supporting, acted as a source of stress.

AB  - Asylum seekers must deal with their unresolved residential status at a time where their well-being may be fragile. This mixed-methods study aimed to investigate asylum seekers' symptoms of psychological distress, in order to inform the services that should be offered while they wait for the outcome of their asylum application. The study comprised: mental health screening of 29 asylum seekers arrived in the UK using questionnaires; and in-depth interviews with 8 of these asylum seekers' one month later about their subjective experiences of the asylum process, its potential impacts on their mental health, and their suggestions for tackling mental health needs. The asylum seekers originated from 13 countries. Given the potential limitations of using �_~idioms of distress�_T across cultures, the interview data provided rich descriptive accounts which helped locate the mental health needs that the asylum seekers experienced in the specificities of each participant's social context. The results revealed that psychological distress such as anxiety and post-traumatic stress is common among asylum seekers, but so are post-migratory living difficulties relating to accommodation, discrimination, worry about family back home, and not being allowed to work. The participants reported mixed experiences of health and social care services. These results suggest that asylum seekers' unique social position may affect their mental health. Implications for practice are presented

AB  - This study investigated aspects of the mental health of asylum seekers who had recently arrived in the UK. It used the Post-Migration Living Difficulties Scale, the Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 Scale, the PTSD Symptom Scale Interview, the Clinical Outcomes Routine Evaluation and in-depth interviews. A total of 29 asylum seekers, 26 of whom were male, representing 13 countries, agreed to take part. Findings revealed that the participants all experienced a feeling of fear and sadness about the uncertainty of their application for asylum, while fear of deportation affected their ability to carry out activities of daily life. Social support was deemed essential in helping them cope with these difficulties. The paper ends with some reflections on the challenges that arose during the investigation, and presents recommendations to help other researchers undertaking similar research

AB  - Cambodian, Laotian and Vietnamese refugees who have come to North American host countries via the South Asian camps have been exposed to many potentially traumatic events and have been submitted to an alienating migration process.

AB  - Throughout the world, the number of refugees and asylum seekers continue to increase. Due to persecution, war, or violations of their human rights, many will have specific mental health needs. Cultural and socioeconomic factors play a major role in expressions of distress, help seeking, pathways into care, and acceptance or rejection of treatments. Being a refugee or asylum seeker raises questions about an individual's self-respect and altered identity. Too often though, the needs of this population are ignored by policy makers and clinicians, and these people are left to fend for themselves. This book presents both the theoretical and practical aspects of the mental health needs of refugees and asylum seekers. It looks at the impact of migration on mental health and adjustment, trauma, individual identity, and diagnostic fallacies. A practical section highlights cultural factors, therapeutic interaction, therapeutic expectation and psychotherapy. The final part of the book focuses on special problems - such as bereavement, sexual violence, and post-traumatic stress disorders, as well as considering mental health problems in special groups, such as child refugees. This book is designed for all mental health professionals, helping them better understand the needs of refugees and asylum seekers, how their problems can be managed, and how they can best be helped

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Refugees are at high risk of mental disorders but often complain about a lack of access to appropriate care. The purpose of this study was to assess the representation of refugees among psychiatric inpatients, given that it has been suggested that they use a disproportionate level of care compared with nonrefugees. METHODS: A census of all psychiatric inpatient units in London was used to determine the numbers of inpatients, the numbers of refugees, and measures of need, such as compulsory detention, duration of admission, need for interpreters, and whether inpatient status was appropriate. RESULTS: Of 2,955 psychiatric inpatients, 134 (4.5%) were refugees. Refugees' admission rates were similar to or lower than those of nonrefugees. Refugees were more likely to be inappropriately placed, to require interpreters, and to have more complex needs. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that refugees are not overusing London's psychiatric inpatient units but have complex needs that challenge existing service providers. [Author Abstract]

AB  - In 2010, the government announced a new process for deporting children and families which has also changed the approach to the immigration detention of children. In this context, this article explores immigration detention in the UK, focusing in particular on detention of children. It discusses the impact of detention on children and changes as a result of the new policy, reporting that fewer children are held for shorter periods, and in better conditions. It describes Cedars, a new secure facility�providing pre-departure accommodation for families, which was designed explicitly not to feel like a prison. The author argues that the Cedars model, including its open design and welfare orientation, should influence the development of adult detention centres. The article also discusses issues of equity and legitimacy of detention in the immigration control system

AB  - During the spring of 1980, over 120,000 Cuban refugees emigrated to the United States. Their rapid, unexpected arrival overwhelmed existing health care facilities in south Florida. Government-operated screening centers capable of handling large patient loads were established. Health screening involved a brief history and physical examination and a search for active tuberculosis and venereal disease. Thousands of refugees were processed rapidly and released to waiting relatives and sponsors. Many others, who for social or psychological reasons could not be released, were transferred to holding centers in various parts of the country. US Public Health Service physicians were faced with difficulties whose basic cause could be traced to the boredom of camp life and stresses due to uncertainty regarding the future. Acting out and compliance problems with medical aftermaths were common. About 3,000 refugees remain in custody today.

In cooperation with the personnel at the latter center, they tried to detect and record the mental health of the refugees in one camp, using questionnaires. 44.8% of the sample were found to suffer from PTSD, which was not much related to demographic parameters, but only to the parameter trauma events.

AB  - The majority of research on the mental health status of Cambodian refugees living in the USA indicates high rates of psychopathology and low utilization rates of health and mental health care. This study used probability sampling techniques in the selection of the sample which consisted of 124 Cambodian refugees living in Utah. The purposes of the study were threefold: to examine the mental health status of Cambodian refugees living in Utah, to examine risk and protective factors associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and/or major depression, and to examine utilization of health and mental health care. Examination of mental health status revealed that PTSD and major depression were the most prevalent disorders: 45% of the sample were diagnosed with PTSD, and 51% of the sample were diagnosed major depression. Univariate and bivariate statistics were used to identify the following primary risk factors in the study: (a) experiencing a greater number of war traumas increased the risk of both PTSD and major depression, (b) having a greater amount of time in refugee camps and less time in the USA increased the risk of major depression, (c) experiencing a greater number of resettlement stressors during the past year increased the risk of both PTSD and major depression, and (d) having financial stress increased the risk of major depression. Logistic regression analysis was also used to examine the influence of a combination of variables on a diagnosis of PTSD and on major depression. Studying utilization of health and mental health care indicated that only 6% of the sample had received medical treatment for PTSD symptoms; only 8% of the sample received medical treatment for symptoms of major depression; and only 9% of the sample had received any type of mental health treatment. In addition, subjects reported a variety of barriers to accessing health and mental health care. Results of this study indicate that practice and policy changes are necessary in order t (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The political asylum system in Western Europe is under strain. High numbers of people are applying for political asylum as the only possibility of living legally in Western countries, while governments are trying to prevent access to their territories and to discourage applicants. It is very difficult to foresee an equitable and timely solution of the root causes of many displacements, either extreme poverty or human rights abuse. In the meanwhile, many of those who are genuinely persecuted are rejected before their cases can even be considered. The entitlements to health care of different categories of refugees and asylum seekers have been reviewed. While convention refugees and de facto refugees have the same right to health care than the citizens of the country of asylum, asylum seekers and persons who are offered temporary protection tend to have restricted access to health care, although there is a great variability across countries. The available reports on the health status of asylum seekers in Western European countries document a quite difficult psychological and social adjustment. It is unclear whether this situation, which is caused by the stress of leaving their own country and family, by uncertainty over the future, and by possible exposure to violence is intensified by restriction to work, unsuitable organization of day to day life in asylum centers, and limited access to health care. A major effort is urgently needed to evaluate the health needs of asylum seekers, and to improve standards of reception and care in European countries.

AB  - Self-inflicted deaths in prisons in England and Wales were at a 10-year low in 2006 but rose in 2007, largely attributed to an unexpected increase in self-inflicted deaths by foreign national (FN) prisoners. All deaths were reviewed in detail using prison and clinical records and interviews with prison staff. This paper reports findings for the deaths of the 20 FN prisoners from non-EU countries. Similarities were found between these deaths and self-inflicted deaths of UK nationals in terms of method, location of death, index offence, and prevalence of mental illness. Additional factors found in the FNs included early anxiety, trauma symptoms in refugees from conflict, language issues, deportation fears, and cultural concepts of shame. These findings are discussed in relation to the entrapment model of suicide and the need for specialised mental health service provision. Reprinted by permission of Routledge, Taylor and Francis Ltd

AB  - Migration and asylum have become permanent features of international politics as is the development of human rights principles. As the world today experiences tremendous population turbulence, states have intensified their efforts to control and deter potential migrants and asylum seekers. State actions have often disregarded international human rights principles, thus the question as to why this is the case. In this regard, the issue of treatment of migrants and asylum seekers in host states has drawn the attention of the international community, scholars and policymakers and the focus is centered on state compliance with international human rights standards in the treatment of migrants and asylum seekers. Within the international legal context, numerous instruments have been created to protect the rights of all humans regardless of their nationality, status, color or creed. The principles contained in these instruments have imposed duties and obligations to signatory states on legal grounds and to all other states on moral grounds. This study is about states' compliance with human rights standards. It analyzes state immigration and asylum policies as one of the fundamental influences of state human rights policies and practices. It also focuses on compliance with human rights principles based on theories of compliance. The study problematizes the extent of state compliance with human rights principles with specific reference to the rights of immigration and asylum detainees. The thrust of this dissertation is to ascertain the degree to which nation-states comply with international human rights obligations and norms regarding detention of migrants and asylum seekers. This study argues that state compliance with international human rights principles is based on legitimacy (ratification and/or incorporation) of human rights commitments and reputational or credibility concerns. The acceptance of treaty obligations raises expectations about the state's behavior and once made it becomes reputationally costly to violate terms of the treaty. It analyzes domestic immigration and asylum policies and how they influence migrants and asylum seekers' flows and the state's level of compliance. This study reviews core international and regional human rights instruments and identifies principles that are applicable to the protection of migrants and asylum seekers and analyzes Britain's compliance with some of the core principles. The study concludes that Britain's treatment of migrants and asylum seekers is discriminatory and does not comply with international human rights standards. It illustrates the existence of racial bias in British immigration and asylum policies and practices and the limits of reputational or credibility and legitimacy considerations to enforce compliance. It shows that anti-trafficking and anti-smuggling legislation and enforcement has virtually criminalized asylum seeking. It makes some recommendations for better protection of migrants and asylum seekers in Britain

AB  - This article examines the detention and deportation of time-served foreign-national prisoners in England and Wales. Drawing on penal policy and interviews with staff and detainees in prisons and immigration removal centres, it critically assesses the growing interdependence of the UK Border Agency and HM Prison Service. While the removal of failed asylum seekers has generated widespread concern and activism, the deportation of foreign ex-prisoners is rarely noted. The foreign offender, it seems, has few advocates. For anyone interested in immigration control, however, the treatment of foreign-national prisoners, both during and after their sentence, is compelling. On the one hand, they reveal a wider and deeper border, one that includes penal institutions located within the nation-state. Along these lines, the absence of citizenship enables harsher and longer punishments, as ex-prisoners may be held for considerable periods of time post-sentence due to their complex immigration cases. On the other hand, however, the treatment of foreign ex-prisoners is not uncontested - prison employees and staff within the immigration estate express concern at their treatment under Immigration Act powers. In short, this article suggests that the detention and deportation of foreign ex-prisoners raise a number of troubling questions about both the nature of governance and the limits of the liberal project of inclusion in late-modern Britain.

It examines the statistics of foreign prisoners, and explore the growing overlap between criminal justice and immigration policy. Meanwhile it asses the legislation which enables "crimmigration" and the conditions within immigration incarceration regimes

AB  - The Measure of the Quality of Life in Detention is a survey measure designed to gather self-reported information on demographic variables and detainee perceptions about aspects of life in detention and the progress of their immigration case, their mental health and their quality of life. This article sets out emerging findings from testing of the measure in the Yarl's Wood, Tinsley House and Brook House immigration removal centres between August 2010 and June 2011. For the research, 158 men and women from a range of countries completed the questionnaires (which took 45-60 minutes to complete). The article describes the survey and presents and discusses the main results. The survey findings suggested that there are 5 key dimensions to perceptions of quality of life in detention relating to depression, distress, isolation and the quality of relationships: humane treatment, staff decency, immigration trust, immigration procedural fairness, and health care. The authors consider the findings and their implications, and conclude that the measure offers an opportunity for investigation of issues and aspects of best practice in detention, and provides detainees with a forum to express their views

Data on immigrants in Dutch prisons show the percentage of inmates who are Dutch, aliens, and of Dutch nationality but with non-Dutch background. The report also addresses problems in prison encountered by Turks and Moroccans, Surinamese, and Moluccans. It concludes with a general discussion of prison problems common to most immigrant inmates. They include food requirements pertaining to both religious dictates and cultural tastes, religious practices, language barriers, cultural and lifestyle differences, and discrimination. 14-item bibliography

AB  - What are the likely mental and related physical health consequences of prolonged exposure to common stressors to detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba? Significant distress leads to high rates of psychiatric disorders, medical problems, and functional impairments. The consequences are severe, physically and psychologically, affecting the individual, his or her family, and the culture at large. Damaging conditions endured by detainees are multiple and severe and are reviewed here in detail. The author identifies parallels between Guantanamo detainees and similarly mistreated populations (e.g., prisoners of war, asylum seekers, prisoners) to draw inferences from existing research regarding likely outcomes for Guantanamo detainees. Protective factors normally present are systematically disrupted at Guantanamo. Overall, it is likely that detainees and their families are experiencing significant mental and physical health problems as a result of overlapping severe and chronic stressors related to detention and that this will worsen over time, particularly in the absence of appropriate assessment and treatment. The author addresses political and ethical factors, as well as basic implications for assessment, treatment, and advocacy, although these are not the focus of the article. Researchers and clinicians will face challenges in providing care for this population and understanding the long-term effects of such mistreatment. Sources reviewed are current up to September 2009.

AB  - The abuse of alcohol and other drugs (AOD) is evidently a significant, but often neglected, problem in refugee camps. There are some differences compared with AOD problems in developed countries (notably fewer affected women), but also many similarities. Alcohol is the major problem in terms of behavior and is often manufactured and traded by refugees themselves. Not all AOD users are AOD abusers, but identifying abusers may be worth the effort if it can be shown to reduce, rather than increase, the healthcare workload. If staff can be engaged, there are several techniques for engaging and managing abusers. The nonspecific effects of interventions may be considerable.

AB  - This article considers the challenges of meeting the mental health needs of refugees, migrants and their families. Specifically, it considers the concept of demoralisation and whether this may provide a more relevant diagnosis than depression for these individuals. The study participants were 100 refugee and migrant clients recruited from mental health and resettlement services in New Zealand and South Australia. A set of self-report scales revealed a degree of demoralisation and psychological distress among the sample. However, the study was not able to demonstrate that demoralisation is a more relevant diagnosis than depression for these clients, although the concept is worthy of further investigation. Despite the fact that many of the participants had attracted a diagnosis of major depressive disorder, a trial of antidepressants resulted in much lower effective response rates than would be expected. Additional factors known to impact on mental health, such as unemployment, were also apparent, placing emphasis on the need for further development of culturally competent and evidence-based practice in resettlement and mental health services

AB  - This article describes the impact of immigration detention on the health of asylum seekers. Drawing on specific examples, it explores the roles of professional staff working within the detention system and/or challenging the practices as advocates. Using oral testimony from a citizen-initiated campaign, The People's Inquiry into Detention, we interrogate the harmful experiences of force-feeding, deportation practices and the incarceration of children, including the role of the health professionals who sometimes betrayed their duty of care. Discussed are the paradoxes of dual loyalty and professional ethics. Reproduced by permission of Taylor and Francis Ltd

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate an observed epidemic of gynecomastia among Haitian refugees in US detention centers in 1981 and 1982 METHODS: All identifiable environmental exposures were investigated for estrogenic and antiandrogenic activity RESULTS: A high incidence of gynecomastia was observed among Haitian refugees in five detention centers in the United States. Of 284 men screened, 20 (from 18 to 53 years old) demonstrated new-onset gynecomastia (Tanner stages 2 to 5) in June 1982. The mean onset of gynecomastia was 130 +/- 12 days after arrival in the United States. Other symptoms included loss of libido (in all 20 patients) and decreased beard growth (in 10). Plasma concentrations of luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, prolactin, testosterone, and estradiol were not significantly different from those in 20 age-matched control subjects. Environmental substances, including tap water and the delousing agents Kwell shampoo and R&C Spray (applied to bedding and clothing), were tested for estrogenicity and androgenicity. None of these substances bound to cytosol estrogen receptors. The delousing agents were assayed for androgen binding by using genital skin fibroblasts. R&C Spray competed equally with testosterone for androgen-binding sites. Phenothrin, the "multi-cide" component of R&C Spray, reproduced this competitive binding result. When tested for antiandrogenic effects on prostate growth by using immature male rats treated with testosterone-filled Silastic capsules, phenothrin antagonized androgen action, as demonstrated by decreased prostate weights CONCLUSION: The antiandrogenic activity of phenothrin may explain this unusual epidemic of gynecomastia

AB  - Although, much has been written thus far about the numbers and needs of refugees. Little has been written, however, about their human rights. The most important human rights aspect of the refugee problem is that protection is often sought because of human rights violations. In any refugee population, approximately 80 percent of uprooted people are women and girls who are stripped of the security of their family structure. Many of these women are confronted with difficulties involving the loss of their children and loved ones. They face the many difficulties regarding displacement, harassment and frequent sexual abuse even after reaching an apparent place of safety ..PAT.-Unpublished Manuscript [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Conference Papers -- American Sociological Association is the property of American Sociological Association and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

AB  - During the first two years of the war in Bosnia (1992-93) refugees came both to Norway and to other European countries. Bosnian "war refugees" are released prisoners from Serbian concentration camps, and their close families. Most of the former prisoners and their families had experienced extreme traumas, qualifying them for help from expert psychotherapists. No such help was available. The aim of the present project was to find out whether useful psychosocial preventive work can be done within the primary health services. Our intervention, which was carried out during a six month period in 1993-94, included two semi-structured interviews with each refugee family in the centre, and follow-up contacts with persons who indicated major psychological problems. All the refugees reported that they experienced deep sorrow, and the majority had difficulty in sleeping and concentrating. A pessimistic view of their future was common. Most of the refugees were positive towards participating in the interviews. Several of them have reported that the interviews were of direct help. In the majority of cases we have experienced that the ordinary health contacts later have been meaningful. [Author Abstract]

AB  - Since the introduction of mandatory detention of unauthorized non-citizens in Australia in 1992, there has been considerable public debate on the wisdom of such policy. The negative impact and long-term implications of indefinite detention on the health of detainees have been raised by medical practitioners and human rights advocates, with more strident argument emerging over the last five to six years. This article contributes to this debate through a methodical review of the Commonwealth Ombudsman's Immigration Reports over the four-year period 2005 through 2009. From such reporting it has been possible to produce a systematic analysis which can be related to and positioned with respect to previously published research evidence. What emerges from this analysis is evidence of the significant parallels between immigration detention and the criminal justice system with regard to the conditions and longer-term mental health implications for those held in the two estates.

AB  - This article deals with the issues linked to refugees in Australia. In the face of the refugee, and in the wake of the Tampa crisis, the Border Protection Act, the Pacific Solution, the immigration prisons, and the Danish laws, people in Australia allegedly face an impasse. Asylum seekers in Australian detention centers are depressed, frustrated, fearful, bewildered, defiant, and proud. The refugees are prisoners not only of barbed wire, armed guards and legislation. In Australia, irony and paradox are now a dangerous form of commonsense. They have been stitched into the fabric of its foreign and defense policy, and its images of nationhood and being. The Tampa crisis could not be allowed to port in Australia sovereignty, despite that sovereignty having been qualified by our signature on the 1951 Refugee Convention and 1967 Protocol, and despite the Australian government's aggressive promotion of open borders to trade and capital. National identity, survival and being in the country is based on exclusion, on repression, on a profound functional cruelty toward the lives of others. The refugee seems to be defined by homelessness, by falling between the cracks, of nations, laws, and the decks of rickety boats

AB  - The steady growth in the use of immigration detention under the UK's New Labour government has been, it is argued here, mirrored by the concurrent development of a new form of labour market within immigration removal centres (IRCs). This market has grown out of the long history of what some label as exploitative employment practices used amongst the wider prison population. It relies upon a subtle form of coercion which ensures compliance and discipline and, in so doing, provides a cheap and easily exploitable pool of labour for private sector companies. The research for this article draws on findings from prison inspection reports and the annual reports of independent monitoring boards

AB  - Although it is only a minority of displaced and persecuted people globally who seek refuge in Western countries, they meet an increasingly hostile reception. This paper discusses children seeking asylum with or without their families in Great Britain and Australia, and the implications for children's rights and social work. The policy background and its racist foundations in both countries are outlined. Despite geopolitical differences, there are unnerving parallels. Legislative changes and policy complexity signal increasingly punitive attitudes towards asylum seekers. The situation of children and families in the community is discussed in terms of the exclusion of asylum seekers from basic rights, and specific issues for separated children. Even more damaging is the incarceration of children and families in detention centers. In both countries there is widespread flouting of children's rights, and children also feature as pawns in ideological contests. However, they also act autonomously and illustrate an inclusive model of citizenship. The role of social workers in the statutory and voluntary sectors is considered, and the paper concludes with a discussion of the challenges for social work of avoiding collusion with repressive policies and actively promoting human rights.

AB  - Drawing upon data from field work in a refugee transit camp in Hong Kong, this article attempts to focus on one phase of the refugee experience often overlooked by refugee research scholars and governments charged with the task of refugee resettlement: the phase between flight from persecution and resettlement. The article examines the relationship between culture shock, conditions of life and culture in refugee transit camps, and the emotional and psychological life of the refugees. Implications of the study's data for refugee resettlement are also formulated.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide a brief review of the history and demographics of the Vietnamese asylum-seeking population in Hong Kong and their possible effects on the initiation of a cervical cytology screening program at a Hong Kong detention center STUDY DESIGN: Analysis of case histories, questionnaires and interviews with women in a detention center identified demographic features related to Pap smear history, knowledge of the Pap test, age at first intercourse and cigarette smoking status among women aged 17 years and over. Analysis of Pap smear uptake following initiation of a screening program was undertaken RESULTS: Of the 1,171 women in the detention center who were eligible for a Pap smear, 536 (45.8%) actually obtained one, although enrollment, which was strong at the initial offering, slowed considerably as the program progressed. None of the women had had a Pap smear prior to leaving Vietnam. Knowledge of the utility and risk status criteria for Pap testing was very limited. The majority (77.9%) of the subjects started sexual activity after age 20 years, and three (0.6%) smoked. There were four (0.2%) abnormal smears identified among those tested CONCLUSION: Convincing evidence was obtained that the Pap test was not widely used in Vietnam among the asylum-seeking population, and its role in preventing cervical cancer was not well known to the women studied. The initial strong uptake of the Pap smear was not maintained. That may be attributable to psychosocial factors associated with detention under harsh conditions and trauma associated with fleeing Vietnam

AB  - This paper sets out to describe how UK legislation governing asylum policy may lead to the marginalisation and mental health distress of asylum seekers. The paper covers 4 areas. First, it starts by briefly setting out the main policy framework, picking out 3 key issues in relation to adult asylum seekers: poverty, dispersal and detention. It explores the mental health implications of each of these and argues that these policies replicate known risk factors in mental ill health. Second, much of the psychiatric literature relating to asylum seekers and refugees draws on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as the key diagnostic category. The paper argues that PTSD has to be problematised and highlights the importance of maintaining a social model of understanding mental distress and developing it further to include insecure immigration status in our models of understanding mental distress. Third, it considers the specific issues facing women asylum seekers and illustrates how an analysis at the intersection of gender, mental distress and asylum is essential. Finally, the paper argues that, to respond more effectively in this complex area of work, interventions at a practitioner, organisational and societal level are required. It concludes by highlighting the key challenges to mental health social work, and suggesting 8 key ways forward

AB  - This paper engages with the critique that mental health social work with asylum seekers requires urgent attention, as current practice is inadequate. Four key issues are discussed in the paper. First, I briefly interrogate key aspects of the UK's current asylum policy: poverty, dispersal and detention. I elaborate on the mental health implications of each of these and argue that these policies replicate known risk factors in mental ill health. Second, much of the psychiatric literature relating to asylum seekers and refugees draws on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as the key diagnostic category. The paper argues that PTSD has to be problematised and highlights the importance of maintaining a social model of understanding mental distress and developing it further to include insecure immigration status in our models of understanding mental distress. Third, I consider the specific issues facing women asylum seekers and illustrate how an analysis at the intersection of gender, mental distress and asylum is essential. Lastly, I argue that, to respond more effectively in this complex area of work, interventions at a practitioner, organisational and societal level are required if the espoused values of social work are to be more than mere rhetoric.

AB  - This chapter examines the effect of trauma on the developing brains of children and young people, including the possible long-term psychological, behavioural, and social consequences later in life and the ways in which intergenerational trauma occurs. The risk factors that exacerbate distress and the protective factors that support recovery and build resilience are identified. This research is then applied specifically to children and young people who are asylum seekers to consider what impact their placement in detention centres may have on them. The chapter considers these findings, given the government's current practice of placing children and young people in high-risk settings. Also outlined are alternative approaches that would be more congruent with contemporary government policies on the protection of children and young people and the strengthening of families and communities.

AB  - In this article, we seek to map out what we know concerning unaccompanied migrant minors, with a focus on unaccompanied migrant children coming to the United States. We base our review on research and reports that document the migration of Mexican and Central American children. In contrast to reports that focus on only the receiving end, we take a broader approach to shedding light on the different facets of the unaccompanied children's migration. Thus, we include the following areas: the migration processes (initiation, transit, arrival, and integration in both Mexico and the United States); the institutions (shelters and detention centers) involved in unaccompanied minors' migration; and the glocal polity (local, national, and international laws) that have a profound impact on this migration.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and associated epidemiological features of Helicobacter pylori infection in child refugees in Western Australia DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional study of 193 eligible African refugee children (aged < 16 years) at their initial health assessment after resettlement in Australia between 1 February and 30 November 2006 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: (i) Prevalence of H. pylori infection determined by monoclonal faecal antigen enzyme immunoassay testing (MFAT); (ii) associations of H. pylori infection with epidemiological factors (age, sex, transit through refugee camps, comorbidities and treatment interventions) RESULTS: MFAT was performed in 182 of the 193 children; 149 of these 182 (82%) had H. pylori infection. Age was an independent predictor of H. pylori infection (odds ratio [OR], 1.18; 95% CI, 1.07-1.31). No sex differences were observed. Premigration antimalarial therapy (with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and artesunate) significantly reduced the prevalence of H. pylori infection (age-adjusted OR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.15-0.75) CONCLUSION: African refugee children have a high prevalence of H. pylori infection. Increasing age is a strong predictor of infection and antimalarial treatment may have a protective effect

AB  - The Children's Society has published research which reveals that children seeking asylum in the UK on their own are subjected to a culture of disbelief and suspicion, which leaves them feeling frightened and confused. This report is based on the views of 33 young people aged 13 to 20 supported by The Children�_Ts Society�_Ts services in Manchester, Birmingham and Oxford. The young people spoken to were at different stages of the asylum process at the time of the consultation and came from a range of countries including Algeria, Afghanistan, Iran, Somalia, Sudan and Syria. All had come to the UK as unaccompanied asylum-seeking children. Most were boys but five of the 33 were girls.� The report calls for the UK Borders Agency to make its asylum process more child-friendly. This includes providing specialist training for immigration interpreters who work with these children, establishing an independent complaint and feedback system to inform all stages of the immigration process that children can easily understand, and addressing the �_~culture of disbelief�_T that prevents children from being treated fairly

Some of the cases are not yet reported, but they are generally available on the court's website. Some of them have received extensive publicity. In all the cases, the applicants had come to Australia illegally and were seeking asylum as refugees. Their applications had been unsuccessful to date, although the state of their litigation varies among the cases--some have appeals pending in the Federal Court, or have applied for special leave to appeal to the High Court. In all cases, as a result of the provision of the Migration Act of 1958, they were liable to be removed from Australia. In one of the cases, the applicant was a mother who was in immigration detention. She had come to Australia on a false passport, and had had a child there. The child was living with the father--not in detention. She sought asylum. The Full Court dismissed her appeal

AB  - The article presents information on the mental health effects of detention on asylum-seeking refugees. According to the research literature on this issue, detention of refugees encompasses most of the factors that may cause increased vulnerability to negative mental health outcomes. These factors include forced separation from one's family, low levels of social support, financial difficulties, lack of access to health and welfare services and difficulties with the refugee visa process. One major problem faced by researchers studying the health of detainees is the limited access to the sample population

AB  - Objectives: To examine the association between brief detention and psychiatric symptom levels among adult asylum seekers. Method: The Harvard Trauma Questionnaire and the Hopkins Symptoms Checklist-25 were used to assess psychiatric symptoms and premigration trauma exposure in 122 detained and 66 nondetained adult asylum seekers in Montreal and Toronto. Results: After a mean detention of 31 days, the proportion of asylum seekers scoring above clinical outpoints was significantly higher in the detained than the nondetained group for posttraumatic stress (X�� = 4.117, df = 1, P = 0.04), depression (X�� = 13.813, df = 1, P < 0.001), and anxiety (X�� = 4.567, df = 1, P = 0.03) symptoms. Hierarchical multiple regression models showed that posttraumatic stress, depression, and anxiety symptom levels were significantly higher among detained asylum seekers than among the nondetained comparison group, taking into account previous trauma and demographics Incremental F was significant for the addition of detention status for all 3 models, indicating that detention contributed to increased symptom levels. Conclusions: For asylum seekers, even brief detention is associated with increased psychiatric symptoms. Governments should consider the many viable alternatives to incarceration of asylum seekers, such as temporary placement in a supervised residential facility, to minimize the risks of psychological harm to this vulnerable population.

AB  - This research aimed to examine the experience of extended periods of immigration detention from the perspective of previously detained asylum seekers and to identify the consequences of these experiences for life after release. The study sample comprised 17 adult refugees (16 male and 1 female; average age 42 years), who had been held in immigration detention funded by the Australian government for on average 3 years and 2 months. They were interviewed on average 3 years and 8 months following their release and had been granted permanent visa status or such status was imminent. The study employed a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods. The qualitative component consisted of semi-structured interviews exploring psychological well-being, daily life, significant events, relationships, and ways of coping throughout these periods. This was supplemented with standardised quantitative measures of current mental health and quality of life. All participants were struggling to rebuild their lives in the years following release from immigration detention, and for the majority the difficulties experienced were pervasive. Participants suffered an ongoing sense of insecurity and injustice, difficulties with relationships, profound changes to view of self and poor mental health. Depression and demoralisation, concentration and memory disturbances, and persistent anxiety were very commonly reported. Standardised measures found high rates of depression, anxiety, PTSD and low quality of life scores. The results strongly suggest that the psychological and interpersonal difficulties participants were suffering were the legacy of their adverse experiences while detained

AB  - The aim of the present research was to examine the experience of extended periods of immigration detention from the perspective of previously detained asylum seekers and to identify the consequences of these experiences for life after release. The study sample comprised seventeen adult refugees (sixteen male and one female; average age 42 years), who had been held in immigration detention funded by the Australian government for on average three years and two months. They were interviewed on average three years and eight months following their release and had been granted permanent visa status or such status was imminent. The study employed a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods to explore detention and post-detention experiences, and mental health some years after release. The qualitative component consisted of semi-structured interviews exploring psychological well-being, daily life, significant events, relationships, and ways of coping throughout these periods. This was supplemented with standardised quantitative measures of current mental health and quality of life. All participants were struggling to rebuild their lives in the years following release from immigration detention, and for the majority the difficulties experienced were pervasive.

The results strongly suggest that the psychological and interpersonal difficulties participants were suffering at the time of interview were the legacy of their adverse experiences while detained. The current study assists in identifying the characteristics of prolonged immigration detention producing long-term psychological harm.

AB  - This study examined the incidence of suicide and self-harm in asylum seekers in the UK, both those in detention and in the community. The investigation revealed that data recording is seriously flawed or sometimes non-existent. However, the scanty data those were available from Immigration Removal Centres, coroners' records and Prison Ombudsman's reports showed high levels of self-harm and suicide for detained asylum seekers as compared with the United Kingdom prison population. It is suggested that this could be attributed to routine failure to observe and mitigate risk factors. The author makes the following recommendations: coroners should record asylum seeker status and ethnicity of deceased, self-harm monitoring in the community should record asylum seeker status and ethnicity, health care in immigration removal centres should meet the same standards as UK prisons as a minimum, allegation of torture by immigration detainees should trigger a case management review and risk assessment for continued detention, and this process should be open to audit, and interpreters should be used for mental state examinations unless their English has been shown to the fluent

AB  - Given the uniquely disempowering context of the refugee camp, and particularly the limitations on young refugees' opportunities for realizing self-determination and self-sufficiency, it cannot be assumed that participatory action research (PAR) is an applicable methodology. This paper analyzes whether a PAR project conducted with youth in a long-term refugee camp in northeastern Kenya contributed to the empowerment of participants. An account of the experiences and outcomes of the PAR project is provided from the perspectives of the visiting facilitator and the youth participants. These accounts demonstrate the important psychological gains and capacity-building that PAR can support, but also reflect the inherent tensions of applying PAR in situations where participants are not expected to gain enough power to significantly change their disempowering circumstances.

AB  - For young people with refugee backgrounds, establishing a sense of belonging to their family and community, and to their country of resettlement is essential for wellbeing. This paper describes the psychosocial factors associated with subjective health and wellbeing outcomes among a cohort of 97 refugee youth aged 11�_"19 during their first 3 years in Melbourne, Australia. The findings are drawn from the Good Starts Study, a longitudinal investigation of settlement and wellbeing among refugee youth conducted between 2004 and 2008. The overall aim of Good Starts was to identify the psychosocial factors that assist youth with refugee backgrounds in making a good start in their new country. A particular focus was on key transitions: from pre-arrival to Australia; from the language school to mainstream school; and from mainstream school to higher education or to the workforce. The results showed that the refugee youth�_Ts experiences of social inclusion or exclusion have a significant impact on subjective wellbeing; the most important predictors being subjective social status in the broader Australian community, perceived discrimination, and bullying. The article argues that settlement specific policies and programmes can ultimately be effective if embedded within a broader socially inclusive society that offers real opportunities for youth with refugee backgrounds to flourish

T1  - Correlates of post-traumatic stress disorder and disorder of extreme stress not otherwise specified among Palestinian child ex-detainees [dissertation]

AB  - The objective of this study is to investigate the variations in the type of trauma (PTSD) and disorder of extreme stress not otherwise specified (DESNOS) resulting first from group membership, and second from variations in socioeconomic status, and last, from exposure to physical and psychological methods of interrogation due to imprisonment. I use a diverse sample of 202 child ex-detainees who served sentences in Israeli prisons and were 17 years of age or less at the time of arrest. Various regression techniques were utilized to determine the most parsimonious way to distinguish between the three groups in their trauma responses. The key finding in this study is that child refugee ex-detainees living in refugee camps, in general, did not report PTSD or DESNOS reactions compared to their counterparts. Continuing PTSD and DESNOS symptoms were more prevalent among the group of refugees living outside the camps. However, there is at least one finding that supported what I hypothesized: refugees living in camps were more likely to experience elevated levels of alterations in attention or consciousness (DESNOS2). For refugees in camps, the DESNOS absence tells us that the volatile childhood these children experienced was not associated with severe pathological reactions or heightened sensitization to trauma. In contrast, refugees living outside camps suffer from alterations in self-perception DESNOS4 symptomology, in addition, to elevated levels of complex trauma DESNOS and they qualified for the DESNOS diagnosis more than the other two groups of children. Refugees living outside camps were the only group subjected to interpersonal stressors. [Author Abstract]

T1  - The High-Stakes Literacies of Undocumented, Unaccompanied Immigrant Youth Detained in America

AB  - Every year, thousands of undocumented, unaccompanied immigrant youth take dangerous journeys to the United States only to be apprehended by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) upon arrival. These youth, who are both involuntary and voluntary immigrants, are then faced with the challenge of having to navigate the complex contexts of the legal and social services systems. While detained, youth begin their family reunification and immigration legal cases. Within this navigation, youth enact unique literacies as well as make use of documents in order to mediate domains of activities within their detention centers. Immigrant youth face many obstacles and challenges while detained in America. The current inquiry focused on the experiences of unaccompanied, undocumented immigrant adolescents (henceforth referred to as youth and/or minors). The current research employed descriptive case study methodology (Yin, 2006) in order to examine the literacy practices and events of minors detained in the World's Children Home (WCH). Within this inquiry, the expectations placed upon youth by the contexts of the WCH were also examined. All findings have been embedded within a contextual analysis, which served to describe the environment of the center, the first 48 hours of detention and a day in the life of an unaccompanied immigrant adolescent detained in America. A variety of sources of data were collected including: WCH staff interviews, observations, student artifacts, and document analyses. The document analyses involved an independent examination of features of the text as well as a Coh-Metrix (McNamara, D.S., Louwerse, M.M., Cai, Z., & Graesser, A., 2005) analysis in order to determine the difficulty levels of texts that mediated literacy events for the adolescents within the center. Findings revealed that all literacy practices and events present within the WCH can be categorized into youth-enacted and system-imposed literacies. Additionally, the literacy activities present in the center and the documents mediated the following domains of activities: Decision-Making, Orientation, Academic and Downtime. The literacy practices, events and documents used to mediate the domain of Decision-Making activities played extremely large roles in the youths' futures. Additionally, minors were observed having to participate in numerous high-stakes meetings with little knowledge of their purpose and inadequate preparation. Moreover, the documents used to mediate domains of activity were written at a level far beyond the ability of detained youth. The significance of these findings bring forth implications that speak to the need to revise documents, create a comprehensible timeline to accompany adolescent immigrants in their navigation of contexts, and provide additional systems of support to increase transition into life upon discharge. This study sought to add knowledge to the fields of education and adolescent literacy research, yet its implications cross additional boundaries and speak to the fields of policy, immigration and social services. The current research challenges scholars within the field to add the literacy needs and experiences of unaccompanied, undocumented immigrant youth to the larger dialogue on immigration, English language learning, and adolescent literacy in the United States. In doing so, the voice of a marginalized population that is growing at a staggering rate can begin to be accounted for and the needs of youth navigating a new land can be further examined

AB  - This study focuses on the economically disadvantaged position of refugees. We use survey data of refugees from Somalia, Iran, Afghanistan, Iraq, and the former Yugoslavia in the Netherlands, to analyze refugees�_T odds of employment and their occupational status. In line with human capital and social capital theory, we find that host country specific education, work experience, language proficiency, and contacts with natives are positively related to the chances of employment and occupational status. The study shows that health problems, integration courses, and the time spent in refugee reception centers form important additional explanations of the economic integration of refugees.

Thousands of these refugees, of Cuban descent, �_olos balseros,�__ (rafters), have battled the turbulent waters of the Florida straits to find a new life for themselves and their children. Many of them were detained at Guantanamo Naval Base until they were permitted to enter the United States. For some, the detention lasted for several months, while others were detained for years.

AB  - One of the biggest issues young people seeking asylum face on arrival in the UK is that they are usually unable to verify their date of birth with official documents. Without information to immediately identify them as children, young people may be incorrectly judged to be an adult on their appearance alone. This report discusses the situation of children detained as part of the asylum process because a decision has been made to treat them as adults. It argues that current policy and practice is not providing adequate protection for a number of young people in the asylum system, and that children are being held in immigration detention after wrongly being judged to be adults. It urges the government to take all necessary steps to ensure that no more children are detained. The report explains how the Refugee Council Children�_Ts Section helps these young people to get out of these harmful situations and includes examples of young people who have been detained and found to be children. The report concludes with recommendations for policy and practice to improve the situation for young people

KW  - eppi-reviewer
AB  - Although criminologists in the US and Europe continue to explore issues of immigration, race, and ethnicity in the context of crime, they have yet to examine the detention of asylum seekers. Still, this is a social phenomenon that requires serious consideration since in many instances such policies and practices violate international standards for the protection of refugees. This work takes a critical look at the detention of persons fleeing persecution by situating it an expanding culture of control stoked by the criminology of the other. The article offers evidence of a steady increase in the reliance on detention of asylum seekers in the US, UK, France, Germany, and Italy. Indications of a conservative shift in criminological thought affecting crime--and asylum--policy are addressed alongside concerns for human rights in a post-September 11 world

AB  - The article explores the abolition of Australia's mandatory refugee detention policy due to mental health issues of refugees. Mental health practitioners faced an ethical dilemma regarding whether to treat refugees in confinement, as they risk making themselves complicit in the system that by its nature causes mental harm. The program was implemented in 2002 amid national security worries. Refugee detention centers need to be established in the spirit of the 1951 UN Refugee Convention

AB  - The objective of the study was to examine differences between asylum seekers, living in asylum seekers' centres, and refugees, who officially have been granted asylum, when they were acutely admitted to a psychiatric hospital. All 53 asylum seekers and 45 refugees, acutely admitted to a Norwegian psychiatric hospital from 1995 to 2001 were included. The number of admissions by coercion, diagnosis, length of hospital stay and years residing in Norway at the time of the admissions were compared between the two groups. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was more frequent among asylum seekers (43.4%) than among refugees (11%), while schizophrenia was more frequent among refugees (62.2%) than among asylum seekers (15%). The refugees (24.4%) were more often admitted by coercion than asylum seekers (11%). The high proportion of PTSD among asylum seekers compared to refugees may be explained by experiences in Norway after arrival into the country. The stresses of life in reception centres and the risk of being expelled from the country may contribute more to these admittances than experiences in the asylum seekers countries of origin

AB  - (from the introduction) This chapter examines the process of acculturation of refugees in camps from a space and time perspective. The study of this phenomenon in camps is important for understanding acculturation in the global context for four main reasons. First, most of the research on this topic describes the experience of refugees in the West, and this chapter documents acculturation in non-Western settings, exploring the role of cultural similarity and distance between country of origin and host country. Second, this chapter examines those refugees who are not expected to settle in the host country and thus is complementary to research on refugees who are settled in the West as discussed in this Handbook by Allen, Vaage and Hauff. Third, individuals and groups experience acculturation when living intermingled among host community members; refugees in camps differ by living in collective settings where interactions with conationals while residing in host countries predominate. Fourth, while traditionally acculturation refers to psychological and cultural change and maintenance in host countries, recent research has studied acculturation beyond exit migration to include return, leading to the examination of re-acculturation (Dona & Berry, 1999). This chapter contributes to the Handbook by adding a new dimension to acculturation research, the phenomenon of return. It places acculturation and re-acculturation in the continuum of exile and return by examining the impact of the acculturation experience in camps on the re-acculturation process.

AB  - Australia deports its asylum seekers to poor neighbouring islands like Nauru in the Pacific. The asylum seekers are kept in detention on these islands, with serious consequences for their mental health and a high incidence of psychiatric disorders. Proper mental health care is virtually impossible under these conditions. Detention is unnecessary and inhumane. The International Organization for Migration, responsible for running these camps, should reconsider its mission as the world's leading organisation for migration issues

AB  - BACKGROUND: As in many European countries, access to care is decreased for undocumented migrants in the Netherlands due to legislation. Studies on the health of undocumented migrants in Europe are scarce and focus on care-seeking migrants. Not much is known on those who do not seek care METHODS: This cross-sectional study includes both respondents who did and did not seek care, namely undocumented migrants who have been incarcerated in a detention centre while awaiting expulsion to their country of origin. A consecutive sample of all new arrivals was studied. Data were collected through structured interviews and reviews of medical records RESULTS: Among the 224 male migrants who arrived at the detention centre between May and July 2008, 173 persons were interviewed. 122 respondents met inclusion criteria. Only half of the undocumented migrants in this study knew how to get access to medical care in the Netherlands if in need. Forty-six percent of respondents reported to have sought medical help during their stay in the Netherlands while having no health insurance (n = 57). Care was sought most frequently for injuries and dental problems. About 25% of these care seekers reported to have been denied care by a health care provider. Asian migrants were significantly less likely to seek care when compared to other ethnic groups, independent from age, chronic health problems and length of stay in the Netherlands CONCLUSION: The study underlines the need for a better education of undocumented patients and providers concerning the opportunities for health care in the Netherlands. Moreover, there is a need to further clarify the reasons for the denial of care to undocumented patients, as well as the barriers to health care as perceived by undocumented migrants

AB  - Objective: This paper argues that the decision by the Australian Commonwealth Government to continue its policy of indefinite mandatory detention, without review, in the face of the accumulated evidence regarding the harmful effects, amounts to state-sponsored trauma and child neglect and/or abuse. Conclusions: The Australian government's policies supporting successful suicide prevention programs stand in contrast to its policy regarding indefinite mandatory detention of on-shore asylum-seekers.

AB  - Objective: This paper argues that the decision by the Australian Commonwealth Government to continue its policy of indefinite mandatory detention, without review, in the face of the accumulated evidence regarding the harmful effects, amounts to state-sponsored trauma and child neglect and/or abuse. Conclusions: The Australian government's policies supporting successful suicide prevention programs stand in contrast to its policy regarding indefinite mandatory detention of on-shore asylum-seekers. Men's and women's rates of suicidal behaviours in Australian immigration detention centres (IDCs), while imprecise, are calculated as 41 and 26 times the national average, respectively, and male IDC rates are 1.8 times the male prison rates. Self-harm in detention reflects a convergence of (child) health, protection and human rights concerns, and is driven by the extremity of detention and the detention environment. Recommendations are made for these concerns to be immediately addressed. It is noted that in handling this unprecedented situation, the government has not sought advice from its own advisory councils.

We review the implications of this for clinicians attempting to assess or work with incarcerated child and adult refugees and asylum seekers. Recent findings: There are increasing numbers of adults and children seeking asylum across the globe and many nations use incarceration and other harsh and interceptive immigration practices. There is mounting evidence of the psychological harm associated with detention of already vulnerable adults and children. Australia is used as a case study. Summary: Clinicians are required to consider the intersection of mental health assessment and treatment with human rights violations, and the impact of restrictive immigration policies, not only on asylum seekers and refugees but also on clinicians, clinical practice and professional ethics.

AB  - In the Netherlands, procedures for obtaining eventual refugee status normally take several years. This long period of uncertainty has been identified as a significant variable in psychological health complaints related to post-migration stress. Drug and alcohol problems were examined in a convenience sample of key figures in asylum seeker communities (N =21) selected from three Dutch Asylum Seeker Centres (AZCs). A qualitative analysis of drug and alcohol use drawn from semi-structured, cross-sectional interviews was conducted to provide a description and explanations of variations in the drug use careers and drug use patterns of asylum seekers. Drug and alcohol use patterns were found to be often a continuation of standards, values and traditions from the country of origin and four types of drug culture emerged: abstinence, opium, khat and alcohol. Although psychological expectations and cultural background differed, our main finding was a hypothetical causal mechanism where use patterns have a similar function across groups as a means of "killing time". "Killing time" involved countering the psychosocial distress of the asylum-seeking process and uncertainties about the future as well as past trauma. Several possible education and policy interventions were identified. We hypothesise post-migration and cultural expectation factors that continue between the country of origin and the host country are more significant than past trauma in accounting for drug and alcohol use patterns in the asylum seeker population.

T1  - Effect of post-migration detention on mental health among Afghan asylum seekers in Japan

AB  - Objectives: Afghan asylum seekers in Japan were increasingly subject to detention following the terrorist attack in New York in September 2001, yet little is reported about the net impact of the detention on their mental health. We examined this by comparing asylum seekers who had once been detained in post-migration and their non-detained counterparts. Method: We conducted a cross-sectional survey in 2002/03 among asylum seekers from Afghanistan who were in the process of refugee application in Japan. We contacted them through their lawyers or non-governmental organizations. Of 73 contacted, 55 agreed to participate. Anxiety and depression were measured using the Hopkins Symptom Checklist 25, and posttraumatic stress disorders (PTSD) and past traumatic experiences were studied with the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire. These mental disorders were scored on a 4-point scale; the average symptom score of 4 indicates the worst mental health status. Results: Respondents reported a mean (SD) of 10 (4.0) pre-migration traumas. Since their arrival in Japan, 18 (33%) had once been detained. Trauma exposures and other characteristics of those detained were not significantly different from those not detained, whereas the symptom scores of anxiety (2.91), depression (2.75) and PTSD (2.90) among those detained were higher than among those not detained (2.30, 2.41, 2.34 respectively). Multiple regression analyses revealed independent adverse effects of post-migration detention, alongside exposure to greater trauma and living alone, and the effects were comparable between these variables. Conclusion: The post-migration detention of Afghan asylum seekers in Japan was independently related to their worsened mental health

They had attempted to flee the island but were intercepted by the U.S. Coast Guard and denied asylum. This was a change in policy and prompted many of the detainees to resort to self-inflicted injuries, as a desperate attempt to necessitate treatment in a hospital on American soil. Several doctors propose policy changes that will avert similar situations in the future

AB  - Examined family functioning and 66 children's (aged 5�_"15 yrs) psychosocial adaptation while they were housed in a Swedish refugee camp after the collapse of Yugoslavia. The children (33 boys and 33 girls) and their parents, mainly mothers, were interviewed. Results show that homesickness had the highest frequencies among the children, followed by depression and somatic symptoms. The average number of symptoms was 2 and was unchanged after arrival. The number of children with no symptoms was about double for girls compared with boys and 2.5 times more common among preschool children than school children. 75% of the children were judged mentally healthy, 20% at risk, and 5% mentally unhealthy. The mother's perception of her own health and well-being was important in understanding the child's health. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Introduction: Torture survivors often present a complex clinical picture with mental and physical symptoms and illness in addition to social incapacities. Torture survivors can be subjected to deprivation of liberty in a variety of situations. Detention might remind the torture survivor of former torture experiences and thus add further to the strain of being detained. Objective: To evaluate and discuss the present knowledge of mental health consequences of detention of torture survivors and to present and discuss practices relating to detention. Aim: To focus attention on existing evidence and problematic practices in relation to this. Methods: Results from key publications within the field will be resumed and discussed and implications outlined. Results: Research on the impact of detention on torture survivors is almost non-existent. A negative impact of detention on mental health of torture survivors can however be deducted mainly from the existing evidence on asylum seekers. Whether screening for torture experiences and following systematic monitoring of mental health are going on worldwide remains obscure, but from a Danish perspective it is likely that torture survivors are not identified. Conclusion: Torture survivors constitute a vulnerable group mentally, physically and socially. A negative impact of detention on mental health can be deducted mainly from studies on asylum seekers. Identification of torture survivors is necessary before decision on detention is taken. Scientific evidence on the subject is missing. Research initiatives and monitoring of practices are necessary.

AB  - "Since 2002, approximately 15,000 migrants have landed on the tiny European island nation of Malta, arriving in the country by boat without permission, or "irregularly." Malta has placed virtually all of these migrants--many of whom are fleeing violence or persecution--in detention. This automated, indiscriminate, and blanket detention policy violates international law at the very border of the European Union. The central Mediterranean migration route--through which migrants from sub-Saharan Africa typically travel from Libya to Malta or to Italy in rickety boats--is a major entrance point to the EU. This report documents the experiences of migrants, including unaccompanied children, who reach Malta by boat, or whose boats are intercepted at sea by the Armed Forces of Malta and taken directly to detention. Under international law migrants who do not have permission to enter or stay in a country may be subject to detention, in certain circumstances, and subject to safeguards. However in Malta, detention is automatic and prolonged, without safeguards. Asylum seekers who arrive by boat are detained for up to 12 months, and migrants who do not apply for asylum (or who are rejected) can be detained for up to 18 months. Even the most vulnerable migrants--such as families with children, elderly people, and people with mental or physical disabilities--are taken to detention. Malta routinely detains unaccompanied migrant children pending age assessment. "Unaccompanied migrant children" are children traveling without parents or other guardians; typically they travel in dangerous conditions for many months before reaching Malta. As the children lack documents proving that they are under 18 years old, Malta detains these children until they have been through a formal age determination procedure. This means children can be detained for months; the average length of time in detention for our interviewees was 3.4 months. During this period, children are detained with unrelated adults without any special provisions for the fact they are minors. Malta should urgently revise their detention policies to detain migrants only in exceptional circumstances in accordance with the law, and should refrain from detaining those requesting age determination until they have been found to be adults."--P.

AB  - (from the chapter) This chapter examines Australia's policies for the early education and care of transnational displaced children and their families. Early childhood services are at the frontline of educating and caring for these children and their families. These services have the potential to improve resilience and to ameliorate the stresses and negative consequences of displacement. This chapter focuses on the important work of early childhood professionals with one group of displaced persons, that is, refugee children in Australia. Most unauthorized-arrival children and families are detained under Australia's mandatory detention laws and are held in secure immigration detention facilities. In view of the global phenomenon of transnational displacement and the potential short- and long-term effects of displacement on children and their families, the Australian community and early childhood educators need to pursue evidence-based policies and practices that may have a positive effect on the health and well-being of these children and families.

The appeals against court decisions by many of the asylum seekers on the programme at Harmondsworth Immigration Removal Centre were left without legal representation. Only 1% of 330 fast-track claimants received a positive initial decision in the first three months of 2006, based on the figures obtained by BID

Mental health practitioners faced an ethical dilemma regarding whether to treat refugees in confinement, as they risk making themselves complicit in the system that by its nature causes mental harm. The program was implemented in 2002 amid national security worries. Refugee detention centers need to be established in the spirit of the 1951 UN Refugee Convention

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the occurrence of and risk factors for depressive disorder in a random sample of 342 Ethiopian immigrants and refugees in Toronto. The Composite International Diagnostic Interview questionnaire was used to measure depression. The results suggested a lifetime prevalence of depression among Ethiopian immigrants and refugees of 9.8%, which was slightly higher than the lifetime prevalence rate in the Ontario population (7.3%). However, the rate among Ethiopian immigrants and refugees was approximately three times higher than the rate estimated for Southern Ethiopia (3.2%). The data confirmed the significance of known risk factors for depression in immigrants, including younger age, experiences of premigration trauma, refugee camp internment, and postmigration stressful events. The implication of the overall finding is that there is a need to develop mental health intervention programs, particularly for people who have experienced premigration trauma, refugee camp internment, and postmigration stresses.

AB  - The creation of a new class of refugees granted Temporary Protection Visas may be indicative of the intent to shift from permanent resettlement of refugees towards a model of provisional safety and eventual repatriation. This new visa category appears to be having a significant impact on the mental health of the refugees. Initial evidence seems to indicate that the experiences of this client group upon arrival in Australia -- that is, being detained in detention centres, restrictions imposed by temporary visa, perceived discrimination by various agencies/services -- exacerbate symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD. The resultant symptom picture could perhaps provide evidence of a more complex form of PTSD. Further research is needed to substantiate the above hypothesis and also assist the Early Health Assessment and Intervention (EHAI) program develop appropriate service delivery models to work more effectively with this client group.

AB  - The study was primarily designed to assess the prevalence of suicidal behaviour among asylum applicants diagnosed as having PTSD and the impact of cultural bias factors (such as religion and nationality) in suicidal dynamics. The traumatic stressors reported in the study included being subjected to or forced to witness war atrocities, imprisonment, torture, sexual violence, other's suicide, and summary or mock executions. The study included 64 PTSD patients who were examined as part of a diagnostic and suicidal risk assessment after referral. Suicide risk assessments were assisted with scores of the SAD PERSONS Scale. Most PTSD patients reported suicidal behaviour. Nearly half of the refugees with PTSD diagnoses had a history of suicide attempts. Religious proscription or nationality was not found to be a significant deterrent of suicidal behaviour, and no differences between the various religious groups were established on this point. Another note-worthy finding in the present study was that suicidal behaviour did not differ significantly between asylum applicants and refugees granted residence permits. Thus, the notion that asylum applicants might manifest a higher frequency of suicial behaviour, possibly due to the threat of imminent expulsion from the country, derived no support from our findings. The results ratified our previous findings, which suggested that suicidal behaviour is more closely related to PTSD trauma diathesis and clinical features than to cultural bias. [Author Abstract]

AB  - The article discusses the effect of immigration detention on the physical and mental health of children. Child detainees are children of asylum seekers, over staying foreigners and undocumented migrants. It is noted that the detention is traumatic for children due to poor nutrition and medical care and that they experienced severe mental problems even after they are returned to their families. Measures and good practice standards to safeguard the well being of detained children are proposed

AB  - Unaccompanied immigrant minors arrested on French borders are today detained in airport waiting zones, then brought before a freedom and detention judge who rules on whether they are to be maintained in detention or released. Combining observations of hearings and interviews with actors implicated in them, this research study focuses on the emotional and moral order in which these proceedings unfold ; namely the tension between two conflicting images of minors : as vulnerable and in need of protection ; as illegal migrants who should be sanctioned. Hearing deliberations are characterized by an emphasis on compassion where the general understanding is that these young defendants should be shown consideration. However, the study also shows how the values and moral assessments deriving from this empathic approach operate in practice : under some circumstances, an apparently repressive measure may be taken because it protects minors. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Los menores extranjeros aislados detenidos actualmente en las fronteras francesas son encarcelados en los espacios de las zonas de esp��ra para personas en instancia en los aeropuertos, pero ellos comparecen de inmediato ante el juez de libertades y de la d��tention, ��l es quien d��cide de su mantenimiento en d��tention o de su lib��ration sobre el territorio. Combinando las observaciones de las audiencias y las entrevistas realizadas con los protagonistas, esta contribution describe el orden emocional y moral en torno al cual se organizan localmente estas comparaciones. Atravesadas por una tension entre dos representaciones de los menores (vuln��rables y a prot��ger, o emigrantes irregulares a reprimir) se caracterizan primero por el � anclage compasional �� en los debates suponiendo un acuerdo g��nerai sobre las consideraciones a testimoniar a los j��venes justiciables. Aunque la encuesta pone igualmente en evidencia la circulation de los valores y las calificaciones morales que ese anclage autoriza- una medida aparentemente represiva pudiendo ser as�� parad��jicamente valorizada como una medida de protection en ciertas circunstancias. (Spanish) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Les mineurs ��trangers isol��s arr��t��s aux fronti��res fran��aises sont aujourd'hui enferm��s dans les Zones d'attente pour personnes en instance des espaces a��roportuaires, mais ils comparaissent ensuite devant un Juge des libert��s et de la d��tention qui d��cide de leur maintien ou de leur lib��ration sur le territoire. En combinant des observations d'audiences et des entretiens r��alis��s avec leurs acteurs, cette contribution d��crit l'ordre ��motionnel et moral autour duquel s'organisent localement ces comparutions. Travers��es par une tension entre deux repr��sentations des mineurs (vuln��rables et �� prot��ger, ou migrants irr��guliers �� r��primer), elles se caract��risent tout d'abord par � l'ancrage compassionnel �� des d��bats, supposant un accord g��n��ral sur les ��gards �� t��moigner aux jeunes justiciables. Mais l'enqu��te met ��galement en ��vidence la circulation des valeurs et des qualifications morales que cet ancrage autorise - une mesure apparemment r��pressive pouvant ainsi ��tre paradoxalement valoris��e comme une mesure de protection dans certaines circonstances. (French) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Die einzelnen ausl��ndischen, an den franz��sischen Grenzen festgenommenen Minderj��hrigen werden heutzutage in Wartebereichen der Flugh��fen eingeschlossen. Sie werden anschlie�Yend einem Juge des libertes et de la detention [Richter f��r Freiheit und Haft] vorgef��hrt, der entscheidet, ob sie in Haft bleiben oder auf franz��sischem Boden frei sind. Gest��tzt auf zusammengestellte Beobachtungen bei Gerichtssitzungen und Gespr��chen mit Gerichtsaktoren beschreibt dieser Aufsatz die emotionelle und moralische Ordnung, unter der die ��rtlichen Gerichtsvorladungen ablaufen. Diese Verfahren unterliegen Spannungen zwischen zwei Vorstellungen zu Minderj��hrigen (wehrlos mit Anspruch auf Schutz oder rechtswidriger Migrant mit Ausweisungsberechtigung) und zeichnen sich zun��chst durch eine �Mitleidseinstellung�� in den Debatten aus, in denen ein allgemeines Einvernehmen zur R��cksicht f��r den jungen Rechts��bertreter herrscht. Unsere Untersuchung zeigt jedoch ebenfalls Werte und moralische Einstellungen, die eine solche Einstellung rechtfertigen, d.h. eine offensichtliche repressive Ma�Ynahme kann somit paradoxerweise als Schutzma�Ynahme unter bestimmten Umst��nden gewertet werden.

AB  - This document comprises a report on the status and needs of undocumented minor aliens detained by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and proposes a national policy regarding their care and treatment. Information was gathered from 26 site visits in the following states: (1) Arizona; (2) California; (3) Florida; (4) Nevada; (5) Texas; and (6) Washington, D.C. The following issues are discussed: (1) patterns of apprehension; (2) staging facilities; (3) regulations on advisement of rights, voluntary departure, and exclusion/deportation hearings; (4) circumstances of detention; (5) types, conditions, and services of facilities; (6) release policies; (7) legal issues and problems of applying for political asylum; and (8) roles of child welfare agencies. The following recommendations are suggested for inclusion in a national policy: (1) release from custody as soon as possible; (2) assign responsibility for release to local child welfare service providers; (3) locate parents and arrange for family reunification; (4) facilitate voluntary departure of minors who live away from the United States border; (5) develop alternatives to the use of secure detention facilities; (6) require facilities to meet the licensing provisions of state child welfare and/or youth service agencies; (7) ensure adequate legal counsel; (8) designate INS staff to coordinate policy development and implementation; (9) appoint a private-sector ombudsman to monitor the circumstances of detainees; and (10) collect statistical data on the age and sex of apprehended and detained minors, asylum requests, and disposition of cases. One table of statistical data and a chart illustrating the sequence of events in immigration proceedings are included. A list of site visits and INS procedures for handling minors are appended.

N1  - Date revised - 2013-06-12 SuppNotes - Though changes in refugee and asylum politics in the North/Western world have attracted substantial academic attention in the 1990s, comparatively little analytical work has been done on the implications and effects these legal and political changes have had on individual refugees. This paper begins to fill this void by comparing the socioeconomic problems of Bosnian and Herzegovinian refugees, particularly women, experienced in Austria and the USA. It explores the underlying rationale of the states' individual welfare provisions and the structural arrangement of settlement support schemes primarily responsible for determining refugees' eligibility for benefits. Though the two countries' refugee relief schemes, the Austrian Bund-L+�nder Aktion and the American public-private partnership of refugee resettlement were significantly different (the former prohibited legal employment, the latter promoted early economic self-sufficiency) Bosnian refugees paradoxically adapted economically quite similarly in both countries. Individual initiative was found to have a much stronger impact than state policy Last updated - 2013-09-16 SubjectsTermNotLitGenreText - 8040; 6230 6232 8037 559 3087 3105 3198; 10695; 6235 11888 10472 9874 5574; 13521; 13529 13527 11888 10472 2793 2803 3874 556 3977 5574; 13598 5421 6091; 1357 11229; 60 394 129; 36 87 129; 433 293 14

T1  - From Refugee Camp to Solitary Confinement: illiterate adults learn Swedish as a second language
JF  - Scandinavian Journal of Educational Research

KW  - eppi-reviewer
AB  - This is a study, based upon 22 interviews, of the factors that govern immigrants' acquisition of a second language. Half of the interviewees are illiterate quota refugees from a Kurdish refugee camp and the other half are immigrants with at least six years of school education. The interpretation framework consists of theories of language and language learning with the emphasis on the acquisition of literacy and theories of motivation. The interviewees from the refugee camp have lived under very difficult conditions. It has been difficult to meet their basic needs. The social needs cannot be provided in Sweden because the refugees become isolated, without any contact with Swedes. They lack the contact with speakers of the target language that is necessary for them to acquire the language. The lack of integration into Swedish society leads to their marginalisation. The pedagogic conclusions that can be drawn from this study relate mainly to measures for increasing motivation. In this respect the most important measure is to achieve greater contact with target language speakers

AB  - This article analyses provision of health and social care for pregnant women and new families who have been unsuccessful in their asylum claims in the United Kingdom. It identifies the contribution of maternity care to child health, and examines the implications of the legislation that excludes 'failed' asylum seekers from free NHS secondary health care and denies them housing and financial support. Finally, the article examines the impact on pregnant women and their babies of being held in removal (detention) centres.

AB  - The objective of this study was to generate a deeper understanding of the influence of pre- and post-migration traumatic experiences on refugees�_T psychological distress, including historical, political and social factors. This dissertation used a multi-method design to examine the impact of trauma on the psychological well-being of refugees. Further, the design included a qualitative component to provide a contextual framework for understanding refugee psychological distress that is not limited to an analysis of a disease model alone but by also making connections to important historical, social and political events. Post-Colonial, Refugee, Trauma and Feminist theories are used as analytic lenses to explain the social structures and events contributing to refugees�_T pre- and post-migration traumatic events, and psychological distress. This was an international study that spanned two continents. Sampling included 50 Sri Lankan Tamil refugee participants who lived in Chennai, India and 50 Sri Lankan refugees in Toronto, Canada. Inclusion criteria included a residency period of the last 12 months in either of the sampling sites, and participants 18 years of age or older. Participants from Toronto were recruited through social service agencies and associations, and participants from Chennai were recruited from refugee camps, and the Organization for Elam Refugee Rehabilitation. Tamil versions of the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire, the Post-Migration Living Difficulties Questionnaire, and the Symptoms Check List - 90R were utilized to measure participants�_T pre- and post-migration traumatic events and psychological distress. The Harvard Trauma Questionnaire contained qualitative open-ended questions to triangulate the quantitative data in identifying and exploring the impact of contextual influences. Results showed that post-migration traumatic event scores positively predicted psychological distress, and refugee claimants living in Canada had the highest scores on pre-migration and postmigration scores. The qualitative analysis revealed themes related to civil war and resettlement as significant issues. Implications of these findings support the development and incorporation of a multi-level approach within social work practice which emphasizes contextual issues, focuses on individuals, and promotes social advocacy. The advocacy role of social workers suggests that better integration of micro and macro systems should be aimed for more consistently since internal and external factors interact to effect psychological functioning. Recommendations for future research point to conducting longitudinal studies to assess the cumulative effects of historical, social and political factors on refugees and identify resiliencies that mobilize their capacity to survive.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This article discusses the design of a study on the prevalence of health problems (both physical and mental) and the utilisation of health care services among asylum seekers and refugees in the Netherlands, including factors that may be related to their health and their utilisation of these services METHODS/DESIGN: The study will include random samples of adult asylum seekers and refugees from Afghanistan, Iran and Somali (total planned sample of 600), as these are among the largest groups within the reception centres and municipalities in the Netherlands. The questionnaire that will be used will include questions on physical health (chronic and acute diseases and somatization), mental health (Hopkins Symptoms Checklist-25 and Harvard Trauma Questionnaire), utilisation of health care services, pre- and post-migratory traumatic experiences, life-style, acculturation, social support and socio-demographic background. The questionnaire has gone through a translation process (translation and back-translation, several checks and a pilot-study) and cross-cultural adaptation. Respondents will be interviewed by bilingual and bicultural interviewers who will be specifically trained for this purpose. This article discusses the selection of the study population, the chosen outcome measures, the translation and cross-cultural adaptation of the measurement instrument, the training of the interviewers and the practical execution of the study. The information provided may be useful for other researchers in this relatively new field of epidemiological research among various groups of asylum seekers and refugees

AB  - Background: Although asylum seekers have been coming to The Netherlands since the 1980s, very few epidemiological studies have focused on this group of inhabitants, or on the refugees who have resettled in this country. The objective of this study is to estimate the use of health care services by refugees and asylum seekers and to identify determinants for this utilisation. Methods: A population-based study was conducted in The Netherlands from June 2003 to April 2004 among adult refugees and asylum seekers from Afghanistan, Iran, and Somalia. A total of 178 refugees and 232 asylum seekers, living in 3 municipalities and 14 reception centres, participated. Results: This study showed that there are no differences between refugees and asylum seekers in the self-reported use of health care services. Respondents from Somalia reported less contacts with a general practitioner, less use of mental health services, and less medication use than respondents from Afghanistan and Iran. Both female gender and older age were related to more contacts with a general practitioner and a medical specialist, and with higher medication use. Poor general health was related to more contacts with a medical specialist and mental health services, and with higher medication use. Conclusion: Asylum seekers and refugees seem to have equal access to the Dutch health care system in general. However, there are differences in the self-reported use of health care services by the different ethnic groups. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB  - Context: Worldwide, the number of refugees and asylum seekers is estimated to be about 11.5 million plus a much larger number of former refugees who have obtained a residence permit in a new country. Although asylum seekers have been coming to the Netherlands since the 1980s, very few epidemiological studies have focused on this group of inhabitants or on the refugees who have resettled in this country. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to estimate the prevalence rates of physical and mental health problems and to identify the risk factors for these complaints. Design, Setting, and Participants: A population-based study was conducted in the Netherlands from June 2003 to April 2004 among adult refugees and asylum seekers from Afghanistan, Iran and Somalia. Asylum seekers were living in 14 randomly selected reception centres, and random samples of refugees were obtained from the population registers of three municipalities (Arnhem, Leiden and Zaanstad). A total of 178 refugees and 232 asylum seekers participated (response rates of 59 and 89%, respectively). Main Outcome Measures: General health and physical health were measured with the Short-Form 36 and a list of 19 chronic conditions, respectively; symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and anxiety, were measured with the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire and the Hopkins Symptoms Checklist-25. Results: More asylum seekers (59.1%) than refugees (42.0%) considered their health to be poor (P = 0.001). In both groups, approximately half of the respondents suffered from more than one chronic condition. More asylum seekers than refugees had symptoms of PTSD (28.1 and 10.6%, respectively; P = 0.000) and depression/anxiety (68.1 and 39.4, respectively; P = 0.000). Respondents from Afghanistan and, in particular, from Iran had a higher risk for PTSD and depression/anxiety. Female gender was associated with chronic conditions, PTSD and depression/anxiety, and higher age was associated with poor general health and chronic conditions. A greater number of traumatic events was associated with all health outcomes, and more post-migration stress and less social support were associated with PTSD and depression/anxiety symptoms. Conclusions: Both physical and mental health problems are highly prevalent among refugees and asylum seekers in the Netherlands. Although higher prevalence rates for most health outcomes were found among asylum seekers, both the specific health services for asylum seekers and the general health services in the municipalities should be aware of these problems.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence rates of mental and physical health problems and the use of healthcare services among adult asylum seekers and recognised refugees from Afghanistan, Iran and Somalia in the Netherlands DESIGN: Cross-sectional study METHOD: Asylum seekers were approached in 14 reception centres and refugees were interviewed in 3 municipalities (Arnhem, Leiden and Zaanstad). Respondents were interviewed in their own language and asked questions pertaining to: general health, chronic complaints, symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), symptoms of depression/ anxiety, the use of healthcare services (general practitioner, medical specialists, hospitalisation, mental-health services, medication) and background variables RESULTS: A total of 232 asylum seekers and 178 refugees participated (response rates of89% and 59%, respectively). Of these, 142 (61%) and 99 (56%), respectively were males and the average age was 34.4 (SD: 11.o) and 40.3 (SD: 13.3) years, respectively. Compared to refugees, asylum seekers more often considered their health to be poor (42% and 59%, respectively), had more symptoms of depression/anxiety (39% and 68%, respectively), and had more symptoms of PTSD (11% and 28%, respectively). No differences were found between refugees and asylum seekers in the self-reported use of healthcare services CONCLUSION: This study showed that asylum seekers have more health problems than refugees, but that there are no differences in the self-reported use of healthcare services. More research is needed to answer the question ifasylum seekers have sufficient access to the healthcare system

AB  - This paper explores the ways in which mobility can have governmental effects in the context of the management of asylum seekers awaiting deportation from the UK. Drawing upon the case of Campsfield House Immigration Removal Centre, a facility for the incarceration of immigration deportees near Oxford, the paper makes the case that the way asylum seekers are moved between detention centres within the UK has implications for the way they are represented to both asylum activists and asylum sector employees, causing them to choose to use their influence differently by with-holding the support that they might otherwise provide. The constant moving and repositioning of asylum seekers means that they are depicted as transitory, fleeting and depersonalised to those actors with the greatest degree of influence over them. The subjection not only of asylum seekers through forceful, blunt forms of power, but also of more powerful asylum sector actors through subtler, governmental techniques, has significant material implications for the incarcerated asylum seeking community that populates Britain's detention estate.

AB  - Serious limitations exist in the delivery of mental health services to refugees throughout the resettlement process. Having survived harrowing physical and psychological traumas prior to reaching refugee camps, many refugees encounter mental health services in overseas camps that are characterized by fragmentation, instability, language barriers, and severe staff shortages. Refugees requiring mental health intervention after resettlement in the United States confront additional barriers, including frequent misdiagnosis, inappropriate use of interpreters and paraprofessionals, and culturally inappropriate treatment methods. Suggestions for improving mental health services for refugee populations emphasize modifying diagnostic assumptions and treatment approaches, recognizing potential problems associated with using interpreters and paraprofessionals, and examining the role of consultation, prevention, and outreach services in addressing refugee mental health concerns.

AB  - Interviewed 32 Chilean refugees (aged 20�_"55 yrs) on the effects of detention and torture and subsequent exile in the US. Exile for this group may constitute a continuation rather than a cessation of their suffering. Marital problems, economic hardship, and loneliness are recounted by the adults, while teachers and parents report adjustment and behavioral difficulties among the children. Two findings are unique to the Ss: a continued sense of persecution in exile and the absence of a mutual support system among the refugees.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several suicide and suicidal behaviour risk factors are highly prevalent in asylum seekers, but there is little insight into the suicide death rate and the suicidal behaviour incidence in this population. The main objective of this study is to assess the burden of suicide and hospital-treated non-fatal suicidal behaviour in asylum seekers in the Netherlands and to identify factors that could guide prevention METHODS: We obtained data on cases of suicide and suicidal behaviour from all asylum seeker reception centres in the Netherlands (period 2002-2007, age 15+). The suicide death rates in this population and in subgroups by sex, age and region of origin were compared with the rate in the Dutch population; the rates of hospital-treated suicidal behaviour were compared with that in the population of The Hague using indirect age group standardization RESULTS: The study included 35 suicide deaths and 290 cases of hospital-treated suicidal behaviour. The suicide death rate and the incidence of hospital-treated suicidal behaviour differed between subgroups by sex and region of origin. For male asylum seekers, the suicide death rate was higher than that of the Dutch population (N = 32; RR = 2.0, 95%CI 1.37-2.83). No difference was found between suicide mortality in female asylum seekers and in the female general population of the Netherlands (N = 3; RR = 0.73; 95%CI 0.15-2.07). The incidence of hospital-treated suicidal behaviour was high in comparison with the population of The Hague for males and females from Europe and the Middle East/South West Asia, and low for males and females from Africa. Health professionals knew about mental health problems prior to the suicidal behaviour for 80% of the hospital-treated suicidal behaviour cases in asylum seekers CONCLUSIONS: In this study the suicide death rate was higher in male asylum seekers than in males in the reference population. The incidence of hospital-treated suicidal behaviour was higher in several subgroups of asylum seekers than that in the reference population. We conclude that measures to prevent suicide and suicidal behaviour among asylum seekers in the Netherlands are indicated

AB  - Background: Though slowly growing, knowledge about prisoners detained for having violated an Alien Act is still marginal and most studies involve detained asylum seekers in the USA and Australia. Little is known about prevalence rates of mental health disorders in such a population. The Brief Jail Mental Health Screening BJMHS has been demonstrated in other prison populations as a valid screening for serious mental illness. Aim: The aims of this study were to describe prevalence rates for mental disorders according to ICD-10 and to validate the BJMHS for this population. Methods: 80 inmates at a detention center for prisoners having violated the Swiss Aliens Act were surveyed using the BJMHS at their admission. The results were cross validated with the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Results: When omitting disorders caused by smoking tobacco, 76% of the prisoners suffered from at least one mental disorder according to CIDI. Whereas the rates for disorders due to psychoactive substance use as well as schizophrenic and affective disorders were comparable with other prison populations, we found a specific increased reporting of phobic (14%) and post-traumatic stress disorders (23%). Discussion: As in other prison populations prevalence rates for mental disorders were markedly above the general population. The specific pattern with high rates of phobic as well as post-traumatic stress disorders may reflect the very often traumatic backgrounds of this population. Whereas the results for the validation of the BJMHS were even better than in other similar studies and the instrument proved to be practicable and helpful to detect serious mental illness, sensitivity for a screening tool of around 80% is still too low. Additionally the fact that other serious mental disorders are not covered emphasizes the importance of other elements in the screening process, including the need to have well-trained staff, and to have a low threshold for psychiatric examination.

AB  - Report of a short inquiry into the detention of children in the UK immigration system.�It investigated why children were detained, how long they were detained for and the conditions at Yarl�_Ts Wood Immigration Removal Centre. Among the recommendations are: Government statistics should be more informative and local authorities should play a greater role in this; detention of children for indeterminate periods must be avoided; UKBA (UK Border Agency)�should consider the use of electronic tags, reporting requirements and residence restrictions (while reserving the right to detain); UKBA should adopt the principle that the detention of young children must only ever be used as a last resort

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the health status of people in Australian immigration detention centres and the effect of time in, and reason for, detention DESIGN, SETTING AND SUBJECTS: An analysis of the health records of 720 of the 7375 people in detention in the financial year 1 July 2005-30 June 2006, with oversampling of those detained for > 3 months MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Health encounters and health condition categories; estimated incidence rates of new health conditions, new mental health conditions, and new injuries for each cohort (defined by time in, and reason for, detention) RESULTS: People in detention had an estimated 1.2 (95% CI, 1.18-1.27) health encounters per person-week. Those detained for > 24 months had particularly poor health, both mental and physical. Asylum seekers had more health problems than other people in detention. The main health problems varied depending on the length of time in detention, but included dental, mental health, and musculoskeletal problems, and lacerations. Both time in, and reason for, detention were significantly related to the rate of new mental health problems (P = 0.018 and P < 0.001, respectively). The relationship between these variables and the incidence rates of physical health problems was more complex CONCLUSION: People in immigration detention are frequent users of health services, and there is a clear association between time in detention and rates of mental illness. Government policies internationally should be informed by evidence from studies of the health of this marginalised and often traumatised group

AB  - Assessed differences in the development of depression and hopelessness between groups of displaced and nondisplaced children. The study included 198 children divided into 2 groups. Group 1 included 112 children who had been exiled from their homes (the eastern part of Slavonia and Baranya) in the beginning of war and lived in refugee camps near Osijek, Croatia. The children had been living in the camp for 4 yrs at the time of the investigation. Group 2 comprised 86 nondisplaced children from Zagreb. All study children completed Croatian versions of the Child Depression Inventory and Hopelessness Scale for Children. Analysis of the results show a statistically significant between-group difference according to the level of depression and hopelessness. There was a significantly higher level of depression and hopelessness in Group 1. These results suggest the need for longitudinal studies related to the effects of war trauma and displacement on psychosocial adaptability of traumatized children.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The length of stay in asylum centres is generally mentioned as a possible health risk to asylum seekers. Medical staff working with asylum seekers has claimed that long lengths of stay in asylum centres might cause or aggravate mental disorders. We used records from a large, multiethnic group of asylum seekers to study if the incidence of mental disorders increased with length of stay METHODS: The study population was asylum seekers in Danish asylum centres run by the Danish Red Cross. General medical care was provided by Red Cross staff who could refer selected cases to medical specialists. If an asylum seeker needed more than three specialist consultations for mental illness or five consultations for physical illness the referrals had to be approved by The Danish Immigration Service. Between July 2001 - December 2002 the Red Cross prospectively registered health related data on all new applications (n = 4516) to the Immigration Service regarding referrals to medical specialists. We used these records to analyse the association between length of stay in the asylum centres and overall rate of referral for mental disorders. Data was analysed using weighted linear regression RESULTS: We found that referrals for mental disorders increased with length of stay in asylum centres in a large, multiethnic population of asylum seekers. The association was found in all the categories of psychiatric illness studied and for a majority of the nationality groups studied CONCLUSION: Length of stay in asylum centres was associated with an increase in referrals for mental disorders in a large, multiethnic group of asylum seekers. The present study supports the view that prolonged length of stay in an asylum centre is a risk factor for mental health. The risk of psychiatric illness among asylum seekers should be addressed by political and humanitarian means, giving prevention of illness the highest priority

AB  - Discusses the efforts made to meet the mental health needs of Vietnamese children and their families in a large US refugee camp. Many of the children received strong emotional support from the multigenerational Vietnamese families, and they adapted well to the new environment. However, children separated from their families demonstrated increased emotional vulnerability, and foster placement of children without families presented a serious problem. It is suggested that Americans' national commitment to these refugees may have ended when they (the refugees) left the confines of the refugee camp.

AB  - European Union policy is to restrict the entry into the EU of asylum seekers. This has resulted in the detention of many thousands of asylum seekers including children and adolescents in prison-like environments. The available evidence suggests this practice is associated with high levels of psychological distress, anxiety, affective and posttraumatic stress disorder, and deliberate self-harm. Significant numbers of detained asylum seekers are released and some would benefit from contact with child mental health professionals. It is suggested that in keeping with EU policy aims alternatives to detention should be sought. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB  - Examined anxiety symptoms, affective disturbances, somatic complaints, and social impairment in 35 refugee Tibetan nuns and lay students (mean age 25.8 yrs) who were arrested and tortured in Tibet and 35 nontortured matched controls (mean age 25.1 yrs). The prevalence of symptom scores in the clinical range for both cohorts was 41.4% for anxiety symptoms and 14.3% for depressive symptoms. The torture survivors had a statistically significant higher proportion of elevated anxiety scores than did the nontortured cohort. This was not true for elevated depressive scores. Results suggest that torture has long-term consequences on mental health over and above the effects of being uprooted, fleeing one's country, and living in exile as a refugee, though the additional effects were small. Political commitment, social support in exile, and prior knowledge of and preparedness for confinement and torture in the imprisoned cohort served to foster resilience against psychological sequelae. The contribution of Buddhist spirituality plays an active role in the development of protective coping mechanisms among Tibetan refugees. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This article seeks to analyze recent findings of mental illness of children in detention centers in the context of Australia's human rights obligations under the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child (the CROC). This article discusses the Australian immigration legislation and the principles under the CROC and then examines the extent to which Australia is adhering to its human rights obligations in regard to these children.' It suggests that further harm is being inflicted on the children, and questions whether this situation is in the long-term interest of the Australian people, as the majority of asylum seekers including children will be granted refugee status and released into the community. The arguments put forward in this article are substantiated further by the findings of the recently released report of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC) Inquiry titled A Last Resort? The article argues that the detention of children is a method that contravenes human rights norms and that Australia's system should not be emulated by other nations seeking a solution to refugee issues. In the light of the findings of this article, and the recommendations of the HREOC Report, Australia's experience should stand as an example to the international community of how not to deal with children in the immigration process.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: International studies have shown high incidences of symptoms regarding anxiety, depression, and PTSD among asylum seekers of different ethnicities. The aim of the present study was to investigate the presence of symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD among rejected Iraqi asylum seekers in two Danish Red Cross asylum centers. Factors such as the length of stay in an asylum center and the number of traumatic events were considered as risk factors associated with the degree of psychological morbidity. METHOD: In 2007, 53 rejected Iraqi asylum seekers from two Danish Red Cross centers completed a survey based on the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire-IV (HTQ) and the Hopkins Symptom Checklist 25 (HSCL-25). The response rate was 36%. The analyses focused on the impact of gender, age, marriage, religion, the length of stay at the asylum center, and the number of traumatic events on the severity of symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD. FINDINGS: Of all participants, 94% were found to have symptoms of anxiety, 100% had symptoms of depression, and 77% had symptoms of PTSD. The participants had experienced or witnessed an average of 8.5 traumatic events before their arrival in Denmark. There was no significant association between the number of traumatic events, and the symptoms of PTSD. In addition, there was no significant difference in the length of stay and symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD despite the fact that 79% of the participants had stayed in an asylum center for 5-10 years or more. CONCLUSION: Despite the limitations of the data, such as the small sample, this study showed that the prevalence rates of psychopathology in Iraqi asylum seekers in Denmark were alarmingly high. Therefore, it is recommended that systematic screening of all detained asylum seekers in Denmark is introduced. Given the degree of mental health problems it is also recommended that procedures be changed and that treatment should be offered to asylum seekers who are detained in Danish asylum centers.

AB  - Objectives: Afghan asylum seekers in Japan were increasingly subject to detention following the terrorist attack in New York in September 2001, yet little is reported about the net impact of the detention on their mental health. We examined this by comparing asylum seekers who had once been detained in post-migration and their non-detained counterparts. Method: We conducted a cross-sectional survey in 2002/03 among asylum seekers from Afghanistan who were in the process of refugee application in Japan. We contacted them through their lawyers or non-governmental organizations. Of 73 contacted, 55 agreed to participate. Anxiety and depression were measured using the Hopkins Symptom Checklist 25, and posttraumatic stress disorders (PTSD) and past traumatic experiences were studied with the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire. These mental disorders were scored on a 4-point scale; the average symptom score of 4 indicates the worst mental health status. Results: Respondents reported a mean (SD) of 10 (4.0) pre-migration traumas. Since their arrival in Japan, 18 (33%) had once been detained. Trauma exposures and other characteristics of those detained were not significantly different from those not detained, whereas the symptom scores of anxiety (2.91), depression (2.75) and PTSD (2.90) among those detained were higher than among those not detained (2.30, 2.41, 2.34 respectively). Multiple regression analyses revealed independent adverse effects of post-migration detention, alongside exposure to greater trauma and living alone, and the effects were comparable between these variables. Conclusion: The post-migration detention of Afghan asylum seekers in Japan was independently related to their worsened mental health.

AB  - The article addresses the treatment of asylum seekers at the immigration detention centre in Bulgaria. In the country, the time between submission of an asylum application and its registration has no limitation, resulting in tremendous hardship for asylum seekers as many are obliged to remain indefinitely in detention without legal recourse while awaiting registration. Also, the large margin of discretion given to state officials regarding the time to register an asylum application has resulted in corruption

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The legacy of post-communist Bulgaria has many aspects with respect to torture. On the one hand, the communist regime conducted political repression and torture; on the other, speaking publicly about torture and other human rights violations was taboo. As a result, the law enforcement agencies inherited to some extent an attitude of unlawful application of force, and the society remained less sensitive to certain human rights violations and/or more inclined to react with denial. This article represents part of the assessment studies carried out by members of the Assistance Center for Torture Survivors (ACET) before its opening for the reception of torture victims. METHODS: We studied two groups: 105 prison inmates and 49 asylum seekers. For the purposes of the study we adapted the Self Reporting Questionnaire of Dr. Federico Allodi, Canada, including mainly parts A, B, and G of the original questionnaire. RESULTS: Torture during their contact with some of the law enforcement agencies was reported by 72% of the prison inmates. More than half of them declared that they needed medical care, legal advice, or counselling on the consequences of traumatic experiences. Among the asylum seekers 90% reported having suffered torture or other forms of inhuman or degrading treatment. Their declared needs for rehabilitation appeared to be similar to those of the previous group. CONCLUSION: We did not intend to compare the two groups. The study showed the need of both groups for rehabilitation of some torture-related conditions. Preventive efforts by the staff of the law enforcement agencies should also be considered.

AB  - The objective of the study was to examine differences between asylum seekers, living in asylum seekers' centres, and refugees, who officially have been granted asylum, when they were acutely admitted to a psychiatric hospital. All 53 asylum seekers and 45 refugees, acutely admitted to a Norwegian psychiatric hospital from 1995 to 2001 were included. The number of admissions by coercion, diagnosis, length of hospital stay and years residing in Norway at the time of the admissions were compared between the two groups. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was more frequent among asylum seekers (43.4%) than among refugees (11%), while schizophrenia was more frequent among refugees (62.2%) than among asylum seekers (15%). The refugees (24.4%) were more often admitted by coercion than asylum seekers (11%). The high proportion of PTSD among asylum seekers compared to refugees may be explained by experiences in Norway after arrival into the country. The stresses of life in reception centres and the risk of being expelled from the country may contribute more to these admittances than experiences in the asylum seekers countries of origin.

AB  - Background: Human rights violations have adverse consequences for health. However, to date, there remains little empirical evidence documenting this association, beyond the obvious physical and psychological effects of torture. The primary aim of this study was to investigate whether Australian asylum policies and practices, which arguably violate human rights, are associated with adverse health outcomes. Methods: We designed a mixed methods study to address the study aim. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 71 Iraqi Temporary Protection Visa (TPV) refugees and 60 Iraqi Permanent Humanitarian Visa (PHV) refugees, residing in Melbourne, Australia. Prior to a recent policy amendment, TPV refugees were only given temporary residency status and had restricted access to a range of government funded benefits and services that permanent refugees are automatically entitled to. The quantitative results were triangulated with semi-structured interviews with TPV refugees and service providers. The main outcome measures were self-reported physical and psychological health. Standardised self-report instruments, validated in an Arabic population, were used to measure health and wellbeing outcomes. Results: Forty-six percent of TPV refugees compared with 25% of PHV refugees reported symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of clinical depression (p = 0.003). After controlling for the effects of age, gender and marital status, TPV status made a statistically significant contribution to psychological distress (B = 0.5, 95% CI 0.3 to 0.71, p �%� 0.001) amongst Iraqi refugees. Qualitative data revealed that TPV refugees generally felt socially isolated and lacking in control over their life circumstances, because of their experiences in detention and on a temporary visa. This sense of powerlessness and, for some, an implicit awareness they were being denied basic human rights, culminated in a strong sense of injustice. Conclusion: Government asylum policies and practices violating human rights norms are associated with demonstrable psychological health impacts. This link between policy, rights violations and health outcomes offers a framework for addressing the impact of socio-political structures on health.

AB  - Asylum seekers arriving in the USA are likely to be held in detention for months or years pending adjudication of their asylum claims. We interviewed 70 asylum seekers detained in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. We used self-report questionnaires to assess symptoms of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. At baseline, 54 (77%) participants had clinically significant symptoms of anxiety, 60 (86%) of depression, and 35 (50%) of post-traumatic stress disorder; all symptoms were significantly correlated with length of detention (p=0-004, 0-017, and 0-019, respectively). At follow-up, participants who had been released had marked reductions in all psychological symptoms, but those still detained were more distressed than at baseline. Our findings suggest detention of asylum seekers exacerbates psychological symptoms. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB  - Asylum seekers arriving in the United States are often imprisoned for months or years while their asylum claims are processed. Recently, Physicians for Human Rights and the Bellevue/New York University Program for Survivors of Torture released the findings of the first systematic study examining the health of detained asylum seekers. The study found that the mental health of asylum seekers interviewed was extremely poor, including high levels of symptoms for anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder, which worsened the longer individuals were in detention. The study also raises concerns about the manner in which asylum seekers are treated upon arrival in the United States and then while in detention. These findings support assertions that detention has a harmful effect on the health and well-being of asylum seekers. Policies regarding the long-term detention of asylum seekers should be reconsidered

AB  - (from the chapter) Discusses the development of the Tibetan Transcultural Psychosocial Organization Project. The need for mental health care was assessed through research, first within the group of newly arrived refugees and ex-prisoners and then though clinical work with the whole refugee population. A questionnaire was adapted to Tibetan culture to qualify and quantify the mental impact of torture. Case examples provide information of health-seeking behavior. The discussion also focuses on the treatment and transcultural aspects of the project. These aspects include mental health in Tibetan medicine, counseling and Buddhist philosophy, and coping strategies and mechanisms. Some of the difficulties of developing the program are addressed, such as, training enough staff, setting up a clinic and initiating activities at various levels within the community and the government. Background information is given of the history and political situation of Tibetans as refugees in India. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (chapter)

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of tuberculosis, hepatitis B carriage and markers of hepatitis C and HIV infection in people detained in immigration reception and processing centres in Australia DESIGN AND SETTING: Eighteen-month survey of medical conditions of public health importance in people detained at the immigration reception and processing centres at Curtin and Port Hedland in Western Australia and Woomera in South Australia PARTICIPANTS: 7000 detainees (5742 adults and 1258 children and teenagers aged < 18 years) between 1 January 2000 and 30 June 2001 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: People treated for active tuberculosis; issuing of health undertakings to report to a chest clinic for follow-up of inactive tuberculosis; and confirmation of hepatitis B carrier status or hepatitis C or HIV infection RESULTS: Eleven people required treatment for tuberculosis (in nine the diagnosis was confirmed bacteriologically), representing a prevalence of 157 cases per 100,000 population. This rate is much higher than the incidence in Australia in 1998 of 4.93 cases per 100,000 population, but comparable with rates in the source countries. Health undertakings were issued to 973 people (13.9%). Of these, 682 (70.1%) were for inactive tuberculosis (26 in association with hepatitis B carriage or hepatitis C infection); and 156, 58 and two health undertakings were for hepatitis B carriage, and hepatitis C and HIV infection, respectively CONCLUSIONS: The health-screening program at immigration reception and processing centres detects significant numbers of conditions of public health importance, enabling treatment and surveillance to the benefit of the people detained and the Australian community

AB  - Previous research studies and inspection reports have highlighted that the experience of detention, even for a relatively brief period of time, has a detrimental effect on the mental and physical health of children. This paper is intended to provide further evidence of these experiences on children and families. It investigates the experiences of UK immigration detention of children and their families. The study was based on the views and experiences of 32 families including 34 children who were detained with their parents and 14 children who experienced the detention of their parents while they lived in the community in the UK. The evidence was collected through family case files and qualitative interviews. Findings revealed that most of the families were already vulnerable and had sought sanctuary, refuge and asylum in the UK. The majority were detrimentally affected by a period in immigration detention and experienced deterioration in both their physical and mental health, and many experienced severe depression. The paper recommended that there should be no attempts to separate families, and appropriate mechanisms should be developed for the UKBA to take into account the views of children subject to enforcement action on all decisions which affect them. Also, all families should have access to good-quality publicly funded legal representation from an early stage in their claim

AB  - The article endeavors to document various problems that Vietrnamese refugees encountered in coping with the stress of transit life. Transit life represents a temporary residence for refugees waiting to be granted asylum in a third country. The account in the article is an analysis based on the refugees' own perceptions of their situation and not of the work of the relief agencies as such. The information was based in five refugee camps in the Philippines, Hong Kong and Japan, supplemented by data by Vietnamese refugees in Norway and U.S.A. The author concludes that inorder to survive, the camp dwellers should need to be active enriching their social life and maintain a continous balance between anonymity and enough exposure to be recognized as a resource rather than a problem

AB  - Les demandeurs d'asile dont la requ+�te a +�t+� rejet+�e et qui ont +�puis+� leurs moyens de recours juridictionnels disposent de quatre semaines pour quitter leur centre d'accueil et le territoire national. " Faire sortir les d+�bout+�s ", c'est-+�-dire les expulser du centre de mani+�re plus ou moins forc+�e, est consid+�r+�e comme une t+�che p+�nible pour les intervenants des centres d'accueil pour demandeurs d'asile (CADA) en France et devient de plus un plus un v+�ritable " dilemme " pour ces " professionnels du social ". Ces " sorties " constituent pour l'observateur des moments exemplaires o+� se cristallisent les tensions entre les divers acteurs du confinement. A partir d'une enqu+�te ethnographique men+�e notamment dans deux CADA qui se trouvent dans la banlieue d'une grande agglom+�ration, il s'agit ici d'analyser ce que " les sorties " des d+�bout+�s disent sur la gestion des demandeurs d'asile. Ce faisant, l'article explore le r+�le ambigu des intervenants sociaux travaillant pour les associations gestionnaires de l'Etat lorsqu'il s'agit non plus seulement de contr+�ler mais aussi d'expulser les +�trangers.

AB  - ABSTRACT IN ENGLISH: Based on interviews conducted at five Finnish reception centers and in two municipal communes during summer 2002 with 93 migrants, mainly from a variety of Southern and Eastern countries of origin, and their ethnoculturally discordant clinicians, the article compares asylum seekers and foreign-born residents in terms of health care treatment and outcome perspectives. Comparative analysis suggests that context makes a difference in post-migration medical encounters. The legally admitted foreign nationals consulted at community facilities were considerably more likely than were asylum seekers assisted at reception centers to be satisfied with the health care they had received and to be confident that the attending physician's recommendations would serve them well in the future. Policy implications related to the study's findings are explored. In Finland and elsewhere, the education of general practitioners for transnational medical encounters needs to be enhanced. International and national efforts to promote health also need to encompass political asylum and third country resettlement policies. In Finland and other migrant-receiving states, prolonged insecure immigration status can be debilitating for both asylum seeker and host society. Expedited admission to legal residence and expanded choice of physician are likely to result in improved health outcomes. // ABSTRACT IN FRENCH: Fond+� sur des entretiens dans cinq centes d'accueil et deux communes municipales pendant l'+�t+� de 2002 avec 93 migrants, originaires surtout de pays du Sud et de l'Est, ainsi qu'avec leurs m+�decins d'une ethno-culturalit+� dissonante, cet article fait une comparaison entre les charcheurs d'asile et les r+�sidents n+�s a l'+�tranger en ce qui concerne le traitement de la sant+� et les r+�sultats attendus. L'analyse comparative sugg+�re que le contexte fait une diff+�rence lors d'entretiens m+�dicaux apr+�s la migration. Les +�trangers admis r+�guli+�rement qui ont demand+� de soins de sant+� aupr+�s de centres de sant+� de la communaut+� avaient une plus grande possibilit+� d'+�tre satisfaits avec les soins re+�us, par comparaison avec ceux ayant re+�u des soins aux centres d'accueil, ainsi que de faire confiance aux recommandations du m+�decin en cas de besoin dans le futur. On explore dans ce document les implications tir+�es de cette +�tude pour la formulation de politiques. En Finlande et ailleurs il semble avoir besoin de repenser la formation g+�n+�rale de m+�decins g+�n+�ralistes pour ces contacts internationaux. Les efforts nationaux et internationaux pour am+�liorer la condition de la sant+� doivent aussi inclure les mesures d'asile politique et de relocation dans le Tiers Monde. En Finlande ainsi que dans d'autres pays accueillant des migrants, la condition d'ins+�curit+� prolong+�e li+�e au statut d'immigration peut +�tre un facteur d'affaiblissement pour le ressortissant +�tranger aussi bien que pour la soci+�t+� d'accueil. Le proc+�d+�es d'admission +� la r+�sidence r+�guli+�re et un choix de m+�decins plus +�largie peuvent donner lieux +� des meilleurs r+�sultats dans la sant+�. // ABSTRACT IN SPANISH: El art+�culo compara la atenci+�n de salud para los solicitantes de asilo y los residentes nacidos en el extranjero y los posibles resultados bas+�ndose en las entrevistas realizadas en cinco centros de recepci+�n y dos comunas municipales en Finlandia durante el verano del 2002 a 93 inmigrantes, principalmente provenientes de pa+�ses del Sur y del Este, y a los profesionales de salud locales que provienen de contextos +�tnicos y culturales diferentes. Los an+�lisis comparativos sugieren que el contexto es un factor de diferenciaci+�n en las consultas m+�dicas posteriores a la inmigraci+�n. Los ciudadanos extranjeros legalmente admitidos que recibieron atenci+�n m+�dica en las instalaciones comunitarias de atenci+�n presentan mayores posibilidades de estar satisfechos y se muestran m+�s confiados en que las recomendaciones del m+�dico que los atendi+� les ser+�n de gran utilidad en el futuro en comparaci+�n con los solicitantes de asilo entrevistados en los centros de recepci+�n. Se exploran las implicaciones de los resultados de este estudio para la formulaci+�n de pol+�ticas. Se necesita majorar la formaci+�n de los profesionales en para que den atenci+�n m+�dica en situaciones que involucran diferentes nacionalidades en en Finlandia y otros lugares. Los esfuerzos nacionales e internacionales para promocionar la salud tambi+�n deben abarcar las pol+�ticas de asilo pol+�tico y reubicaci+�n en pa+�ses del Tercer Mundo. En Finlandia y en otros pa+�ses que reciben inmigrantes, la inseguridad en la condici+�n de inmigrante puede debilitar tanto al solicitante de asilo como a la sociedad que lo acoge. Es probable que con procesos de admisi+�n m+�s r+�pidos para obtener la residencia legal y un mayor n+�mero de m+�dicos disponibles se mejores los resultados en la salud.

AB  - The aim of the study was to explore the prevalence of PTSD in refugees from Croatia and investigate the relationship between PTSD and the number of experienced traumas, especially with regard to being held in detention camp, as well as the relationship between PTSD and demographic variables. A group of refugees, consisting of 34 men and 54 women, mean age 43, were studied. Trauma Questionnaire and Watson's PTSD Interview were applied. The group experienced three traumas, on average; whereas after two years of life in captivity the prevalence of PTSD was 45.45%. It was established that the total of PTSD symptoms grow with the increasing number of traumas and with the refugee's age, but decrease with the person's higher education. The group of refugees (N = 18), who were kept in detention camp no longer than one month and were not tortured, was compared with the comparative refugee group (N = 18), equal in gender, age, education, and number of traumas experienced. The groups had shown statistically the same amount of total PTSD symptomatics. Conclusively, the results indicate that young adulthood and higher education are protective factors in reaction to trauma. A short period of time spent in detention camp, without torture, did not have a separate effect on PTSD symptomatics in the group of polytraumatized adult refugees. [Author Abstract]

While Regulations establishing a mechanism for eligibility determination were issued at the same time, the Mexican government began a transitional process to take over eligibility in March 2002. Prior to that time, the UNHCR had been recognizing refugees under its mandate. As of this writing no national policy regarding the detention of asylum seekers has been established, nor have refugee advocates begun to pressure the government to comply with Article 31 of the Convention. Rather, whether an asylum seeker is detained during the eligibility process depends in part on the place and timing of the request as well as on the knowledge and goodwill of the migration authority Last updated - 2013-09-16 SubjectsTermNotLitGenreText - 1357 11229; 10695; 1279; 6751 8040; 5551; 8041 9874 5574 10472; 1411; 251 293 14

AB  - The problems of asylum seekers are multiple and complex. Next to having experienced a lot of adversities in their country of origin, when they arrive in a host country they face a (usually long) asylum procedure and a multitude of post-migration living problems. Literature shows high prevalence rates of mental disorders and low quality of life. The length of the asylum procedure is an even more important risk factor for psychopathology than the adverse life events in the country of origin. Both qualitative and quantitative research has shown the relevant types of post-migration living problems, such as uncertainty about the future, the fear to be sent home, missing one's family and lack of work. In order to improve the mental health status of this very vulnerable group, the government should reconsider their policy regarding length of the asylum procedure, living conditions in the asylum seeking centres, work, and family reunification, and should facilitate support by voluntary agencies. Mental health workers should realize the importance of the asylum procedure and the (often related) post-migration living problems and consider to focus their treatment on (coping with) these problems instead of only focusing on traumas from the past. A resilience-oriented approach is recommended. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB  - A consecutive sample of 231 refugee patients referred to the outpatient unit at the Psychosocial Centre for Refugees, University of Oslo, were examined by means of a semistructured clinical interview, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), and the self-reports Hopkins Symptoms Check List (HSCL-25) and a checklist for post-traumatic symptoms (PTSS-10). A significant relation was found between the self-report scores on the HSCL-25 and ratings made by the clinician on Global Assessment of Function Scale (GAF) and Global Rating on Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). A further analysis showed that HSCL-25 had a significant relation with mainly two of the four symptom patterns identified in a factor analysis of BPRS, namely Factor II (emotional withdrawal/retardation) and Factor III (anxiety/depression). Multiple regression analyses based on HSCL-25 scores for age, sex, nationality of origin, stay in prison, torture, exposure to war actions, refugee status, and employment situation in Norway showed a significant association with sex, nationality of origin, refugee status, and employment situation in Norway, but with not with any of the traumatization factors.

AB  - During the last two decades the European Union has become a major actor in the field of asylum law. Meanwhile, human rights law, in particular the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), has become of paramount importance in this field. This paper highlights certain areas of concern in the European Asylum System from the viewpoint of the ECHR. It particularly focuses on the Dublin II Regulation, the reception conditions and the detention of asylum seekers.

AB  - The article focuses on asylum seekers and their right to be allowed to live in the community pending determination of their application for refugee status. The mandatory detention of people in jail-like centres demonstrates a lack of compassion for the suffering of other human beings but this article argues a number of propositions that go beyond the simple humanitarian argument. There are a number of economic, legal, ethical, political and social cohesion reasons why a government, keen to be seen by its populace and the international community as a humane liberal democracy, might wish to dismantle policies which insist that asylum seekers are subject to mandatory detention. Detaining asylum seekers, for other than short term processing, subjects them to psychological and physical harm, undermines our international reputation, and undermines the Australian economy. This is so because, in the short term, there is the cost of detention and the foregoing of the productive capacity of those detained. In the long term, the majority of asylum seekers are granted residence in Australia, but their productive capacity is reduced as a direct result of the trauma and missed training opportunities that occur as a result of their incarceration

AB  - The present study aimed to assess the mental and physical health of children held within a British immigration detention centre. A total of 24 detained children (aged 3 months to 17 years) were assessed with their parents or carer after being referred by a registered legal charity. During the psychological assessment of 11 children, 8 met criteria for psychiatric �_ocaseness�__ on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. All 11 reported symptoms of depression and anxiety. Sleep problems, somatic complaints, poor appetite, emotional symptoms, and behavioural difficulties were common. Symptoms of global distress were also reported by all 9 parents. According to paediatric assessment 8 out of 20 children had lost weight. Six had missed health appointments and 2 were taken to hospital. Detained children were found to be experiencing mental and physical health difficulties of recent onset, which appeared to be related to the detention experience. These findings suggest that current UK policies regarding the detention of children for purposes of immigration control should be re-examined. Detained families had very limited access to appropriate assessment, support or treatment. The traumatic experience of detention itself also has implications for the sizeable proportion of psychologically distressed children who are eventually released from detention and expected to successfully reintegrate into British society; while those children who are deported are returned with increased vulnerability to future stressors

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to assess the mental and physical health of children held within a British immigration detention center METHOD: A total of 24 detained children (aged 3 months to 17 years) were assessed with their parents or carer after being referred by a registered legal charity. Thirteen were seen by a pediatrician alone, 4 by a psychologist alone, and 7 by both professions using semi-structured clinical interviews. The psychologist also used standardized self-report questionnaires to measure psychopathology RESULTS: During the psychological assessment of 11 children, 8 met criteria for psychiatric "caseness" on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. All 11 reported symptoms of depression and anxiety. Sleep problems, somatic complaints, poor appetite, emotional symptoms, and behavioral difficulties were common. Symptoms of global distress were also reported by all 9 parents. According to pediatric assessment 8 out of 20 children had lost weight. Six had missed health appointments and 2 were taken to hospital. Nutritional, developmental, educational, and child protection concerns were raised CONCLUSIONS: Detained children were found to be experiencing mental and physical health difficulties of recent onset, which appeared to be related to the detention experience. These findings support previous Australian studies demonstrating that detention is not in the best interest of the child. It suggests that current UK policies regarding the detention of children for purposes of immigration control should be re-examined. Further research in the area is required PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Although high levels of mental and physical health problems, as well as child protection concerns were detected, detained families had very limited access to appropriate assessment, support or treatment. The traumatic experience of detention itself also has implications for the sizeable proportion of psychologically distressed children who are eventually released from detention and expected to successfully reintegrate into British society; while those children who are deported are returned with increased vulnerability to future stressors

AB  - Objective: The objective of this study was to examine the behavioral and emotional problems of former unaccompanied refugee children who had repatriated to Vietnam from refugee centers in Hong Kong and South East Asia. The children were compared with a matched sample of children who had never left Vietnam. Method: The participants consisted of 455 Vietnamese children aged between 10 and 22 years; 238 of the children had formerly resided in refugee camps without their parents. Data were collected using the Achenbach Youth Self-Report, the Cowen Perceived Self-Efficacy scale, a Social Support scale as well as an Exposure to Trauma scale. Results: No significant difference was found between the two groups of children on the YSR Total Score. The former refugee children had significantly lower Externalizing scores and failed marginally to report significantly higher Internalizing scores than the local children. The study showed that the perceived self-efficacy, number of social supports and experience of social support did not differ between the two groups of children. Further analysis showed that a significant interaction between the immigration status of the children and the children' s subjective perception of their current standard of living explained the differences in the YSR. Conclusion: The results suggest that the experience of living without parents in a refugee camp does not lead to increased behavioral and emotional problems in the immediate years after repatriation.

Los ni��os fueron comparados con una muestra emparejada de ni��os que nunca dejaron Vietnam. MǸtodo: La muestra estaba compuesta por un total de 455 ni��os vietnamitas de edades comprendidas entre los 10 y los 22 a��os. Un total de 238 ni��os hab��an residido previamente sin sus padres en campos de refugiados. Se recogieron datos aplicando la versi��n de autoinforme para j��venes del Achenbach (Youth Self-Report), la Escala de Autoeficacia Percibida de Cowen, una escala de Soporte Social y una escala de Exposici��n al Trauma. Resultados: No se observaron diferencias significativas entre los grupos de ni��os en la puntuaci��n total del YSR. Los ni��os previamente refugiados tuvieron puntuaciones mǭs bajas que los ni��os del grupo control en la escala de "problemas de conducta externalizados". Se observ�� una tendencia en los ni��os refugiados a presentar puntuaciones mǭs altas que los ni��os del grupo control en la escala de "problemas de conducta internalizados". No se observaron diferencias entre los dos grupos en la eficacia autopercibida, el nǧmero de fuentes de apoyo social y las experiencias de apoyo social. Otros anǭlisis mostraron que una interacci��n significativa entre la condici��n de inmigrantes de los ni��os y su percepci��n subjetiva del actual nivel de vida explic�� las diferencias en las puntuaciones en el YSR. Conclusi��n: Los resultados sugieren que la experiencia de vivir sin sus padres en un campo de refugiados no conduce a presentar mǭs problemas emocionales y de conducta en los a��os posteriores inmediatos a...

AB  - Mental health professionals working with refugees are often confronted with traumatised survivors who are living in legal limbo. Complicated asylum procedures or provisions of only 'temporary' protection trigger existential fears, reexperiencing of trauma and feelings of hopelessness and deep despair and can actively contribute to further destabilise survivors. Mental health centres have to reconceptualise their provided services for these clients. The paper introduces a testimony project for traumatised Bosnian refugees in Frankfurt, Germany, who were living in legal limbo for many years. The testimony method was used in combination with supportive therapy and informed advocacy to try to reduce the survivors' feelings of humiliation and demoralisation which for them were at the centre of their survival. By giving testimony, survivors benefited psychologically and became better able to cope with the difficult present. Feelings of self-worth and dignity could be regained and a trusting relationship between the survivor and the listener facilitated the therapeutic process. The testimony material documented human rights abuses both in the country of origin and in exile, helped us to perform informed advocacy for this group and informed a larger public on the psychological costs...

AB  - Although many individuals applying for political asylum allege maltreatment and sometimes torture in their countries of origin, the utility of medical evaluations in asylum adjudication has not been documented. This study compares the asylum grant rate among US asylum seekers who received medical evaluations from Physicians for Human Rights (PHR), with rates among asylum seekers who did not receive PHR evaluations. Retrospective analysis was carried out on all asylum cases referred to PHR between 2000 and 2004 for medical evaluations for which adjudication outcome was available. Basic demographic information was obtained: age, sex, country of origin, English language ability, US region where adjudication occurred, whether legal representation was pro bono, type of evaluation, provision of oral court testimony, and whether asylum seekers were in detention. Cases were analyzed descriptively and with chi square tests. Between 2000 and 2004, 1663 asylum seekers received medical evaluations from PHR; the adjudication status (either granted or denied) was determined in 746 cases at the time of the study. Of these cases, 89% were granted asylum, compared to the national average of 37.5% among US asylum seekers who did not receive PHR evaluations. Medical evaluations may be critical in the adjudications of asylum cases when maltreatment is alleged.

An example of a young immigrant who revealed his issues with his abusive mother to his designated caseworker at the U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement is presented, noting how the sense of desperation felt by asylum seekers can influence their willingness to consider legal alternatives to being deported. Services for young immigrants at juvenile detention facilities are reviewed, noting the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder

AB  - Records observations from a series of visits to 2 of Australia's immigration detention centers and considers the mental health consequences of Australia's policy of mandatory immigration detention (ID) of asylum seekers for families and children. Families and children were interviewed. Two vignettes are given to illustrate the situation for families and children in ID. It is concluded that parents and children in ID are often vulnerable to mental health problems before they reach Australia. Experiences in prolonged ID add to their burden or trauma, which has an impact not only on the individual adults and children, but on the family process itself. Observations show that ID profoundly undermines the parental role, renders the parent impotent and leaves the child without protection or comfort in already unpredictable surroundings where basic needs for safe play and education are unmet. This potentially exposes the child to physical and emotional neglect in a degrading and hostile environment and puts children at high risk of the developmental psychopathology that follows exposure to violence and ongoing parental despair. The authors suggest that psychiatrists have a role in advocating for appropriate treatment of these traumatized and vulnerable parents and children.

AB  - Objective: This paper reports the clinical, practical and ethical issues arising in the assessment of 10 consecutive referrals from a remote Immigration Reception and Processing Centre to a child and adolescent mental health service (CAMHS) between February and August 2002. Method: The 16 adults and 20 children (age range 11 months to 17 years) were comprehensively assessed by allied health clinicians and child psychiatrists. All children were also assessed by the statutory child protection agency. Results: There were very high levels of mood disturbance and post-traumatic symptoms in this population. All children had at least one parent with psychiatric illness. Of the 10 children aged 6-17 years, all (100%) fulfilled criteria for both post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depression with suicidal ideation. Eight children (80%), including three pre-adolescents, had made significant attempts at self harm. Seven (70%) had symptoms of an anxiety disorder and half reported persistent severe somatic symptoms. The majority (80%) of preschool-age children were identified with developmental delay or emotional disturbance. Few clinically based recommendations were implemented. Conclusions: Very high levels of psychopathology were found in child and adult asylum seekers. Much was attributable to traumatic experiences in detention and, for children, the impact of indefinite detention on their caregivers. Implications: Multiple obstacles to adequate service provision are identified. Adequate clinical intervention and care was not possible. The impact on involved clinicians is discussed.

N1  - Date revised - 2013-06-12 SuppNotes - The attacks of September 11, 2002, have dramatically altered the policy landscape in Washington, but it is important to reject the notion that there is a necessary trade-off between security and civil liberties. One of the most serious threats to civil liberties has been the adoption of a policy of preventive detention that has resulted in the secret jailing of hundreds of Arabs and Muslims when there is no evidence linking them to terrorist activity. This has been done, not by using the limited new authorities granted the government in the post-September 11 terrorism legislation, but by improperly using pre-existing criminal and immigration authorities. Secret arrests are antithetical to a democratic society. A targeted investigation that focuses on actual terrorist activity and respects the legitimate political and religious activity of citizens and non-citizens would be more effective than a dragnet approach that has resulted in the secret arrests of hundreds of individuals Last updated - 2013-09-16 SubjectsTermNotLitGenreText - 10695; 2301 5278 9705; 6232 8037; 6103 11032 9705; 8528; 1279; 9614 7256; 12424 6608 6085; 433 293 14

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This paper sought to examine which pre- and post-migration factors might be associated with changes in refugees' health status METHODS: Using linear regression, the associations between pre- and post-migration factors and changes in self-rated mental and physical health status were examined in 525 refugees from the 1998 Settlement Experiences of Refugees in Alberta study RESULTS: Having spent time in a refugee camp and having held professional/managerial jobs in one's home country were associated with a greater decline in mental health status since arrival in Canada. Having completed a university degree in one's home country was associated with a greater decline in physical health status. Being employed was associated with greater improvements in mental health status. Perceived economic hardship was associated with greater declines in physical health status. A higher number of settlement services received during the first year in Canada was associated with greater improvements in both mental and physical health status. Longer residence in Canada was associated with greater declines in physical health status but not in mental health status CONCLUSION: While little can be done to alter refugees' pre-migration experiences, public policies can affect many post-migration experiences in order to mitigate the negative health consequences associated with resettlement. Results of this study point to the need for continued provision of settlement services to assist refugees with job training, labour market access, and credential recognition, as well as counseling for refugees who experienced the trauma of living in a refugee camp

AB  - (from the chapter) Increasingly, the global north uses detention to repel, deter and contain asylum seekers from the global south. Exposing the violence of Australian refugee detention is a worthwhile task. Australia has the dubious honor of being a world leader in asylum seeker incarceration. It has been at the forefront of punitive responses to onshore asylum seekers through the use of mandatory, often lengthy and potentially indefinite detention; detention in remote, harsh and isolated locations; the redrawing of Australian borders specifically to thwart asylum claims and naval blockades aimed at repelling boats carrying asylum seekers. The evolution of Australia's policies in relation to refugees, particularly mandatory detention, is not only a story about violation of rights and the tactics of power. It is also a story that makes clear the positive force of collective action against such practices and tactics. Detainees, despite concerted official efforts to isolate and silence them, have gone to extraordinary lengths to draw attention to their plight, engaging in a whole range of individual and collective, organized, spontaneous, desperate and sometimes extremely creative acts. Ultimately, there was a major shift in popular opinion in Australia, and the Government was forced to mitigate some of the harshest aspects of its mandatory detention policy. This chapter aims to contribute to the task of bringing the Australian Government to account for its treatment of asylum seekers. It also aims to acknowledge and go some small way towards documenting the unconscionable pain and suffering inflicted on people whose only 'crime' is to be in need of safe harbor and protection after suffering persecution in their home country. It begins by considering the politicized nature of border politics and, in particular, the way that the human rights of asylum seekers have been sacrificed for political gain. The nature and conditions of mandatory detention of refugees in Australia and offshore are described and explored along with the profound impact of this detention on asylum seekers. Finally, the way the violence of incarceration is denied through tactics designed to deny, minimize and blame the victim is considered.

AB  - There is increasing evidence that the provision of mental health services is inadequate for immigration detainees. In S v Secretary, Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 549, Justice Paul Finn held that the Commonwealth had breached its duty to ensure that reasonable care was taken of two Iranian detainees, 'S' and 'M', in relation to the treatment of their respective mental health problems. The lack of proper psychiatric care at Baxter Detention Centre was also highlighted in the Palmer Inquiry into the detention of Cornelia Rau. This article analyses the Commonwealth Government's legal duty to provide adequate levels of mental health services and psychiatric care to immigration detainees as well as the implications of the cases brought on behalf of a child refugee, Shayan Badraie and an Iranian man, Parvis Yousefi against the Department of Immigration and Citizenship and the detention centre operators.

It says that 45 of the 1637 asylum seekers imprisoned in Nauru ended up in New Zealand or Australia. It mentions that the Australian Coalition proposes temporary protection visas, which resulted to the families risking their lives due to its inability to sponsor a family. Moreover, the statements of Scott Morrison on the cynicism of the Coalition

AB  - Asylum seekers arriving in the USA are likely to be held in detention for months or years pending adjudication of their asylum claims. We interviewed 70 asylum seekers detained in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. We used self-report questionnaires to assess symptoms of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. At baseline, 54 (77%) participants had clinically significant symptoms of anxiety, 60 (86%) of depression, and 35 (50%) of post-traumatic stress disorder; all symptoms were significantly correlated with length of detention (p=0.004, 0.017, and 0.019, respectively). At follow-up, participants who had been released had marked reductions in all psychological symptoms, but those still detained were more distressed than at baseline. Our findings suggest detention of asylum seekers exacerbates psychological symptoms

AB  - Detainees in Australian immigration centers have poor mental and physical health, according to a study by the University of Wollongong, NSW. Forty percent of those held for 2 years or longer developed new mental health symptoms. A third of Australia�_Ts 7375 detainees are seeking asylum under the 1951 UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. Many are traumatized, with high rates of post-traumatic stress disorder and severe depression, and about 20% have been tortured, imprisoned for political offences, or have witnessed murder of family or friends. Although the situation in Australia has improved, with closure of remote desert detention centers and provision of non-camp facilities for children, the status quo is hardly satisfactory. The Australian Government and the Detention Health Advisory Group need to respond to this continuing problem as asylum seekers continue to flee conflict-ridden areas in Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, and parts of southeast Asia.

It mentions that Labor resorted to long-term indefinite detention of asylum seekers as the number of arrivals increased. Moreover, Labor Immigration Minister Chris Evans adds that detaining people for longer periods in immigration detention centres imposed high costs on Australian taxpayers and individuals

AB  - This study utilized both quantitative and qualitative methods to assess the mental health and psychosocial development of 58 Guatemalan Mayan Indian children living in two refugee camps in the Mexican state of Chiapas. Data are presented which indicate minimal evidence of psychological trauma, as well as generally low levels of other types of psychological distress. Several factors are suggested to explain these findings, including "the recreation of normality" within the context of the refugee camps. Data are also reported which describe a moderate relationship between children's mental health and the physical and emotional well-being of their mothers. A strong association was found between depressive symptomatology in girls, but not boys, and physical and psychological distress in their mothers. It is suggested that girls may experience a greater level of vulnerability to the impact of their mothers' distress due to a developmental norm according to which boys, as they grow older, spend increasingly greater amounts of time outside of the home working with their fathers and other adult relatives in the fields, while girls remain at home assisting their mothers with a wide variety of household chores. Qualitative data are examined which are based on semi-structured interviews, drawings, and creative arts workshops conducted with a sub-sample of 40 children in the two camps. While the interviews addressed a broad range of developmental and phenomenological themes, the focus of the qualitative analysis in this dissertation concerns the ways in which the children have come to make sense of their experience of exile. Specific topics discussed include children's understandings of why their families fled Guatemala, the nature and causes of the violence, and their thoughts and feelings regarding the prospect of returning to Guatemala at some future point. The dissertation concludes with a summary of the major findings of the study, and examines the limitations of conceptualizing mental health strictly in terms of the absence of psychiatric symptomatology. A more holistic definition of mental health is advocated, in which children's competencies are taken into account

AB  - This study examined the mental health and psychosocial development of 58 Guatemalan Mayan Indian children living in 2 refugee camps in the Mexican state of Chiapas. Conventional assessment instruments were adaped for use in this unique context, and semistructured interviews were utilized to gather phenomenological data from children regarding various developmental, sociocultural, and political topics. Data are presented that show minimal evidence of psychological trauma in this sample, and various factors are suggested to account for this finding. In addition, data are presented showing a positive relationship between children's mental health and the health status (physical and mental) of their mothers. In particular, a strong association was found between depressive symptomatology in girls and poor health status in their mothers. Qualitative data from the interviews are presented, focusing on children's understandings of why their families fled Guatemala, the nature and causes of the violence, and their thoughts and feelings regarding the prospect of returning to Guatemala at some future point.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term impact of trauma and confinement on the functional health and mental health status of Cambodian displaced persons living on the Thailand-Cambodia border DESIGN: Household survey of 993 adults randomly selected from household rosters. Household sample selection by multistage area probability sample SETTING: Site 2, the largest Cambodian displaced-persons camp on the Thailand-Cambodia border PARTICIPANTS: Adults 18 years of age and older selected at random within households; 98% of eligible persons selected agreed to participate RESULTS: From 1975 through 1979 (Khmer Rouge regime), more than 85% reported lack of food, water, shelter, and medical care, brainwashing, and forced labor; 54% reported murder of a family member or friend; 36% reported torture; 18% reported head injury; and 17% reported rape or sexual abuse. During the refugee period between 1980 and 1990, 56% reported lack of food or water, 44% reported lack of shelter, 28% reported lack of medical care, 24% reported brainwashing, and 8% reported torture. Since 1980, reports of murder of a family member, head injury, and rape/sexual abuse have decreased to 5%. Reports of experiencing combat situations and shelling attacks have remained consistent between the two time periods, approximately 44% and 30%, respectively. From 1989 to 1990, 25% reported experiencing lack of food or water, and 5% to 10% reported serious injury, combat, and shelling conditions. More than 80% said they were in fair or poor health, felt depressed, and had a number of somatic complaints despite good access to medical services. Fifty-five percent and 15% had symptom scores that correlate with Western criteria for depression and posttraumatic stress disorder, respectively. Fifteen percent to 20% reported health impairments limiting activity, and moderate or severe bodily pain. Despite reported high levels of trauma and symptoms, social and work functioning were well preserved in the majority of respondents CONCLUSIONS: Reports of extensive trauma, poor health status, and depressive symptoms of this population are of concern in predicting future morbidity and mortality. The health and mental health needs of Cambodian displaced persons and their impact on social and economic behavior should be addressed now that the Cambodians have been repatriated

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the impact of the Australian provisions for temporary rather than permanent protection for asylum seekers found to be genuine refugees. DESIGN AND SETTING: A comparison of the mental health of Persian-speaking refugees with temporary (n = 49) versus permanent (n = 67) protection visas attending an early intervention program in Sydney, New South Wales, 2002-03. MEASURES: Standard measures were used to assess past trauma, detention experiences, postmigration stresses, symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, depression, and functional impairment. RESULTS: The 2 groups had experienced similar levels of past trauma and persecution. Nevertheless, holders of temporary protection visas (TPVs) returned higher scores on 3 psychiatric symptom measures (P < 0.001). Multivariate analyses showed that TPV status was the strongest predictor of anxiety, depression, and particularly PTSD. Further analyses suggested that, for TPV holders, experience of past stresses in detention in Australia and ongoing living difficulties after release contributed to adverse psychiatric outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The sequence of postmigration stresses experienced by TPV holders appears to impact adversely on their mental health. [Author Abstract]

N1  - Date revised - 2013-06-12 SuppNotes - For fourteen years Australia has detained asylum seekers arriving unlawfully in its territory. It also intercepts asylum seekers arriving in the territorial waters, detaining them in third countries and preventing them from seeking refugee status in Australia (the 'Pacific Solution'). This paper traces the development of the policy, its current implementation, the justification employed by the government for maintaining it, and its legality under international law. On examination of these issues, it is evident that the justification for the mandatory policy is flawed; that the costs of the policy - in terms of the physical and mental well-being of asylum seekers themselves, and the social and financial impact on the Australian community - are too great, and it puts Australia in breach of its obligations under international law. However, the government has not canvassed alternatives to the mandatory detention policy and has no intention of changing it. This leaves asylum seekers who enter Australian territory unlawfully literally and figuratively between a 'rock and hard place.'

AB  - The country of Sudan has experienced violent conflict for much of the past 50 years, killing and displacing millions of Sudanese and generating widespread diaspora. In recent years, international humanitarian resettlement programs have increased the numbers of Africans entering third country resettlement programs; however, very little has been written about the experiences of African adults in resettlement as compared to other refugee groups. The current study used quantitative and qualitative methods to enhance understanding of the refugee experience among a specific group of refugees, adults from Sudan resettled in Brisbane, Australia. Ninety Sudanese adults (Mean age = 34.19) participated in the quantitative study, with 10 participants from that group purposefully selected to complete the semi-structured qualitative interview. Participants represented 20 different ethnic groups and reported disparate backgrounds and experiences both in Sudan and Australia, highlighting the incredibly heterogeneity of the Sudanese community. Quantitative participants reported an average 5.54 traumatic experiences on the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ) and approximately one-quarter of the sample meeting recommended cut-off criteria for significant psychological distress on the Hopkins Symptoms Checklist (HSCL) and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) on the HTQ. Individuals with higher rates of prior trauma, younger adults, and people who had spent time in a refugee camp reported higher levels of psychological distress. These groups also reported higher frequencies of discrimination, with one-third of the sample reporting experiences of discrimination several times per month. During data collection in 2007, there was significant public debate regarding the integration of the Sudanese community, mirroring debates worldwide as nations struggle with public discourse surrounding changes in global migration. In the current sample, the majority of participants (54.4%) reported integration as their method of acculturation, with individuals who had been in Australia longer, having higher levels of education and greater social connectivity within both the Sudanese and Australian communities being more likely to endorse integration. The ten qualitative participants emphasized opportunities for advancement such as through education and employment opportunities as a highlight and experiences of discrimination as a low point in resettlement, suggesting the importance of social context and opportunities for advancement in resettlement.

AB  - (from the chapter) At the end of 2008 the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimated that there were 10 million refugees around the world and over 14 million internally displaced persons. Many more were deemed stateless (over 6 million), with a total of 34 million "of concern" to the agency. Around one-third of these persons were children aged 6-17 years, and around 10% were less than five years of age. Infants and children constitute a significant proportion of those impacted by war, conflict, displacement and loss and are among the most vulnerable. The following discussion will review the psychological and developmental impact of immigration detention on child asylum seekers, with reference to the Australian experience and research findings.

AB  - Asylum seekers represent a highly traumatized group with experiences of systematic oppression, loss, displacement, and exposure to violence. Around the world many are viewed with distrust and anxiety. The Australian response to asylum seekers is one that has used prolonged detention with significant negative impact on mental health. This has prompted much social debate and the involvement of clinicians and researchers in advocating for the human rights of asylum seekers. This article reviews the impact of mandatory prolonged detention on the mental health of asylum seekers and the significance of this for recovery and adaption. It concludes that the mandatory detention of high-risk and oppressed groups compounds trauma, with a potential long-term negative impact on mental health.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: There is growing concern for the mental health of asylum-seeking children due to protracted periods of stay at asylum centres and an increasing need for psycho-social measures. The objective of this study is to survey asylum-seeking children's mental health in Denmark MATERIALS AND METHODS: The population comprised all asylum-seeking children aged 4-16 years living at asylum centres run by the Danish Red Cross. In order to assess their mental health the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was employed along with four questions from the Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children questionnaire (HBSC). The respondents were teachers of the 4-16 year-old and the 11-16 year old children. The data collection took place from October to December 2006. We received responses for 246 children, equivalent to 95% of the study population RESULTS: Based on SDQ, 35% of asylum-seeking children showed evidence of having a psychiatric disorder. The results from the SDQ were supported by the results from the HBSC which showed that asylum-seeking children had numerous physical and psychological symptoms, poor self-perceived quality of life and a fragile social network CONCLUSION: Emotional and behavioural problems were highly prevalent among asylum-seeking children--also in comparison to children in the general population. This is in accordance with former studies. The causes of the children's condition should be reviewed and relevant psychological and psychiatric treatment should be secured. Furthermore, the long-term consequences of asylum-seeking children's poor mental health need to be clarified

AB  - Background: The process of seeking asylum and the related organisational conditions in the host country may adversely affect the children's mental health. The objective of this study was to examine the mental health of children seeking asylum in relation to organisational factors of the asylum system including length of stay and number of relocations. Methods: The population included all 260 parent-accompanied asylum-seeking children aged 4-16 years living in the asylum centres managed by the Danish Red Cross in October-December 2006. Mental health was evaluated using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. School teachers evaluated children aged 4-16; and the 11-16-year-olds completed the self-report version. To assess the association between organisational factors and mental health, binary logistic regression analyses were done using backwards elimination. We received responses for 246 children equivalent to 95% of the study population. Results: Using teachers' reports, we found that children who had been asylum-seeking for more than one year in Denmark had an increased risk of having mental difficulties (odds ratio 5.5, 95% CI 1.8-16.3); four or more relocations in the asylum system were also associated with a higher risk (3.0, 1.4-6.7). When the self-report data were included, the associations were even stronger. Conclusion: Protracted stays at asylum centres and multiple relocations within the asylum system appear to have an adverse effect on asylum-seeking children's mental health. A limit to the duration of the children's stay in the asylum system should be ensured. Follow-up studies with inclusion of other conditions, such as parental mental health and the children's previous trauma, are needed to clarify the influence of the different factors and their interactions.

AB  - The study examined mental and psychopathological consequences of refugeeism and included (109) refugees from refugee camp in Krnjaca. Their reactions were compared with the reactions of (70) somatically injured patients from Orthopedic Hospital of the Clinical Centre in Belgrade and subjects (105) from Belgrade denying any traumatic experience whatsoever. Apart from the questionnaire on socio-demographic features, subjects were asked to provide answers to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD-10) scale, Brief Eysenck's Personality Inventory, Family Homogeneity Inventory and Impact of Events Scale. By implementation of appropriate statistical procedures (variance analysis), the significance of differences among certain features within the experimental group of refugees was examined, as well as the difference concerning presence of mental and psychopathological features among all three subgroups. It was determined that within the refugee group, males more significantly and more frequently reacted with PTSD symptoms, as well as with signs of general neuroticism and that married refugees more frequently presented with PTSD symptoms. In comparison to non-refugees, refugees more significantly and more frequently present with PTSD symptoms, which is probably caused by PTSD chronicity in this category of subjects. Subjects denying any significant traumatic experience in their lives presented with symptoms of general neuroticism more than the rest of examinees. This is an interesting finding that can be explained by the fact that the same group achieved the highest values on the extraversion scale (using the same Eysenck instrument), or may be correlated to the increase of neurotic reactions in the whole population of Serbia and Montenegro. The above mentioned and other results were compared to the findings of similar researches performed by other authors

AB  - Machover Human Figure Test was used to investigate eight clinical features in five diagnostic categories (neurosis, depression, schizophrenia, paranoid feature and aggressiveness) and one symptom (motor deficiency) through graphical features of human figure drawing. The test involved 201 subjects, out of whom 109 were refugees from refugee camp in Krnjaca, 31 somatically traumatized patients from the Orthopedic Clinic, Clinical Center of Serbia, Belgrade, and 61 subjects from Belgrade denying any traumatic experience whatsoever. The following was determined in three tested sub-groups: - Out of general psychopathological features, "thickened line of the drawing", "unclear medium line of the drawing" and "absence of an arm or a leg" were significantly most frequent in the group of somatically traumatized subjects, thus supporting the hypothesis that Machover Test examined projective aspects of disorder of the body scheme experience. - Out of eight diagnostic categories, only "motor deficiency" was significantly different - of course, in the group of somatically traumatized subjects, while "aggressiveness" was different in the group of refugees

AB  - Context Worldwide, the number of refugees and asylum seekers is estimated to be about 11.5 million plus a much larger number of former refugees who have obtained a residence permit in a new country. Although asylum seekers have been coming to the Netherlands since the 1980s, very few epidemiological studies have focused on this group of inhabitants or on the refugees who have resettled in this country. Objectives The objectives of this study were to estimate the prevalence rates of physical and mental health problems and to identify the risk factors for these complaints. Design, Setting, and Participants A population-based study was conducted in the Netherlands from June 2003 to April 2004 among adult refugees and asylum seekers from Afghanistan, Iran and Somalia. Asylum seekers were living in 14 randomly selected reception centres, and random samples of refugees were obtained from the population registers of three municipalities (Arnhem, Leiden and Zaanstad). A total of 178 refugees and 232 asylum seekers participated (response rates of 59 and 89%, respectively). Main Outcome Measures General health and physical health were measured with the Short Form-36 and a list of 19 chronic conditions, respectively; symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and anxiety, were measured with the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire and the Hopkins Symptoms Checklist-25. Results More asylum seekers (59.1%) than refugees (42.0%) considered their health to be poor (P=0.001). In both groups, approximately half of the respondents suffered from more than one chronic condition. More asylum seekers than refugees had symptoms of PTSD (28.1 and 10.6% respectively; P=0.000) and depression/anxiety (68.1 and 39.4, respectively; P=0.000). Respondents from Afghanistan and, in particular, from Iran had a higher risk for PTSD and depression/anxiety. Female gender was associated with chronic conditions, PTSD and depression/anxiety, and higher age was associated with poor general health and chronic conditions. A greater number of traumatic events were associated with all health outcomes, and more post-migration stress and less social support was associated with PTSD and depression/ anxiety symptoms. Conclusions Both physical and mental health problems are highly prevalent among refugees and asylum seekers in the Netherlands. Although higher prevalence rates for most health outcomes were found among asylum seekers, both the specific health services for asylum seekers and the general health services in the municipalities should be aware of these problems

AB  - Darfur refugees face hardships associated with chronic displacement, including lack of basic needs and safety concerns. Psychiatric research on refugees has focused on trauma, but daily stressors may contribute more to variance in distress. This article reports rates of past trauma and current stressors among Darfur refugees and gauges the contribution of each to psychological distress and functional impairment. A representative sample of 848 Darfuris in 2 refugee camps were interviewed about traumatic events, stressors faced in the camps, psychological distress, and functional impairment. Basic needs and safety concerns were more strongly correlated with measures of distress (rs = .19-.31) than were war-related traumatic events (rs = .09-.20). Hierarchical regression supported models in which effects of trauma on distress were mediated by current stressors. Although war-related traumatic events are the initial causes of refugees' hardship, findings suggest that the day-to-day challenges and concerns in camps mediate psychological distress associated with these events.

AB  - Although psychosocial programming is seen as essential to the humanitarian response to the Darfur conflict, aid groups lack culturally-appropriate assessment instruments for monitoring and evaluation. The current study used an emic-etic integrated approach to: (i) create a culturally-appropriate measure of distress (Study 1), and (ii) test the measure in structured interviews of 848 Darfuris living in two refugee camps in Chad (Study 2). Traditional healers identified two trauma-related idioms, hozun and majnun, which shared features with but were not identical to posttraumatic stress disorder and depression. Measures of these constructs were reliable and correlated with trauma, loss, and functional impairment. Exploratory factor analysis resulted in empirical symptom clusters conceptually parallel to general Western psychiatric constructs. Findings are discussed in terms of their implications for psychosocial programming. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB  - Originally published in Contemporary Psychology: APA Review of Books, 1992, Vol 37(8), 828. Reviews the book, "Refugee Children: Theory, Research, and Services" edited by Frederick L. Ahearn, Jr. and Jean L. Athey (see record 1991-98445-000). Seven and a half million children in the United States are refugees, many of whom have fled warring countries and have lost family, home, and community. In addition, some of these children have endured starvation, torture, and long periods of time in relocation or prison camps. This volume examines the impact of the refugee experience on children, asking how they manifest post-traumatic stress, grief, and depression; what their specific health, developmental, and mental health problems are, and what interventions best foster adaptation.

AB  - Pregnant asylum-seeking women and those with young babies living in initial accommodation centres are a highly vulnerable group. The care that these women receive during pregnancy, childbirth and in the postnatal period can have a lifelong impact on them and their babies. This study, conducted in June 2008, investigates the health and wellbeing needs of this group of women through holding in-depth consultations with professionals from the main organisations involved in their care and accommodation. Analysis of consultations identified areas of concern--health needs, women in transition, access to services, access to resources and information, and working environment. Several recommendations are made, which constitute small changes in practice that could make large differences to the quality of life of women in this group

AB  - Global estimates suggest 20 million children from hundreds of different countries and cultures are currently displaced from their homes as refugees or internally displaced persons (USCR, 2000). Each year hundreds of thousands of children are resettled in second or third countries of asylum. However, little is known about children within asylum camps. With the explosion of asylum seekers worldwide, many being children, gaining insight into the development, well-being, and coping of children in asylum camps must be a primary concern of the international community. The goal of this research study was to augment understanding of the experiences of asylum seeking children in Gimo, Sweden. Twenty refugee children (11 males, 9 females) between 7 and 13 (M = 10.0 years) and their parents participated in the study and represented three linguistic groups. Eight (40%) of the participating children and parents spoke Bosnian, four (20%) Russian, and eight (40%) Arabic. The children and parents were presented with a battery of assessment instruments measuring the presence of trauma and its symptoms, socio-emotional behavior, and perceived social support. Parents and children also participated in an in-depth interview, and children's drawings about their experiences as refugees were collected. Analyses of the surveys documented the presence of traumatic life events and trauma symptoms in the sample, as well as socio-behavioral difficulties. A moderate amount of social support was perceived by children, although no relation between perceived social support and adjustment was detected in the participants as was a priori hypothesized. Significant differences on the survey measures as a function of linguistic group and length of time in the asylum camp were found. Several persistent themes recurred in the interviews. All children and parents expressed the presence of trauma and suffering, loss of humanity as a refugee, uncertainty, and the need of support and restoration of normalcy in their lives. This exploratory research was a first step into understanding the asylum setting for refugee children. More research must be conducted and asylum policies examined because further investigation and insight into the healthy development and psychosocial well-being of refugee children is an investment in our collective human future.

T1  - Risk and protective factors in the mental health status of Cambodian refugees in Utah [dissertation]

KW  - eppi-reviewer
AB  - The majority of research on the mental health status of Cambodian refugees living in the USA indicates high rates of psychopathology and low utilization rates of health and mental health care. This study used probability sampling techniques in the selection of the sample which consisted of 124 Cambodian refugees living in Utah. The purposes of the study were threefold: to examine the mental health status of Cambodian refugees living in Utah, to examine risk and protective factors associated with PTSD and/or major depression, and to examine utilization of health and mental health care. Examination of mental health status revealed that PTSD and major depression were the most prevalent disorders: 45% of the sample were diagnosed with PTSD, and 51% of the sample were diagnosed major depression. Univariate and bivariate statistics were used to identify the following primary risk factors in the study: (a) experiencing a greater number of war traumas increased the risk of both PTSD and major depression, (b) having a greater amount of time in refugee camps and less time in the USA increased the risk of major depression, (c) experiencing a greater number of resettlement stressors during the past year increased the risk of both PTSD and major depression, and (d) having financial stress increased the risk of major depression. Logistic regression analysis was also used to examine the influence of a combination of variables on a diagnosis of PTSD and on major depression. Studying utilization of health and mental health care indicated that only 6% of the sample had received medical treatment for PTSD symptoms; only 8% of the sample received medical treatment for symptoms of major depression; and only 9% of the sample had received any type of mental health treatment. In addition, subjects reported a variety of barriers to accessing health and mental health care. Results of this study indicate that practice and policy changes are necessary in order to better serve the mental health needs of the Cambodian refugee population. [Author Abstract]

AB  - The paper analyzes Canada's practice of detaining a subset of the asylum seeker population pending a decision regarding their application for refugee status. The author argues that Canadian practices fall short of customary international standards in some respects, particularly as they relate to the co-mingling of detained asylum seekers with criminals. To support the analysis, a survey was administered to explore the attitudes and awareness of detention officers at a maximum-security correctional facility in British Columbia that holds a mixed population of persons awaiting sentence, persons on remand, and detained asylum seekers. The study is unique in that most research to date has studied the effects of detention on the person detained, rather than looking at those who exercise control over the detention environment. The findings support the conclusions that corrections officers are not generally aware of the unique circumstances of asylum seekers under their custody and that co-mingling should be avoided. The background of the paper covers the deleterious health effects of detention on asylum seekers and how the identity of an asylum seeker is constructed and framed so as to create a public perception of fear and mistrust. Specific reference is made to the role of the Canadian Red Cross in monitoring the conditions of detained asylum seekers, which is supplemented by a Field Guide for Canadian Red Cross delegates who conduct detention visits

AB  - This study aimed to compare levels of depression, anxiety, and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) amongst immigration detainees with a comparison group of asylum seekers living within the community.� Sixty-seven detained asylum seekers, 30 detainees who had previously been imprisoned within the UK for criminal offences, and 49 asylum seekers living in the community completed the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) and the impact of event scale-revised (IES-R). Demographic information was collected.� High levels of anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms were reported by all three groups. Detained asylum seekers had higher scores than asylum seekers living within the community for depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms. There was an interaction between length of detention period and prior exposure to interpersonal trauma (IP trauma) on depression scores.� Immigration detainees are highly vulnerable to psychological distress. A review of detention policies is recommended in light of this. Immigration detention may have an independent adverse effect on mental health. It is also possible that individuals with mental health problems may be more likely to be detained. Further research is required to investigate this

AB  - The number of asylum seekers, refugees and internally displaced people worldwide is rising. Western countries are using increasingly restrictive policies, including the detention of asylum seekers, and there is concern that this is harmful. In order to investigate mental health outcomes among adult, child and adolescent immigration detainees a�systematic review was conducted�through a systematic search of databases and a supplementary manual search of references.�Ten studies were identified. All reported high levels of mental health problems in detainees. Anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder were commonly reported, as were self-harm and suicidal ideation. Time in detention was positively associated with severity of distress. There is evidence for an initial improvement in mental health occurring subsequent to release, although longitudinal results have shown that the negative impact of detention persists. This area of research is in its infancy and studies are limited by methodological constraints. Findings consistently report high levels of mental health problems among detainees. There is some evidence to suggest an independent adverse effect of detention on mental health

AB  - Compared self-reported symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a cohort of Cuban children and adolescents with assessments of internalizing and externalizing behaviors by the Ss' teachers. 87 Ss (aged 6-17 yrs) who had left Cuba by sea and who had been confined to refugee camps for up to 8 mo before arriving in the US were evaluated 4-6 mo later. Self-reported symptoms of PTSD were assessed with the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Reactive Index, and internalizing and externalizing behaviors were assessed with the Child Behavioral Check List-Teacher Report Form. A majority of the Ss reported moderate to severe PTSD symptoms. The most common symptom clusters were avoidance, regressive behaviors, reexperiencing the traumatic events, somatic symptoms, and hyperarousal. 86% of the Ss reported that the refugee experience had severely affected most of their peers. A statistically significant dose-effect relationship was found between the number of stressors and the severity of self-reported PTSD symptoms. There was a modest relationship between withdrawn behavior and Ss' feelings that they would die at sea and witnessing violence at the camps. Age and witnessing violence in the camps were moderately associated with PTSD. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - (from the chapter) Discusses psychic trauma in refugee children and adolescents and addresses the experience of adolescents and their families who left Cuba by sea with the goal of reaching the US but who were intercepted by the US Coast Guard and confined to refugee camps outside the US mainland. The chapter also describes the experiences of the clinicians who cared for the refugees and the political agendas that affected service delivery. Findings are based on 74 teenagers, held in camps in Guantanamo Bay, who presented to a psychiatric clinic for help. Adolescent refugees exposed to traumatic migratory experiences, including prolonged confinement in refugee camps, are at risk for developing psychiatric psychopathology. These experiences are likely to have an effect not only on their adolescent development but on their adult life as well. It is important for clinicians in the communities that receive refugees to become familiar with the adolescent refugees' past migratory experiences and with the characteristic presentation of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in this particular age group to be able to accurately diagnose and identify high-risk patients requiring treatment.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Two cohorts of Cuban refugee children and adolescents who migrated with their parents by sea and were later confined to refugee camps were assessed for symptoms of PTSD during refugee camp confinement. A third cohort of children and adolescents was assessed for PTSD four to six months after release from the refugee camps, and assessed for the presence of internalizing and externalizing behaviors by their teachers. METHODS: A clinic population of 285 children and adolescent refugees who had left Cuba by sea in the summer of 1994, undergoing their sixth month of confinement, was assessed in the military field hospital inside the camps for the presence of PTSD with the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Reactive Index (PTSDRI). A second cohort of 79 children and adolescents who had taken an alternative exit route out of Cuba and had been transferred from a camp in another country were assessed using DSM-III-R criteria for PTSD. A third cohort of 87 children and adolescents were assessed for PTSD with the PTSDRI, and for the presence of internalizing and externalizing behaviors by their teachers, using the Child Behavioral Checklist-Teacher Report Form. RESULTS: The majority of children and adolescents in the clinic population reported very severe symptoms of PTSD. The rates of pre-existing medical conditions such as Asthma and Epilepsy, and pre-existing psychiatric conditions such as Learning Disabilities and Behavior Dis-control Problems, were found to be double than those found in the general population. The type of posttraumatic symptoms and the effects of particular stressors showed variations by sex and gender. The subjects that were transferred from a camp situated in another country also showed elevated rates of PTSD symptoms. However, these were not as severe as those found among the clinic population. The majority of the children and adolescents that were studied after release from the refugee camps reported moderate to severe PTSD symptoms. The most common symptom clusters were avoidance, regressive behaviors, re-experiencing the traumatic events, somatic symptoms, and hyper-arousal. A statistically significant dose-effect relationship was found between the number of stressors and the severity of self reported PTSD symptoms. Teachers' overall ratings of internalizing and externalizing behaviors did not produce clinically significant findings. CONCLUSIONS: The psychological effects of multiple stressors on child and adolescent refugees are discussed. The role of mental health professionals in treating child and adolescent refugees and their families during refugee camp confinement, the psychological effects on mental health workers, the role of political agendas, and the adaptation issues of the refugees to the host country are also addressed. PTSD symptoms among refugee children and adolescents may continue unabated after the stressors have been removed. The symptoms may be experienced subjectively and go unnoticed by adults.

It argues that such detention is unacceptable and should cease without delay. Other countries have developed viable alternatives and the UK should now follow suit. Meanwhile a set of specific recommendations is outlined to minimise the damage caused by the detention of children

AB  - Aims: The aim of this study was to compare profiles of present mental health and previous exposure to violence among refugee children from the Middle East, whose asylum seeking families either did or did not obtain permission to stay in Denmark. Methods: Shortly after arrival in Denmark, the parents of 311 Middle-Eastern children answered a structured interview on their children's exposure to organized violence and their mental health. The families were followed-up as concerns receipt of a residence permit. Results: At arrival in Denmark, the children's patterns of previous exposure to violence and present mental health was generally similar irrespective of the family getting a residence permit, as was the case for 90 families (60.4%) with 190 children (61.1%). In both groups an overwhelming majority, eight to nine out of 10 children, had been exposed to conditions of war and had stayed in a refugee camp, and seven out of 10 had witnessed violence. Half of the children had a tortured parent. Considerably more children of families who did not get a residence permit had lost a parent (30.6% versus 13.7%; P < 0.001). In both groups about two-thirds suffered from anxiety and about 30% from sleep problems, and children whose families did not later on get a residence permit more often appeared sad or miserable (43.8% versus 27.9%; P < 0.005). Conclusions: The asylum-granting decision process seems to have divided the children into two groups with only superficial disparity as concerns their previous exposure to violence and their present mental health. There seems to be good reason to systematically integrate evidence on the children of refugee families in the treatment of applications for permission to stay

AB  - We live in an age when the number of refugees worldwide is increasing. All of them have suffered physically or emotionally to a varying degree in their country of origin. The transit to a country of resettlement is fraught with further difficulties or the risk of death. This article explores the different approach taken to the management of this issue by Denmark and Iceland, in comparison to that of Australia.

AB  - We live in an age when the number of refugees worldwide is increasing. All of them have suffered physically or emotionally to a varying degree in their country of origin. The transit to a country of resettlement is fraught with further difficulties or the risk of death. This article explores the different approach taken to the management of this issue by Denmark and Iceland, in comparison to that of Australia. In particular, the different approaches to health care for children and their families are identified. The management of these issues by Denmark and Iceland would appear to be a model to follow. Outcomes of the different managements have not been assessed

T1  - The impact of refugee assistance on the elderly: A socio-economic and demographic study of elderly women and men at Tongogara, Mazowe River Bridge and Chambuta camps in Zimbabwe, 1983--1992

AB  - The general purpose of this study is to investigate the socio-economic and demographic characteristics of the elderly Mozambican population within refugee camps in Zimbabwe between 1983 and 1992. It also investigated the impact of governmental as well as non-governmental assistance to this particular group. The selected study areas focused on three refugee camps in Zimbabwe established between 1984 and 1990. These camps were located in different ecological areas of the country. The major instrument for data collection was the survey, with two questionnaires, one for the elderly women and the second for the elderly men. In addition, an unstructured interview schedule was administered to key informants working for various Government departments and NGOs. Participant observation was followed at the project sites in the refugee camps themselves. The findings indicate that Government policy of restricting employment opportunities to the studied population affected their economic well-being in the camps significantly. The adaptation of elderly refugees in camps is affected by structural, economic, cultural, social and psychosocial issues impacting their lives. An overwhelming majority of the elderly refugees were functionally illiterate. They came from a subsistence farming background. The general well-being of elderly refugees in camps is affected by their economic status, and whether their spouses and children are present with them in the camps. The population had a significantly higher representation of elderly women than men, and a sizeable number of these were widowed. Lack of money was a serious problem for the majority of the elderly women and men in the camps. More women participated in the skills-training projects. As a result, there were more women who stated that they had learned some useful skills by participating in the projects. However, a significant number of elderly refugees who were subsistence farmers before their displacement from Mozambique, noted that they had learned nothing new from participating in the projects. The skills-training projects provided certain skills to those who participated in them. It was not clear however, how these skills were going to be used in Mozambique after repatriation. Due to lack of traditional social support mechanisms in the camps, many elderly refugees often experience social isolation and emotional problems. More elderly women encountered various types of problems ranging from material want to emotional problems. The results of the logistic regression run on several key indicators of refugee well-being revealed that, gender, participation in skills-training projects, their relationship with camp staff and finally their relationship with other refugees were the most important predictor variables accounting for their well-being in the camps. In order to become meaningful and effective, protection and assistance programmes have to acknowledge and encourage the development of innovative self-help coping strategies and income generating projects that are directed by refugees themselves. These coping strategies take place within systems of independent communication among the refugees themselves, as well as the various trading relationships which develop between elderly refugees and the local population. It is largely from such interactions that their independent livelihoods are sustained. For the future, it will be important that more multi-disciplinary studies be carried out in different regions of the globe in order to gain more insight into both the needs as well as the capacities of elderly refugees in camps, and for the assistance agencies to design more responsive programmes

AB  - Australia has a long legacy of providing asylum to refugees who, it is now well established, suffer high rates of psychological and psychiatric problems requiring specialised treatment. In this paper we outline the special stressors faced by asylum-seekers who have not obtained formal refugee status and who are at risk of being forcibly repatriated. We suggest that the experiences they undergo in Australia, particularly that of prolonged detention, risk retraumatising an already vulnerable group. The implications for policy formulation are considered. [Author Abstract]

AB  - In the past, most refugees who permanently resettled in the traditional recipient countries of North America, Europe, and Australasia were screened prior to arrival in a host country. In the last decade, increasing numbers of unauthorized refugees or asylum seekers, those who formally lodge application for refugee status in the country in which they are residing, have applied for protection after crossing the borders of these countries. Concerns about uncontrolled migration have encouraged host countries to adopt policies of deterrence in which increasingly restrictive measures are being imposed on persons seeking asylum. These measures include, variously, confinement in detention centers, enforced dispersal within the community, the implementation of more stringent refugee determination procedures, and temporary forms of asylum. In several countries, asylum seekers living in the community face restricted access to work, education, housing, welfare, and, in some situations, to basic health care services. Allegations of abuse, untreated medical and psychiatric illnesses, suicidal behavior, hunger strikes, and outbreaks of violence among asylum seekers in detention centers have been reported. Although systematic research into the mental health of asylum seekers is in its infancy, and methods are limited by sampling difficulties, there is growing evidence that salient postmigration stress facing asylum seekers adds to the effect of previous trauma in creating risk of ongoing posttraumatic stress disorder and other psychiatric symptoms. The medical profession has a role in educating governments and the public about the potential risks of imposing excessively harsh policies of deterrence on the mental health of asylum seekers.

AB  - Examines the mental health consequences of contemporary Australian policies pertaining to asylum seekers and to consider the possible roles of psychiatrists in responding to this issue. Historical and political factors driving policy are considered. The results of Australian studies examining the mental health of asylum seekers are reviewed, finding that available research shows high rates of trauma, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression in asylum seekers. The conditions of the postmigration environment influence outcomes. Psychiatrists working with other agencies continue to advocate for this group. Important roles include the provision of clinical services, undertaking and disseminating research, acting as expert witnesses and consultants, and writing reports for refugee applicants. It is concluded that complex political motivations steer asylum policy. Psychiatric formulations are important in considering the impact of contemporary policy, but a wider ecological model is needed to understand acts of desperation displayed by asylum seekers, particularly those in long-term detention.

AB  - The final decades of the twentieth century were accompanied by an upsurge in the number of persons fleeing persecution and regional wars. To stem the flow of asylum seekers, several countries in the west introduced policies of deterrence, including detention. Although many countries detain asylum seekers, Australia has been unique in establishing a policy of mandatory, indefinite detention. The impact of prolonged detention on the mental health of asylum seekers drew commentary from mental health professionals soon after the policy was introduced, but administrators and politicians disputed the assertion that detention was a factor in causing or exacerbating mental disorder. This overview examines the impact of mandatory, indefinite detention on the mental health of asylum seekers by drawing on evidence gathered during Commissions of Inquiry, from observations of health and mental health professionals who have worked in detention centres, and from the small body of systematic research undertaken among immigration detainees. The data from all sources converge in demonstrating that prolonged detention has adverse mental health and psychosocial impacts on adults, families and children. Recent studies suggest that the mental health effects may be prolonged, extending well beyond the point of release into the community. The Australian experience offers general lessons to health professionals worldwide about the importance of remaining vigilant in protecting the rights of vulnerable groups, and more specifically, to ensure that the traumas that cause mental suffering in refugees are not compounded as a consequence of immigration policy decisions in recipient countries. Documentation and research can be vital in achieving policy change in these settings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB  - This article examines the detention of asylum seeking women and their children and demonstrates that this practice breaches human rights obligations and undermines the UK's policies on gender sensitivity and children's welfare. Case study research was carried out with a small cohort o f women with children who had experienced detention during their claim for asylum. Data were analysed thematically. The detention of women and their children who seek asylum is detrimental to mental and physical health and has long term implications for individuals and families. Detention was arbitrary and there was no evidence of the application of gender-sensitive guidelines. Principles of gender-sensitivity are important but when subsumed by politically expedient processes can seem little more than a cosmetic gesture towards women's and children's rights. The authors argue that immigration policy itself should be subject to impact assessments for its implications for women and children.

AB  - The impact of detention on psychological status, and quality of life was examined in a sample of 150 former refugee detainees from the Woomera Detention Centre now living in the Australian community. Detainees completed a psychological status inventory including the Truncated Assessment of Self-Destructive Thoughts (TASDT), the Quality of Life Inventory, the Suicidal Ideation Scale, and the Profile of Mood States. Former detainees reported their current status and retrospectively reported their status while detained. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB  - The present study examined the traumatic events and behavior symptoms of 46 unaccompanied refugee minors waiting for placement in an asylum center in Finland. Using all the clinical information available information about the refugee children's experiences before and during their flight and after their arrival in Finland was gathered. Children were evaluated with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). The refugee children had experienced a number of losses, separations, persecution, and threats. About half of the minors were functioning within clinical or borderline range when evaluated with the CBCL. Young age (< 15 years) was associated with more severe psychiatric problems. There was a lack of rehabilitative services, the staff ratio was very low and the time spent in the asylum center waiting for the placement decision was relatively long for these minors. Unaccompanied refugee minors are in a highly vulnerable situation. Younger refugee children are more vulnerable to emotional distress than older children. Current procedures for dealing with asylum-seekers may contribute to high level of stress and emotional symptoms in previously traumatized refugee children. A high level of social security and mental health care does not guarantee an appropriate level of care for unaccompanied refugee children.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Our aim was to examine suicidal behaviours among asylum seekers in Denmark MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective quantitative analysis of data from reports to the Danish Red Cross Asylum Department on suicidal behaviours among persons over 15 years of age in the period 2001-2003 and from 54 medical records of suicidal asylum seekers in Denmark in 2001 was carried out RESULTS: The number of suicide attempts by asylum seekers in 2001 was 3.4 times higher than by Danish residents. Furthermore, the rate of suicide attempts by asylum seekers grew in the following two years. Suicidal behaviours are most frequent among asylum seekers between 30 and 39 years of age. There are national differences. The preferred method of suicide attempt is intake of medicine. Stress-related diagnoses constitute three fourths of all diagnoses. One analysis suggests that the long waiting time (average 20.8 months) faced by asylum seekers combined with rejection of asylum cases may trigger a rapid suicidal reaction. Other factors may also be active, as 44% of suicide attempts occur within six months after arrival in the country DISCUSSION: The results are discussed in relation to other research on the vulnerability of refugees, immigrants and asylum seekers and also in relation to length of waiting time, growing mental morbidity and the increasing number of rejections of asylum applications during recent years, a period characterized by a reduction of staff at the asylum centers. It is recommended that prevention of suicidal behaviour shall be given higher legal and administrative priority

AB  - The possible mental health impact on asylum seekers of Australia's policy of mandatory detention is an issue of special relevance to health professionals and the public. Independent commissions of inquiry in Australia have found varying degrees of mental distress to be common in detained asylum seekers. Research studies in Australia and elsewhere suggest that detained asylum seekers may have suffered greater levels of past trauma than other refugees, and this may contribute to their mental health problems, with their detention providing a retraumatising environment. Studies are urgently required to examine the mental health consequences of detention, and to determine the effect of detention on acculturation and adaptation for asylum seekers subsequently released into the community.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To document the psychiatric status of a near complete sample of children and their families from one ethnic group held for an extended period of time in a remote immigration detention facility in Australia. METHOD: Structured psychiatric interviews were administered by three same-language speaking psychologists by phone to assess the lifetime and current psychiatric disorders among 10 families (14 adults and 20 children) held in immigration detention for more than two years. RESULTS: All adults and children met diagnostic criteria for at least one current psychiatric disorder with 26 disorders identified among 14 adults, and 52 disorders among 20 children. Retrospective comparisons indicated that adults displayed a threefold and children a tenfold increase in psychiatric disorder subsequent to detention. Exposure to trauma within detention was commonplace. All adults and the majority of children were regularly distressed by sudden and upsetting memories about detention, intrusive images of events that had occurred, and feelings of sadness and hopelessness. The majority of parents felt they were no longer able to care for, support, or control their children. CONCLUSIONS: Detention appears to be injurious to the mental health of asylum seekers. IMPLICATIONS: The level of exposure to violence and the high level of mental illness identified among detained families provides a warning to policy makers about the potentially damaging effects of prolonged detention on asylum seekers. In their attempt to manage the international asylum crisis, it is important that Western countries do not inadvertently implement policies that cause further harm. [Author Abstract]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Over the past decade, developed Western countries have supplied increasingly stringent measures to discourage those seeking asylum. AIMS: To investigate the longer-term mental health effects of mandatory detention and subsequent temporary protection on refugees. METHOD: Lists of names provided by community leaders were supplemented by snowball sampling to recruit 241 Arabic-speaking Mandaean refugees in Sydney (60% of the total adult Mandaean population). Interviews assessed PTSD, major depressive episodes, and indices of stress related to past trauma, detention, and temporary protection. RESULTS: A multilevel model which included age, gender, family clustering, pre-migration trauma, and length of residency revealed that past immigration detention and ongoing temporary protection each contributed independently to risk of ongoing PTSD, depression, and mental health-related disability. Longer detention was associated with more severe mental disturbance, an effect that persisted for an average of 3 years after release. CONCLUSIONS: Policies of detention and temporary protection appear to be detrimental to the longer-term mental health of refugees. [Author Abstract]

AB  - Abstract: Australia has been at the forefront of implementing immigration policies that aim to limit the flow of asylum seekers over recent decades. Two controversial polices have been the use of immigration detention for unauthorized arrivals and the issuing of temporary protection visas (TPVs) for refugees who arrived without valid visas. We conducted a longitudinal survey over 2 years commencing in 2003 of 104 consecutive refugees from Iran and Afghanistan attending a state-wide early intervention program in New South Wales. The sample included those released from immigration detention on TPVs (n�=�47) and others granted permanent protection visas prior to entering Australia (PPVs, n�=�57). Psychological symptoms were assessed at baseline and follow-up by the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ), the Hopkins symptom checklist-25 (HSCL), the GHQ-30 and the Penn State Worry Questionnaires (PSWQ). English language competency, daily living difficulties and coping-related activities were also assessed. The results indicated that TPVs had higher baseline scores than PPVs on the HTQ PTSD scale, the HSCL scales, and the GHQ. ANCOVA models adjusting for baseline symptom scores indicated an increase in anxiety, depression and overall distress for TPVs whereas PPVs showed improvement over time. PTSD remained high at follow-up for TPVs and low amongst PPVs with no significant change over time. The TPVs showed a significant increase in worry at follow-up. TPVs showed no improvement in their English language skills and became increasingly socially withdrawn whereas PPVs exhibited substantial language improvements and became more socially engaged. TPV holders also reported persistently higher levels of distress in relation to a wide range of post-migration living difficulties whereas PPVs reported few problems in meeting these resettlement challenges. The data suggest a pattern of growing mental distress, ongoing resettlement difficulties, social isolation, and difficulty in the acculturation process amongst refugees subject to restrictive immigration policies.

AB  - Introduction: Studies point to an adverse effect of detention on the mental health of asylum seekers, yet the use of detention has been rising in several recipient countries. In general, many asylum seekers suffer from psychological disorders and symptoms, and a large percentage has been subjected to torture. The UNHCR recommends that torture survivors generally should not be detained. Due to a lack of systematic screening it is often unknown whether the asylum seeker is a torture survivor. This causes several hindrances for the protection of this vulnerable group from potentially harmful factors such as deprivation of liberty. Objectives: To examine the impact of detention on the mental health of adult torture survivors. Aims: To produce a comprehensive review of the literature and bring attention to a potentially harmful praxis. Methods: The systematic review follows the PRISMA guidelines. The search was made in PubMed (Medline), PsychINFO, PILOTS and IBSS. A screening of reference lists identified additional studies. The search was broadened to �_~asylum seekers�_T as very few studies were found on torture survivors specifically. Results: Presently (Oct. 2012) the review is in the stage of analyzing, thus results are preliminary. Currently the identified studies amount to 26. All studies report mental health problems among the asylum seekers and some identify detention itself as a contributing factor to these problems. Conclusions: Detention does pose a risk factor in regard to deteriorating the mental health of asylum seekers. Although torture survivors might be an especially vulnerable group, research is almost non-existent.

AB  - Background: The unaccompanied foreign children migrate taking with them traumatic and extremely painful experiences. About the correlation between trauma and subjective psychological state, from a clinical perspective, studies found that the structuring of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or its associated symptoms (anxiety, depression and dissociative tendencies) is one of the dysfunctional outcomes related to the exposure to traumatic events. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the presence of PTSD or symptoms associated with it (anxiety, depression and dissociative tendencies) within a group of unaccompanied minors living in emergency reception centers and residential communities for minors seeking asylum in Bari. The second aim is to verify the presence of statistically significant differences concerning the presence of symptoms related to or associated with PTSD as a function of the residence time in the community, focusing on the therapeutic value of community settings with respect to the symptomatology referred above. Methodology and Results: The data show the presence of symptoms related to PTSD, and the Chi-Square analysis underlines how these are distributed in a statistically significant manner in relation to the time spent in the community. The presence of depressive symptoms changes in relation to the time spent in the community but its distribution is not significant. Finally, there are no change in data about anxiety and dissociative tendencies in the three times considered. Conclusions: The results of the study show the presence of symptoms related to PTSD, anxiety, depression and dissociation in the research sample. These data underline the potentially stressful effect and the psychopathological risk of child migration, confirming the literature about the correlation between the status of unaccompanied foreign children, the traumatic experiences and the development of symptoms related to PTSD. Furthermore, in the sample, the specific symptomatology emerges in those children who live in communities from more than six months but less than a year, and it declines in minors who stay in residential contexts from more than one year. In conclusion, these data underscore the functional role of prolonged educational interventions acted in communities with respect to the specific symptoms examined. In this way, the permanence in communities organized on the model of the global therapeutic environment has therapeutic effects on pathological experiences of the persons involved.

The mental health of 116 Persian-speaking refugees on temporary and permanent protection visas who attended an early intervention program in Sydney, New South Wales in 2002 was assessed. While both groups had lived in Australia for about three months, many on temporary visas had been held in immigration detention for the previous 12 months

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the short-term impact of a group crisis intervention for children aged 9-15 years from five refugee camps in the Gaza Strip during ongoing war conflict. Children were selected if they reported moderate to severe posttraumatic stress reactions, and were allocated to group intervention (N = 47) encouraging expression of experiences and emotions through storytelling, drawing, free play and role-play; education about symptoms (N = 22); or no intervention (N = 42). Children completed the CPTSD-RI and the CDI pre-and post-intervention. No significant impact of the group intervention was established on children's posttraumatic or depressive symptoms. Possible explanations of the findings are discussed, including the continuing exposure to trauma and the non-active nature of the intervention.

T1  - The immigration stress experiences, acculturation levels, and PTSD symptoms differences between Vietnamese political refugees and Vietnamese immigrants [dissertation]

AB  - Vietnamese Americans are the fourth largest Asian American group in the United States. There are two groups of individuals who have immigrated to the United States from Vietnam: refugees and immigrants. These two groups share the same ethnicity, language, customs, etc., but they differ in their experiences in coming to the U.S. Refugees often witnessed traumatic events of the Vietnam war, the horrendous conditions of the boats and refugee camps, and came to the U.S. with insufficient knowledge of the English language to start a new life. Immigrants usually chose to immigrate for better economic opportunities and tended to have existing family members already in the U.S. that could provide them with the social support. This dissertation focuses on these two particular groups by comparing their immigration experiences and relating them to PTSD symptoms. Three hypotheses were developed: (a) Refugees will report more stress than will immigrants, (b) Refugees will report more PTSD symptoms than will immigrants, and, (c) Immigrants will be more acculturated than refugees. These hypotheses were tested using three measures: (a) Four-Dimensional Symptom Questionnaire, (b) Harvard Trauma Questionnaire, and (c) Behavioral Acculturation Scale. This study was a quasi-experimental design and an independent sample t test was used to test the hypotheses. The results of this dissertation supported all three hypotheses: Vietnamese refugees reported more stress than did immigrants, Vietnamese refugees reported more PTSD symptoms than did immigrants, and Vietnamese immigrants were more acculturated than were refugees. Several limitations of this study were discussed, such as lack of diversity in sample size due to age, religious affiliation, and geographical locations. This research provides additional information that may help explain Vietnamese refugees and immigrants' experiences and beliefs that could affect their mental health seeking behaviors.

AB  - The possible mental health impact on asylum seekers of Australia's policy of mandatory detention is an issue of special relevance to health professionals and the public. Independent commissions of inquiry in Australia have found varying degrees of mental distress to be common in detained asylum seekers. Research studies in Australia and elsewhere suggest that detained asylum seekers may have suffered greater levels of past trauma than other refugees, and this may contribute to their mental health problems, with their detention providing a retraumatising environment. Studies are urgently required to examine the mental health consequences of detention, and to determine the effect of detention on acculturation and adaptation for asylum seekers subsequently released into the community.

We analyzed the medical care policies and procedures for immigrants in detention, government reports on detainee medical care, and available mortality and morbidity data. We conclude that the current system of medical care for this vulnerable population needs improvement. We suggest that a federal legislative solution is one essential component to address this issue and improve medical care. Principles to be embodied in a legislative proposal necessary to address the inadequacies in the current system are presented

AB  - This study focused on the relationship between trauma and financial and physical well-being of Cambodian refugees in the United States. Trauma was defined by three variables: whether or not trauma had been experienced in Cambodia, the number of traumas experienced, and the number of years spent in refugee camps. It was hypothesized that these trauma variables would predict financial and physical health among Cambodians in the United States. A discriminant analysis showed significant relationships between the trauma variables and current employment status, and multiple regression analyses showed that trauma predicted income and physical health.

AB  - Examined the mental health and psychosocial problems of Sri Lankan Tamils living in refugee camps in South India. 51 Ss (aged 16�_"67 yrs) completed the Hopkins Symptom Checklist�_"58 (L. R. Derogatis et al, 1974) and participated in interviews concerning personal loss, personal traumatic experiences, negative feelings, living in camps, and the availability of support. Results show that the mental health of Ss was poor. Living in camps had resolved most fears of being harmed but Ss suffered from survival guilt, grief, loss of dignity, shame, uncertainty, and other negative feelings. Those who had experienced personal trauma scored higher concerning posttraumatic stress disorder. Findings suggest that easily accessible counseling centers with counselors who have the same cultural background as the refugees are needed.

AB  - Children of asylum seekers are at risk for psychosocial problems because of their flight history and exceptional living circumstances. This study aims to assess the association of sociodemographic factors and asylum procedural factors with psychosocial problems of asylum seekers' children, and differences herein by informant (parents, teachers, and children). To this end, we obtained data on psychosocial problems among a random sample of 267 children aged 4 to 16, living in Dutch asylum seekers' centers, using the multi-informant Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire. The results show that the prevalence rate of psychosocial problems among asylum seekers' children was high. The occurrence was not associated with asylum-procedural variables but only with child-contextual factors such as mental health of the mother and leaving behind a parent in the country of origin. The associations varied in strength by informant. Therefore, preventive and supportive measures to improve psychosocial health of young asylum-seekers should concentrate on these contextual issues.

AB  - Detained immigrants may be especially vulnerable in terms of their health because of past and present circumstances, and may lack entitlements to care due to their legal situation. This exploratory mixed methods study aimed to test the usefulness of a questionnaire among former detainees in examining perceptions of their health needs and access to care in UK immigration detention (immigration removal centres). 30 former detainees completed questionnaires, and 27 of these also participated in semi-structured interviews, in June/July 2010; all had been released from detention in the past 12 months. The article describes the study methodology and presents the results, reporting on findings about pre-existing health issues, health issues in detention, access to health care services, and medication. The results showed that 66% of the participants entered detention with pre-existing mental or physical health conditions that required ongoing or new treatments, and that a variety of physical and mental health needs arose during detention. The phrasing and content of the questionnaire and interview guide were also tested and developed in preparation for an intended larger study. The authors conclude that access to health care in detention was often problematic in its effectiveness or availability, and that the results cast doubt on how appropriately the mental and physical health needs of detainees are provided for within the current UK detention estate

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Our aim was to examine suicidal behaviours among asylum seekers in Denmark. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective quantitative analysis of data from reports to the Danish Red Cross Asylum Department on suicidal behaviours among persons over 15 years of age in the period 2001-2003 and from 54 medical records of suicidal asylum seekers in Denmark in 2001 was carried out. RESULTS: The number of suicide attempts by asylum seekers in 2001 was 3.4 times higher than by Danish residents. Furthermore, the rate of suicide attempts by asylum seekers grew in the following two years. Suicidal behaviours are most frequent among asylum seekers between 30 and 39 years of age. There are national differences. The preferred method of suicide attempt is intake of medicine. Stress-related diagnoses constitute three fourths of all diagnoses. One analysis suggests that the long waiting time (average 20.8 months) faced by asylum seekers combined with rejection of asylum cases may trigger a rapid suicidal reaction. Other factors may also be active, as 44% of suicide attempts occur within six months after arrival in the country. DISCUSSION: The results are discussed in relation to other research on the vulnerability of refugees, immigrants, and asylum seekers and also in relation to length of waiting time, growing mental morbidity, and the increasing number of rejections of asylum applications during recent years, a period characterized by a reduction of staff at the asylum centers. It is recommended that prevention of suicidal behaviour shall be given higher legal and administrative priority. [Author Abstract]

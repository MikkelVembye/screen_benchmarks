AB  - Randa Farah provides a corrective to the stereotypical images portrayed in the West of Palestinian women. Based on fieldwork conducted in the late 1990s in al-Baq'a refugee camp, she underscores how women defend and reproduce notions of 'women', 'home' and 'homeland' to generate further debate and contribute to the dialogue on women's role in carving, defending and re-appropriating places

AB  - Questions of asylum and immigration have taken Centre stage in national and international debate and figure prominently in the domestic political agendas of wealthy states and nations. In Australia, Europe and the US, harsh and punitive asylum and immigration laws are being enacted incrementally and asylum-seekers are subject increasingly to detention. Through a focus on the detention of asylum-seekers in the UK, this article makes a critical intervention in current theoretical debates around asylum. Focusing on the writing of Giorgio Agamben, this article suggests that within political and cultural theory, there has been a turn to the figure of the asylum-seeker (and the refugee) as a trope for theorizing the political constitution of the present. By opening up a critical dialogue between humanitarian, media studies and abstract theoretical accounts of immigration detention, this article produces a critique of the ways in which theory appropriates the figure of the asylum-seeker

AB  - While members of the southern Sudanese Dinka tribe converted to Christianity in large numbers in the early 1990s, the Lost Boys, a largely Dinka group of young men who were separated from their families during the Sudanese civil war in the late 1980s, had a distinct conversion experience in refugees camps. Using first-person interviews and participant observation with a group of Lost Boys resettled in Denver, and historical and ethnographic data, this research seeks to explain why the Lost Boys converted to Christianity and the role that it played in their identity in refugee camps in Ethiopia and Kenya, and continues to play in their lives in Denver. Findings include the Lost Boys' need to adapt to radically changed circumstances that separated them from the central components of their lives--their families, villages, and cattle--and retention of the Dinka values of pragmatism and group autonomy, which allowed the Lost Boys to accept the once foreign practice of Christianity

AB  - This is the story of Azeldin, a Libyan who came with his family to Britain as an asylum seeker and was eventually granted refugee status. Life was not easy for Azeldin. He spent time in a detention centre and suffered a period of depression. He and his family were given sub-standard housing. Although several organisations tried to help him, it wasn�_Tt until a friend suggested that he should visit the Manchester Refugee Support Network that his life really began to improve. With their support, he was able to access services to get his family on a more solid footing. He now works with the Support Network and helps other refugee families to get established in this country. Describing the challenges of connecting asylum seekers and refugees with services, the video gives us a look at some of the work being done to support and advise members of these communities

AB  - The aim of this research was to examine and develop the evidence for good practice in social care for asylum seekers and refugees in order to develop a resource guide for social care practice in this area. Services for adults, older people, children and families across England, Wales and Northern Ireland were considered. The research comprised a focused literature review and a practice survey. The practice survey explored current practice in this area through 6 focus groups with asylum seekers and refugees; a national survey of 525 organisations including local authorities, care group organisations and refugee and community organisations; and follow up fieldwork. The findings are used to provide an overview of the social care needs of asylum seekers and refugees and to identify suggested good practice in meeting needs. Areas for suggested good practice are made under the headings: ensuring access; effective communication and advocacy; comprehensive needs-led assessment; personalised high-quality service provision; facilitating self-organisation and innovation. Six critical steps were identified to provide a foundation for this practice: securing organisational commitment to promoting the wellbeing of asylum seekers and refugees; the development of strong multiagency partnerships with a clear focus on asylum seekers and refugees; the development of a local strategy based on a joint strategic needs assessment to enable the planning and development of services; methods for engaging with and involving asylum seekers and refugees in the development of services; workforce development; and regular monitoring and review. Policy, practice and research implications are discussed

AB  - This article focuses on the sanctuary movement that have assisted Central American political refugees in the U.S. Undocumented persons originate from virtually every country in the world and typically enter the United States via the Canadian and Mexican borders. The majority of undocumented persons journey to this country for purely economic reasons. However, in recent years an increasing number of individuals have sought entry to the United States because of fear of death, torture, or imprisonment at home. Many persons who flee to the United States for political reasons begin their journey in El Salvador or Guatemala. In response to a U.S. immigration policy that seldom allows legal sanctuary for such political exiles, a sanctuary movement and underground railroad have assisted several thousand Central American political refugees with border crossings, resettlement, jobs, medical and dental care, and other services. Social workers are volunteers in this underground railroad in a western city near the Mexican border. Also serving in the movement are hundreds of other volunteers from various walks of life. In addition to direct assistance to political refugees, the sanctuary movement has recruited over 160 U.S. churches and synagogues that have been publicly declared as sanctuaries. The movement has successfully involved journalists who participate in border crossings and later publish their accounts

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and the predictive factors amongst immigrants entering prison METHODS: prospective study conducted in May and June of 2009. The tuberculin skin test (TST) was performed, with induration of >= 10 mm being regarded as positive. Variables collected were: age, origin, number of incarcerations, length of time living in Spain, heroin and cocaine consumption, intravenous drug use and HIV infection. The rate of LTBI was calculated and the overall infection rate (ITL and history of TB). To study predictable factors, a bivariant and multivariant analysis were carried out using logistic regression RESULTS: 152 male immigrants. Average age: 31.9 years +/- 7.8; 37.2% of them with heroin or cocaine consumption and 7.5% IDU. 12 patients were previously TST positive and 6 patients had history of TB. TST was performed on 134 people, 63 with positive results and 71 with negative ones. ITL rate: 49.3. Overall infection rate: 53.3%. Bivariate associated with LTBI: more than one incarceration (67.4% vs. 36.4% in primary, p=0.001), age (76% >= 40 vs. 40.4% under this age and heroin and cocaine consumption (60% consumers vs. 39.3% non consumers; p=0.02. Multivariate analysis only confirmed the association with age (p=0.001; OR: 2.34, IC=1.39-3.94) CONCLUSIONS: The LTBI rate amongst immigrants entering prison is very high. A complete study is recommended for all of them, with special attention being paid to the most vulnerable ones, such as older people

AB  - This purpose of this qualitative descriptive single case study was to describe patterns of relationship in community between an American nongovernmental organization (NGO), its field staff, primarily nurses, and refugees as they interacted in a work-centered relationship (WCR) in a refugee camp at the Thai-Cambodian border. At least 50,000 NGOs provide services to approximately 27 million refugees and internally displaced persons throughout the world. NGOs approach relationship with refugees in different ways depending on their mission. Relationship, key to nursing, shapes self-perception, helps people find meaning, and relationship between nurses and communities affects health. Data were gathered from in-depth interviews with NGO leaders (N = 4) and from organizational documents (>140). Measures, such as member checking, were taken to insure trustworthiness. Data were analyzed using a systematic process of content analysis, guided by a conceptual framework of relationship in community and a study definition of relationship. The goal of the WCR was to improve the lives of refugees in the short and long-term. Results depicted a strong relationship with prominent patterns of refugee self-reliance and advocacy that endured in a particularly harsh circumstance. As a result of the WCR over 400 refugees delivered effective health care to a camp of up to 85,000 people over a 13-year period with the assistance of a total of 235 field staff (122 RNs). In addition and as a result of this WCR the NGO gained its permanent philosophy and refugees were able to use their work experience in significant ways upon their return to Cambodia. As a result of this study, the concept of Relationship in Community has been explicated and effectively applied to guide research. This study points out the significance of relationship as a phenomenon affecting human life. As a result of this study work-centered relationship between Western health care professionals and refugees is better understood, and one way to enact such relationship has been made explicit, offering understanding of the possibilities and limitations within such relationship

AB  - BACKGROUND: Internally displaced persons (IDPs) are one of the largest at-risk populations in the world. Nurses provide health services to IDPs as staff of non-governmental organizations (NGO). IDPs are also employed to deliver NGO services. The way that NGOs and field staff (nurses and others) interact with employed IDPs can enhance or diminish IDP quality of life AIM: This report describes patterns of relationships in a community formed by an American NGO, its field staff and IDPs as they worked together in a refugee camp at the Thai-Cambodian border over 13 years METHODS: This qualitative case study describes relational patterns from the NGO perspective. Content analysis was used to process data from in-depth interviews with organizational leaders (n = 4) and organizational documents (n = 234) FINDINGS: A health care training and service mission, carried out between an NGO, its field staff and IDPs, was based on a philosophy that turned programme activity and authority over to IDP staff. Over 400 IDPs, assisted by 235 field staff, delivered effective health care to 85,000 people over 13 years CONCLUSIONS: Work-centred relationships between NGOs, field staff and IDPs are significant; they can be consciously created to promote effective, autonomous IDP management of health care

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to apply a stress model drawn from the literature to the relief and social service workers who have been active in refugee camps for a prolonged period of time. Working in difficult environments, social service workers deliver essential services to refugee populations around the world. A model of four work-stress determinants-tasks, management, appreciation and collaboration-was tested on 274 social workers in five regions of the Middle East (Jordan, Lebanon and Syria, as well as the occupied Palestinian territories of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank). Statistical fit indices were adequate but two relationships were statistically insignificant. The collaboration variable was dropped to create a modified model with tasks indirectly and management and appreciation directly affecting work-related stress. The five direct relationships and two indirect relationships of this modified model are consistent with stress theory, and all relationships-direct and indirect-are statistically significant.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the incidence of Reiter's syndrome aboard The Golden Venture, a ship carrying illegal immigrants from China to the United States METHODS: After identification of an index case, we conducted telephone interviews with medical staff at immigrant detention centers in Pennsylvania, New York, and Virginia. When a potential case was identified at one facility, we performed a site inspection, reviewing the medical records of all detainees and performing histories and physicals on all those with joint and/or ocular complaints RESULTS: We identified two patients, both HLA B27 positive, with Reiter's syndrome. The observed incidence (0.87%) approximated the predicted incidence but may have underestimated the actual incidence. We review the history of shipboard Reiter's syndrome, and discuss the pathogenic roles of HLA B27 and particular infectious agents CONCLUSION: Continued transportation of illegal immigrants from China and other parts of the world is likely to result in occasional clusters of Reiter's syndrome. Physicians treating immigrant populations should remain aware of the possibility of reactive arthritis

AB  - A rise in crime among immigrants has allegedly occurred in Europe over the last decades. This article aimed to explore the reasons for this phenomenon. A study collected data regarding the number of non-nationals in prison in 18 main countries in Western Europe. The findings show that the non-national share in the Western European prison population more than doubled between 1985 and 2005 reaching close to 30% over the last few years. Non-national shares of the prison population are found to be out of proportion when compared to the resident population. With regard to offences, high non-national percentages are seen among people charged with homicide, rape, theft, and robbery. However, the findings also show that the share in crime figures varies greatly from country to country. The article argues that the present increase in non-national crime involvement is not associated with immigration per se, but with the contexts in which immigration occurs and features of the immigration inflow. Immigration, therefore, is not tantamount to high crime rates, and some countries show that it is possible to keep immigrant crime under control. The increase of non-national crime involvement in some European countries seems to be related to a low level of legality and scare rule of law, with the concomitant corruption and exploitation of the weaknesses of immigrants via the hidden economy

All male refugees (aged 15-35 yrs) convicted of violent crimes completed surveys; additionally, 6 prisoners completed interviews, as did prison welfare assistants. Other collected data included court records and other trial documents. Results show that violent acts may be committed when somebody has been exposed to an intolerable amount of physical or psychic pressure; such acts are then committed as a means of regaining control.

AB  - At least five people were killed when a salvo of mortar shells intended for Somalia's presidential palace missed and landed on a nearby refugee camp, residents and the African Union's peacekeeping force said Monday. Shabab militants said they fired more than a dozen mortar shells at the presidential compound in Mogadishu, their second such attack in less than a week. Paddy Ankunda, a spokesman for the African Union force, said some mortar rounds crashed into a camp for Somalis displaced by war and famine about 500 yards from the presidential palace.

Abduallahi Moalim, a Somali military commander, said government soldiers in the Lower Juba region that borders Kenya stopped a vehicle carrying supplies for the attackers on Sunday and seized three of the occupants who directed the force to where the hostages were being held. Col. Cyrus Oguna, a spokesman for Kenya's military, said the two forces then carried out a joint rescue operation. Colonel Oguna said that the aid workers were not hurt, but that one gunman was killed. The aid workers are employed by the Norwegian Refugee Council.

AB  - A World Food Program handout of corn rations to Somalis trying to survive a famine turned deadly Friday after government troops opened fire, killing at least seven people, witnesses said. Residents of a famine refugee camp in Mogadishu said soldiers started the chaos by trying to steal some of the food. Refugees joined in the scramble, prompting soldiers to open fire, the witnesses said. ''They fired on us as if we were their enemy,'' said Abidyo Geddi, a refugee. ''When people started to take the food, then the gunfire started and everyone was being shot. We cannot stay here much longer. We don't get much food, and the rare food they bring causes death and torture.''

AB  - In 1963, the Muluki Ain (the Law of the Land) was changed in accordance with the provisions of the country's constitution. Under present law, discrimination on the basis of religion, race, sex, caste, or tribe is forbidden; and the reformation of offenders is an important goal. Forced labor, exile, and the death penalty (except for treason and offenses under the Army Act) have been abolished; and 'life imprisonment' is actually a sentence of 20 years or less, depending on the inmate's behavior. Prisoners now receive medical services, reading materials, and opportunities for education and skill -oriented training. Criminal liability laws provide that 8-to 12-year-olds may receive up to 2 months imprisonment; 12-to 16-year-olds may receive one-half the adult sentences; and those over 16 are treated as adults. The role of the police has also changed. Formerly, they were responsible only for the maintenance of law and order; today, their duties also include the control and investigation of crime, the collection of evidence, the regulation of public assemblies, and traffic services. Together with a district attorney, the police prepare formal accusations against offenders. Suspects must be brought before a district court for the setting of bail and dates for preliminary hearings within 24 hours of their arrest, and trials must be completed within 6 to 12 months, depending upon the distance of the nearest court from the scene of the crime. Suspects are guaranteed the right to defense by lawyers of their own choosing, and legal aid is available to poor persons. All trials are open to the public. Following crimes, citizens are required to participate in 'spot investigations' and reveal any knowledge they may have of criminal activities. Efforts at crime prevention through social reform include the prohibition of job discrimination and the redistribution of land to the rural poor. References or footnotes are not included

With nearly 3000 fossil and subfossil records, it is one of the most frequent mammals in the Late Quaternary. 2. During the Middle and Late Weichselian Pleniglacial, the distribution of the roe deer was not restricted to the Mediterranean peninsulas but repeatedly reached regions of central Europe. In contrast to that, roe deer records from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 21.0�_"14.5 ka 14C BP) are largely confined to the Mediterranean peninsulas �_" with the exception of south-western France and the surroundings of the Carpathians where several records attest to its occurrence during the LGM. 3. During the Greenland Interstadial 1 (12.5�_"10.8 ka 14C BP), the species' distribution extended further north and the roe deer appeared north of the Alps and reached regions of central Germany. This seems to be correlated with the abrupt change to more favourable environmental conditions during this period. It is very likely that the roe deer disappeared north of the Alps during the Younger Dryas cooling (10.8�_"10.0 ka14C BP). The northern regions of the central European lowlands were recolonized by roe deer during the late Preboreal 9.7�_"9.5 ka 14C BP for the first time since the Weichselian Glacial. 4. The combined pattern of genetic data and fossil records of European roe deer suggests several regions in the Iberian peninsula, southern France, Italy and the Balkans as well as in the Carpathians and/or eastern Europe as glacial refugia. It further suggests that C. capreolus might have recolonized most parts of central-northern Europe out of one or more eastern European (not Balkan) and/or Carpathian refugia. This recolonization wave might have blocked immigration from the traditional Mediterranean areas.

T1  - SETTING AND THE SEARCH FOR IDENTITY: THE VICTORIAN MATURATION NOVEL

AB  - The rites of passage dramatized by the Victorian maturation novel, or Bildungsroman, depict a youthful protagonist' discovery that his coming of age is very much a question of how best to adapt his own ideals to the values of society. Forging an identity is thus as much a social question as a personal one, and the interaction between protagonist and society must be viewed as the central concern of the nineteenth century maturation novel. Previous studies of the genre by Susanne Howe and Jerome H. Buckley have sought other quarry. Howe's Wilhelm Meister and His English Kinsmen stresses the self-conscious aspect of maturation while Buckley's Season of Youth concentrates upon the "autobiographical matrix" out of which most maturation novels grow. It is setting which becomes the significant narrative technique for delineating the relationship between the maturing youth and his society, serving a doubly important function. Setting not only depicts the physical world of the protagonist's search for identity, but also conveys the increasing hostility of that world, an antagonism which reflects the fragmenting society of the late 1800s. Predictably, the search for identity comes to resemble a quest, one with obstacles largely produced by the conflict between the individual and society; this conflict is realized through a figurative use of setting which obliquely comments upon the characters' maturation. In this opportunity to comment indirectly, thus avoiding complete reliance upon overt value judgment, resides the extreme usefulness of setting as a narrative technique in the maturation novel. The major Victorian maturation novels make such dual use of setting to anchor their narratives in a palpably real world and to record observations about both that world and its inhabitants. In David Copperfield and Pendennis setting functions primarily as a means of depicting the world of the protagonists' successful quests for identity, its figurative use as commentary on the quest being at a minimum. The different nature of the obstacles society places in the path of women accounts for the greater emphasis upon figurative settings--in a pattern of imprisonment and escape to safety--in Jane Eyre, a novel which nevertheless also concludes with the protagonist's successful completion of her initiatory rites. In the maturation novels of the 1860s the false values of a materialistic society become concrete in settings such as Satis House in Great Expectations, St. Ogg's in The Mill on the Floss, and even Raynham Abbey in The Ordeal of Richard Feverel. Setting still comments upon the protagonist's quest: for Pip maturity will come when he learns to judge character by deed rather than by surroundings; for Maggie maturity relies upon her ability to forsake her need for self-created refuges and instead face her world squarely; for Richard maturity means escape from Raynham, an escape satirized by Meredith's extensive figurative use of setting. In the era's final maturation novels, a successful quest for identity is no longer possible. The world of these novels is typically an overtly hostile, or at best merely indifferent, one. Obstacles to the quest abound in an intensified pattern of incarceration and flight until only total disengagement from society can provide any means for survival. Although Tess Durbeyfield and Jude Fawley cannot so disengage themselves, Samuel Butler's Ernest Pontifex and H. G. Wells's George Ponderevo can. The portrait of the decay of Victorian society in Wells's Tono-Bungay heralds the lessening importance of the social dimension of the maturation novel; the functions of setting described here are replaced by other techniques more germane to the increasingly psychological interest of later maturation novels

AB  - This dissertation focuses on children's psychological and behavioral responses to war trauma, specifically on 182 Cambodian refugee adolescents, ages 12 and 13, who were survivors of the Pol Pot regime and residents of the Site Two refugee camp in Thailand. Subjects were exposed to prolonged war trauma conditions consisting of deprivations of food, water, shelter, and medical care; witnessing the death of family or friends; exposure to shelling and bombing; imprisonment; beatings and injuries; and separation from family. Unlike past studies on children, war trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder, this study systematically tests the relationship between specific war trauma events and psychological and behavioral problems, assessed via a culturally sensitive survey and a self-evaluation instrument, the Youth Self Report (YSR) (Achenbach, 1991). The objectives of this study are to determine the relationship between the total number of behavior problems, chronic problems, and tendencies toward internalizing/externalizing behaviors (from the YSR) with specific war trauma events, levels of trauma, and children's total trauma experience and to identify a set of culture-specific syndromes including a culture-specific trauma syndrome. The Cambodian refugee children in this subject sample had more behavior and psychological problems than the children in Achenbach's normative Western sample. The expectation that Cambodian refugee children use internalization to express their behaviors and emotions was confirmed. Contrary to expectations, the number of war trauma events and levels of war trauma were not highly correlated with the total number of problems experienced. However, a principal component analysis and varimax rotation conducted on the individual behavior problem items listed in the YSR yielded 11 culture- and war-specific syndromes. Correlations of the 11 syndromes with trauma confirmed a culture-specific trauma syndrome for the children in this sample. This 20-item syndrome consisted of symptoms of hyperactivity, poor concentration, attention-seeking behaviors, and fearfulness. Nightmares, a pathognomic symptom of the DSM III-R diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder and a universal indicator of emotional distress in children, correlated highly with level of trauma and with the trauma syndrome as did specific war trauma events with the syndrome scores on the YSR and the trauma syndrome

AB  - Many Korean church leaders have noted the serious membership leakage of the second generation (SG) Koreans from Korean immigrant churches. The purpose of this research was to describe the patterns of religious participation among the SG Koreans in Toronto. The study probed into the nature and extent of their church participation. It also explored the relationship between church participation and the following factors: growing up in the Korean immigrant church, parental influence on spirituality, view of the Korean immigrant church, pluralistic influence during university years, and ethnic identity. The research was a descriptive study that utilized the methods of telephone survey and ethnographic interview. The telephone survey of 278 SG Korean adults who were raised in the Christian home revealed that 32.0% were still actively involved in church activities while 28.8% were only nominally involved and 39.2% were inactive (or left the church). The successful retention rate of 32.0% was alarmingly low when compared to other counterpart groups. The ethnographic interviews also revealed that the cultural rigidity of the FG Koreans was one of the major factors associated with the serious membership leakage of the SG Koreans, a phenomenon known as 'the Silent Exodus.' The present study confirms the emerging SG Korean sub-culture, which is distinct from the FG Korean and the North American cultures. It also predicts that the SG membership leakage will continue to occur unless appropriate measures are taken. The implications of the study include (1) the implementation of effective structural change to accommodate the emerging SG Korean sub-culture, (2) focus on ministry to the FG parents toward effective Christian nurturing of their children and (3) a call for more intergenerational communication and participation, as well as inter-ethnic fellowship

AB  - This study examines the effects of conflict and international humanitarian responses on forced migration in Sub-Saharan Africa between 1980 and 2007. In facing violent conflicts, not all people leave their homes. Some people decide to stay. Some people seek a refuge outside their countries while others stay inside their countries. Some displaced people become involved in military actions while others stay in humanitarian camps with the assistance of the international community. In other words, forced migration is not determined by preconditions, but is precipitated by a political process through which forced migrants affect processes and outcomes of forced migration by making decisions about whether to leave, to cross international borders, and/or to become involved in military actions. Forced migrants make decisions, with their constrained freedom of choice, not only based on their expectations of being victimized but also based on their expectations of being assisted by the international community. Multi-methods of a count data analysis, a fractional data analysis, and a comparative case analysis, combined with a game theory approach, are all applied to the investigation of these choices. Empirical findings are as follows. First, conflict and political violence in a country are dominant factors, but international humanitarian assistance reduces the likelihood that a country that once produced forced migrants will produce additional forced migrants. Second, as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) expands its mandates from conventional refugees to include internally displaced persons (IDPs), the ratio of refugees decreases because displaced people find a refuge with the help of UNHCR-involved field operations inside their countries. Third, while international humanitarian assistance and effective protection have contributed to maintaining the humanitarian character of refugee camps in Dadaab, Kenya, the access of international humanitarian agencies to IDPs in Darfur, Sudan, has been very limited, which has led to a higher level of camp militarization. Although governments politicize and securitize refugees and IDPs, they can hardly refuse the international humanitarian operations within their territories. From this study, two general lessons can be learned: not all international relations are determined by the principle of reciprocity among sovereign states, and the growing awareness of international norms regarding human rights and human security is important to forced migration and international relations

AB  - This comparative case study examines to what extent government's attitudes toward forced migrants and the levels of international humanitarian field operations and protection services have affected the likelihood that the Dadaab refugee camp in Kenya and the internally displaced persons (IDP) camps in Darfur, Sudan, are militarized. The main findings of this study are as follows. First, the level of militarization is affected by the response of the host government, as each government in Kenya and Sudan tries to securitize refugees and IDPs. Second, protracted refugee situations have not been factored into the militarization in the Dadaab area, although it made government and armed groups target the camps in Darfur to decrease the influence of armed groups or increase the negotiation leverage of armed groups. Third, humanitarian assistance and protection contribute to maintaining the humanitarian character of the Dadaab refugee camps while in Darfur, the international presence has been effective in the government-controlled area and it has been limited in the rebel-controlled area due to the restrictions imposed by the government and armed groups.

Suicide levels were low in Caribbeans (SMRs 81 and 62 in men and women respectively) and high in East Africans (SMRs 128 and 148 in men and women respectively). The excess in East Africans (most of whom are of Indian origin) was largely confined to younger ages. Immigrant groups had significantly higher rates of suicide by burning, with a ninefold excess among women of Indian origin. The pressures leading to higher suicide levels among young women of Indian origin highlight the need for making appropriate forms of support and counselling available to this community

AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of family physicians in the protection of human rights is unclear. The purpose of this article is to explore this role through examination of the specific case of former Yugoslavia METHODS: In January/February 1993, we investigated medical aspects of human rights abuses as part of a fact-finding mission for the Physicians for Human Rights organization. We used primarily qualitative methods, including direct observation, key informant interviews, focus groups, and key document review RESULTS: We observed pervasive violations of medical neutrality, as indicated by the shelling of Kosevo Hospital, the major tertiary care hospital in Sarajevo. Forty-one percent of former prison camp detainees from north Bosnia housed at the Karlovac, Croatia, refugee camp had scars consistent with physical abuse. Civilians in north central Bosnia and Sarajevo were targeted through physical violence, artillery shelling, and strangulation of the public health infrastructure--food, water, electricity, heat, and medical supplies CONCLUSIONS: Physicians can be uniquely useful in the investigation of human rights. The flexibility of family physicians and their attention to the biopsycosocial aspects of health can be especially useful. Family physicians should become actively involved in the protection of human rights

AB  - The strands of medical social science based on such social theories as postmodernism and poststructuralism have tended to mystify what really affects health care use patterns including the simultaneous use of bio-medicine and traditional medicine. The small amount of research on the use of traditional medicine among recent immigrants in the West which has been conducted has often tended to be dominated largely by interpretivist per-spectives, which neglect the underpinning political-economic aspects of health and health care. The data for this article come from interviews with three different groups of Korean men (17 illegal/amnesty, 14 skilled and nine business migrants), using open-ended questions. Analysing the processes of adjustment to a new country and the constant involvement in hard manual work and long work hours, the article explores how Korean men in Australia make use of all the available resources to stay healthy. They have fully utilized the 'freely' available biomedical services under government subsidized Medicare although illegal migrants restrained themselves from using it until the time of obtaining legal status. However, Koreans have also utilized Korean traditional herbal medicine and acupuncture and other informal remedies despite their high cost, bearing in mind that health is a 'capacity to work' under the current environment.

AB  - The ostensibly free British Indians, coveted as substitutes for slaves (after Emancipation), contributed to the ordeal and victory of free labor in Trinidad 1808-1888. In the historiography, Indo-Trinidadian indenture has been separated from labor history; we see a continuum of many labor regimes including slavery, indenture and free labor. This study is about the daily struggles of indented adults and children who succeeded as "immigrants" against unimaginable odds. A largely illiterate people--ill-prepared for western, multi-racial societies--remained anonymous behind numerous regulations, platitudes, gross statistics and averages. My study humanizes high "caste" and "Pariah" groups who knew nothing of Trinidad and shows what indenture contracts signified. Many succumbed during the three-month voyage, with mortality, at times, recalling the slave trade. Individual deaths on ships or "gang beatings" of workers and leaders; kicking of women; medical and food inadequacies (Walkinshaw's Estate in 1846) are connected with names and details. Especially damning of British-sponsored indenture was its relegating of Indians to pass-carrying prisoners of an anachronistic apartheid state; Indians became the largest sub-group of prisoners allegedly for "infringement of immigration ordinances." The untruths told Indians about high wages at nearby "farms" and outright abductions (women), and capricious extension of "contracts," are juxtaposed with African slavery and other labor migrations. We link this to the "spirit of the times" where colonial elites and planters alone defined "labor shortage," "recalcitrant laborers," "high wages," "freedom" and "dangerous festivals." The newcomers were prevented from shaping post-emancipation Trinidad; and society failed in providing formal education for them until the 1870s. Hugh Tinker's diffuse A New System of Slavery: The Export of Indian Labour Overseas 1830-1920 (1974) is supported by this case study of Trinidad. Indenture was known among whites in America and elsewhere; despite the arrival of indented whites and Africans in Trinidad (1833-1888) we ask why their ordeal was negligible in comparison with the Indian experience. Race, religion, and the Indians' unfamiliarity with contractual, plantation-style societies limited their options severely. Indian labor helped modernize Trinidad's sugar industry and propagate free trade. This is part of the Indo-Trinidadian legacy, and of educational self-help

AB  - Sophia Alekseyevna (s��_�fy�T �Tly��ksy�_�_�y�Tvn�T), 1657�_"1704, regent of Russia (1682�_"89); daughter of Czar Alexis by his first wife and sister of Czar Feodor III. Supported by the streltsi (semimilitary formations in Moscow), she seized power shortly after Feodor's death (1682) and was proclaimed regent during the minority of her retarded brother, Ivan V, and of her half brother, Peter I (Peter the Great), who reigned jointly. She brutally eliminated her opponents and ruled autocratically with her lover Vasily V. Gallitzin (see under Gallitzin). Sophia wished to be crowned czarina in her own right, but she lacked sufficient support among the nobility and clergy. Gallitzin's two unsuccessful campaigns against the khan of Crimea helped undermine Sophia's power. When it was rumored that she intended to kill Peter and proclaim herself sole ruler, Peter summoned the nobles and his loyal guards, overthrew the regency, deposed Ivan, exiled Gallitzin, and had Sophia confined in a convent. After an attempted revolt of the streltsi, Peter forced her (1689) to take the veil.

AB  - This dissertation investigates the manner in which various media in contemporary Chile discuss human rights violations committed during the dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet from 1973 to 1990. During Pinochet's regime, an estimated 3,500 Chileans were "disappeared" or executed, and tens of thousands of Chileans were detained, tortured, and exiled. This dictatorship constituted a rupture in the nation's history, which has needed in some way to be addressed by families who suffered the trauma of torture, disappearances, executions, and exile. This historical rupture has needed to be addressed by the nation as well, as it struggles to move from a repressive totalitarian regime to a democracy. Through an intricate interplay of censorship, remembrance, and protest, the media have played a key role in structuring how Chileans today conceive of this moment. It is with the media's role in alternately silencing and representing trauma during times of social upheaval and flux, as well as with how Chileans respond to these re-presentations, that this dissertation is expressly concerned. I investigate human rights discourses in contemporary Chile through an analysis of the production, content, and reception of specific examples of Chilean media, including television, documentaries, feature films, and newspapers

AB  - BACKGROUND: Incarceration of young people should be avoided according to Norwegian policy. Even so, young people reside in our prisons at all times. Our aim was to investigate their mental health MATERIAL AND METHODS: Among 42 teenage boys (below 20 years of age) remanded to prison, 40 consented to participate in the study. Socio-demographic data were collected and a structured diagnostic instrument (K-SADS) was used to assess their mental health RESULTS: Only four participants had no mental disorder. The 36 who had mental disorders had a mean of 2.5 diagnoses. The most common diagnosis was substance abuse/dependence (n = 31). 30 of the adolescents had serious conduct disorders and nine of them fulfilled the ICD-10 criteria for a dissocial personality disorder. Anxiety and/or depressive disorders (n = 14) and hyperkinetic disorders (n = 12) were also frequent. Many of the adolescents had unmet treatment needs in addition to large social problems, such as disrupted education and unemployment. Three of four adolescents had an immigrant background INTERPRETATION: Teenage boys remanded to prison have a variety of complex problems. They have an extensive need for psychiatric treatment, drug treatment, education and employment. This calls for multidisciplinary coordinated interventions to avoid further negative development of chronic maladjustment with substance abuse, mental problems and crime

Face-to-face interviews revealed four main themes: life before the war; life and conditions during the war; personal experiences and challenges with resettlement; and resilience factors. All had experienced normal lives, with a good standard of living, and resettlement challenges included loss of previous professional jobs and the status that went with them, language problems, lack of instant educational opportunities and misconceptions about mental health services that might have helped with trauma. Resilience factors included the immediate and extended family, spirituality expressed as non-organised religion, an the availability of community social support services

AB  - The mental health of refugee families with children during the asylum period is a neglected research area in psychiatry. The present paper describes the situation of 10 refugee families residing at an asylum centre in Finland. Case vignettes are presented to illustrate the situations of these families. The study shows a high rate of depressive and post-traumatic stress disorder related symptoms among adult refugees. The case vignettes suggest that during the asylum period, many children and adult members of the family are not in a post-traumatic situation, but they live constantly in a distressing situation. The foremost distress amongst the asylum seekers appeared to be fear of deportation and separation from family members. Most of the adults and all children had not received any psychiatric or psychotherapeutic assessment or treatment. It is likely that current procedures for dealing with the asylum seekers contributes to the level of stress, family confusion and psychiatric problems in already traumatized refugee families.

AB  - The official results are expected soon, but Jacob Zuma's election as the next president of South Africa has long been certain. He now needs to demonstrate that he is worthy of the trust placed in him by the voters. There is a lot of doubt on that score. Mr. Zuma has considerable charm and a story that appeals powerfully to a large majority of South Africans. Rising from the humblest of beginnings in rural parts now known as KwaZulu-Natal, he joined the liberation struggle as a young man, spent 10 years in prison with Nelson Mandela and 15 in exile. He rose through the ranks of the African National Congress until he finally wrested the party leadership away from Thabo Mbeki, the former president.

AB  - During the years 1990 through 1996 more than three hundred people who were currently homeless and who were staying on publicly owned lands in the Pacific Northwest were informally interviewed, and eighty-two formal tape recorded interviews were conducted. Throughout the Pacific Northwest Homeless Campers Study the researcher employed a purposive sampling technique, participant-observation, grounded theory methodology, and ethnographic interviews using open-ended questions. The researcher utilized the data from the extensive field research to analyze the ways in which homeless "non-recreational" campers describe their lives, their survival strategies, and represent their personal choices regarding using public lands. The specific research questions examined are: (1) What are the demographic characteristics of the study's informant population? (2) How and why were they directed toward their particular living arrangements? (3) What are their survival strategies (both physical and economic)? (4) What are their social relationships with others (social networks)? (5) How do the data characteristics of the study's informant population compare to, or contrast with, existing research data about people who are currently homeless and who avoid using homeless shelters? The researcher develops an original grounded typology of three major categories of homeless campers: "Economic Refugees," "Voluntarily Nomadic," and "Separatists." Economic Refugees are people who are currently homeless and who are camping on public lands because they lack the resources to maintain a more conventional "homed" lifestyle. The Voluntarily Nomadic campers are people who are homeless and for whom the mobility of traveling and camping is a lifestyle preference. Separatists are moderately stationary homeless campers who seek out seclusion by living in remote rural areas of the publicly owned lands

AB  - Hepatitis B and C virus markers were assessed during a survey on malaria in gold mine camps in southern Brazilian Amazon in order to identify risk factors associated to these viral diseases. The study comprised 520 subjects, most of them were gold miners. Missing subjects totaled 49 (8.6%). Among these 520, 82.9% had HBV markers and 7.1% were HBsAg positive. Previous hospitalization, surgery, sexually transmitted diseases and incarceration were quite common among surveyed people, but there is no association between total HBV markers and these factors. On other hand, HBsAg was independently associated to history of sexually transmitted diseases and history of surgery after adjustment. The most frequent HBsAg subtypes identified, adw2 (59%), predominates in populations of Northeast Brazil. The most surveyed people were immigrants coming from that area suggesting that immigrants carried HBV themselves to the study area. Immunoblot (RIBA) confirmed-anti-HCV were found in 2.1%. The only variable associated to anti-HCV in multivariate analysis was illicit intravenous drug. Lack of HCV infection in subjects with such a high HBV markers prevalence reinforces the opinion that HCV is transmitted by restricted routes when compared to HBV. Furthermore, gold miners in Amazon may be considered as a risk group for HBV infection, but not for HCV

AB  - Abstract Background: The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between child, parent, family/ support, and stress variables and problem behaviors in Turkish immigrant children in the Netherlands. Methods: Parents of 833 children were interviewed and administered a Turkish version of the Child Behavior Checklist for ages 4 through 18 and a Turkish immigrant assessment questionnaire. Results: Increased integration (i.e., children belonging to a second generation of immigrants, older children) generally reduced the risk for problem behaviors, while frequent arguments, divorce, psychological problems, and convictions/incarcerations increased the risk for problem behaviors. Conclusions: Results indicate that problem behaviors are associated with the high level of separation faced by Turkish immigrant families and that more integration leads to lower levels of problem behavior. Additionally, migration history alone does not contribute to problem behavior. Factors in the family (e.g., quarrels, divorce, conviction) associated with problem behaviors in Turkish immigrants are similar to those found in Dutch and American populations. Future studies could examine predictors of problem behaviors in other culturally separated immigrant groups in the Netherlands, and in Turkish immigrant groups in other countries.

AB  - Three more Cuban political prisoners arrived in Madrid on Tuesday, bringing to 23 the number who have been released into exile under Cuba's pledge to free dissidents jailed there since 2003. The three were among six dissidents the Roman Catholic Church in Cuba said last week would be freed. Twenty other dissidents were flown to Spain last month. The men are among 75 dissidents arrested in March 2003 and sentenced to prison on charges that included treason. One of the three who arrived in Madrid, Regis Iglesias Ramirez, said, ''I think we have been freed because the regime needs to clean up its image internationally.'' Cuba maintains that none of the released is a former prisoner of conscience and insists they are all mercenaries paid by Washington and supported by anti-Castro exiles in Miami.

T1  - Speaking Law to Power: The War Against Terrorism and Human Rights
JF  - European Journal of International Law
A1  - Fitzpatrick Joan
KW  - eppi-reviewer
AB  - The human rights regime adopts a legalist approach to limit the harm the powerful may inflict on the vulnerable The attacks of September 11, 2001 and the ensuing 'war against terrorism' test the limits of the legalist approach. Human rights constrain state responses to terrorism more directly than they govern the conduct of terrorists. As a result, the international human rights regime is disadvantaged rhetorically and politically. While substantive human rights standards have not changed since September 11, six possible norm developments may occur: (1) alterations in norms governing the use of force may increase the perceived legitimacy of pre-emptive defensive action, for example with regard to targeted assassinations; (2) reconceptualization of counter-terrorism as a new species of international armed conflict may displace human rights law and international criminal law, and substitute new rules that are less detailed than those that apply to conventional armed conflicts; (3) derogation principles may be refined, especially in relation to the temporal element and the non-derogability of the prohibition on arbitrary detention and of fair trial rights; (4) an increase In the commission of extraterritorial human rights violations may spur the clarification of the scope of human rights treaties ratione loci; (5) the targeting of non-citizens, Muslims and Arabs may clarify non-discrimination norms; and (6) exclusion from refugee protection may expand. In institutional terms, the 'war against terrorism' has not yet had significant effects, but the following issues are notable: (1) integrating human rights into UN counter-terrorism initiatives; (2) the aggressive campaign by the United States Government against the International Criminal Court; (3) the tendency toward American exceptionalism; (4) leadership by Europe to preserve human rights principles in counter-terrorism; (5) increased polarization of UN human rights bodies around the Israeli--Palestinian crisis;.

AB  - Purpose: To assess the effects of parents' experience of traumatic events on violence among Southeast Asian and Chinese youth. The study examines independent effects of parents' refugee camp experiences and immigration stress on serious or family/partner violence among youth. Findings contribute evidence on the intergenerational effects of community-level trauma that can help policy makers better integrate family and community strategies to reduce youth violence. Methods: Obtained cross-sectional, face-to-face interview data including peer delinquency, parental engagement, parental discipline, serious violence, and family/partner violence from a sample of 329 Chinese and Southeast Asian adolescents. Measures of socioeconomic status, refugee status, and immigration stressors were collected from their respective parents. Data were analyzed using LISREL 8.54 for structural equation modeling. Results: Findings show that parents' refugee status facilitated serious violence, and was fully mediated by peer delinquency and parental engagement, but for Vietnamese only. Parents' refugee status was also significantly related to family/partner violence, and mediated by peer delinquency. This relationship was not observed among the other Asian ethnic groups. The immigration stress variable had no significant effects on either serious violence or family/partner violence. Conclusions: Refugee communities may not transform easily into stereotypical immigrant Asian communities characterized by little youth violence. Results suggest that the refugee process, as experienced second-hand through the children of refugees, has a strong effect on externally oriented violence (serious violence) and on family/partner violence for particular subgroups. Therefore, community-oriented policy makers should join social workers in developing programs to address youth violence in Southeast Asian families and communities. Findings have implications for other forms of community trauma such as natural disasters. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB  - One key consideration for UK policy makers is what happens to migrants after they arrive in the country. Some new arrivals access employment, accommodation and any services they need without delay and begin to build new social networks, but others do not. As a result, some migrant groups together, have low labour market participation rates and, for instance, disproportionately poor housing and health. There is no consensus, however, on the reasons why this is the case. This policy primer discusses government policy towards migrants after their arrival in the UK. It covers the history and goals of policy intervention, what is meant by �_~integration�_T, to whom policy is directed and some of the issues which underlie policy debates. It asks who the targets of integration are, and who�_Ts responsible for it. This policy primer concludes that the UK has to follow a trend in the EU of greater emphasis on the migrant�_Ts obligation to integrate rather than on addressing barriers that they face

AB  - Background: Violence and rape are believed to fuel the HIV epidemic in countries affected by conflict. We compared HIV prevalence in populations directly affected by conflict with that in those not directly affected and in refugees versus the nearest surrounding host communities in sub-Saharan African countries. Methods: Seven countries affected by conflict (Democratic Republic of Congo, southern Sudan, Rwanda, Uganda, Sierra Leone, Somalia, and Burundi) were chosen since HIV prevalence surveys within the past 5 years had been done and data, including original antenatal-care sentinel surveillance data, were available. We did a systematic and comprehensive literature search using Medline and Embase. Only articles and reports that contained original data for prevalence of HIV infection were included. All survey reports were independently evaluated by two epidemiologists to assess internationally accepted guidelines for HIV sentinel surveillance and population-based surveys. Whenever possible, data from the nearest antenatal care and host country sentinel site of the neighbouring countries were presented. 95% CIs were provided when available. Findings: Of the 295 articles that met our search criteria, 88 had original prevalence data and 65 had data from the seven selected countries. Data from these countries did not show an increase in prevalence of HIV infection during periods of conflict, irrespective of prevalence when conflict began. Prevalence in urban areas affected by conflict decreased in Burundi, Rwanda, and Uganda at similar rates to urban areas unaffected by conflict in their respective countries. Prevalence in conflict-affected rural areas remained low and fairly stable in these countries. Of the 12 sets of refugee camps, nine had a lower prevalence of HIV infection, two a similar prevalence, and one a higher prevalence than their respective host communities. Despite wide-scale rape in many countries, there are no data to show that rape increased prevalence of HIV infection at the population level. Interpretation: We have shown that there is a need for mechanisms to provide time-sensitive information on the effect of conflict on incidence of HIV infection, since we found insufficient data to support the assertions that conflict, forced displacement, and wide-scale rape increase prevalence or that refugees spread HIV infection in host communities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Violence and rape are believed to fuel the HIV epidemic in countries affected by conflict. We compared HIV prevalence in populations directly affected by conflict with that in those not directly affected and in refugees versus the nearest surrounding host communities in sub-Saharan African countries METHODS: Seven countries affected by conflict (Democratic Republic of Congo, southern Sudan, Rwanda, Uganda, Sierra Leone, Somalia, and Burundi) were chosen since HIV prevalence surveys within the past 5 years had been done and data, including original antenatal-care sentinel surveillance data, were available. We did a systematic and comprehensive literature search using Medline and Embase. Only articles and reports that contained original data for prevalence of HIV infection were included. All survey reports were independently evaluated by two epidemiologists to assess internationally accepted guidelines for HIV sentinel surveillance and population-based surveys. Whenever possible, data from the nearest antenatal care and host country sentinel site of the neighbouring countries were presented. 95% CIs were provided when available FINDINGS: Of the 295 articles that met our search criteria, 88 had original prevalence data and 65 had data from the seven selected countries. Data from these countries did not show an increase in prevalence of HIV infection during periods of conflict, irrespective of prevalence when conflict began. Prevalence in urban areas affected by conflict decreased in Burundi, Rwanda, and Uganda at similar rates to urban areas unaffected by conflict in their respective countries. Prevalence in conflict-affected rural areas remained low and fairly stable in these countries. Of the 12 sets of refugee camps, nine had a lower prevalence of HIV infection, two a similar prevalence, and one a higher prevalence than their respective host communities. Despite wide-scale rape in many countries, there are no data to show that rape increased prevalence of HIV infection at the population level INTERPRETATION: We have shown that there is a need for mechanisms to provide time-sensitive information on the effect of conflict on incidence of HIV infection, since we found insufficient data to support the assertions that conflict, forced displacement, and wide-scale rape increase prevalence or that refugees spread HIV infection in host communities.

AB  - Since 1982 over 2 million Afghan refugees have settled in the North West Frontier Province (NWFP) of Pakistan. Socio-economical factors, sudden urbanisation and psychological stress may influence the pattern of tuberculosis morbidity and infection among refugees as compared with the original population. In order to study the prevalence of tuberculous infection among Afghan children a tuberculin survey was carried out in April and May 1985 on a cluster sample of male children attending the first two grades of primary schools in refugee camps in the NWFP. The sample size was 4108 male children with an average age of 8 years. 1358 of them, average age of 7.8 years, had not been vaccinated with BCG. An infection prevalence of 13.8% was found when using a transverse diameter of 10 mm induration or more for the tuberculin test as the criterion for infection. The findings were compared with the results of a national sample survey carried out in Afghanistan in 1978: a downward trend of the annual risk of infection (ARI) of 7.8% per year was found in children of the same age group. Thus, Afghan children living in refugee camps in NWFP showed a lower ARI than was observed in their homeland 7 years earlier

AB  - During the past twenty years, the world's most renowned critical theorist - the scholar who defined the field of postcolonial studies - has experienced a radical reorientation in her thinking. Finding the neat polarities of tradition and modernity, colonial and postcolonial, no longer sufficient for interpreting the globalized present, she turns elsewhere to make her central argument: that aesthetic education is the last available instrument for implementing global justice and democracy. Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak's unwillingness to sacrifice the ethical in the name of the aesthetic, or to sacrifice the aesthetic in grappling with the political, makes her task formidable. As she wrestles with these fraught relationships, she rewrites Friedrich Schiller's concept of play as double bind, reading Gregory Bateson with Gramsci as she negotiates Immanuel Kant, while in dialogue with her teacher Paul de Man. Among the concerns Spivak addresses is this: Are we ready to forfeit the wealth of the world's languages in the name of global communication? "Even a good globalization (the failed dream of socialism) requires the uniformity which the diversity of mother-tongues must challenge," Spivak writes. "The tower of Babel is our refuge." In essays on theory, translation, Marxism, gender, and world literature, and on writers such as Assia Djebar, J.M. Coetzee, and Rabindranath Tagore, Spivak argues for the social urgency of the humanities and renews the case for literary studies, imprisoned in the corporate university. "Perhaps," she writes, "the literary can still do something." Summary reprinted by permission of Harvard University Press

The proposed split was introduced after the agency was charged with asylum backlog, prison overcrowding and other problems. The split could pose benefit to vulnerable prisoners and youth offenders due to the shift of their organisation to justice in terms of management. The emphasis of the government on national security will lead to the neglect of asylum seekers' needs

AB  - These innovative essays take a comparative approach to queer studies while simultaneously queering the field of comparative literature, strengthening the interdisciplinary of both. The book focuses not only on comparative praxis, but also on interrogating our assumptions and categories of analysis. These innovative essays take a comparative approach to queer studies while simultaneously queering the field of comparative literature, strengthening the interdisciplinarity of both. By focusing not only on comparative praxis, but also on interrogating our assumptions and categories of analysis, Comparatively Queer powerfully transforms the paradigms of comparison "Addressing a welter of topics ranging from Sapphic tales in early seventeeth-century Europe to animal fables in India, from the tensions between Western bio-medicine and Chinese cosmology in modern-day Hong Kong to the tensions between gender and sexual legislation in contemporary France and the United Status, and from circuses, fairs, and sideshows in Western Europe to Palestinian refugee camps in the Middle East, Comparatively Queer constitutes a lucid and lively intervention in the newly intersecting fields of queer and comparative literary and cultural studies. It boasts a scintillatingly diverse yet deliciously intersecting array of scholars committed to interdisciplinary work at the interstices of historical and geo-political borders and makes a profound contribution to the productive "troubling" of the Anglo-American and presentist assumptions of much queer theory as well as of the Eurocentric and nationally circumscribed assumptions of much literary and cultural compartivism. Proudly hybrid, even 'promiscuous,' in its methodologies, styles, approaches, and objects of study, Comparatively Queer is sure to be a 'must read' for scholars and students of sexuality, gender, history, culture, and, indeed, life in an increasingly globalized world." - Brad Epps, Professor of Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies, Harvard University "This collection is about crossing borders of every sort; it is about queering not only gender but also time, space, and comparison itself. It explores the possibility of, and the implications for, denaturalizing all sorts of subject formations: sexual, national, racial, social. Hayes, Higonnet, and Spurlin and their colleagues continue the gender studies work of Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick and others in a boldly energetic, transnational, and transcultural manner. The nine essays and framing commentaries bring together lives and works that span more than 2,000 years and cover the globe. Additionally they bring queer and gender studies into a productive dialectic with postcolonial, transnational, and critical race studies. Each essay undertakes what the editors term 'crossings,' but each employs the logic of comparison, of crossing from A to B, so as to interrogate rather than to reify binary logics and bright boundaries. Whether in the context of Renaissance Neo-Classicism, Postcolonial Hong Kong, Genet's Palestine, or the Indian diaspora, the 'queering of comparison' and the comparing of queerness is richly explored in this volume and is celebrated in theoretically rigorous and wholly original ways. At the same time, as Traub notes in her afterword, the authors' persistent attention to both difference and incommensurability ensures an ethical core to this intrepid collection. Scholars interested in topics as varied as women's studies, post-nationalism, medieval studies, nineteenth-century popular culture, animal studies, and international law will find the essays that reconfigure our intellectual terrain so as to invite further comparative queerings." - Elizabeth M. Richmond-Garza, Director, Program in Comparative Literature and University Distinguished Teaching Associate Professor, University of Texas, Austin

AB  - The title of Tui Lau, an innovation in the Fijian polity, was created in 1869 expressly for Ma'afu. It recognised the power he had gained in Lau during his 22 years in Fiji and completed his transformation from a Tongan chief into a chief of Fiji. Ma'afu, a cousin of Tupou I, formerly T�_ufa'�_hau, grew up in Tonga during unprecedented political and social change occasioned by intermittent civil war and especially by the introduction of an alien religion, Christianity. After the succession of T�_ufa'�_hau as Tu'i Kanokupolu and king of a reunited Tonga, Ma'afu, then a young man, was restrained by the social discipline imposed by the new regime and by the unrelenting hostility of John Thomas, a Wesleyan missionary in Nuku'alofa. Ma'afu left Tonga in 1847 to live in Fiji. Tupou has been said to have exiled Ma'afu as a dangerous rival for the throne, a disaffected 'prince' around whom chiefly opponents of the king might rally. This paper examines the circumstances and timing of Ma'afu's departure for Lau and draws some conclusions concerning his motives in leaving his homeland.

AB  - This critique of the securitization and criminalization of asylum seeking challenges the claim that asylum seekers 'threaten' receiving states. It analyzes recent policy developments in relation to their wider historical, political and European contexts and argues that the UK response effectively renders asylum seekers as scapegoats. The issue of asylum has become the focus of intense debate over recent years, much of which is organized around questions regarding how far and in what ways increasing numbers of asylum seekers pose a 'problem' or a 'threat' to 'host' states. This book steps back from this debate in order to consider how, why and with what effects such questions have come to take such a hold in UK and EU contexts. Critiquing the securitisation and criminalisation of asylum seeking, it analyses recent policy developments in relation to their wider historical, political and European contexts, and argues that the UK response effectively produces asylum seekers as scapegoats for dislocations that are caused by the shifting boundaries of the nation state. Any move beyond such an exclusionary politics, it claims, requires a distinctly political re-thinking of asylum, as well as of citizenship more widely 'Theoretically sophisticated and empirically well-grounded, The Exclusionary Politics of Asylum is an important addition to critical literature on the politics of refuge in Europe. Squire's assured dissection of the discourses and practices through which the problematic figure of the asylum seeker is produced underpins a fascinating mediation on securitization, sovereign power and territoriality in the contemporary European political order.' -David Owen, Professor of Social and Political Philosophy, University of Southampton, UK 'An outstanding contribution to the study of the securitisation of asylum, this book is a must read for anyone interested in the critical study of migration, borders, and citizenship. Through a theorisation of 'acts of citizenship', Vicki Squire brilliantly demonstrates how migrants are emerging as agents that interrupt and move beyond the exclusionary politics of asylum.' - Peter Nyers, Assistant Professor, Department of Political Science, McMaster University, Canada 'This is a timely and ambitious book...it constitutes a serious contribution to critical debates on the possibilities of a post-territorial conception of citizenship. Challenging contemporary readings of the politics of migration and highlighting the dangers that are associated with the failure to move beyond a territorially-based conception of citizenship, Vicki Squire offers a theoretically engaging and empirically rich contribution on a burning issue of contemporary politics.' - Aletta J.

AB  - This study examines narrative strategies through which feature films accomplish the dual role of entertainment-education to shape social reality surrounding health issues. More specifically, exploring films' narrative structures and characterization, this study illuminates how a coherent HIV/AIDS narrative is woven into cinematic artifacts laden with specific cultural values, beliefs and practices. The entertainment-education literature has rarely undertaken a study of films to demonstrate their entertainment-education potential. Moreover, by taking a structuralist perspective and utilizing narrative theories this study uncovers underlying elements that cut across narratives. According to Fisher (1987), the proponent of narrative theory, narratives are moral constructs with values embedded in its structure, characters, conflicts, and actions. As narratives are transmitted through various media and consumed within a culture through storytelling, so are the values and beliefs that guide behavior. Adhering to this definition of a narrative, Propp's (1968) methodological framework, morphology of a folktale , was utilized to analyze films containing HIV/AIDS messages. The study employed a cross-cultural study design to investigate films in four different languages. The films were Longtime Companion, All About My Mother, Yesterday and Mirugam in English, Spanish, Zulu and Tamil respectively. This study found that Propp's morphological framework serves as a useful analytical tool that would withstand the rigors of empiricism. The characters and functions in the films were interpreted deductively using Propp's categories. However, since Propp developed his categories based on oral folklores and before a time when issues such as HIV/AIDS existed, the analyses of the characters and functions in the films required some interpretive transformations from their original Proppian rendition. Therefore, while Propp's categories, developed in 1928, are clear and explicit, some interpretive readjustments were required in order to interpret contemporary filmic narratives. Hence, while all Propp's 31 functions and 8 characters were present in all the films analyzed, the functions did not follow the sequence purported by Propp. This does not imply that Propp's framework needs to be updated. It can be considered evidence of the flexibility of Propp's morphology. This study establishes that (a) Propp's framework can be effectively used to analyze film narratives despite the genesis of this framework in the oral folkloric tradition; (b) Propp's framework, which presupposes a classic comedy structure, can be effectively used to analyze narratives from other genres, such as the four filmic tragedies, (c) it is a comprehensive tool with a clear enumeration and operational definition of the component parts of a narrative's structure. The study also resulted in useful findings for health educators, film critics, and film producers. Entertainment-education films proved to be a useful vehicle to disseminate health related information. The films each contained some unique information about HIV/AIDS based on their respective cultural milieu. Both Longtime Companion and All About My Mother convey a Euro-centric experience of HIV/AIDS within the confines of non-traditional relationships. Longtime Companion focused on a small white male minority homosexual community in the United States, whereas All About My Mother was characterized by women, transsexuals and homosexuals. Yesterday conveyed a black, Afro-centric experience of HIV/AIDS specifically within the confines of heterosexual relationships and migrant working communities of South Africa. And, Mirugam conveyed a Tamil, Dravidian-centric experience of HIV/AIDS, specifically within the confines of poor and uneducated working class people. Due to these varied cultural circumstances the films conveyed some unique health information. While there were some differences in the health information conveyed, some of the common messages that resonated through the films were: (a) HIV/AIDS is transmitted sexually and through the transfusion of contaminated blood products. (b) Drug-use and sharing needles for injection drug use are risk factors for HIV/AIDS. (c) Exact treatment for HIV/AIDS is unavailable. (d) Fatality is a likely outcome of the disease. (e) Some symptoms of the disease include lesions, weight loss, and muscle attrition. For film critics, Propp's morphology is a useful analytical tool to form the basis of film commentary. Using the framework a critic can discern if the structure of the film is logical. A critic can also comment on the development of the significant characters in the film to assess characterological coherence. Lastly, a critic can comment on the attribution of significant functions in the film. This study also has some significance for film producers. Conducting a Proppian analysis on film scripts can help producers develop structurally and characterologically coherent scripts

AB  - Sri Lanka plans to release the remaining 136,000 Tamil refugees still in the squalid and overrun government camps where they have been detained since the country's civil war ended six months ago, a top official said Saturday. The official, Basil Rajapaksa, a senior adviser to President Mahinda Rajapaksa, said that the refugees would be free to return to their villages after Dec. 1 and that the camps would be closed by Jan. 31.

AB  - The government sent home nearly 10,000 war refugees Friday amid growing international concern for the nearly 300,000 Tamil civilians still detained in government-run camps. The civilians were displaced during a military offensive that crushed the Tamil Tiger rebel group in May, ending decades of civil war on the island. Since then, the displaced ethnic Tamils have been confined to overcrowded military-run camps. The government says it cannot release the civilians until it finishes screening them for potential rebels, and until land mines are cleared from their villages in the north. International rights groups have said holding the civilians is illegal.

The central focus of the article is the contention that the indefinite detainment of these persons is an abrogation of their individual human rights. The article notes a number of issues including the creation of this refugee population as a result of a final stand of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam guerrillas against the Sri Lanka armed forces and declining humanitarian conditions in the camps

AB  - A Tamil lawmaker said Thursday that hundreds of Tamil war refugees the government said it had released from military-run camps last week were moved to other detention centers. The legislator, Mavai Senathiraja, a member of the Tamil National Alliance, an opposition party representing ethnic Tamils, also alleged that thousands of others who were promised freedom remained in the camps. It was impossible to verify his claims. The government has declined to open the camp gates to outside observers, but says it will resettle 80 percent of the displaced by the end of the year.

Data was collected using a questionnaire, and analyzed for trauma moderation by demographics and mediation by PTSD symptom scores. Findings indicate a prevalence of PTSD of 49.4% overall, with 75% of the female refugees meeting the PTSD criteria. The refugees with PTSD had high intrusive, avoidance and arousal scores, in addition to moderate to severe PTSD symptom severity scores. Trauma load was a significant predictor of PTSD among adolescent refugees. Our findings point to the high prevalence of PTSD resulting from an increased trauma load and being a female

AB  - The current study looks at the value and function of creative self-expression (specifically poetry writing) in the mitigation of violence. Buber's I-Thou or dialogical philosophy is combined with the theory of creative interests as a variant form of object relations to better understand how creativity serves to diminish violent tendencies and facilitate the growth and development of the self. The important dialectical relationship between violence and creativity is explored through a heuristic study of the life and work of poet, Jimmy Santiago Baca, who used his own creative process to transform his life from prisoner and gang leader to poet and recipient of several literary awards. Baca poignantly illustrates the value of creativity in giving him both a voice to express his rage and a means for finding his own redemption and self-worth. He first started writing poetry while he was in prison and he openly credits the poetry writing with saving his life. The importance of discovering his own voice and understanding his life by way of his writing gave him a place to stand and be in the world without drugs, alcohol and violence. Moreover, Baca found refuge (containment), music (soothing), and happiness (a sense of well being) in writing his own poetry and reading the lyrical poetry of other poets. In Buber's theory of the I-Thou, a person can only know himself or herself in relation to others. For Baca, this "other" being was the matrix of art (poetry) itself. Poetry opened him to experiencing both his own mind as well as other minds. Creativity provided a witness to his experiences and a means for transforming his destructive impulses by fitting these impulses into a wider context and meaning beyond himself. The creative process offered him a healthy and constructive means for self-expression, self-confirmation, and thus self-transcendence. In finding value in himself, he came to value the life of others. The creative process gave Baca a means of feeling real and of relating to others in a vital and non-destructive way

Nos r+�sultats montrent que la pr+�sence d'immigrants hors Montr+�al est davantage tributaire du choix du premier lieu de r+�sidence que de la migration secondaire interne. Tant la r+�partition initiale que les +�changes migratoires subs+�quents ont toutefois connu des changements profitables au Qu+�bec hors Montr+�al qui re+�oit une part accrue des nouveaux immigrants et qui est devenu plus attractif aupr+�s des immigrants de Montr+�al. Les r+�sultats pr+�cisent aussi qu'+� l'ext+�rieur de Montr+�al, ce sont les principaux centres urbains (Qu+�bec, Gatineau et Sherbrooke) qui exercent la plus forte attraction, mais que des agglom+�rations de taille plus r+�duite ont consid+�rablement am+�lior+� leur bilan. // ABSTRACT IN ENGLISH: This article examines the evolution of the capacity of the areas of Qu+�bec outside Montr+�al to attract and retain immigrants since initiatives for regionalization became part of Qu+�bec's immigration policy at the beginning of the 1990s. Through the longitudinal use of FIPA, the insured persons registration file of the R+�gie de l'assurance maladie du Qu+�bec, we reconstructed up until 2007 the residential trajectories of four immigrant cohorts admitted to Qu+�bec between 1992 and 2004. Our findings show that the presence of immigrants outside Montr+�al depends more on the choice of first place of residence than on internal secondary migration. However, both initial distribution and subsequent migratory exchanges with Montr+�al profited the rest of Qu+�bec, which welcomed a higher share of new immigrants and became more attractive to Montr+�al immigrants. The findings also show that outside Montr+�al It is the main urban centres (Qu+�bec, Gatineau and Sherbrooke) that are exerting the strongest pull on immigrants but that smaller urban areas have improved their situations considerably

AB  - When the Great Depression struck northeastern Pennsylvania, coal mining towns like Carbondale--and its large population of Italian-American residents--underwent significant industrial reorganization and transformation. As a result, first- and second-generation Italian-American women experienced shifts in their identities and roles at home, at work, and in the community. Where most had been confined to traditional roles in the home, leaving the wage-earning to men, mothers and daughters in the 1930s often acted as sole or primary breadwinners in their families. Using one such daughter-breadwinner's oral history, I seek to reveal the transformation of this community by giving voice to this marginalized vantage on the desperate decade. My subjects, Joan Festa and her older sisters, labored alongside other immigrant women in low-wage, semiskilled jobs in textile and garment factories, earning cash to feed their families. Joan's mother offered her daughters one dollar out of their weekly pay envelopes; with this dollar, the young women used their leisure time beyond home and factory to claim increased personal space. Wary of union participation, these women found creative and strategic ways to resist the strictures of factory work, the economic strain of the time, the family norms of Italian immigrant households, and the stereotypes of their ethnic group in this small American coal town. The everyday, captured by oral history, is a terrain on which young women in particular carved out space for autonomy and independence. This paper seeks to complicate definitions of political subjectivity and resistance of Italian-American wage-earning women during the Depression. The story of the Festas invites us to reconsider women workers with their agency at the center

AB  - The aim of this article is to investigate the barriers that asylum seekers with disabilities may face in accessing protection and assistance in the European Union.� It examines whether the approach towards disability adopted in the Common European Asylum System acknowledges these barriers, and whether it is sensitive to the social model and the human rights of persons with disabilities. The relevance of disability in the context of asylum is examined at 3 levels: the qualification of persons with disabilities for asylum; their access to a fair asylum procedure; and the reception conditions they encounter. Three Directives that deal with these issues are analysed, and the findings considered in relation to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.� The findings show that the medical model continues to dominate asylum policies. Consequently, asylum seekers with disabilities continue to face numerous barriers in the assessment of their claim, in the asylum procedures, and with regard to reception conditions. Advocacy is required on behalf of asylum seekers with disabilities in order to encourage a shift towards the social and human rights based approach to disability

AB  - As direct or indirect participants, women have felt the full burden of the Croatian War of Independence. In the minority as soldiers, women experienced war as wives, mothers, refugees, prisoners, support, or engaged in providing relief. The role of women in the war is often marginalized and reduced to the passive category of civilians. Using semi-structured interview, within qualitative methodological approach, the main aim of this paper is to discover and understand experiences, perceptions and roles of women in the war. The research was conducted in 2011, in Split-Dalmatia County. The sample was selected according to the research objectives, using chain referral sampling. Used method yielded eight informants. The data were analyzed descriptively. Results show that the perception of war is primarily shaped by the psychological principle and then by the historical and political factors. Negative emotions arise from a comprehensive destruction of war. Women experienced war as a destructive and disintegrating, having severe consequences on the individual and social environment. In this meaning war causes dramatic changes in family life as well as it appears as a mechanism of isolation and exclusion. In addition, war has integrative meaning as a motive for the solidarity and cooperation in providing assistance. Women at war have a wide range of roles and activities. In the individual and social chaos of war, they try to return balance as well as to reconstruct their and lives of others. The burden of personal war experience appears as an important determinant of reconciliation. Lived experiences of war, with the burden of their consequences, continue even in the peacetime and after more than a decade and half they are so intensive that overcome religious beliefs.

U manjini kao hraniteljice, _�ene su rat pro_�ivjele kao supruge, majke, prognanice, zatoZ_enice, potpora ili anga_�irane na prikupljanju pomoZ�i. Uloga _�ena u ratu Z_esto se minorizira i svodi na pasivnu kategoriju civilnog stanovni_�tva. Temeljni cilj rada je, metodom polustrukturira-nog intervjua, u okviru kvalitativnog metodolo_�kog pristupa, otkriti i razumjeti iskustva, do_�ivljaje i uloge _�ena u Domovinskom ratu. Istra_�ivanje je provedeno 2011. godine, na podruZ_ju Splitsko-dalmatinske _�upanije. Uzorak je odabran sukladno istra_�ivaZ_kim ciljevima, pri Z_emu je kori_�teno lanZ_ano uzorkovanje. Ova metoda poluZ_ila je osam kazivaZ_ica. Dobiveni podaci su obraZ'eni deskriptivno. Rezultati pokazuju kako percepciju rata primarno oblikuje psiholo_�ko naZ_elo, a potom povijesni i politiZ_ki Z_initelji. Negativne emocije proizlaze iz obuhvatnog ratnog uni_�tenja. U iskustvima _�ena rat se pojavljuje kao destruktivni i dezintegrativni dogaZ'aj s te_�kim posljedicama na pojedinca i njegov socijalni okoli_�. U tom znaZ_enju rat uzrokuje dramatiZ_ne promjene u obiteljskom _�ivotu, te se pojavljuje kao mehanizam izolacije i iskljuZ_ivanja. Rat ima i integrativno znaZ_enje kao motiv za solidarnost i suradnju na pru_�anju pomoZ�i. _�ene u ratu imaju _�iroki spektar uloga i aktivnosti. U socijalnom i individualnom kaosu rata poku_�avaju povratiti ravnote_�u i rekonstruirati svoje i tuZ'e _�ivote. ZnaZ_ajna determinanta oprosta je te_�ina osobnog ratnog iskustva. Ratni do_�ivljaji se te_�inom svojih posljedica nastavljaju u mirnodopskom razdoblju i nakon desetljeZ�a i pol toliko su intenzivni da nadvladavaju vjerska uvjerenja.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Artificial penile nodules are defined as inert objects inserted beneath the skin of the penis to enhance the pleasure of female/male sexual partners during intercourse AIM: The aim of this article is to present our experience in dealing with artificial penile bodies. We have also reviewed the pertinent literature focusing on social, motivational, and occupational characteristics of individuals adopting this sexual practice, diagnostic dilemmas and the surgical and health side effects of the implantation of artificial penile nodules METHODS: We performed a computerized MEDLINE search followed by a manual bibliographic review of cross-references. These reports were analyzed and the important findings summarized RESULTS: The phenomenon of inserting self-made artificial nodules beneath the skin of the penis was first described in the Kama Sutra, the classic Indian treatise on love. It is most commonly observed among men from Southeast Asia. The occurrence is much less common in western cultures, but it has been reported to occur in Romania, Germany, and among Fijians and Russian immigrants in Israel. Furthermore, four cases of self-inserted artificial penile bodies from our clinical practice are presented and discussed CONCLUSIONS: The most common motive associated with foreign artificial bodies on the penis is sexual or erotic in nature and that is to enhance the pleasure of female or male sexual partners during sexual intercourse. Most of the reports involve members of low economic groups like gang members, soldiers, drug addicts, sailors, labor workers, and prisoners. Men suffer no serious side effects after insertion, although fixed beads can cause rupture of condoms. For women, the beads can cause abrasions and a few days of postcoital vaginal pain. Penis implants and inserts and other penis augmentation devices are potentially dangerous to both men and women, and of questionable value in bringing pleasure to either, and should be discouraged

AB  - The article presents information on the sufferings of the Cambodian people during the regime of Khmer Rouge, a Cambodian genocide. In the city and the refugee camps on the Thai border, relief workers were piecing together accounts of starvation, brutal forced labor, and mass executions into some comprehension of the whole. Cambodian indices of development are barely holding stable or sliding. The rice diet is so lacking in protein that stunted growth in children is endemic. Basic public services are lacking: in Phnom Penh, there is no garbage collection, no visible police, and only a handful of traffic lights in a city of a half million. Schools are the exception

AB  - Prey often adopt anti predator strategies to reduce the likelihood of predation. In the presence of predators, prey may use antipredator strategies that are effective against a single predator (specific) or that are effective against several predators (nonspecific). Most studies have been confined to single predator environments although prey are often faced with multiple predators. When more than one predator is present, specific antipredator behaviours can conflict and avoidance of one predator may increase vulnerability to another. To test how prey cope with this dilemma, I recorded the behaviours of lizards responding to the nonlethal cues of a bird and snake presented singly and simultaneously. Lizards use specific and conflicting antipredator tactics when confronted with each predator, as evidenced by refuge use. However, when both predators were present, lizards' refuge use was the same as in the predator-free environment, indicating that they abandoned refuge use as a primary mechanism for predator avoidance. In the presence of both predators, they reduced their overall movement and time spent thermoregulating. This shift in behaviour may represent a compromise to minimize overall risk, following a change in predator exposure. This provides evidence of plasticity in lizard antipredator behaviour and shows that prey responses to two predators cannot be accurately predicted from what is observed when only one predator is present.

AB  - Temminck's red colobus (Procolobus badius temminckii) was the focus of this study, which took place from February 1978-September 1983 in the 107 ha relict forest patch of the Abuko Nature Reserve, The Gambia, West Africa. I examine sexual differences in a population in which females generally transfer between troops, whereas males generally remain in their natal troop (except for an adolescent period of exile). All ages and reproductive stages were represented by transferring females, but juveniles clearly predominated. Males, however, emigrated at a younger age than females. Female departures appeared to be voluntary and not the result of competition and aggression, but young males left because of aggression received while in the confines of their natal troop. During the transfer process, females appeared to move immediately between troops while males spent months as solitaries looking for vacancies. Most males, however, returned to their natal troop when a vacancy occurred. This population has more prominent female-female bonds than has been described in other populations in which females transfer. I argue that this is due to the fact that females transfer between troops with, or immediately after, their natal troop peers and maintain these relationships with each other in their chosen troop. In fact, attraction among female peers is likely to be an important factor determining the timing of transfer and eventual troop choice. Females who originally shared a common natal troop rarely use aggression against each other, groom each other more than other females, and form subunits which leave the troop for days at a time. Female-female aggression was mostly between those individuals who did not share a common natal troop. Male-male bonds are not as prominent in this population as they are in most other female-transfer populations. A recurring theme is the importance of female peer transfer in the everyday interactions of the colobus in Abuko. I suggest that this practice fosters female bonding in what has traditionally been regarded as a non-female-bonded species. This is clearly at odds with previous ideas regarding female-transfer species in general and the bonding patterns of red colobus monkeys in particular.

AB  - The article discusses various issues related to sanctuary and sanctuary movements in the U.S. Sanctuary and sanctuary movements on behalf of refugees, especially the sanctuary movement in the United States, have been much in the news in recent years. Supporters of such movements have defied the government in order to prevent the deportation of refugees, labeled illegal aliens by the official system, back to their homelands. In the U.S., where current policies vis-a-vis uprooted Central Americans have been characterized largely by exclusion, restriction, and control, the movement challenges the monopoly of the state over who is to be admitted to its sovereign territory. In Canada, where, until recently, a more open policy had seemed to make a sanctuary movement superfluous, the government is moving to shut the doors. But these trends and opposition to them are by no means confined to North America. In Western Europe, more and more countries are posting keep out signs on their borders. The most recent such example is Switzerland, which had long stood as the very symbol of a country of haven for political exiles

AB  - Stephen Jenks was a prolific exponent of the American musical idiom developed by Daniel Read and other Connecticut composers in the 1780s and 1790s. He contributed 125 compositions to the ten sacred tunebooks he issued between 1799 and 1818. Virtually unknown in the cities, he flourished in the hinterland of New England and New York, where he taught singing-schools and cultivated a network of pupils and fellow teachers whose compositions he published. In 1829 he moved to Ohio, where he lived out his life in obscurity as a farmer and reportedly a maker of percussion instruments. He continued to compose actively until 1850. Jenk's tunebooks appeared during a period when typographical music printing was gradually replacing copperplate printing in the publication of sacred music in America. Jenks employed both methods; his publications, in association with engravers, such as Amos Doolittle and printers such as Herman Mann, helped to document this and other changes in music publishing. His two secular song collections (one with musical notation) helped to show rural tastes in a field dominated by urban and immigrant musicians. While taking most of his texts from Isaac Watts and other English evangelical poets, Jenks showed considerable interest in patriotic, commemorative and elegiac verse from varies sources. His MOUNT VERNON is perhaps the best known of the many American pieces mourning George Washington; SORROW'S TEAR (composed in 1804) may be the earliest American setting of a poem by Thomas Moore. After achieving proficiency in the rural Yankee idiom in his earliest publications, Jenks experimented with newer styles of sacred music, including the "solo-theatrical" style and the folk hymn, in his later publications. He nevertheless maintained, with only slight change, an idiom increasingly attacked by reformers as rustic or even sacrilegious; indeed, he is the only major nineteenth-century composer of fuging-tunes, a form especially condemned by pious critics. In his manuscript copybook now in The Newberry Library, the aged composer included several settings of popular revival hymns in a contemporary style showing folk elements. Compositions by Stephen Jenks were reprinted by other compilers throughout the nineteenth century, but after 1860 they were confined to southern shape-note tunebooks. Today, tunes by Stephen Jenks make up an important part of the New England legacy surviving in the southern shape-note tradition

AB  - The policies of deterrence pursued in response to spontaneous asylum seekers raise important practical and ethical issues that must be addressed by health practitioners. Governments pursuing such policies are in effect manufacturing difficulties and hardships for displaced and war-affected populations with the aim of ensuring that asylum seekers do not trigger protection obligations incurred as signatories to the Refugee Convention. The ethical problems arising from this policy approach are particularly acute with regard to use of indefinite nonreviewable mandatory detention of asylum seekers. The remainder of this chapter will focus on the professional, clinical, and ethical issues associated with the detention of asylum seekers as they have emerged within the Australian context.

AB  - Despite a strong historical record of resettling and providing care for refugee populations, the Australian Federal Government has increasingly implemented harsh and restrictive policies regarding the treatment and management of asylum seekers. Most controversial of these has been the mandatory detention of asylum seekers, a policy applied indiscriminately and without discretion where individual cases have not been subject to judicial review or time constraints. From the outset health professionals have raised concerns about the possible adverse mental health impacts of prolonged detention. In contrast, government representatives have characterized conditions in detention as benign and comfortable, and have consistently contested criticism of detention, often citing a lack of scientific evidence as tacit support for the continuation of the policy. Nevertheless, requests for access to the detention centres to undertake rigorous scientific investigations have gone unheeded. In this context we argue that the Australian Government has failed to uphold its commitment to good governance by allowing transparency, openness and a willingness to have the impact of its policies scrutinized by scientists. The manifest conflict of interest in the government position leads to a breach in the normal social contract between mental health researchers and those responsible for the policy of detention. There is, we argue, a legitimate moral imperative in such situations for clinical researchers to breach the walls of enforced silence and give a voice to those who are afflicted. This imperative, however, must be carefully balanced against the risks that may face detainees agreeing to participate in such research

AB  - This article reports on a study which aimed to examine domestic violence shelter workers�_T perceptions of child maltreatment reporting. It focuses on the answers to two research questions identified following a literature review: whether there is a significant difference in the perceived impact of reporting abuse based on the identity of the abuser, and whether there is a significant difference in the perceived impact of reporting based on the nature of the report. The study included a survey using a sample of 82 professionals from domestic violence shelters across the United States, focusing on a variety of different types of reports and the frequency of both positive and negative outcomes arising from these. Possible outcomes noted by the study include: damage to the relationship between the worker and the victim of domestic violence, disempowerment of the victim of domestic violence, discouragement from seeking further help, protection of the child, further traumatisation of the child, further disruption to the family, and damage to the woman�_Ts likelihood of maintaining custody. Significant differences in perceived impact were found based on identity of abuser (perpetrator or victim of domestic violence) and nature of report (child as witness to domestic violence or child as victim of abuse)

AB  - This paper examines development policy in colonial Botswana in the 1930s. It rejects the conventional characterisation of this period as either one of unremitting neglect or deliberate underdevelopment. Charles Rey, Resident Commissioner at the time, responded to the collapse of the old economic system - never very supportive of high nutritional standards - with a comprehensive development strategy focusing on water resources and the revival of the cattle industry. Under his command the local state was neither slothful nor a prisoner of capital, but worker actively to enhance production and organize exchange. In these efforts and in its attitudes to oscillating migrant labour and the issue of political transfer, it sought to secure the best deal for the territory, which often entailed opposing, rather than serving, South African capitalists. Rey's intention was to promote a large, prosperous `middle' peasantry. The fact that his development project instead enhanced socio-economic differentiation is evidence, not of underdevelopment, but rather of the uneven development of capitalism in Botswana. The development policy, along with programmes of administrative reorganization and political reform, confirmed Botswana autonomy, and the Territory, until then an imperial `envelope' of heterogeneous African polities, began to assume the character of a coherent state. The foundation for a democratic capitalist order were laid in this period. Reprinted by permission of Taylor & Francis Ltd

AB  - The return of displaced populations is regarded by the international community as essential to peace processes in war-torn societies, with housing and property restitution increasingly seen to constitute a pre-condition for the success of such return movements. A decade after the end of war in Bosnia and Herzegovina the property restitution process is close to full implementation while the rate of return remains relatively low. This paper explores the relationship between property restitution and patterns of return and relocation, as well as between house and the sense of home in the aftermath of the violent conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is based on research among three distinct groups of displaced Bosnians within and from the town of Banja Luka (repatriates, �_otransnational�__ refugees, and IDPs). The paper shows that although repossession of pre-war housing was perceived by the displaced as important for reasons of morality, justice, and economic rehabilitation, sustainable return usually also demanded access to jobs and other sources of livelihood, often located in transnational space. This, however, meant that in many cases �_oreturn�__ was temporary rather than permanent, and that for other displaced Bosnians �_osustainable relocation�__ had eventually come to be the desired goal. Yet the option of permanent resettlement in new parts of the country has not received much backing from the international organizations operating in Bosnia because of the emphasis on ethnic minority return as the central objective of post-war reconstruction. At the same time, the sustainability of return has to some extent been jeopardized by the international prioritization of �_osmall home�__ politics, i.e. property restitution, at the expense of �_obig home�__ politics, that is, efforts to normalize the political and socio-economic structures beyond the confines of private homes. The paper argues that displaced persons may (re)create livelihoods and a full sense of home only when a positive relationship starts to develop between housing and the surrounding local and national environment. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]La comunidad internacional cree que el retorno de poblaciones desplazadas es esencial para el proceso de paz en sociedades desgarradas por la guerra, considerando que la restituci��n de bienes y viviendas es una condici��n previa para el Ǹxito de esos movimientos de retorno. Una dǸcada despuǸs del fin de la guerra en Bosnia y Herzegovina el proceso de restituci��n de bienes estǭ llegando a su tǸrmino a pesar de que la tasa de retornos sigue siendo relativamente baja. Este art��culo examina la relaci��n entre la restituci��n de bienes y los patrones de retorno y relocalizaci��n as�� como entre la vivienda y el sentimiento de hogar, consecutivos al violento conflicto en Bosnia y Herzegovina. Ello se basa en los estudios realizados en tres distintos grupos de bosnios desplazados en y del pueblo de Banja Luka (repatriados, refugiados �_otransnacionales�__ y desplazados internos). El art��culo demuestra que si bien los desplazados consideran esencial retomar posesi��n de las que fueron sus viviendas antes de la guerra por razonas morales, de justicia y de rehabilitaci��n, el retorno sostenible exige un acceso al empleo y a otras fuentes de sustento, localizadas a menudo en un espacio transnacional. Ello no obstante, hubo muchos casos de �_oretornos�__ que fueron temporales y no permanentes mientras que para otros desplazados bosnios �_ola relocalizaci��n sostenible�__ era un objetivo deseado. Ahora bien, la opci��n de reasentamiento permanente en otras partes del pa��s no ha contado con mucho apoyo de las organizaciones internacionales que operan en Bosnia en raz��n del Ǹnfasis que se ha hecho en el retorno de minor��as Ǹtnicas por ser el objetivo central del proceso de reconstrucci��n consecutivo a la guerra. Al mismo tiempo, se ha puesto en peligro, en cierta medida, el sostenimiento del retorno al establecer una pol��tica internacional de �_opeque��o hogar�__ es decir, restituci��n de propiedades, a expensas de las pol��ticas de �_ogran hogar�__ a saber, esfuerzos para normalizar las estructuras pol��ticas y socioecon��micas mǭs allǭ de los confines de los hogares privados. Este art��culo arguye que los desplazados pueden (re)crear medios de sustento y un pleno sentido de hogar ǧnicamente cuando se inicia una relaci��n positiva entre la vivienda, el entorno local y el ambiente nacional. (Spanish) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]Le retour des populations dǸplacǸes est considǸrǸ par la communautǸ internationale comme essentiel au processus de paix dans les sociǸtǸs ravagǸes par la guerre, et la restitution des logements et des propriǸtǸs est de plus en plus per��ue comme une condition prǸalable nǸcessaire au succ��s des mouvements de retour. Une dǸcennie apr��s la fin de la guerre en Bosnie-HerzǸgovine, le processus de restitution des propriǸtǸs est prǦt ��Ǧtre pleinement mis en ��uvre, mǦme si le taux de retour reste relativement faible. L'auteur explore les relations entre la restitution des propriǸtǸs et les modalitǸs de retour et de rǸinstallation, tout en faisant le parall��le entre le logement physique et le sentiment d'Ǧtre chez soi au lendemain du violent conflit qui a sǸvi en Bosnie-HerzǸgovine. Il s'appuie sur des recherches effectuǸes au sein de trois groupes distincts de Bosniaques dǸplacǸs �� l'intǸrieur et en provenance de la ville de Banja Luka (rapatriǸs, rǸfugiǸs �_otransnationaux�__ et dǸplacǸs internes). Il montre que, si la reprise de possession des logements par leurs occupants d'avantguerre est per��ue par les personnes dǸplacǸes comme revǦtant une rǸelle importance pour des raisons de moralitǸ, de justice et de rǸhabilitation Ǹconomique, la durabilitǸ des retours exige Ǹgalement un acc��s �� l'emploi et �� d'autres moyens d'existence, qui sont souvent situǸs dans l'espace transnational. Ceci signifie cependant que, dans de nombreux cas, le �_oretour�__ a eu un caract��re temporaire plut��t que dǸfinitif, et que pour d'autres Bosniaques dǸplacǸs, la �_orǸinstallation durable�__ est en fin de compte devenue le but �� poursuivre. Cependant, l'option d'une rǸinstallation dǸfinitive dans d'autres parties du pays n'a gu��re re��u l'appui des organisations internationales opǸrant en Bosnie en raison de l'accent mis sur le retour des minoritǸs ethniques en tant qu'objectif central de la reconstruction au lendemain de la guerre. Dans le mǦme temps, la durabilitǸ des retours a dans une certaine mesure ǸtǸ mise en pǸril par la prioritǸ accordǸe au plan international �� la politique des �_opetits logements�__, �� savoir la restitution des propriǸtǸs aux dǸpens de la politique des �_ogrands logements�__, �� savoir les efforts visant �� normaliser les structures politiques et socioǸconomiques par-del�� les logements privǸs. Pour l'auteur, les personnes dǸplacǸes ne peuvent (re)crǸer leurs moyens d'existence et retrouver compl��tement le sentiment d'appartenance �� un lieu que si s'installe une relation positive entre le logement et l'environnement local et national.

AB  - From mid-May to mid-July 1980, 363 anaesthesias were carried out in the refugee camp Khao I Dang on the border between Thailand and Kambodia. These were done in a tropical climate under difficult conditions. The patients were refugees, mostly injured in the war. Regional anaesthesias were generally preferred as they are safer for the patients and not so much surveillance is necessary. For general anaesthesia ketamine combined with diazepam and in most cases assisted respiration by a combination of nitrogen oxide - oxygen and halothane were selected. Anaesthesia was induced by thiopental or diazepam on patients with eclampsia or head injuries or toxic goitre. Apart from a laryngospasm no other severe complication occurred. To reduce pain after an operation, ketamine infusion was successfully employed in isolated cases

The conversion took place in 1944, at the conclusion of the Second World War in central and southern Italy and the studio functioned as a facility for displaced persons until 1950. The focus of the article is a discussion of the Italian neorealist school of motion picture making as represented in the conversion of the facility. It is noted that the plight of refugees would by an apt subject for neorealist cinema with the added irony that the school rejected studio filming

AB  - Adrienne Rich voices a contemporary woman artist's odyssey. Developing through five stages, her portrait of women's evolving selfhood is informed by images of home and journey. Her first two volumes, A Change of World (1951) and The Diamond Cutters (1955), comprise her first stage, enclosure. Home seems to offer refuge from threats of change and disorder, protection for a vulnerable self and preservation of social values. Similarly, the formal controls of rhyme and meter become means of ordering poetry. Accordingly, Rich prizes objectivity and craft, choosing the diamond cutter as a metaphor of the poet. In stage two, entrapment, primarily in Snapshots of a Daughter-in-Law (1963) and Necessities of Life (1966), home becomes a trap. Despair permeates these poems as the poet chafes within the confines of her home and limited life. Images of death, autumn, cages and traps predominate. The central poem of this period, "Snapshots of a Daughter-in-Law," alleges that history and myth contribute to women's entrapment. As the title suggests, the stasis of the still photograph informs the imagery and the structure of these poems. In poems of the third stage--escape--from Leaflets (1969), The Will to Change (1971), and Diving into the Wreck (1973), Rich turns from the private to the public world. In fiery rhetoric she rages at an embattled, self-destructive society ("The Phenomenology of Anger"). Recognizing their anger, heroines prepare to escape from limiting homes. Her "will to change" leads Rich to use the kinetic image of film (as in "Shooting Script"). The fourth stage, journey, includes poems from Diving into the Wreck and Poems (1975). Here, heroines journey beyond the confines of home to explore oceans, discover comets and design cities on the moon. Questing adventurers eager to test themselves through exploration and new experience, these heroines take risks in exploring the unknown, both in the extreme environments of jungle, desert, ocean, and in their own minds. The journey culminates in return, the fifth stage, in The Dream of a Common Language (1978) and A Wild Patience Has Taken Me This Far (1981). Rich strives to speak of women's shared experiences in a "common language." Images of circles, wholeness, dialogue describe her attempts to synthesize disparate parts of the self, to reconcile the polarities of "home and wanderer."

AB  - This important volume rethinks the conventional parameters of Middle East studies through attention to popular cultural forms, producers, and communities of consumers. The volume has a broad historical scope, ranging from the late Ottoman period to the second Palestinian uprising, with a focus on cultural forms and processes in Israel, Palestine, and the refugee camps of the Arab Middle East. The contributors consider how Palestinian and Israeli popular culture influences and is influenced by political, economic, social, and historical processes in the region. At the same time, they follow the circulation of Palestinian and Israeli cultural commodities and imaginations across borders and checkpoints and within the global marketplace. The volume is interdisciplinary, including the work of anthropologists, historians, sociologists, political scientists, ethnomusicologists, and Americanist and literary studies scholars. Contributors examine popular music of the Palestinian resistance, ethno-racial "passing" in Israeli cinema, Arab-Jewish rock, Euro-Israeli tourism to the Arab Middle East, Internet communities in the Palestinian diaspora, caf+� culture in early-twentieth-century Jerusalem, and more. Together, they suggest new ways of conceptualizing Palestinian and Israeli political culture. Summary reprinted by permission of Duke University Press

AB  - Refugees often spent weeks, months and sometimes years in refugee camps. To gain an understanding of everyday life within refugee camps, an ethnographic study was designed to describe and explore engagement in daily occupations of women living in an Austrian refugee camp. Data gathered through observations and interviews were analyzed using a comparative method. The findings show that women experience their engagement in daily occupations as altered in many ways. The process was described as a struggle between 'being' and 'becoming', where the need to reengage in meaningful occupations was threatened by contextual factors. At the same time, the women seemed to experience the conditions differently, depending on the consequences for resettlement. The two themes "Daily occupations �_" a struggle against restrictions" and "Travelling towards the future" were intertwined. Though camp life was seen as restricting, constraining conditions were tolerated as long as they did not delimit personal goals for the future. In conclusion, participation in daily occupations within a refugee camp turned out to be a challenge, influenced by a range of factors internal and external to the person.

AB  - Notes that the author carried out crisis interventions in Bosnian refugee camps in Vienna. She worked with translators who were, moreover, experienced in therapeutic exchanges. The particular challenges involved in crisis interventions with Bosnian refugees are discussed. The goal of this work was to reduce the refugees' acute symptomatics and help them solve their present problems. The author exemplifies her therapeutic strategies with 2 case narratives and examines some of the psychic aftereffects of war, displacement, and flight. She shows, moreover, that with crisis interventions, consisting in 10 sessions in an individual setting, it is possible to achieve a reduction in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and an improvement in the patients' wellness, despite the linguistic and cultural barriers.

AB  - Objective:To monitor the dietary intake of energy, macro- and micronutrients in asylum seeker children.Design and setting:Cross-sectional study in three asylum seeker centres in The Netherlands.Subjects:Hundred and sixteen children 2�_"12 years old (86% of the study cohort) provided a dietary history.Method:The dietary intake was estimated by 24 h recall, and the origin of the children was classified in three geographic regions: African (n=45), Central Asia (n=34) or Eastern Europe (n=37).Results:The total energy intake from fat was in 24% of the children above 40En%. Seventy per cent of the children above 4 year of age had a saturated fat intake above 10En%. The children from Eastern Europe had a higher intake of fat and disaccharides than the children from the other regions. Among the children, an intake less than 80% of the recommended daily allowances of micronutrients was found for calcium (42%), iron (49%), vitamin A (45%) and vitamin D (80%). An inadequate dietary intake of iron and vitamin D was significantly more seen among the youngest children, whereas an inadequate intake of calcium and vitamin A was found more among the elder children.Conclusions:The dietary intake of a prominent proportion of these children contains too much fat and insufficient amounts of calcium, iron, vitamin A and vitamin D. The low micronutrient intake of the asylum seeker children can be considered as a nutritional risk. Nutritional education and strategies to improve the macro- and micronutrient intake of asylum seeker children is indicated.European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2007) 61, 104�_"110. doi:10.1038/sj.ejcn.1602501; published online 2 August 2006 [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]Copyright of European Journal of Clinical Nutrition is the property of Nature Publishing Group and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

AB  - As the journalists Laura Ling and Euna Lee complete their third month of detainment in North Korea, it remains rather astonishing that they were there in the first place to report for a fledgling cable channel. But their path there may explain in part why they remain in custody. They were working not for a news network or a widely read newspaper, but for Current TV, a channel best known, if it is known at all, for a mix of short YouTube-style segments about technology, current events and culture. The two journalists, both American, were reportedly working on a piece about North Korean refugees when they were stopped by border guards. Last week, the women were sentenced to 12 years in a labor prison, prompting diplomatic maneuverings to gain their release.

AB  - In this dissertation I evaluate the impact of British rule on customary land law and capitalist class formation in the Gold Coast Colony (now Ghana) from the early 1800s to independence in 1957. I do so from an Africanist "dependency perspective" which proposes that a major function of colonial regimes in Africa was to constrain the growth of the rural capitalism that unexpectedly emerged there with new opportunities for cash-cropping. According to Africanist dependency theorists, the two main techniques colonial regimes relied on to defuse an indigenous capitalist challenge were interference with supportive native institutions and alliance with opposition classes. I find evidence of both in the Ghanaian case. By the 1880s, farmers in the land-short eastern part of the Gold Coast Colony had begun to migrate west in search of land for cocoa farming. Although sales of land had been very rare "before cocoa," chiefs obliged and native and British courts (the latter spurred by investors' and traders' demands for legal security) found precedent in customary law for such transactions. By the early 1910s, however, wealthy migrant farmers were hiring laborers away from the gold mines in the west and becoming creditors, brokers and lorry owners as well. Then followed a verbal campaign in London in 1912-14 in which colonial officers called for a return to "pure native custom." The results of this were the revamping of the appellate process and freezing of land law's further doctrinal modernization. Although the period 1915-56 witnessed no great turning back from the recognition of land sales, the courts worked against the perfection of a free market in land in smaller ways: e.g., subjecting the sale of land to greater corporate control and accepting land's characterization as self-acquired instead of family property only where failing to do so would undermine land's use as security in an expanding credit economy. Given the confines of a recorded body of doctrine, this legal retrenchment could only have a limited impact on rural class formation, however, permitting capitalist broker- and creditor-farmers to grow in strength until they challenged expatriate domination of cocoa marketing in a six-month cocoa hold-up in 1937-38. Thereafter, British attempts to regulate cocoa capitalism shifted to the electoral arena where, ironically, the success of cocoa capitalism had generated an opposition class of workers, cocoa laborers, and elementary school leavers that came together to form the Convention People's Party. After brief strikes and riots in the late 40s, the British began grooming this party as its political heir. The neo-colonial state thus forged, by eliminating private agro-mercantile capital from participation in cocoa marketing, finally succeeded where the British, though their legal half-measures, had failed: dismantling in little more than a decade rural capitalism's long-forming chance to expand and become exclusive in the formation. I suggest that dependency theory, by focussing on the politics of underdevelopment, is a needed corrective to the now-dominant world-systems perspective on colonialism. I also propose the applicability of the concept of contradictions to the analysis of relations of imperialism

AB  - From 1999 to 2005, the Minneapolis-based Center for Victims of Torture (CVT) served Liberian and Sierra Leonean survivors of torture and war living in the refugee camps of Guinea. A psychosocial program was developed with 3 main goals: (a) to provide mental health care, (b) to train local refugee counselors, and (c) to raise community awareness about war trauma and mental health. Utilizing paraprofessional counselors under the close, on-site supervision of expatriate clinicians, the treatment model blended elements of Western and indigenous healing. The core component consisted of relationship-based supportive group counseling. Clinical interventions were guided by a 3-stage model of trauma recovery (safety, mourning, reconnection), which was adapted to the realities of the refugee camp setting. Over 4,000 clients were provided with counseling, and an additional 15,000 were provided with other supportive services. Results from follow-up assessments indicated significant reductions in trauma symptoms and increases in measures of daily functioning and social support during and after participation in groups. The treatment model developed in Guinea served as the basis for CVT's ongoing work with survivors in Sierra Leone and Liberia. ((c) 2006 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In the aftermath of war atrocities, symbolization-a process whereby an experience or emotion that has been unexpressed is given form-can provide survivors with a sense of relief and solace and can attenuate isolation by permitting traumatic experiences to be shared with and acknowledged by others. This article focuses on creative methods of symbolization used in a trauma counseling program for Liberian and Sierra Leonean refugees in the refugee camps of Guinea. The program, developed by the Center for Victims of Torture, integrated contemporary expressive therapy techniques with indigenous healing practices (e.g., songs, cultural stories, drama, drawing, dance/movement, letter-writing, rituals). A case example of the treatment of a war-traumatized Liberian boy is presented. The psychological harm of war atrocities is exacerbated by silence. Conversely, as victims find ways of giving form to their experiences-verbally, nonverbally, or via a combination of the two-psychological and social repair become possible.

AB  - The article describes the situation of the Czechoslovak exile, especially the exile of physicians to Sweden. Many of Czechoslovak physicians decided to emigrate due to their political attitudes. Majority of them left Czechoslovakia after the invasion of Warsaw Pact armies in 1968. The top of the exile wave was shortly after August 1968 and during 1969. Most of the people escaped from Czechoslovakia via Austria, where they asked for political asylum. Part of the emigrants had to spend some months in the refugee camps and during this time they tried to get visa to other European or non European countries. One of target countries for medical emigrants was also Sweden. In the 60th Sweden had deficiency in physicians and the wave of Czechoslovak emigration was convenient for Swedish Ministry of Health. The group of emigrants consisted of experts from hospitals or graduated medical students. In Sweden they had to attend special courses of Swedish medical language, Swedish medical law and social medicine. If they had medical training shorter than three years, they had to attend special courses also in internal medicine, surgery and psychiatry. After one year of service in northern part of Sweden, where there was a lack of physicians, they could choose hospital, where they wanted to work. Czechoslovak physicians were very successful in the Swedish medical system and also well accepted in the Swedish society as other exulants from Czechoslovakia. Key words: Czechoslovak exile to Sweden, political asylum 1968-1968

AB  - Political participation in the rural United States has often been narrowly defined within the confines of electoral politics. Increasingly, participants in rural US social movements have highlighted the shortcomings of democracy defined purely in terms of electoral politics in favour of a more participatory model of politics that focuses on the social and cultural rights of those who are often formally or informally excluded from the liberal definition of citizenship. This article highlights the process of claiming rights as cultural citizens in a political context where there are efforts through the formal political system-usually in the form of ballot referendums at the state or local level-to further limit the rights of specific constituencies such as gay, lesbian and transgendered individuals or immigrants. A second focus of this article is on the dynamics of solidarity and alliance building between different kinds of social movements acting in concert to push for cultural rights and then formal rights for each other's constituencies. The article specifically seeks to illustrate how two organizations that share quite different constituencies and agendas can effectively collaborate in regional and state-wide campaigns in the rural state of Oregon, while also honestly discussing their differences and difficulties in working together.

AB  - RATIONALE: The scope of treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in the United States and Canada is unknown. Identifying the types of clinics that administer such treatment and patients who receive it could guide resource utilization and improve treatment initiation and completion OBJECTIVES: Estimate the number of persons started on LTBI treatment; describe the types of clinics that treat LTBI METHODS: The Tuberculosis Epidemiologic Studies Consortium, consisting of 19 United States and 2 Canadian sites, conducted a survey among clinics that initiated LTBI treatment for>or=10 patients in 2002 RESULTS: Study catchment areas from the 19 United States sites represented 8.6% of the United States population and 12.7% of all tuberculosis cases in 2000. An estimated 37,857 patients started LTBI treatment during 2002 at 244 clinics surveyed. Of these treatment starts, 29,970 (79%) occurred at general public health clinics; immigrant/refugee clinics (2,409; 6.4%) and correctional/detention facilities (2,325; 6.1%) were the next most common sites. Based on these data, United States tuberculosis case rates, and United States population data, the estimated total number of LTBI treatment starts in the United States was 291,000-433,000. When the 37,145 persons who initiated LTBI treatment in the United States were extrapolated to the entire United States population, with a 5% lifetime risk of tuberculosis without treatment, and 20-60% treatment effectiveness, approximately 4,000-11,000 tuberculosis cases were prevented in the United States CONCLUSIONS: LTBI treatment is initiated among a substantial number of persons in the United States and Canada, primarily in the public sector. Treatment of LTBI can significantly decrease the tuberculosis burden

AB  - In this article we challenge the conclusion made from vital statistics that Hispanic Americans have lower all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality than non-Hispanic whites. There is reason to believe that vital statistics underascertain minority, and in particular Hispanic, deaths. Cohort studies minimize many of these limitations. In the San Antonio Heart Study risk factor distributions predicted higher all-cause and CVD mortality among Mexican Americans than among non-Hispanic whites. Follow-up of the cohort confirmed a mortality ratio of 1.38 for all-cause and 1.30 for CVD mortality for Mexican Americans vs non-Hispanic whites. This excess risk was confined to U.S.-born Mexican Americans, since immigrants from Mexico had very low mortality despite low socioeconomic status. We attribute this latter finding to a "healthy migrant effect." [References: 21]

Until he fell out with the first family last year, Mr. Aliyev held a number of government posts, including deputy head of the secret services and ambassador to Austria. In a separate case in January, a civilian court in Almaty sentenced him to 20 years for kidnapping and embezzlement, and Kazakh authorities have tried to extradite him from Austria. Mr. Aliyev has called the charges a government-sponsored witch hunt.

AB  - The migratory routes along which the Central European species of dragonflies probably immigrated from their periglacial refuges into Central Europe are reconstructed. Due to the topographical configuration in Central Europe, the postglacial invasions were confined to only a few routes. Mountain chains and also small river valleys, i.e. the Rhine valley between Lake Constance and Waldshut, acted as barriers; while geotectonic depressions, such as the �_~Geneva Gate�_T, �_~Burgundian Gate�_T and �_~Moravian Gate�_T, played an important role as �_~gateways�_T in overcoming these obstacles, the wide river plains were used as corridors to invade the hinterland. The extent of the immigration into Central Europe by the dragonfly species depended on the one hand on the distances which had to be covered from the refugial areas, but, on the other hand, also on the distinct postglacial climatic periods (Preboreal, Boreal, Atlantic, Subboreal, Subatlantic). Depending on their thermal requirements each species started expanding from their refugial areas at different times. Due to variable postglacial climatic conditions, progressive migratory phases alternated with regressive phases. The very different recent distribution patterns of the Central European dragonflies can only be understood if all the climate history, landscape morphology, the thermal requirements of the species, their origin (refugial areas) and history of colonization are considered. Because many Central European dragonfly localities currently lie at the periphery of the range of many species, these species can only survive in these areas if individual �_~reinforcements�_T from their centres of distribution are possible. They still take place mainly along the old routes. Thus, disruption of the migratory routes, especially at the gateways, due to anthropogenic actions may influence the fauna of large Central European regions. Due to many anthropogenic...

AB  - It is well known that large numbers of children are affected by domestic violence, with the problem crossing every social class and culture. It can cause distress and anxiety in children and adversely affect their learning and play, as well as their behaviour, well-being and attendance. Education staff knowing of a child or family in crisis may want to help, yet feel outside their comfort zone. This book describes the impact of domestic violence on children and provides support for education and social care professionals. It takes heavy workloads into account and suggests practical ways of meeting the needs of pupils who come from difficult home backgrounds. The authors provide guidance and advice on: identifying and responding to signs of distress; helping pupils to talk about and make sense of their experiences; the impact on parenting and how parents can be supported; the needs of young people in refuges and temporary accommodation; pupil safety and government safeguarding guidelines; educating young people and the community about domestic violence; and specialist domestic violence services and other agencies that support schools

AB  - This study is an exploration of the Civil War in the South as an experience of motion across space. During four years of social and political upheaval, the roads of Dixie were packed with millions of Southerners: soldiers on their way to battle, deserters on their way home, former slaves exercising their new freedom, and refugees in flight from occupation or political oppression. For Southerners from all across the social spectrum--men and women, black and white, enslaved and free, the war experience translated first and foremost into movement. The goal of my dissertation is to investigate this great wave of human mobility and the impact it had on shaping the history of the South. Movement, I argue, played a crucial role in the Southern experiment in nation building. In 1861, men on the road embodied a nascent country and symbolized the idea of war; for a conflicted and often confused citizenry, they turned the Confederacy from a mere idea to a corporeal reality and infused content into abstract political decisions. As the war progressed, movement of soldiers took on further meanings; from the confident march to battle, through the shameful retreat after a bitter defeat, to the desperate straggling of men who had given up, it was a living testimony to the success and failure of an army and of the country that stood behind it. In the Confederate mind, the nation existed in the motion of its soldiers. At the same time, human mobility posed an acute challenge to the South's entrenched social hierarchy. Service in the Confederate army imposed the first limitations on the movement of white men; an overarching system of internal controls, directly inspired by the means previously devised to command the movement of slaves, now governed the lives of free citizens. Meanwhile, emancipated bondsmen embraced their first opportunity to move at will: joining the Union army, looking for lost relatives, searching for better economic prospects, or merely exploring a geography formerly out of their reach, black Southerners were freed through their mobility. On the roads of the South, a centuries-old order was being turned upside down and the balance of power between Southerners of different races, classes, and genders was renegotiated. Freedom and enslavement were redefined for Southerners from all walks of life as the old rules regarding movement were broken and new ones formed. The roads of the Confederacy were the sites for simultaneous processes of emancipation and mobilization, liberation and confinement. It was where the social revolution of the Civil War was actually taking place. On the level of a social phenomenon, the study of movement in the Civil War South enables a deeper understanding of the larger trends that were sweeping the region and shattering its basic maxims; on the level of the individual experience, it is an examination of how one's understanding of their world is molded by a simple, natural thing as bodies in motion. Taken together, studying mobility is an investigation into the human condition in times of war

AB  - Through a comparative, ethnographic study of two Ghanaian Pentecostal churches in Chicago this dissertation examines the relationship between immigrants' religious culture and their incorporation into the United States. Specifically it analyzes how in recreating the meaning and practice of evangelism, two Ghanaian immigrant Pentecostal congregations were also engaged in shaping the role of ethnicity in their congregations and deciding how to best interact with American culture. This dissertation shows how the process of recreating a religious culture in a new context creates religious adaptation dilemmas for immigrants--situations where they must choose between changing their religious culture in order to more comfortably fit into their new context or maintaining their religious culture and the tension that exist between it and their new context. I argue that by responding to these dilemmas immigrants both assimilate and create ethnicity. The nature of the conflict and response determines whether assimilation/acculturation or ethnic identification will predominate at any given moment. These findings highlight that religion , as opposed to religious organizations, plays an important role in immigrant incorporation by serving as a catalyst for selective assimilation/ethnic retention and a medium through which it occurs. They also suggest that researchers should pay more attention to the process of recreating religious culture rather than the specifics of what has and has not changed in any given religious tradition. In particular scholars should focus on general patterns in both the adaptation dilemmas that immigrants face and the methods they use to resolve them

AB  - This article tries to define the term �_~asylum-seeking families�_T, as used in the United Kingdom, as encompassing various relationships between family members, with many typologies. The exact typology is important to the form of protection afforded during the asylum process, as defined by UK law. The author focuses on Article 8 of the 1950 European Convention on Human Rights, and the continually evolving jurisprudence before European and national courts on the interpretation of �_~private�_T and �_~family�_T life and looks to Article 8 to provide a route to greater protection, for some families, than they might receive through the traditional asylum processes. In the text, the author defines �_~family�_T, family unit(y)�_T, family reunification�_T, �_~family life�_T, and �_~asylum�_T in UK and European terms. He describes the typologies of �_~asylum-seeking families�_T as being in two sub-groups of �_~intact family�_T, living as a single unit, and �_~divided family�_T, members of who are separated between or within states. Each sub-group has further divisions which will determine how the �_~family�_T are treated under the law and what rights they have and these sub-divisions are listed. In further sections entitled, increasing restriction �_" increasing suffering, whither the asylum-seeking family?, the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, and the case-law of the UK courts, the complex process and often bleak prospects of many �_~asylum-seeking families�_T is illustrated

AB  - The current study was designed to test a reformulation of Allport's and Kramer's "vigilance hypothesis" by applying signal detection theory to social categorization. Specifically, the impact of prejudice and specific threat concerns (e.g. terrorism or illegal immigration) was investigated. Participants were asked to assume the role of either an airport security officer facing a potential terrorist attack or a border patrol officer facing possible illegal immigration. Forty photographs were presented and participants were asked to either detain or not detain the target presented. Ten of these targets were actual terrorists or illegal immigrants. Following this task, the same 40 photographs were presented and participants classified the targets as either "Arab" or "Not Arab" (in the airport security role), or "Hispanic" or "Not Hispanic" (in the border patrol security role). Measures of sensitivity and criterion were calculated and a signal detection analysis was conducted. Results did not confirm the reformulated vigilance hypothesis. Exploratory analyses revealed that political ideology would provide a better foundation for the reformulation of the vigilance hypothesis. Political conservatives set a lower criterion to categorize a target as a threat. Additionally context interacted with political ideology to impact sensitivity to threat. Specifically political conservatives displayed greater sensitivity to illegal immigrants while liberals displayed greater sensitivity to terrorists. Political conservatives also displayed greater sensitivity except when the cost of a false alarm exceeded the cost of a miss. Implications and future directions are discussed

AB  - Between 1977 and 1982, the Australian Government resettled over 54,000 Vietnamese refugees. It also admitted 2,059 Vietnamese asylum seekers who arrived by boat without state authorisation. Although the number of Vietnamese asylum seekers was significantly smaller than the number of Vietnamese refugees processed offshore in refugee camps, the unexpected arrival of these boat people stimulated debate in Parliament and in the press about an appropriate response. This article examines the language politicians used to describe Vietnamese asylum seekers and the arguments used to justify their inclusion or exclusion. The evidence demonstrates that the political rhetoric used in this period in Australia's immigration history cannot be solely categorised as inclusive or humane. Rather, the overall impression is one of resistance and pragmatism. Reprinted by permission of Blackwell Publishers

AB  - This guidance has been produced by the Scottish Housing Regulator in partnership with Stonewall Scotland and the LGBT Centre for Health and Wellbeing. The guidance highlights the key drivers for addressing homophobic and transphobic harassment and gives a brief outline of previous work funded by Communities Scotland that highlights LGBT housing needs and providing guidance for social housing providers. The�bulk of the guidance provides a basic introduction to LGBT housing and homelessness issues. The content is drawn from a number of research studies. It should be noted that most currently available research focuses on the needs and experiences of younger and older lesbian and gay people. There remains a paucity of evidence on transgender experiences in housing and very little specific to the needs of bisexual people. Section 3 focuses on the nature of homophobic and transphobic harassment. It identifies the kinds of behaviours that constitute harassment, who is targeted by such behaviours and, crucially, the impact of harassment and consequent issues of reporting and disclosure. The report concludes by suggesting what LGBT tenants and potential applicants should expect from social housing providers

AB  - The past half-century of urban studies has demonstrated that the design of human settlements is a potent tool of governance. Active involvement in place shaping has also been shown to be a key empowerment mechanism for citizens and a strong means of creating cohesion in communities. Internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugee camps are a unique form of human habitation, temporary spaces created "between war and city." Drawing from urban planning theory, camp management tools, and migrant narratives, this paper will explore the dynamics of the spatial relationship between camp residents and the international governance bodies who manage them. As we will demonstrate, this approach offers important insights into how the relationships between camp residents and aid agencies are negotiated, and the implications for governance in societies camp inhabitants later (re)settle in.

AB  - Traditionally citizenship is a dichotomous concept, defining a person with citizenship as being a legally recognized member of state, while a non-citizen is a not legally recognized. While the literature provides clarity by conceptualizing citizenship as a fairly constant dichotomy, I argue that citizenship is something fluid. Therefore I am attempting to focus and suggest that citizenship is more than just belonging or not belonging to a state, and additionally belonging and not belonging is never constant, but always fluctuating. I will analyze interviews conducted in two federal prisons in Texas of Mexican migrants who are tagged for deportation in order to re-conceptualize our understanding of what it means to belong and not belong within a state.l [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Conference Papers -- American Sociological Association is the property of American Sociological Association and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although physician burnout has received considerable attention, there is little research of doctors who thrive while working in challenging conditions AIM: To describe attitudes to work and job satisfaction among Australian primary care practitioners who have worked for more than 5 years in areas of social disadvantage METHOD: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 primary health care practitioners working in Aboriginal health, prisons, drug and alcohol medicine, or youth and refugee health. The interviews explored attitudes towards work and professional satisfaction, and strategies to promote resilience RESULTS: All doctors were motivated by the belief that helping a disadvantaged population is the 'right thing' to do. They were sustained by a deep appreciation and respect for the population they served, an intellectual engagement with the work itself, and the ability to control their own working hours (often by working part-time in the field of interest). In their clinical work, they recognised and celebrated small gains and were not overwhelmed by the larger context of social disadvantage CONCLUSION: If organisations want to increase the numbers of medical staff or increase the work commitment of staff in areas of social disadvantage, they should consider supporting doctors to work part-time, allowing experienced doctors to mentor them to model these patient-appreciative approaches, and reinforcing, for novice doctors, the personal and intellectual pleasures of working in these fields

AB  - The introduction to the great work of Hugo Grotius, composed in the first years of his exile, and published at Paris in 1625, contains the most clear and authentic statement of the general principles of morals prevalent in Christendom after the close of the schools, and before the writings of Thomas Hobbes had given rise to those ethical controversies which more peculiarly belong to modern times. That he may lay down the fundamental principles of Ethics, he introduces Carneades on the stage as denying altogether the reality of moral distinctions; teaching that law and morality are contrived by powerful men for their own interest; that they vary in different countries, and change in successive ages; that there can be no natural law, since nature leads men as well as other animals to prefer their own interest to every other object; that therefore there is either no justice, or if there be, it is another name for the height of folly, inasmuch as it is a fond attempt to persuade a human being to injure himself for the unnatural purpose of benefiting his fellow-men. To this Grotius answered, that even inferior animals, under the powerful though transient impulse of parental love, prefer their young to their own safety or life; that gleams of compassion, and, he might have added, of gratitude and indignation, appear in the human infant long before the age of moral discipline. Such was the state of opinion respecting the first principles of the moral sciences, when, after an imprisonment of a thousand years in the cloister, they began once more to hold intercourse with the general understanding of mankind. This was the condition in which ethical theory was found by Hobbes, with whom the present Dissertation should have commenced, if it had been possible to state modern controversies in a satisfactory manner, without a retrospect of the revolutions in opinion from which they in some measure flowed. The fundamental errors on which the ethical system of Hobbes is built are not peculiar to him; though he has stated them with a bolder precision, and placed them in a more conspicuous station in the van of his main force, than any other of those who have either frankly avowed or tacitly assumed them, from the beginning of speculation to the present moment. These will be shortly stated in the remaining pages of this chapter. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Among the many eminent persons who were either driven from France, or who went into voluntary exile, in consequence of the revocation of the edict of Nantz, the most illustrious by far was Pierre Bayle; who, fixing his residence in Holland, and availing himself, to the utmost extent, of the religious toleration then enjoyed in that country, diffused from thence, over Europe, a greater mass of accurate and curious information, accompanied by a more splendid display of acute and lively criticism, than had ever before come from the pen of a single individual. Happy! if he had been able to restrain within due bounds his passion for sceptical and licentious discussion, and to respect the feelings of the wise and good, on topics connected with religion and morality. But, in the peculiar circumstances in which he was educated, combined with the seducing profession of a literary adventurer, to which his hard fortune condemned him, such a spirit of moderation was rather to be wished than expected. When Bayle first appeared as an author, the opinions of the learned still continued to be divided between Aristotle and Descartes. A considerable number leaned, in secret, to the metaphysical creed of Spinoza and of Hobbes; while the clergy of the Roman Catholic and the Protestant churches, instead of uniting their efforts in defence of those truths which they professed in common, wasted their strength against each other in fruitless disputes and recriminations. In the midst of these controversies, Bayle, keeping aloof as far as possible from all the parties, indulged his sceptical and ironical humour at the common expence of the various combatants. Unattached himself to any system, or, to speak more correctly, unfixed in his opinions on the most fundamental questions, he did not prosecute any particular study with sufficient perseverance to add materially to the stock of useful knowledge. The influence, however, of his writings on the taste and views of speculative men of all persuasions, has been so great, as to mark him out as one of the most conspicuous characters of his age; and I shall accordingly devote to him a larger space than may, at first sight, appear due to an author who has distinguished himself only by the extent of his historical researches, and by the sagacity and subtlety of his critical disquisitions. This chapter also covers the philosophies of Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle, Joseph Addison, and the metaphysics of George Berkeley. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Prior to the nineteenth century no separate institutions for the treatment of juvenile delinquents existed in the United States. It was, in fact, well after the American Revolution before children were recognized as a distinct class demanding special attention. Since the close of the eighteenth century, as the percentage of children and youth under sixteen years of age has decreased, interest in and policy regarding their welfare has increased. Not until the 1820s were the first institutions for the training and rehabilitation of delinquents built in the nation's eastern urban centers. In the middle decades of the nineteenth century American population grew dramatically as it spread westward, and juvenile correctional institutions were established in the new states of the West. In the 1850s and 1860s Ohio established and financed two institutions for juvenile delinquents, which for over a century remained the primary response of the state to the growing problem of youthful misbehavior. Following the lead of eastern states like New York, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts, Ohio's juvenile correctional institutions sought to recreate family discipline and structure within the confines of the facilities. Founded primarily by middle class reformers the Boys' and Girls' Industrial schools, as they were known for the greatest part of their history, were intended to serve as refuges from the temptations and unhealthy influences that led youth astray. They were to be a source of order and stability in the lives of juveniles who were presumably in need of a stern hand of authority. Soon after their founding both the BIS and GIS grew rapidly and overcrowding became an acute and persistent problem. This, coupled with inadequate funding from the state, handicapped the two institutions and was largely responsible for their development into primarily custodial facilities unable to offer programs necessary to effectively rehabilitate the youths charged to their care. Strict regimentation and harsh discipline, sometimes approaching cruelty, became evident at both institutions. Educational programs also suffered and became largely oriented around the maintenance needs of the schools. BIS and GIS changed very little over the first century of their existence. As time passed there was more emphasis placed on industrial rather than agricultural training, but the vocational programs never met the needs of many inmates. In recent years, however, the state of Ohio has begun a movement away from large residential facilities toward smaller community based treatment programs. In January, 1980 Fairfield School for Boys (BIS) was closed and transferred to the adult corrections authorities. This dissertation is a comparative study of Ohio's two state supported juvenile correctional institutions over approximately the first century of their existence. It attempts to show how the system developed, how the two facilities compared to each other, and, most importantly, how they treated the youths committed to their care

AB  - Despite evidence demonstrating the importance of support from people who share the same background, the authors believe this has not been used in the development of interventions to help refugees adapt to life in Canada. Therefore they designed and pilot tested a culturally tailored intervention to meet the support needs and preferences of two ethno-culturally distinct refugee groups. The research was carried out in two urban centres in western and central Canada. Support was delivered to Sudanese and Somali refugees (n=58), by trained peer and professional helpers, in face-to-face groups matched by gender and ethnicity and in telephone dyads. Participants were surveyed pre and post test. Group interviews with refugee participants and individual interviews with peer and professional helpers post-test discussed perceived impacts of the intervention and factors influencing these impacts. Service providers and policy influencers (n=22) were interviewed in groups about the implications of this intervention study for services, programs and policies. There were significant increases in perceived support and social integration and significant decreases in loneliness following the intervention. Participants reported that they learned how to seek services, including health services, and how to cope with challenges faced as refugees. Service providers and policy influencers were impressed by the success of the intervention

AB  - African refugees face stresses that jeopardise their integration in resettlement countries. The aim of this study was to design and pilot test a culturally congruent intervention that meets the support needs and preferences of 2 ethno-culturally distinct refugee groups. The participants were 39 Somali and 29 Sudanese refugees. Semi-structured interviews were conducted by trained peer and professional facilitators to inform the specific design of the intervention. Face-to-face groups comprised of refugees, matched by gender and ethnicity, were created to enhance the depleted social networks of Somali and Sudanese refugees. Each peer support group met bi-weekly for a face-to-face session for 12 weeks. In addition, peer facilitators delivered supplementary one-to-one support via the telephone. The ingredients of the support intervention included: peer facilitators and professionals; provision of information, affirmation and emotional support; and accessibility (e.g. childcare, transportation). Data collected for the study included: in-depth pre-intervention interviews with potential support group participants to assess intervention preferences; fieldnotes by peer and professional facilitators; post-intervention group interviews with support group participants; and in-depth interviews with peer and professional helpers. A major perceived benefit of the support programme was connecting with people from African refugee participants�_T cultural communities. Following the social support intervention, refugees reported increased social integration, decreased loneliness and expanded coping repertoire

AB  - In today's globalized world, it happens continually more often that a person who has committed core international crimes appears in a State without any link to the crime.1 This State (the custodial State) often experiences a pressure to either prosecute or extradite the person to another State for prosecution there. The pressure comes from victims and surviving relatives, human rights organizations, civil society or other States. It also happens that during their interviews, asylum seekers themselves admit to crimes such as torture, rape and mass murder. In such situations, the State must take a stance as to how it shall proceed.2 The case most naturally belongs in the territorial State or in the home State of the victim or the suspect. But sometimes extraditing to an affected State is no real option. The suspect might risk torture or the death penalty there;3 the legal system might be too weak;4 the authorities might be implicated in the crimes;5 or the State might be socially and politically inclined not to prosecute the crimes.6 If extraditing the suspect to a third State or an international(ized) criminal court is also not an option,7 prosecution in the custodial State is the only way to avoid impunity. In order to avoid attracting criminals to their territories and in order to enable their courts to prosecute if necessary, many States have adopted legislation granting their courts universal jurisdiction. Some States have established a special prosecutorial unit for such cases.8 This raises the following fundamental question: Does international law allow a State to prosecute a crime without any link to it? This article concludes that the right to apply universal jurisdiction is more questionable than most international lawyers maintain. Reprinted by permission of Martinus Nijhoff Publishers

AB  - The thesis focuses on the exclusion of the other in contemporary politics. Following the work of Michel Foucault, it attempts to make two main points: first, that exclusion is a creative act, which aims not to protect a community from an already-existing other, but rather to bring into being an other so as to inaugurate the community to which s/he corresponds; second, that exclusion is site-specific, an act which differs from one place to the next depending upon the particular requirements of the community in question. The thesis is divided into three sections, each of which attempts to reveal the workings of a particular "structure of exclusion." First, drawing upon writings by Descartes and Michel de Certeau, it examines short stories by Borges and Kafka which deal with the "Great Wall of China," to look at the Wall as a "founding gesture," the first condition of community. In the second section, through a reading of texts by Plato, Deleuze, and Michel Serres, it turns to the exclusion of the "illegal immigrant"/"asylum seeker" in Western Europe and North America, to show how the laws and measures which deal with this figure are attempts to organize/categorize what the legislator perceives as a "swarming mass" of difference. Finally, employing theorists working within the field of psychoanalysis (Freud, Lacan, Zizek), and drawing mainly upon examples from Bosnia and Israel, it looks at the structure of the enclave as an attempt to enclose or confine the bearer of an "uncanny" alterity, the other who is "in you more than you" (Lacan)

AB  - The research presented in this thesis tackles the leisure behaviour of recent immigrants with emphasis on post-arrival changes in participation and on the role of assimilation in the leisure experience. The impact of perceived discrimination on leisure is also analysed. Empirical sections are based on a questionnaire survey of 264 recent immigrants from Poland and on interviews with 13 immigrants, conducted in Edmonton, Alberta. The thesis consists of four papers that deal with the changes in leisure behaviour following immigration, the evolution of constraints on leisure along with changing assimilation levels, the impact of discrimination on leisure, and the decision-making process leading to discrimination. The findings indicate that leisure participation changes significantly following immigration due to emerging opportunities, environmental differences, shattered social networks, and post-arrival depression. Leisure simultaneously allows to retain some elements of native culture and facilitates assimilation. Immigrants not only experience certain unique leisure constraints, but also many common constraints play for them a greater role than for the mainstream. Moreover, some constraints experienced by immigrants diminish along with the increasing assimilation level. White ethnics tend to experience less frequent discrimination in leisure settings than visible minorities, which can be attributed to difficulties with their identification and less competitive nature of leisure engagements. Moreover, white ethnic minorities experience less extreme forms of discrimination than visible groups. However, the expectation of discrimination often leads to "ethnic enclosure" in leisure, which can limit the choice of partners and reduce the awareness of leisure opportunities. A model of individual-level discriminatory behaviour is developed. Individuals are assumed to form a stable long-term perception of a minority group. Long-term perception is combined with incoming information input to produce a short-term attitude. Individuals with a hostile short-term attitude are assumed to derive satisfaction from discrimination. However, the potential perpetrator must also consider the consequences of his actions. Thus, certain level of hostility may produce various forms of discrimination depending on the operational conditioning factors. The framework explains the differences in discrimination between work and leisure and discrimination in leisure as a function of the cultural content of activities and the nature of interactions

AB  - Young immigrants have a significant impact on the social and cultural makeup of many American communities, especially the education system, and this literature review examines studies on their adaptation to a new life. It focuses on studies of adaptation from psychological, socio-psychological and sociological perspectives, and also examines theoretical frameworks used to model the adaptation processes of immigrants. Three categories of factors affecting adaptation are identified: individual (e.g. age, gender, personality traits, length of time in the host country); proximate environmental factors (e.g. family, school, peer group, neighbourhood); and distal environmental factors (e.g. education and health care systems, societal attitudes, legal system). Some policy implications are outlined. (Copies of this article are available from: Haworth Document Delivery Centre, Haworth Press Inc., 10 Alice Street,� Binghamton, NY 13904-1580)

AB  - This study analyzes how literary narrative perceives and represents 20th century Dominican history, in particular Rafael Leonidas Trujillo's dicatorship. The narratives analyzed in this study are: El Masacre se pasa a pie (1973), by the Dominican Freddy Prestol Castillo, The Farming of Bones (1998), by the Haitian-American Edwidge Danticat, Las Mirabal (1976), by Ram+�n Alberto Ferreras, In the Time of Butterflies (1995), by the Dominican-American Julia +_lvarez, Cementerio sin cruces (1949), by the exiled Dominican author Andr+�s Requena, and La Fiesta del Chivo (2000), by the well-know Peruvian author Mario Vargas Llosa. The narratives selected share much in common in that they are all to greater and lesser extents historical-political narratives. They are also narratives of dictatorship and focus on the experience of living under a dictatorship, not the dictator. Additionally, the selected narratives can also be categorized as those written during the Trujillato and those written after Trujillo's assassination. This is important in that his death allowed for the re-writing of the official history without fear of repercussion. Of particular interest to this study is how the literary texts chosen reconstruct Dominican historical discourses thereby creating new interpretations. This study also focuses on the development of Dominican national identity or identities, (black, white, Indian, masculine, feminine, etc.) and their representation in literature. The Dominican historical event or period that will be studied is the 'Trujillato' or the era of Trujillo (1930-1961), and more specifically within this time frame, the massacre of the Haitians along the Dominican-Haitian border in 1937, and the imprisonment and execution of the Mirabal sisters in 1962. For each historical event, I have selected two novels: one written by a Dominican and another written by either an 'outsider' or someone who is 'marginalized'. This analysis allows for a better understanding of how national identities are constantly being re-negotiated and of how Dominican history is constantly being recorded and re-written by both Dominican and non-Dominican authors

AB  - We have studied the distribution of astrocytes in the ganglion cell and nerve fibre layers of the retina in cat, rat, rabbit, and possum using anti-serum and a monoclonal antibody against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and our own monoclonal antibody against glial filaments. The distribution of retinal astrocytes appears to be strongly determined by the vasculature of the retina; astrocytes are absent from almost all the retina of the possum and from the avascular regions of the rabbit retina. In the cat and rabbit, retinal astrocytes also show a strong affinity for the bundles of ganglion cell axons found at the inner surface of the retina. Retinal astrocytes do not invest the somas of ganglion cells, and even in areas of retina in which they are numerous, they are sharply confined to the layer of ganglion cell axons. It is suggested that retinal astrocytes are "immigrant" fibrous astrocytes that enter the retina with its vasculature

AB  - Neville Chamberlain's role in the Spanish Civil War is a neglected subject in the history of the conflict. Yet he wielded considerable influence over Britain's Spanish policy. Like most Conservatives, his ideological sympathies lay more with the Nationalist forces led by General Francisco Franco than the besieged Republicans. At the same time, he deplored the intervention of Germany, Italy, and Soviet Russia and was strongly committed to the policy of non-intervention, which he genuinely believed had confined the Spanish conflict and prevented its escalation into a European conflagration. He was strongly opposed to granting belligerent rights to Franco unless foreign volunteers were withdrawn from Spain. He deplored the bombing of civilians in Spain, sought to help the many refugees caused by the war, and tried unsuccessfully on occasions to mediate an end to the conflict. The civil war was a considerable obstacle which threatened to undermine Chamberlain's appeasement of Fascist Italy, intended to weaken the Rome�_"Berlin Axis, and to constrain Germany in pursuit of general European appeasement. The Prime Minister's commitment to non-intervention in Spain, more the creation of the Foreign Office than his own, did no serious damage to British economic and strategic interests before June 1940.

AB  - The present investigation sought to determine the correlates of attitudes towards the new ANC-dominated government in South Africa among two groups of White university students. To a large extent, the present research replicates an earlier project conducted in 1986 which investigated the predictors of attitudes towards the ANC at a time when it was banned as were its leaders who were either imprisoned or in exile. Results indicate that conformity to group norms was of importance in the Afrikaans-speaking sample as was patriotism, authoritarian behavior and prejudiced attitudes. Conversely, attitudes in the English-speaking group seemed to be held less strongly and attitudes towards the ANC-led government appeared no longer to be related to such factors as prejudice, authoritarianism, patriotism or self-esteem. Results are understood in terms of long-standing sociopolitical differences between White English-speaking and Afrikaner groups in South Africa.

AB  - Material for this report was collected by Human Rights Watch/Middle East between March 1996 and February 1997. Although the government of Bahrain rejected the request by Human Rights Watch to send an official information-gathering mission to the country, Human Rights Watch representatives did visit Bahrain briefly nonetheless, where they met with defense lawyers and persons who had been detained by the authorities, as well as prominent persons in various professions and in business. Human Rights Watch representatives also met with Bahrainis living in exile. Abuses in the area of law enforcement and administration of justice encompass the behavior of security forces toward those under arrest and detention as well as those involved in civil disturbances. Other abuses in this area include arbitrary detention, physical and psychological abuse of detainees, denial of access to legal counsel, and denial of the right to a swift and impartial judicial hearing. The broad denial of fundamental political rights and civil liberties encompasses freedom of expression, freedom of association and assembly, and the right to participate in the conduct of public affairs. In terms of numbers of people affected, the situation has been particularly acute since the end of 1994, with the onset of a period of protracted civil unrest that has continued into the spring of 1997. This unrest has increasingly assumed the character of a sectarian conflict between the majority Shi'a population and the Sunni ruling family and military-political establishment. Human Rights Watch calls on the government of Bahrain to repeal all laws and decrees that unduly restrict the ability of Bahraini citizens to exercise peacefully their rights to freedom of assembly, association, and expression. Human Rights Watch also urges an end to the practice of detaining people for unlimited or extended periods without charge and an end to the practice of interrogating detainees without allowing access to legal counsel.

AB  - This dissertation is concerned with the experiences of South Indian male and female immigrants in the Portland. Oregon area, where some--but not all--of the sample has been employed in high-technology. Twenty South Indian high-tech men, 18 South Indian high-tech women, and 20 South Indian homemakers were interviewed to explore the effect of employment on gender role ideology and assimilation. The sample was further confined to South Indian Hindus who have lived in the U.S. between four and 20 years, and are married (but not to each other). The stories of South Indian men and women shed light on the consequences for assimilation of 'where you start' in terms of traditional vs. modern values, as well as the consequences of being male or female. Homemakers and men married to homemakers experience the greatest change in comparison with dual professional high-tech couples in terms of gender roles, behavior, and ideology. This is brought about by a transition from a relatively more conservative and restrictive environment into a more open and less restrictive environment. The change is less dramatic for high-tech couples, as their ideas and behaviors in India were more similar to the ideas and behaviors that govern their world today. This research v indicates that immigration brings structural changes in one's environment--greater independence, autonomy, and isolation. The structural changes lead to cultural changes--increased liberalism in regard to gender roles and relations. The significance of these changes and the implications for gender roles, values, and behaviors, is negotiated within the family. Viewing the family as a site of struggle as well as a source of cultural maintenance, allows one to see how gender roles and relations are negotiated over time in the new cultural milieu

AB  - The policy of apartheid not only fosters conditions conducive to child abuse and neglect, but is in itself abusive. Apartheid policies have led to civil unrest and high levels of violence in South Africa's black townships. Many youth are thus exposed to multiple trauma including witnessing death, being arrested, being beaten, being in exile, and being separated from family and friends. This had led many to develop PTSD although this term is a misnomer in the South African context as traumatic stress is not historic but is current. Treatment programs have thus to be modified to accommodate the impossibility of guaranteeing even the physical safety of patients. They have also to be modified to accommodate the fact that most black youth are totally unfamiliar with the notion of the "talking cure." This paper describes a modified treatment program for PTSD which was developed in working with a group of 60 township refugees. Systematic follow up studies of its effectiveness were impossible as many of those treated have gone into hiding to escape the continuing violence in their communities, a violence facilitated by the ultimate guardian of the child, the State. However there are indications that the program was successful in providing immediate relief. [Author Abstract] KEY WORDS: treatment; apartheid; abuse; PTSD; neglect; detention; war children

AB  - In order to determine why high rates of HIV transmission have persisted in a rural area despite community-wide HIV prevention since the mid-1980s, qualitative information was collected about the contexts and social organization of risk behaviour for HIV transmission from residents of a southern Florida community with high HIV prevalence. Original data were collected during 1995�_"1997 using individual interviews, observations, focus groups, and print media. The research findings were recently reviewed by community members, and the relevance of the data in the present day context was confirmed. We identified risk behaviours including multiple sex partners within heterosexual networks that cross socioeconomic strata and include adults and young people, sex workers, men who have sex with men, prison inmates, truckers, and migrant workers. Crack cocaine was an important feature of some networks. Financial support from multiple male or female sex partners was often part of a personal economic strategy and overlaid traditional social support networks. This type of relationship appears to be historically integrated into the economic fabric of the community and is not likely to receive social censure. Sexual reciprocity may explain, in part, why HIV transmission is rising among women in rural southern communities that have depressed economies.

AB  - The article provides information on the Royal Literary Fund, the oldest literary association in Great Britain and for almost 200 years the principal refuge for writers in distress. The Fund's founder was an eccentric but humane cleric named David Williams, who migrated from the coal-mining valleys of Wales to London, England late in 1770. His unconventionally extended to his religious practices and he held services based not on The Book of Common Prayer but on a liturgy of his own writing, one that welcomed Jews and Gentiles, Christians and Mahometans and conspicuously excluded the immortality of the soul and the existence of Christ. By mid-19th century, the Fund had gained financial solvency due to the sumptuous fund-raising dinners and to the patronage of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, who gave the Fund permission to add Royal to its name. In 1839 there were 88 grants totaling ��1,590. The largest eight grants at ��50 each nearly equaled an average workingman's salary for a year or about a fifth of the minimum considered necessary for a gentleman. Among those 88 beneficiaries, the Fund listed three dramatists, seven novelists and 19 poets. The Fund also aided contributors to such fields such as medicine, science, theology and topography, a range that considerably stretches the term literary

AB  - Ethical issues within public health and health policy, related e.g. to pandemic plans and vaccination policies (c.f. SARS or the New Influenza), preventive measures like screening (e.g. for breast cancer or dementia) or health information campaigns, social inequalities or health care rationing gain increasing relevance around the world. Evidence-based information for a valid benefit-harm assessment is often rare and hard to get for participants in public health interventions. Program implementations often disregard requirements of a fair decision-making process (like public participation, transparency, etc.). Originating from an international conference (based on a call for abstracts and external review), this volume contains contributions from a group of experienced scholars from multiple disciplines and countries, covering (i) conceptual foundations of public health ethics, (ii) methodological approaches and (iii) normative analyses of specific issues and cases. In bridging theoretical foundations with practical applications, the volume shall provide a valuable resource for researchers, practitioners and students in the field.-�

AB  - In refugee settings, alcohol and other psychoactive substances can potentiate many underlying problems and contribute to the erosion of social relations and community structure. Interventions to minimise harmful use of alcohol and other psychoactive substances can lead to positive changes, but must be customised to the specific needs of each setting. Rapid assessments with appropriate tools, understanding the situation,partnership with workers and refugees, as well as inclusive approaches are all essential. Based on field experience in two refugee camps, these elements are discussed and recommendations are proposed for integrated interventions for alcohol and psychoactive substances.

This collection highlights innovative programs and interventions targeted toward underserved, vulnerable, and marginalized populations, including the homeless, immigrants, refugees, female ex-offenders, people with developmental disabilities who are entering the criminal justice system, homicidal youth, and children whose parents are involved in high-conflict custody disputes. In addition, Practicing Social Justice raises critical questions on how society should justly provide for the economic well-being of our most valuable human asset--our children--with an incisive look at the Temporary Aid for Needy Families legislation and its long-term impact on disadvantaged children. This book also evaluates the Bridges Across Racial Polarization Programs� and explores a wide selection of important social justice issues that the social workers of today and tomorrow need to understand.

AB  - Besides cardiovascular disease, a high salt intake causes other adverse health effects, i.e., gastric and some other cancers, obesity (risk factor for many cancer sites), Meniere's disease, worsening of renal disease, triggering an asthma attack, osteoporosis, exacerbation of fluid retention, renal calculi, etc. Diets containing high amounts of food preserved by salting and pickling are associated with an increased risk of cancers of the stomach, nose and throat. Because gastric cancer is still the most common cancer in some countries (especially in Japan), its prevention is one of the most important aspects of cancer control strategy. Observations among Japanese immigrants in the U.S.A. and Brazil based on the geographic differences, the trend in cancer incidence with time, and change in the incidence patterns indicate that gastric cancer is closely associated with dietary factors such as the intake of salt and salted food. The findings of many epidemiological studies suggest that high dietary salt intake is a significant risk factor for gastric cancer and this association was found to be strong in the presence of Helicobacter (H.) pylori infection with atrophic gastritis. A high-salt intake strips the lining of the stomach and may make infection with H. pylori more likely or may exacerbate the infection. Salting, pickling and smoking are traditionally popular ways of preparing food in Japan and some parts of Asia. In addition to salt intake, cigarette smoking and low consumption of fruit and vegetables increase the risk of stomach cancer. However, it is not known whether it is specifically the salt in these foods or a combination of salt and other chemicals that can cause cancer. One study identified a mutagen in nitrite-treated Japanese salted fish, and chemical structure of this mutagen suggests that it is derived from methionine and that salt and nitrite are precursors for its formation. Working under conditions of heat stress greatly increased the workers' salt excretion through perspiration. Workers exposed to heat stress consumed as much as 13-38 g salt daily. As salt strongly enhances and promotes chemical gastric carcinogenesis and H. pylori infection in both humans and animals, there is an association between work, salt intake, and development of stomach cancer. Reducing salt intake, especially during pregnancy, also reduces the risk of developing breast cancer and many other diseases, as well as obesity. The risk of most cancers is reduced by losing weight. The geographical data and analyses currently available suggest that road salt (road salting in winter) may be associated with elevated mortality from cancer of the breast, lung, esophagus, throat, larynx, large intestine, rectum and bladder. There is no available literature on the health impacts of road salt. The cause and effect relationships cannot be established without further studies

AB  - Strozzi (str��t�_�ts�"), noble Florentine family. It grew rich through commerce and took an active part in the government of the city after the 13th cent. Later the Strozzi strongly opposed the Medici rule of Florence. Among the Strozzi, there were several eminent soldiers, scholars, and men of letters. At an early date the family divided into several branches. Palla Strozzi, c.1373�_"1462, a politician and ardent humanist, furthered Greek studies in Florence and Padua. Filippo Strozzi, 1428�_"91, was banished by the Medici, gained wealth and influence in Naples, and after his return to Florence began to build the celebrated Strozzi Palace. His son Filippo Strozzi, 1489�_"1538, married a granddaughter of Lorenzo de' Medici; he was first friendly to the Medici, then became a staunch opponent. He led Florentine exiles against Cosimo I de' Medici, was captured, and died in prison. His son Leone Strozzi, 1515�_"54, first entered the Order of Malta and later became an admiral in the French service. He distinguished himself in wars against Spain and England. Another son of Filippo, Piero Strozzi, d. 1558, a violent enemy of the Medici, fought for the French in the Italian Wars and was made a marshal of France. He took part in the French siege of Calais (1557). Filippo Strozzi, 1541�_"82, was also in the French service. He was captured and killed by the Spanish in a naval battle off the Azores.

AB  - Spirit Wrestler is an historical novel narrated by Mikhail Mikhailovich Strelyaev. He was born in 1868 in a village in western Russia, the son of an atheist father and a Doukhobor mother. After the death of his parents, he lives the first half of his life in the southern Caucasus Mountains among his mother's people, the Doukhobors (or "Spirit-Wrestlers," a religious sect). When the Doukhobor leader dies, the new leader, Peter Vasilievich Verigin, is exiled and, via messengers, takes them on an ever-intensifying journey toward strict fundamentalism, attracting government abuse. When the sect withdraws from military conscription and burns their arms, the government decimates their community through incarceration, exile, rape, and confiscation of their communal lands. Leo Tolstoy hears of their plight, arranges safe passage for them to Canada, and writes his final novel, Resurrection , in order to donate the proceeds to the Doukhobor emigration. Verigin is released from exile and returns to the others in Saskatchewan. The community begins to fracture, causing the rise of the Sons of Freedom, a sub-sect that opposes Verigin. Most of the Doukhobor lands are confiscated by the government because of disputes. A majority of the Doukhobors then move with Verigin to Brilliant, British Columbia. Life is good for a time, but the old fractures re-emerge and Verigin is killed under mysterious circumstances in 1924. The Doukhobor community begins a quick decline. The narrator is carried through this sequence of dramatic events--at first by living near a Doukhobor village, then by marrying a Doukhobor woman, and finally by becoming a part of their community--allowing the reader to glimpse what it was like to be a Doukhobor at this time. Throughout the novel he struggles with his own faith, just as the Doukhobors struggle with their communal sense of themselves and their ever-changing religion practices. In the end, he is haunted by the mysterious saga in which he played a consistent part, and he suggests that he could very well have been part of the demise of the Doukhobors, possibly even the murderer of Verigin himself

AB  - The independent post-Yugoslav country of Croatia has faced a conjunction of war, mass forced migration and post-communist/post-socialist transition which defies adequate analysis by a single discipline, much less the 'technicism' of traditional 'refugee studies'. Based on three years of 'social praxis' in Croatia �_" the author served as a volunteer in a refugee camp, working with grassroots NGOs, and as a 'professional' researcher examining NGO contributions to 'peacebuilding', social reconstruction and social development - this article challenges the existing orthodoxy which sees NGOs as inexorably a part of 'progressive' civil society. The experience of Suncokret and other NGOs in Croatia, in the context of the involvement of global agencies, rather supports the argument that NGO work with refugees and displaced persons perpetuates the extended reproduction of a globalized new professional middle class.

AB  - Historically, German American women authors have been the objects of a double bias: as female immigrants, their role in the German immigrant experience has been virtually invisible, since the parameters of that experience have been defined in terms of men's--not women's--activities; as immigrant authors they have been neglected by German literary history which has shown scant interest in the literary production of the immigrant community. The purpose of this study is to examine the double status of nineteenth-century German American women writers--as immigrants and as women--to determine how it affected their reception in history, how it defined their role as literary figures, and how it shaped and influenced their literature. Focusing on the "golden age" of German American literary production (1850-1890), the first half of the study examines the position of the woman writer within the cultural context of a displaced community, emphasizing the sociological, economic, and pyschological variables which influenced women's professional opportunities. The literary careers of three German American women serve as case studies of the small number of women who ignored or rejected the pressure upon immigrant women to confine their activities to the private sphere. Therese Robinson (ps. Talvj, 1797-1870), Mathilde Franziska Anneke (1817-1884), and Kathinka Sutro-Schucking (1838-?) all overcome the obstacles which militated against women's entry into the literary arena only to be confronted with a new set of difficulties which was plaguing all immigrant authors, including exploitative publishing policies, reader indifference and low creative morale. Chapter Four of the study, a profile of the immigrant experience of Mathilde Anneke based on archival letters, examines in detail the tenuous position of women who pursued writing careers in German America. An analysis of the creative works of Robinson, Anneke, and Sutro-Schucking provides the second focus of the study with special emphasis placed on their fictional representations of the immigrant experience and women's role within it. Synopses of the works discussed are included in an appendix. Although these authors were not innovators in the genre of the immigrant narrative, their fiction contains important insights into the changing preoccupations of the German American community between 1850-1890. Their works also add a new dimension to immigrant literature through the use of a female perspective which views the actions of the world in their relationship to women, rather than men. It stands as one of the most significant findings of this investigation that German American women authors unanimously perceived the New World as a destructive environment for immigrant women, and thus in an extended sense, for themselves as well

AB  - BACKGROUND: Deficiency of micronutrients is common in refugee populations OBJECTIVES: Identify deficiencies and whether provided supplements and wheat flour fortified with 10 micronutrients impacts upon status among breast-feeding women from Maela refugee camp METHODS: Two sequential cross-sectional studies were conducted in different groups of lactating mothers at 12 weeks postpartum. The first survey was before and the second 4-5 months after micronutrient fortified flour (MFF) had been provided to the camp (in addition to the regular food basket). Iron status and micronutrients were measured in serum, whole blood, and in breast milk samples RESULTS: Iron and zinc deficiency and anemia were highly prevalent while low serum retinol and thiamine deficiency were rarely detected. Iron and zinc deficiency were associated with anemia, and their proportions were significantly lower after the introduction of MFF (21 vs. 35% with soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) >8.5 mg/L, P = 0.042, and 50 vs. 73% with serum zinc <0.66 mg/L, P = 0.001). Serum sTfR, whole-blood thiamine diphosphate (TDP) and serum -carotene were significant predictors (P < 0.001) of milk iron, thiamine and -carotene, respectively. Lower prevalence of iron deficiency in the MFF group was associated with significantly higher iron and thiamine in breast milk CONCLUSIONS: High whole-blood TDP and breast milk thiamine reflected good compliance to provided thiamine; high prevalence of iron deficiency suggested insufficient dietary iron and low acceptance to ferrous sulfate supplements. MFF as an additional food ration in Maela refugee camp seemed to have an effect in reducing both iron and zinc deficiency postpartum

AB  - BACKGROUND: The provision of high doses of thiamine may prevent thiamine deficiency in the post-partum period of displaced persons METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The study aimed to evaluate a supplementation regimen of thiamine mononitrate (100 mg daily) at the antenatal clinics in Maela refugee camp. Women were enrolled during antenatal care and followed after delivery. Samples were collected at 12 weeks post partum. Thiamine diphosphate (TDP) in whole blood and thiamine in breast-milk of 636 lactating women were measured. Thiamine in breast-milk consisted of thiamine monophosphate (TMP) in addition to thiamine, with a mean TMP to total thiamine ratio of 63%. Mean whole blood TDP (130 nmol/L) and total thiamine in breast-milk (755 nmol/L) were within the upper range reported for well-nourished women. The prevalence of women with low whole blood TDP (<65 nmol/L) was 5% and with deficient breast-milk total thiamine (<300 nmol/L) was 4%. Whole blood TDP predicted both breast-milk thiamine and TMP (R(2)=0.36 and 0.10, p<0.001). A ratio of TMP to total thiamine >=63% was associated with a 7.5 and 4-fold higher risk of low whole blood TDP and deficient total breast-milk thiamine, respectively. Routine provision of daily 100 mg of thiamine mononitrate post-partum compared to the previous weekly 10 mg of thiamine hydrochloride resulted in significantly higher total thiamine in breast-milk CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Thiamine supplementation for lactating women in Maela refugee camp is effective and should be continued. TMP and its ratio to total thiamine in breast-milk, reported for the first time in this study, provided useful information on thiamine status and should be included in future studies of breast-milk thiamine

AB  - Crimmigration law wastes one of the law's most valuable tools: time. It eschews the temporal gauges that criminal law and immigration law rely on to evaluate who should be included or expelled from society. Instead, crimmigration law narrows the decision whether to exclude or expel the noncitizen from the nation to a single moment in time: the moment of the crime that makes the noncitizen eligible for deportation or incarceration for an immigration-related offense. This extraordinary focus on the moment of the crime conflicts with the fundamental notion of the individual as a collection of many moments composing our experiences, relationships, and circumstances. It frames out circumstances, conduct, experiences, or relationships that tell a different story about the individual, closing off the potential for redemption and disregarding the collateral effects on the people and communities with ties to the noncitizen. This Article critiques crimmigration law's uniquely cabined approach to the temporal aspects of decisions about membership. It explores how crimmigration law wastes the potential for time to usefully evaluate a noncitizen's connection to the community, the advisability of expulsion, and the potential for inclusion. By establishing permanent expulsion as the default consequence, crimmigration law ignores the potential for reintroduction into the community that criminal sentencing and relief from deportation contemplate. Instead, it combines and heightens the exclusionary power of criminal and immigration law. Focus on that moment has the effect of flattening the hierarchy of immigration status--from permanent resident to unauthorized migrant--that has traditionally informed the level of constitutional and statutory rights granted to individual noncitizens. The Article explores solutions to this temporal stasis, examining the benefits and costs of resurrecting a statute of limitations for crimmigration law.

AB  - (from the chapter) Psychotherapies with refugees and asylum seekers are a challenging task for health professionals. Therapists do not only have to face the difficulties of transcultural communication, they also have to confront the omnipresence of social and administrative problems these patients struggle with. They equally have to adapt their technique to the dynamics appearing in therapeutic work with victims of deliberate violence. In this article, we first propose a brief discussion of these problems, their impact on the psychotherapeutic work and our strategies to deal with them. In the following part, we illustrate our approach by a case study of Mr Diallo, a 36-yr-old man referred to a trauma team for chronic pain and invasive recollections related to his imprisonment and persecution during the conflict between the black nomads and the government. Transcultural therapies with asylum seekers confront therapists with an extremely complex field of interrelations between different cultural and political contexts. Therapists should consider these sociopolitical and cultural contexts and try to understand the unique way their patients try to deal with them. Accepting the impact of "outer reality" on their subjectivity is an imperative in therapies with refugees and asylum seekers. At the same time, we should also insist on the importance of subjective experience and the unique way in which the individual perceives and transforms the reality he or she encounters.

AB  - The article looks at the history of Soviet brutality which took place in the remote Russian city of Archangel. The Archangel oblast was one of the earliest Soviet killing fields. A remote land of forest and swamp was an ideal place of exile and execution. By the late 1930s the region was dotted with prison camps and peasant settlements. When the Soviets came they found a place of pilgrimage, a once rich monastery supported by a neat little town. The crosses went down and the prisoners came in. On Sekirnaya Hill, the lighthouse-chapel became a punishment barracks of barbarous cruelty, a beacon for future totalitarians

AB  - How do we read the novel as a record of the ways in which communities recuperate from violence? How is resistance to violence possible through the act of narration? This project focuses on select contemporary novels in which women characters resist violence and redefine notions of community by imagining bonds with the dead, the exiled, and the disempowered. The inscription of state and family on women's bodies is a prominent theme in the textual analysis framed by this study. It draws within its scope novels from the Americas and South Asia that explicitly address violence committed in the name of territoriality, religious orthodoxy and racial supremacy. The novels from the Americas reflect on violence against marginalized people as a public spectacle instrumentalized and sanctioned by law. The South Asian novels direct our attention to the more intimate confines of the domestic sphere, where law oppresses the dispossessed through the filial figure of the patriarch. Read together, these disparate texts alert us to the fundamental importance of the novel as a discourse of resistance to iniquity, as a theory of recovery from human loss. The earlier chapters study novels from the Americas like Toni Morrison's Paradise and Edwidge Danticat's The Farming of Bones while the later chapters focus on the South Asian novels read in Hindi like Mridula Garg's Kathgulab and Tahmina Durrani's Kufr. My dissertation emphasizes remembering, recalling and retelling stories of lost lives as a powerful mode of resistance and dwells on the place of imagined communities with the dead in these texts. The critical research focus is on ingenious ways in which women-characters in novels restore dignity and agency to their kin and beloved by experimenting with voice and narrative techniques within the novel. The resilience of the women characters is a transcendent force which makes it possible to resist the domestic patriarch as well as injustices perpetrated in the name of law and state

AB  - Scyphomedusae have been recognized in recent years as important predators in coastal and estuarine environments, but the factors affecting vulnerability of zooplankton to these cruising jellyfish remain poorly understood. In particular, models fail to account for the ingestion of fast-escaping prey such as calanoid copepods. Analysis of gastric contents of Aurelia aurita, Cyanea sp. and Chrysaora quinquecirrha from field-collections and mesocosm experiments showed that despite morphological differences, all three species fed on Acartia spp. copepods; C. quinquecirrha selected adult over copepodite stages. The goal of this research was to determine which characteristics of Acartia spp. copepods make them susceptible to predation by scyphomedusae. I compared feeding rates by medusae on live and immobilized (heat-killed) adult and copepodite stages in a planktonkreisel while simultaneously videotaping predator-prey interactions. The continuous-flow planktonkreisel allowed manipulation of freely swimming predator-prey pairs yet avoided many of the problems associated with small container experiments. The results contained some surprises. First, size had a dramatic impact on the vulnerability of copepods, influencing contact and retention rates. Small size provided a refuge for copepods trying to elude capture by jellyfish. This effect must be incorporated into predictive models. In addition, scyphomedusae digested smaller copepodites faster than larger adults, a difference that influenced calculations of feeding rates and prey selection. Second, although copepod behavior decreased feeding rates on adults and mitigated the liability associated with larger size, it did not significantly change feeding rates on copepodites. Consequently, I expected adults and copepodites to respond differently to encounters with scyphomedusae. The salient distinction was that copepodites failed to escape, or responded passively, more often than did adults. Third, escape velocities of copepods corresponded poorly to their vulnerability to medusae. Instead, copepod escape behavior was complex, variable, and effective. Fewer than 1% of encounters resulted in ingestion. Escapes typically involved multiple, sometimes-misdirected jumps at submaximum velocities. Because copepods exhibit wide variability in escape behavior, scyphomedusae may not capture them using a single, quantifiable mechanism. A range of responses may be the best strategy for copepods faced with strong predation pressure from a variety of predators

T1  - Sudanese in Australia: renewal and hope [dissertation]

KW  - eppi-reviewer
AB  - The country of Sudan has experienced violent conflict for much of the past 50 years, killing and displacing millions of Sudanese and generating widespread diaspora. In recent years, international humanitarian resettlement programs have increased the numbers of Africans entering third country resettlement programs; however, very little has been written about the experiences of African adults in resettlement as compared to other refugee groups. The current study used quantitative and qualitative methods to enhance understanding of the refugee experience among a specific group of refugees, adults from Sudan resettled in Brisbane, Australia. 90 Sudanese adults (Mean age = 34.19) participated in the quantitative study, with 10 participants from that group purposefully selected to complete the semi-structured qualitative interview. Participants represented 20 different ethnic groups and reported disparate backgrounds and experiences both in Sudan and Australia, highlighting the incredibly heterogeneity of the Sudanese community. Quantitative participants reported an average 5.54 traumatic experiences on the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ) and approximately one-quarter of the sample meeting recommended cut-off criteria for significant psychological distress on the Hopkins Symptoms Checklist (HSCL) and symptoms of PTSD on the HTQ. Individuals with higher rates of prior trauma, younger adults, and people who had spent time in a refugee camp reported higher levels of psychological distress. These groups also reported higher frequencies of discrimination, with one-third of the sample reporting experiences of discrimination several times per month. During data collection in 2007, there was significant public debate regarding the integration of the Sudanese community, mirroring debates worldwide as nations struggle with public discourse surrounding changes in global migration. In the current sample, the majority of participants (54.4%) reported integration as their method of acculturation, with individuals who had been in Australia longer, having higher levels of education, and greater social connectivity within both the Sudanese and Australian communities being more likely to endorse integration. The 10 qualitative participants emphasized opportunities for advancement such as through education and employment opportunities as a highlight and experiences of discrimination as a low point in resettlement, suggesting the importance of social context and opportunities for advancement in resettlement.

AB  - This dissertation examines Japanese war brides, who married American servicemen after W.W.II. It argues that this post-war immigrant group followed an unusual assimilation process, in which acculturation--the identification with the values, norms, and behavior patterns of the host society more than those of one's original ethnic heritage--occurred following intermarriage. The assimilation pattern of Japanese war brides was rather reversed compared with other immigrant groups in the United States. This study attempts to uncover (1) how such an unusual pattern of assimilation came to occur, and (2) what are the consequences of this "deviant" assimilation. Through in-depth interviews and questionnaires as the primary resource, the study found that war brides' awareness of women's oppression in Japan played a part in promoting their marriages with American GIs, though the constrained post-war economy was the major factor. The study also found that the war brides have still not completely assimilated into the core of the host culture, since the retention of Japanese ethnic identity was evident in the areas of friendship, occupation, and diet. However, the women studied have become in general well acculturated into American society today, so that most of them see the culture of the host society more favorably than that of Japan. Their positive views on America helped them psychologically to settle into this country. Thus, the war brides who failed to acquire such a favorable view were more likely to encounter psychological problems adjusting to the life in the United States. The dissertation argues that one of the key elements which contributed to their successful acculturation is the host culture's gender roles. The women quickly adapted to the gender roles in America, which were less rigid generally, and more favorable for women, than such roles in Japan. The paper also points out that the war brides today have different perspectives on gender roles from their counterparts in Japan, due to household arrangements in their married lives in which their husbands have been relatively active participants in household chores, practiced over the years. These Japanese-born women in general now have more flexible views on gender roles than their peers who remained in Japan

AB  - When General Augusto Pinochet breathed his last on December 10 2006, this much seemed clear: the man who had lived his whole life and never paid for even one of his crimes had done it again. Once more - one final time - Pinochet had escaped judgment. This paper describes and analyses the struggle to prosecute Pinochet in Chile from his return home in March 2000, following his 18 month detention in Britain, to his death in December 2006. It examines how the numerous proceedings against the former dictator were successfully delayed, why Pinochet was never convicted of anything, and the implications for Chile and the international human rights movement.This paper seeks to make an empirically-based contribution to the largely theoretical debates concerning: the interaction between law and politics; the judicialization of power; the efficacy of human rights, and the ability of courts, activist lawyers and social movements to find new paths to substantive justice; globalization; the denial of organised atrocities and the struggle to acknowledge the past; and the impact of international (i.e., third country) as distinct from domestic accountability. It derives from my analyses of archival material, multiple secondary literatures and hundreds of interviews with key actors (including victims and their families, exiles, judges, NGOs, lawyers, officials, journalists and politicians). ..PAT.-Unpublished Manuscript [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]Copyright of Conference Papers -- Law & Society is the property of Law & Society Association and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

AB  - The aim was to determine the epidemiology and risk factors of childhood and young adult injuries among long-term Afghan refugees in Pakistan. A stratified cluster study was undertaken on a random sample of refugee households from June to July 2002. The Afghan Refugee Injury Survey was administered to the head of the household and recorded all injuries among household members within the last 3 months. Crude injury incidence was 12.3 per 1000 population among those aged 0-29 years (age groups 0-4, 5-14 and 15-29 years). Those aged 15-29 years had the highest injury rate (18.3 per 1000) closely followed by those aged 5-14 (12.3 per 1000) and much higher than the 0-4 years category (2.3 per 1000). Falls accounted for most injuries (48%) with both road traffic injuries and assaults accounting for 15%. The 15-29 year age group (odds ratio = 9.1) and those educated informally or for less than 6 years (odds ratio = 2.10), were associated with injury (p < 0.05) after adjustment for age, gender, occupation and education. Occupation was not associated with injury at a statistically significant level. Afghan refugee children and young adults are disproportionately affected by injuries, especially falls, than children in developed countries. Appropriate injury prevention strategies must be implemented among refugee camps with long-term refugees as part of their health programmes

AB  - The World Health Organization has recognized �_~traditional medicine�_T as a de facto and economical substitute for biomedicine in the developing world. Accordingly, the Zambian government aims to integrate �_~traditional healers�_T, locally known as ng'anga, with their biomedical counterparts in a national health care system. Hence, on the one hand, ng'anga elaborate their practice into �_~herbalism�_T, which could meet scientific standards and fit into the scope of biomedicine. On the other hand, they continue to deal with affliction by positing the existence of occult agents, such as witchcraft and spirits, at the risk of being criticized for exploiting indigenous beliefs. As a result, many ng'anga associate themselves with Christianity, the national religion of Zambia, which serves as an official domain of the occult where they take refuge from biomedical rationalization. However, conventional churches, the government and health authorities do not approve of the link between Christianity and traditional medicine; hence ng'anga as traditional healers are marginalized in modern, Christian Zambia. Being thus dissociated from the national religion, ng'anga are officially confined to the periphery of national health care, where they submit to the primacy of biomedicine and the workings of state power.

AB  - There is concern among public health professionals that the current economic downturn, initiated by the financial crisis that started in 2007, could precipitate the transmission of infectious diseases while also limiting capacity for control. Although studies have reviewed the potential effects of economic downturns on overall health, to our knowledge such an analysis has yet to be done focusing on infectious diseases. We performed a systematic literature review of studies examining changes in infectious disease burden subsequent to periods of crisis. The review identified 230 studies of which 37 met our inclusion criteria. Of these, 30 found evidence of worse infectious disease outcomes during recession, often resulting from higher rates of infectious contact under poorer living circumstances, worsened access to therapy, or poorer retention in treatment. The remaining studies found either reductions in infectious disease or no significant effect. Using the paradigm of the "SIR" (susceptible-infected-recovered) model of infectious disease transmission, we examined the implications of these findings for infectious disease transmission and control. Key susceptible groups include infants and the elderly. We identified certain high-risk groups, including migrants, homeless persons, and prison populations, as particularly vulnerable conduits of epidemics during situations of economic duress. We also observed that the long-term impacts of crises on infectious disease are not inevitable: considerable evidence suggests that the magnitude of effect depends critically on budgetary responses by governments. Like other emergencies and natural disasters, preparedness for financial crises should include consideration of consequences for communicable disease control

AB  - Concerns about the problem of over-research have been reported in communities around the world, and across a wide range of fields of social science research practice for decades. Yet, despite this, over-research remains under-addressed by social scientists as a significant research concern. In this article, we discuss the problem of over-research as articulated by the residents of the Shatila Palestinian refugee camp in Beirut, Lebanon �_" a camp which is probably one of the most heavily researched neighbourhoods anywhere, and certainly within the Palestinian diaspora. Concerns voiced by Shatila residents focus on three issues, in particular: the relationship of research to expectations and promises of social change; alienation from researcher practices and questions and misgivings about researcher identities and agendas; and the impact of research on social relationships and identities within the Shatila camp itself.

AB  - Tuberculosis control among displaced persons is fraught with difficulties to ensure adherence of patients to treatment for a prolonged period of time. In the Khao-I-Dang camp for Cambodian refugees an approach with daily, directly observed treatment throughout the course of 6 months duration was chosen to address the problem. Of a total 929 patients with sputum smear-positive tuberculosis who were enrolled from 1981 to 1990, 5.0% died, 75.5% completed treatment and were bacteriologically cured with a day-to-day adherence of more than 98%, none failed bacteriologically, 19.2% were transferred to another camp where continuation of treatment was guaranteed, and only 0.4% absconded from treatment. These data suggest that the approach to tuberculosis control in this refugee camp was very effective in cutting the chain of transmission of tuberculosis in a highly mobile population and in reducing substantially unnecessary morbidity and mortality

AB  - I think I have a way of finding out what my father looked like. Yes, finally! Excuse my excitement. My father died when I was very young, and to this day, I have never seen a picture of him. My search for his face goes back to when I lived in a refugee camp in eastern Sudan. It was around 1977 when we arrived at the camp on camel from Eritrea, then under Ethiopian control and fighting for independence. My father had been murdered, but at 2 years old I had no understanding of the circumstances. Sudan promised a new beginning.

AB  - Prevalence of malaria in Afghan refugees in Pakistan is higher than in the local population. Malaria control officials in Pakistan hypothesized that Afghan refugees have brought a heavy load of malaria infections with them from Afghanistan, causing a serious setback to the malaria control programme in Pakistan. The purpose of this study was to test this hypothesis, because it is important regarding the selection of appropriate strategy for malaria control. The proposed hypothesis is rejected because of the following evidence against it: (i) a comparison of age-specific parasite rates of malaria in Afghan refugees and a nearby local population at Karachi indicated that Afghan refugees were susceptible to malaria even in later age-groups, while infections in the local population were limited to younger age-groups; (ii) a comparison of epidemiological trends of malaria in Afghan refugees and the local population in the North-West Frontier Province from 1979 to 1986 demonstrated that the rate of increase in the prevalence of malaria over the years was much higher in Afghan refugees than in the local population, a manifestation of low herd immunity in Afghan refugees. The most plausible alternate hypothesis is that Afghan refugees, being more susceptible, were at high risk of malaria infection in Pakistan rather than that they brought a high infection load with them from Afghanistan. Therefore, malaria control in Afghan refugee camps in Pakistan should be primarily based on preventive, rather than curative, measures

AB  - Over the past few decades, ethnicity, amongst third generation and beyond descendants of European immigrants in America, is thought to have evolved from a group-oriented protectorate to a more individualized form of identity. 'Symbolic ethnicity' is the name given by sociologists, who, working in the 1980s and 1990s within the confines of traditional assimilation theory, thought this to be the final step in that process. More recently, however, research within the social sciences has moved on, not just in how assimilation is considered, but also to newer immigrant and ethnic groups. In this study, I return to the concept of symbolic ethnicity and to those 'older' ethnics who, despite the assimilation process, continue to construct and maintain powerful links to an ethnic ancestry and homeland. From my observations of and interviews with dozens of individuals learning the Irish language throughout North America, I attempt to uncover why this connection persists, beginning with the subjective nature of symbolic ethnicity and ending with concepts of performance and performativity. I argue that these Irish not only knowingly construct their ethnic identities, but also unconsciously conform to a discourse of Irishness based on their perception of authenticity and tradition.

AB  - The percept is the immediate outcome of the organisation of certain portions of our sense-experience. It is, moreover, as we have seen, though taking up into itself a representative element, coloured throughout by its more vivid sensuous ingredient. Hence we mark it off from the higher region of ideation as a presentation or direct sense-presentment. Presentations or percepts, though the foundation of all our thought respecting things, are in themselves fugitive psychical phenomena. A percept, depending as it does (in normal circumstances) on a peripheral stimulus, ceases when that stimulus is withdrawn. In order, then, to that permanent psychical product which we call cognition, something more than perception is necessary. This additional factor is supplied by that consequent or after-effect of the percept which we popularly call an idea, but which is more accurately described as a mental image, or representative image. Topics discussed in this chapter include transition from presentation to representation; the revival of percepts; process of revival; differenti�� of images and percepts; coalescence of image and percept; reaction of image on percept; distinctness of images; general conditions of the retention and reproduction of percepts; reproduction as effect of suggestion; association of ideas by contiguity; conditions of contiguous integration; derivative laws of associational revival; experimental investigations into association; trains of representations; composite trains; verbal integrations; memory and expectations; representations of time; and, various forms of suggestion.

AB  - The process of applying for refugee status in Australia is complex, lengthy and often poorly understood by asylum seekers. The psychological reaction patterns of detainees whose claims for asylum are unsuccessful are characterised by stages of increasing depression, punctuated by periods of protest, as feelings of injustice overwhelm them. These reactions have a marked secondary impact on their children in detention. The prolonged detention of asylum seekers appears to cause serious psychological harm. Even if many of those who spend long periods of time are not deemed to have proven their refugee claims, this administrative decision should not be grounds for inflicting grave ongoing psychological injury on the applicants

AB  - The end of the nineteenth century saw the development of Czestochowa-Sosnowiec industrial region, located at the border of Germany and the Kingdom of Poland, which was then a part of the Russian Empire. The main branches of industry represented in the area were coal mining, metallurgy, textile and machine production. One of its important centers was the town of Zawiercie, situated at the Warsaw-Vienna railway. Like other towns of the Kingdom, it was often chosen to settle in by enterprising immigrants from Bohemia and Germany, seeking career opportunities. The article presents the history of the Lutheran German family of Erbe and their factory. The family's ancestor, Ernst Erbe, came to Zawiercie in 1886. He started with a small smithy, employing 10 people. In 1892, his forge was one of the first in Poland to start producing cast-iron. At the turn of the twentieth century both the output and the employment of the enterprise grew considerably (48 employees in 1898, 270 in 1909) and its products found purchasers in all the European part of the Russian Empire. In 1918 the business came into the ownership of Ernst's son, Alexander. In independent Poland the factory prospered, excluding the 1929-1935 period of depression. It was a major exporter of cast-iron, selling it products to Germany, Britain, Belgium, Peru, India and many other countries, and employing up to 600 people. During the Nazi occupation in the years 1939-1945 the factory was still the possession of Alexander Erbe and it worked for the Wehrmacht. After WW II, in 1946, it was nationalized. The article shows the history of not only the plant, but also the family, which gradually integrated with the Polish environment. Ernst Erbe was mostly concerned with developing his enterprise, accumulating fortune and building a magnificent residence - a palace located next to the factory. He was not engaged in any social organizations, which were quite active in Zawiercie. In the early 1920s he went to Germany, where he died in 1935. His heir, Alexander, who spoke Polish and Russian as well as German, was unlike his father in this respect. He belonged to the town's cultural elite, and was active in the Lutheran Church, the local musical society, political parties and the town council. He was also a generous philanthropist. He was preparing his son Edwin to take over the family enterprise. After Zawiercie was liberated from the German occupation, the Erbe family was arrested. Alexander died in prison in 1945. His wife and son were released and rehabilitated, and later moved to Warsaw, where their descendants have been living until today. Reprinted by permission of Instytut Acheologii i Etnologii PAN

AB  - The Department was heavily involved with the problem of refugees and illegal immigrants. The change in policy for dealing with illegal immigrants resulted in a number of persons being imprisoned prior to their repatriation. Prison officers continued to assist in caring for many of the Vietnamese refugees arriving in Hong Kong. In May 1980, Tai Tam Gap began operation as a correctional institution for females, fulfilling a dual role as a training center and prison; it accommodates 160. On December 31, 1980, the Department controlled 18 penal institutions, a halfway house, and a staff training institute. On that date, 9,170 prisoners were held, compared to 10,395 at the same time in 1979. Legislation was enacted to provide for the supervision of young offenders for up to 12 months following their release from prison. A total of 3,696 young offenders have participated in the detention center program since June 1972. Of these, 94.97 percent have completed the 12 months supervision without reconviction. Drug addiction treatment centers continued to provide an alternative to imprisonment and a treatment program for offenders found to be drug dependent. The treatment period in such centers ranges from 4 to 12 months. A new earnings scheme for inmates was introduced during the year. It provides for payments for work in accordance with the skill, responsibility, and experience required for each job. Extensive tabular data are provided on finances, offenders, and corrections services

AB  - The prevalence of dictatorial governments in Latin America in the 1970s and 1980s has generated a substantial field of texts written from exile or prison. These works present a discourse that attempts to combat governments that would define and control the protagonists as undesirables who must be removed from the country by exile or imprisonment. They also form part of the "Post-Boom" of Latin American literature. Four of the works produced from prison or exile are Plantado, Dreaming in Cuban, La muerte V la doncella and La nave de los locos . These texts are part of a movement of "resistance" literature which attempts to de-center the discourse of the governments in charge of the countries to which each text refers (Cuba, Cuba and the United States, Chile and Uruguay). These works, however, differ from the larger movement of "resistance literature" which has sociopolitical-military backing. These texts are works of individual resistance where the writers are lone voices without a support system behind them. The works resist not only the official discourse of governments, but also the patriarchal discourse that so often accompanies governmental repression and the resistance to it in organized groups. Memory, identity, patriarchal discourse and psychological processes are foregrounded in these works as part of the conflict over who can control both national and individual discourse and what they may say. My conclusion is that the trauma engendered by state-imposed exile, imprisonment and/or terror is so great that those who suffered it often cannot readily articulate what happened to them. The individual writer that brings a protest is calling for change, justice and perhaps even reconciliation. Continuing the violence does not seem to be the answer, but as events in the late 1990s and early 2000s show, neither is the state-mandated amnesia with regard to the violence and injustice already perpetrated. The prosecutions in 2001 of government and military figures who had been involved in state-supported terror in Chile and Argentina, as well as other parts of Latin America and the world, demonstrate that even individual voices are eventually heard and do make a difference

AB  - SWEDEN, ALTHOUGH RULED BY THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS, IS CONSIDERED TO BE A NONSOCIALIST COUNTRY. THE POLICY OF GRANTING ASYLUM TO POLITICAL REFUGEES (I.E., PERSONS IN DANGER OF POLITICAL PERSECUTION) MADE SWEDEN A HAVEN FOR THE POLITICALLY DISLOYAL. COMMUNIST PARTY MEMBERS HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO REGISTER SINCE 1930, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE PERIOD IMMEDIATELY FOLLOING THE SECOND WORLD WAR. HOWEVER, AFTER SEVERAL SECURITY-RELATED SCANDALS, THE POLICE REGISTER ACT WAS PROMULGATED IN 1965 TO PROVIDE GUIDELINES FOR SECURITY. INTERNAL SECURITY WAS ALSO THREATENED BY QUARRELS BETWEEN IMMIGRANT GROUPS, NOTABLY THE CROATS AND THE YUGOSLAVS. THE CULMINATION WAS AN AIRPLANE HIJACKING BY A CROAT GROUP DEMANDING THE RELEASE OF SEVEN POLITICAL PRISONERS, WHICH RESULTED IN THE REVISION OF THE PERSONNEL CONTROL ORDINANCE. THE REPORT OF THE LIDBOM COMMISSION IN 1972 PROPOSED THE ENACTMENT OF COOPERATION BETWEEN NATIONAL POLICE FORCES WITH REGARD TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF ALIENS. THIS WOULD PERMIT THE EXPULSION OF A FOREIGNER ON THE BASIS OF A FOREIGN POLICE TIP. THIS BILL CREATED A GREAT DEAL OF ANGER AMONG LEFTISTS BECAUSE OF THE CREATION OF A LIST OF TERRORISTS. THIS BILL WAS TABLED, BUT LIDBOM POINTED OUT THAT THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE WAS TO DO NOTHING AT ALL. THE BILL FINALLY WAS PASSED. VARIOUS INCIDENTS RELATING TO MEMBERSHIP IN TERRORIST GROUPS ARE CITED. THE EXPULSION OF JAPANESE TERRORISTS IN THE SHIMADA CASE IS DESCRIBED. DISCUSSION OF THE SWEDISH POLICY AGAINST TERRORIST GROUPS SHOWS THAT, DESPITE CRITICISM, IT IS COMPATIBLE WTH THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS. WHEN A FOREIGNER COME TO SWEDEN CLAIMING TO BE A POLITICAL REFUGEE, HE IS NOT TURNED AWAY. IT IS STATED THAT SWEDEN HAS NOT DEALT WITH THE PROBLEM OF FELLOW TRAVELERS. BY THIS POLICY, SWEDEN MAY BE ADMITING POTENTIAL TERRORISTS INTO THE COUNTRY. THE SWEDISH GOVERNMENT NO LONGER SEEMS TO WANT THE COUNTRY TO BE HAVEN FOR REVOLUTIONARIES. (BAC) WANT THE COUNTRY TO BE A HAVEN FOR REVOLUTIONARIES. (BAC)

AB  - "Xenophobic violence has reached alarming proportions in Greece, particularly in the capital city of Athens. Vigilante groups of up to twenty people, often with their faces hidden and sometimes armed with clubs or beer bottles, attack migrants and asylum seekers regularly. These attacks usually take place at night on or near particular town squares. Victims have been dragged off buses, beaten, stabbed, and scarred for life. Hate on the Streets, based on dozens of interviews with victims, government officials, police and others, shows that Greek authorities have been shamefully slow in acknowledging the extent of xenophobic violence and taking concerted steps to arrest this disturbing trend. The police fail to take preventive action or respond adequately to reports of attacks, have discouraged victims from filing official complaints and threatened undocumented migrants with detention if they persist in seeking justice. Perpetrators are rarely arrested or prosecuted; to date no one has been convicted of racially-aggravated assault under a 2008 criminal law provision. The economic crisis and migratory pressure are no excuse for the Greek government's failure to counter xenophobic violence. Human Rights Watch calls on the Greek government to repudiate xenophobic violence, and take immediate steps to ensure vigorous law enforcement action to prevent and punish these hate crimes. Criminal law reform, specialized training, and better recording of hate crimes are urgently needed. The EU should support these efforts."--P. [4] of cover

AB  - In 1923-30 the League of Nations investigated the shipment of migrant labour between Liberia and the Spanish island colony of Fernando Po. Although the League concentrated its attention on Liberia, a closer examination reveals labour abuse as very much the product of conditions on Fernando Po itself. In the last quarter of the nineteenth century, black planters on the island shifted from palm oil trading to cocoa cultivation. Dependence on migrant labour and increasing competition from Europeans resulted in economic crisis in the first years of the twentieth century, with detention of labour and the nonpayment of contracts as the outcome. The eventual investigation of the trade was the product of a desire to conserve Liberian labour for use on the African mainland, rather than an attempt to relieve its abuse.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To document the medical problems of detained Vietnamese boat people admitted to hospital in Hong Kong, and to identify the medical problems or features that may indicate an intention to abscond DESIGN AND SETTING: A retrospective review of the records of all Vietnamese boat people admitted to the Medical Unit of the Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong, between 1 October 1993 and 30 September 1994 RESULTS: 614 Vietnamese boat people were admitted during the 12 months (comprising 3% of total admissions). 92 (15%) of these absconded from hospital after admission (compared with 0.06% for all other admissions). Gastrointestinal bleeding, clinical sepsis, drug overdose and spontaneous pneumothorax were the most common presentations among those who absconded. One-third (33.8%) of the 80 patients whose symptoms indicated gastrointestinal bleeding had insignificant endoscopic findings. Needle puncture marks were found in nine of the 75 patients with unexplained bacteraemia and in five of the 12 patients with spontaneous pneumothorax CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians who provide medical care to Vietnamese boat people should be aware of the high incidence of absconding from hospital and that self-inflicted injuries are not uncommon and may identify intending absconders

AB  - Germans arrived in Tanzania with a vision of scientific forestry derived from European and Asian templates of forest management that was premised on the creation of forest reserves emptied of human settlement. They found a landscape and human environment that was not amenable to established practices of rotational forestry. In particular, a general labour dearth and resistance from Tanzanian peasants and labour migrants forced German foresters to compromise their forestry blueprint. The backdrop of the Maji Maji rebellion of 1905 led colonial authorities to back away from the unbridled use of force to muster labour for forest work, and land abundance in most of the colony stymied the introduction of taungya methods of forest squatting as practised in Asia. Early priority given to managing mangrove forests for revenue generation further undermined established precepts of scientific forestry, seen in the trend toward granting concessions to private entrepreneurs for mangrove bark exploitation rather than for timber. The persistence of an African and Asian consumer demand for mangrove poles and fuel wood subverted a vision of rotational forestry based on timber milling. Problems of labour procurement and retention furthermore undermined efforts to demarcate and conserve inland dry canopy forests, and obviated the expansion of managed forestry into woodland savannahs. By the end of German rule managed state forestry had therefore failed to reshape the landscape according to a Eurocentric and Asian model of development.

AB  - 113 rhesus monkeys, representing 4 age classes, 3 matrilines, and immigrant adult males in a 161-member Cayo Santiago-derived troop living in a 2-acre enclosure, were sampled for levels of plasma ACTH and cortisol during a period of capture and brief cage confinement for routine veterinary examination. ACTH levels showed significant decreases over initially high values following capture in all subjects except infants, whereas cortisol levels remained elevated throughout the sampling period. Members of the lowest-ranking matriline had significantly higher ACTH levels than members of the other matrilines and immigrant males. Infants and juveniles exhibited higher cortisol levels than adolescent and adult monkeys. The overall pattern of results was generally consistent with previous findings from laboratory studies, providing not only evidence of generality across conditions and subject populations but also the basis for more detailed subsequent analyses of the relationship between pituitary-adrenocortical responsiveness, behavioral response to challenge, and age-sex-dominance status in wild-born rhesus monkeys

The �_oMapping Vulnerability, Picturing Place�__ project successfully used this method to explore the experiences of women who migrated to Canada in one of two small Canadian cities. As a part of the project, this article analyses the nuances and differing experiences between international students and immigrant women. The results demonstrate the way in which photovoice enables participants to convey their feelings, interpretations, and experiences in a manner the viewer/observer can understand and to which they can relate. It was also an effective catalyst for change, facilitating women�_Ts empowerment and social transformation

AB  - This case study uses social network theory and the social construction of race as lenses to examine the experiences of Black immigrant men from various countries in the African diaspora during their transfer process from a community college to a four-year institution in an American public university system. The study seeks to understand the concept of self-identification from their points of view and understand the role of institutional agents, social capital, cultural capital, and transfer capital in their academic choices and outcomes. National and educational databases use the terms "Black" and "African American" interchangeably and have reported their statistical findings in education from a monolithic perspective, without regard to national origin, linguistic, religious, or cultural differences. As a result, there is a societal perception that Blacks have similar cultural, social, and economic backgrounds. The distinction is made between these two terms as it pertains to class and educational mobility. The findings of this study reveal that ties within their social networks play a significant role in their academic transition and progress. Weak ties (their connection to networks of individuals with whom they are not closely associated) provided access to advisors, counselors, and other institutional agents in their college community, however, strong ties (their spheres of influence--family, peer, and community relationships) provided the information they needed and supported their retention in the academy. Further, findings also revealed that there was an issue of trust and measure of comfort in how they were treated by the institutional agents who provide information to help them complete their transfer process. As a result, there was an even heavier reliance on strong ties for information. Lastly, these immigrant men stated that they experienced either academic incongruence (a mismatch between students and the institution) or social incongruence (perception from students that their values are not in accordance with those of other students). This feeling of being an outsider within their college community was compared to Patricia Hills Collins' theory of the outsider-within. The findings of this study raise serious concerns about the cultural competency skills of institutional agents as they work with the changing demographic enrolled in America's colleges. Questions also arise regarding institutional and state policies that can be implemented to increase and retain not only students of color, but students who begin their postsecondary education in a community college and transfer to four-year institutions

AB  - During the last decade, the refugee population in less-developed countries has undergone unprecedented growth. High tuberculosis rates have been documented in refugees, particularly among those from Asia and Africa, generating interest in tuberculosis control efforts. To assess the tuberculosis burden among Vietnamese refugees, we screened refugees within 1 or 2 days after arrival in camps in Thailand and in the Philippines. Refugees in camps in Thailand were screened with chest radiographs. Persons with radiographic findings consistent with tuberculosis received microscopic and culture examination of sputum specimens. The prevalence of bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis was 5.8 per 1,000 refugees. Males had a higher risk than females (relative risk RR = 1.7, 95% confidence interval CI = 1.2 to 2.4). Refugees in the Philippines were given a tuberculin skin test. An annual risk of infection of 2.2% was calculated for this group. Males had a higher risk of infection (RR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.5 to 2.4) than females. The age-specific prevalence of tuberculosis and the tuberculous infection increased with age. A high proportion of refugees (85%) with positive tuberculin skin tests were eligible for preventive therapy. Special efforts may be necessary to target Vietnamese refugees, as well as other persons originating from countries of high tuberculosis prevalence, for enhanced diagnostic and preventive intervention against tuberculosis to achieve the national goal of tuberculosis elimination by the year 2010

AB  - It is commonly held that the ANC - after its banning in 1960 and the imprisonment of its leaders - largely disappeared off the face of South Africa until public support for it revived in the wake of the Soweto uprising of 1976. This book takes issue with that view. Drawing on substantial oral testimony, Raymond Suttner develops a convincing case that internally based activist, sometimes working independently of the ANC in exile and sometimes in combination, were able to reconstitute networks within South Africa after the organisation's banning. He discusses the broad features of their secret underground work, the impact it had on their personal lives, and the opportunities that were presented for both bravery and abuse. One of the distinctive features of his approach is its treatment of such illegal activity through a gendered lens. Suttner concludes by exploring the dominant position which the ANC had established by the 1970s (partly through underground activity), enabling it to become the prime political beneficiary of the Soweto uprising and ultimately creating the conditions for a negotiated settlement in South Africa

AB  - This dissertation examines the economic achievement of Japanese immigrants in the continental United States up to the beginning of World War II. Four principal questions are addressed: (1) What was the economic position of Japanese immigrants prior to World War II?; (2) What impact did selective emigration and immigration have on the economic achievement of Japanese immigrants?; (3) What impact did the selective return migration of Japanese immigrants have on their economic position?; and (4) Did competitive markets overcome the effects of the anti-Japanese Alien Land Laws? The study is based on U.S. Census publications, annual reports of the Immigration and Naturalization service, and data from a census of Japanese Americans incarcerated in concentration camps during World War II taken by the War Relocation Authority. The data from these sources are analyzed in the historical context of the political and economic developments of Japan, Hawai'i, and the west coast of the United States that shaped the historical experience of Japanese immigrants. This dissertation finds that claims that Japanese immigrants had achieved a middle class stature prior to World War II are exaggerated, as are claims that competitive markets were able to overcome the discriminatory effects of the anti-Japanese Alien Land Laws (Higgs, 1978). Further, the apparent economic achievement of Japanese immigrants was largely due to the patterns of selective immigration and return migration. The exclusion of Japanese immigrants, the Alien Land Laws, and other anti-Japanese laws restricted the number of Japanese laborers who came to the United States, and discouraged laborers from staying. Rather than a "success story", the economic history of Japanese immigrants before World War II is a story where the more successful immigrants stayed in the United States, while the less successful returned to Japan

AB  - The mental status of 27 children in divorced immigrant families and 17 children in divorced refugee families was examined, and compared to that of 113 children in divorced Swedish families. Differences in divorce-pattern between these families and Swedish divorced families were analysed. Viewed together, the immigrant and refugee children displayed a significantly higher symptom load compared to Swedish children from both divorced and intact homes. When examined separately, the refugee children but not the immigrant children were more troubled than Swedish children from divorced families. The shorter time the children had spent in Sweden, the higher was their symptom load. In comparison to Swedish divorced couples, the immigrant and refugee couples had been married for a shorter time, had been unhappy for a longer time prior to divorce, and joint custody was less common. Most of the marriages had been unhappy before the arrival in Sweden, but a dissolution had not been seen as feasible earlier. As among the Swedish couples, it was the woman who had initiated the divorce in most cases, and it was also the mother who became the residential parent in most cases

AB  - For a good decade, �_~class' was something of a swear word in British politics, almost taboo. The government seldom talked about class, preferring terms such as �_~hardworking families' and �_~social exclusion'. Some commentators argued that this was part of a broader strategy to woo middle-class voters and occupy the political centre, which has come at the cost of alienating core working-class voters.However, class inequality is making its way back onto the political agenda, because there are legitimate issues and grievances to be discussed and debated. Class is still at the centre of how people see their place in Britain today, and socio-economic background is still a strong predictor of life-chances. Returning to the issue of class inequality is therefore long overdue.But there is a danger that a debate on class seen through the lens of race could be counterproductive and harmful. Too often, the interests of the white working class are pitched against those of minority ethnic groups and immigrants. Larger social and economic structures are left out. Instead, the white working class are positioned as the losers in the struggle for scarce resources, while minority ethnic groups are the winners. In these terms, the white working class has been left behind by multiculturalism, or indeed because of it. Anti-racists urgently need to get involved in the current discussion on whiteness. It is important to take the grievances of white members of the working class seriously, but surely this does not mean disregarding the views of ethnic minority members of the working class. The problem is the deeply ingrained hierarchical class structure which remains one of the hallmarks of British social life, not ethnic diversity. This is why Runnymede asked eight prominent thinkers on race, class and inequality to reflect on the state of class in 21st century Britain, and its relationship with race equality

AB  - The nature of multi-ethnic Britain is changing with people coming in great numbers from countries which have little or no previous links with the UK. The incremental growth of the number of different ethnic groups calls for a clearer understanding of their trajectories, experiences and opportunities, as well as how these developments are shaping multi-ethnic Britain. The Runnymede Trust�_Ts programme of Community Studies seeks to shed light on these developments and has produced 11 small-scale studies, collecting in-depth interviews, narratives and accounts from nearly 300 individuals throughout the UK. In this last report of the series, the policy implications of the collected evidence are discussed. In particular, the development of a super-diverse Britain calls into question the relationship between immigration policies and race equalities. The report argues that the separation of immigration from race equality debates has led to a situation where migrants, refugees and asylum seekers are excluded from the equalities agenda. Two major immigration policy developments, the Points Based System and the Borders, Immigration and Citizenship Act 2009, are discussed, and it is argued that the racial bias in government policy is resulting in a situation where migrants from poorer countries are disempowered and thus forced into low skilled and low waged employment. The report argues that migrants wish to integrate with society, and that, rather than policies demanding sameness, this should be done by encouraging potent and healthy ethnic identities which allow new migrants to constructively interact with other groups. The report ends with a number of recommendations for government policy

AB  - Recent studies have focused on reading and writing disabilities among inmates in prisons and at juvenile institutions. Some studies in Sweden have demonstrated that more than half of the delinquents have serious reading difficulties, and for immigrants the situation is even worse. However, these studies have focused on small groups. Furthermore, little attention has been paid to different types of reading and writing difficulties. The main purpose of this investigation was to estimate the prevalence of reading and writing disabilities in juvenile institutions. The study analyses gender differences and differences between immigrants and Swedish pupils. The study included 163 pupils from 22 institutions and used three tests of literacy skills: word identification, spelling and reading comprehension. More than 70% showed some problems in reading and spelling. However, only 11% had serious difficulties. Moreover, the results showed that comprehension ability among immigrant boys was lower than among Swedish boys, despite the same level of word reading skill. The high prevalence of reading and writing disabilities seems primarily to be related to social and cultural factors, home backgrounds, limited school attendance and poor self-esteem rather than to constitutional problems of a dyslexic nature. The implication of this conclusion may be important for the intervention process

In the following we will present two therapies with refugee women describing their post-traumatic reactions and the therapeutic interventions applied in the process. The authors have each worked as therapists with one of the women, and will in the following be referred to in the first person. We will also present an interview made with the two women after the therapy. Both stories have been anonymized. [Adapted from Text, p. 13]

In 2 cases 2 men (husbands and fathers) had been the victims of torture while in prison in their home countries. In 1 of those cases, the man was abusive to his wife and children, while in the 2nd case the man suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In the 3rd case, the wife suffered from periods of severe depression, and the relationship between the husband and the wife was troubled. Treatment in all 3 cases emphasized empowerment of the patients, the establishment of a good dialog, and a positive, goal-oriented intervention.

AB  - Monoclonal antibodies with restricted specificity were used in a modified commercial enzyme immunoassay for detection of HBsAg to subtype HBsAg in sera from 122 Southeast Asian refugees entering the United States, 62 inmates of a correctional facility, and 19 homosexual men. This method was able to classify HBsAg as aywl-2, ayw3, ayw4, ayr, adw2, adw4, or adr. The HBsAg subtype was identified in 183 (90.1%) of the serum samples, but the serum HBsAg concentration was too low to determine the subtype for the 20 (9.9%) remaining samples. Among the Southeast Asian refugees, aywl-2 was demonstrated in 35 (33.0%) of the subtyped serum samples, the adw2 subtype was identified in 33 (31.1%) sera, adr was detected in 37 (34.9%) sera, and the adw 4 subtype as found in 1 (0.9%). The most common subtypes in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia were aywl-2, adw2, and adr, respectively. In prison inmates, the ayw3 subtype accounted for 31 (52.5%) of the subtyped serum samples, an ayw2 variant and the adw2 subtype were each found in 13 (22.0%) sera, and the aywl-2 subtype was detected in 2 (3.4%) sera. Many of these inmates admitted intravenous drug use. Among homosexual men, the adw2 subtype was identified in 16 (88.9%) of the subtyped serum samples and the ayw3 subtype was detected in 2 (11.1%) sera. This subtyping method can distinguish between most of the nine major HBsAg subtypes and can be easily performed with these monoclonal antibodies and commercially available reagents

AB  - CONTEXT: Civilians were often the casualties of fighting during the recent Liberian civil conflict. Liberian health care workers played a crucial role in documenting violence against women by soldiers and fighters during the war OBJECTIVE: To document women's experiences of violence, including rape and sexual coercion, from a soldier or fighter during 5 years of the Liberian civil war from 1989 through 1994 DESIGN: Interview and survey SETTING: High schools, markets, displaced persons camps, and urban communities in Monrovia, Liberia, in 1994 PARTICIPANTS: A random sample of 205 women and girls between the ages of 15 and 70 years (88% participation rate) RESULTS: One hundred (49%) of 205 participants reported experiencing at least 1 act of physical or sexual violence by a soldier or fighter. Survey participants reported being beaten, tied up, or detained in a room under armed guard (17%); strip-searched 1 or more times (32%); and raped, subjected to attempted rape, or sexually coerced (15%). Women who were accused of belonging to a particular ethnic group or fighting faction or who were forced to cook for a soldier or fighter were at increased risk for physical and sexual violence. Of the 106 women and girls accused of belonging to an ethnic group or faction, 65 (61%) reported that they were beaten, locked up, strip-searched, or subjected to attempted rape, compared with 27 (27%) of the 99 women who were not accused (P< or =.02, .07, .001, and .06, respectively). Women and girls who were forced to cook for a soldier or fighter were more likely to report experiencing rape, attempted rape, or sexual coercion than those who were not forced to cook (55% vs 10%; P< or =.001, .06, and .001, respectively). Young women (those younger than 25 years) were more likely than women 25 years or older to report experiencing attempted rape and sexual coercion (18% vs 4%, P=.02 and .04, respectively) CONCLUSIONS: This collaborative research allowed Liberian women to document wartime violence against women in their own communities and to develop a unique program to address violence against women in Liberia

AB  - Rhee, Syngman (s��ng�_�m�Tn r�"), 1875�_"1965, Korean statesman, president of the Republic of Korea (1948�_"60). Early an advocate of Korean independence, he led a demonstration against the Japanese in 1897 and was condemned to life imprisonment but was released (1904) under an amnesty. Rhee went to the United States, where he studied at Harvard and Princeton (Ph.D., 1910), and after returning to Korea went to Hawaii for a time. In 1919 a group of conspirators for Korean independence made him president of a government in exile, and he never ceased working for the cause. After World War II he became a leader in South Korea under the U.S. occupation, and in 1948 he became first president of the Republic of Korea, which claimed the right to rule over all Korea. When, on July 27, 1953, a truce was reached in the Korean War, Rhee maintained that all Korea should be united. Reelected to his fourth term in 1960, Rhee was accused of rigging the election. Student-led demonstrations protesting the election and government corruption soon led to riots and in May, 1960, Rhee was forced out of office and into exile in Hawaii.

AB  - With thousands of Syrians being slaughtered, jailed or forced to flee their country, President Obama and other leaders need to find better ways to punish and isolate President Bashar al-Assad and his cronies. Foreign journalists are barred from Syria, but reports of Mr. Assad's savagery are mounting. In the last two weeks, he has sent tanks and troops into the north and east, forcing about 10,000 Syrians to seek refuge in Turkey. Over three months of protests, more than 1,400 people have been killed and 10,000 detained. Still, thousands of Syrians poured into the streets of Damascus and other cities on Friday in another courageous show of defiance.

AB  - Hide paintings of battle exploits, as an extension of a system of recognizing brave deeds, were an integral part of Plains Indian life. The proud warrior wore his heraldic robe as a public announcement of his accomplishments. By the middle of the nineteenth century, exploits were also recorded on paper. Drawings and paintings on paper, known as ledger art, developed for the same purpose as heraldic robes; pre-reservation ledger artists were warriors recording brave actions. With the defeat of the Southern Plains tribes in mid-1875 and the northern tribes a year and a half later, the traditional life of the warrior ended. Confined to reservations, Plains men no longer lived with well-defined avenues to success. Ledger-style art continued in the early reservation years, but the traditional purpose of the art was gone. The ledger style expanded with artists exploring diverse subjects and compositions. As turbulent reservation years eroded traditional Plains society, representational art was in a state of transition. In 1875, a group of Southern Plains warriors were imprisoned at Fort Marion in Florida for three years. While there, many of the men created ledger-style illustrations, usually for tourists. Although the men came directly from the pre-reservation Plains lifestyle, the art they produced at Fort Marion was vastly different from both traditional exploit painting and reservation art. Only one artist is known to have bridged the three separate phases of ledger-style art. Howling Wolf, a Southern Cheyenne warrior, was among the Florida exiles, and while there, he excelled as an artist. Upon his return to the reservation in 1878, he created exceptional drawings of a very different nature. Newly discovered drawings verify that Howling Wolf was also a skilled and innovative warrior-artist who recorded his exploits in a ledger prior to his Florida imprisonment. Stylistic and iconographic analyses of ledger art from the Plains and from Fort Marion are offered. The work of Howling Wolf from each of the three distinct phases of his career is examined and an assessment made of his place in the history of Plains painting

AB  - According to Giorgio Agamben, a �_ostate of exception�__ is established by the sovereign's decision to suspend the law, and the archetypical state of exception is the Nazi concentration camp. At the same time, Agamben notes that boundaries have become blurred since then, such that even spaces like refugee camps can be thought of as states of exception because they are both inside and outside the law. This article draws on the notion of the state of exception in order to examine the Syrian refugee camp cum shrine town of Sayyida Zaynab as well as to analyze questions of religious authority, ritual practice, and pious devotion to Sayyida Zaynab. Though Sayyida Zaynab and many of her Twelver Shi'i devotees resemble Agamben's figure of homo sacer, who marked the origin of the state of exception, they also defy Agamben's theory that humans necessarily become animal-like, leading nothing more than �_obare lives�__ (or zo�") in states of exception.

AB  - This article aims to give an account of how refugees' family relations are constructed in exile. It is based on fieldwork conducted among Chechen asylum seekers living in a refugee camp in the Czech Republic in April 2004. It argues that although traditional norms defining women's and men's position in Chechen families have often been transgressed in the actual experiences of men and women in situations of emergency such as war, flight and life in the camp, they remain relatively unchanged at the level of refugees' ideal notions of femininity and masculinity. It also shows that the environment of the refugee camp provides, on the one hand, some opportunities for the increase of women's power in the family and men's involvement in childcare and household duties. But on the other hand, the assistance in the camp is based on an undiversified and gender-blind perception and construction of refugees as passive objects of aid, and latently sustains gendered violence.

AB  - Accommodation centres are much more than means of securing asylum seekers' housing needs. They are an embodiment of asylum and immigration policies. To understand these policies and their effects on asylum seekers, we need to ask what interests different institutional actors have in keeping asylum seekers in the centres. Based on the study of accommodation centres in the Czech Republic, in this paper I argue that the centres serve as tools of migration control. The prolonged confinement of a highly diverse group of people produced by the interconnectedness between asylum and immigration policies leads to asylum seekers' disillusionment about the asylum procedure and nourishes various illicit activities. The centres enable state institutions to determine the nature of assistance available to asylum seekers, including legal aid provided by non-governmental organizations. By actively promoting the image of accommodation centres as benign places, the state also controls the dominant representation of refugee reception. In everyday practices in the centres, control and assistance are closely intertwined and produce an oppressive environment that engenders asylum seekers' dependency.

AB  - The International Organization for Migration (IOM) developed and implemented a three-month project entitled Priority Medical Screening of Kosovar Refugees in Macedonia, within the Humanitarian Evacuation Program (HEP) for Kosovar refugees from FR Yugoslavia, which was adopted in May 1999. The project was based on an agreement with the office of United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and comprised the entry of registration data of refugees with medical condition (Priority Medical Database), and classification (Priority Medical Screening) and medical evacuation of refugees (Priority Medical Evacuation) in Macedonia. To realize the Priority Medical Screening project plan, IOM developed and set up a Medical Database linked to IOM/UNHCR HEP database, recruited and trained a four-member data entry team, worked out and set up a referral system for medical cases from the refugee camps, and established and staffed medical contact office for refugees in Skopje and Tetovo. Furthermore, it organized and staffed a mobile medical screening team, developed and implemented the system and criteria for the classification of referred medical cases, continuously registered and classified the incoming medical reports, contacted regularly the national delegates and referred to them the medically prioritized cases asking for acceptance and evacuation, and co-operated and continuously exchanged the information with UNHCR Medical Co-ordination and HEP team. Within the timeframe of the project, 1,032 medical cases were successfully evacuated for medical treatment to 25 host countries throughout the world. IOM found that those refugees suffering from health problems, who at the time of the termination of the program were still in Macedonia and had not been assisted by the project, were not likely to have been priority one cases, whose health problems could be solved only in a third country. The majority of these vulnerable people needed social rather than medical care and assistance a challenge that international aid agencies needed to address in Macedonia and will need to address elsewhere

AB  - This dissertation is an ethnographic account of the making of a contemporary border regime and of its human consequences. In 2004 Poland entered the European Union. It's eastern border was reconstituted into a heavily guarded and technologically sophisticated EU's external boundary. Based on ethnographic field research in Poland and Ukraine in 2005-2006, in border enforcement agencies, civil society organizations and among migrants, I argue that bringing the maintenance of Polish eastern border up to capacity required by the European Union is not merely a technocratic process of upgrading laws and state services. It is rather a complex cultural and technological shift, a discursive adjustment which reinforces the narrative of belonging to Europe through an emphasis on civilizational advancement within a secure, prosperous and bounded space. The creation of such space relies on developing new sites, categories and protocols for an enhanced management of exclusion. Thus I conceptualize the border as a networked and flexible regime which proliferates the categories and regulations for the sorting out of people, things and territory in Europe today. Within this regime, legality and protection become scarce resources beyond the access of most migrants traversing the margins of Europe. At the same time safe space within secure boundaries is promoted as an unquestioned social good thus supporting a new banality of exclusion. Agents of re-bordering continue to grapple with contradictory imperatives when it comes to reconciling the need to protect the human rights of migrants, refugees, asylum seekers, and other persons of ambiguous legal status, with exercising sovereignty over territorial borders. The emphasis on surveillance, detention and removal of persons who do not meet the narrow and shifting criteria for admission into the EU undermines such human rights landmarks as the Geneva Convention on the Status of Refugees. This dissertation is an argument for rethinking the EU project of transcending historical divisions and building a continental democracy through the prism of the quotidian functioning of its border regime

AB  - This essay is an ethnographic account of the use of post-Soviet military ruins in western Ukraine. I describe an encounter with the founder of a commune for persons released from prison, victims of human trafficking, and asylum seekers established in a former nuclear base in Ukraine's western borderland. The commune is an unusual restoration project that is carried out in the interstices of the postsocialist state and of the changing European border regime. As such, it is a compelling site for rethinking dispossession and the possibility of redemption some 15 years after the USSR ceased to exist. The protagonist of this account redeems ruins left behind by the collapse of an empire he was glad to see go, and reproduces precisely that which has been lost in the process of the unmaking of Soviet life, that is the all-embracing domain of collective work and life.

AB  - This article focuses on three children who were known as the Lost Boys of Sudan, and how they have returned to the Kakuma refugee camp in Sudan as grown men in order to prepare others who will travel to the United States like they did. Just a decade ago, Duom Deng, David Ayiik and James Biar were refugees too. Having watched their parents murdered and their villages destroyed in Sudan's civil war, they were forced to join thousands of other orphaned children on a 1,000-mile trek east to Ethiopia--only to spend the next five years wandering among refugee camps before settling in Kakuma in 1992. Aid workers called the thousands of male orphans the Lost Boys. "We made ourselves brothers," says Deng, who is in his mid-20s. "We learned by ourselves to be good to ourselves and to others." That philosophy stuck with Ayiik, Deng and Biar after they were granted visas in early 2000 to settle in the United States along with 3,600 other Kakuma refugees. Now they have returned to Kakuma--thanks to the help of the local Rotary Club--to help the next group of U.S.-bound hopefuls prepare for their new home. Thousands of Kakuma's 86,000 refugees are Lost Boys. Most of them have applied for U.S. visas, which are in various stages of the selection process. These days, Deng, Ayiij and Biar seem neither boyish nor lost. INSET: CATCHING UP

AB  - The article focuses on the placement of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) migrants in immigration detention facilities. It notes that while states resort to the practice of detaining irregular migrants to regulate migration flows and discourage further irregular migration, migrants continue to cross borders. It states that conditions in such facilities have been regarded as a violation of international law, adding that detained sexual minorities tend to be subjected to social isolation, physical and sexual violence due to gender identity and harassment. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has released guidelines on the detention of refugees yet are said to be insufficient to address problems associated with detained sexual minority migrants

AB  - In this paper I examine memories and testimonies in Jenin refugee camp. I explore the local narration of the Israeli invasion of April 2002 and the resistance to the assault on the camp. The literature on nationalism suggests that the nation is an imagined community, yet the narratives within the nation, as well as the counter-political imaginaries of anti-colonial national movements are often under-explored. This paper is concerned with the counter-narratives within the nation and the oppositional agency and identities constituted within situated locations and historical experiences. I use the concept of melancholy to identify and distinguish a counter-sensibility and a form of agency associated with people who have experienced violent histories of loss through colonialism and dispossession. Melancholy, as a type of longing and sadness, indicates the creative and inherently political ways in which loss is conveyed. I examine the performative utterances of memories in Jenin camp and consider the way that the melancholic reiteration of loss and suffering that exceeds mourning, is incorporated into the self and informs counter-definitions of subjectivity, agency and community.

AB  - The article looks at the work of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), focusing on its rebuilding efforts in the refugee camp of Jenin in the West Bank following the Israeli military's 2002 incursion. The author notes that UNRWA has been an important, positive help to Palestinians for several decades and says for that reason the agency has often been undermined and criticized by pro-Israel politicians from other countries. She recounts the agency's 2002 work in Jenin and argues that while that work was important, its success was limited by the liberal humanitarian paradigm followed by the agency, which focuses on individual refugees rather than the community and which fails to recognize their rights and the systematic oppression they face

AB  - Objective To assess the magnitude, direction and underlying dynamics of internal health worker migration between public and faith-based health providers from a hospital perspective. Methods Two complementary tools were implemented in 10 public and six faith-based hospitals in southern Tanzania. A hospital questionnaire assessed magnitude and direction of staff migration between January 2006 and June 2009. Interviews with 42 public and 20 faith-based maternity nurses evaluated differences in staff perspectives and motives for the observed migration patterns. Results The predominant direction of staff movement was from the faith-based to the public sector: 69.1% ( n = 105/152) of hospital staff exits and 60.6% ( n = 60/99) of hospital staff gains. Nurses were the largest group among the migrating health workforce. Faith-based hospitals lost 59.3% ( n = 86/145) of nurses and 90.6% ( n = 77/85) of registered nurses to the public sector, whereby public hospitals reported 13.5% ( n = 59/436) of nurses and 24.4% ( n = 41/168) of registered nurses being former faith-based employees. Interviews revealed significantly inferior staff perspectives among faith-based respondents than their public colleagues. Main differences were identified regarding career development and training, management support, employee engagement and workload. Conclusion This study revealed considerable internal health worker migration from the faith-based to the public sector. Staff retention and motivation within faith-based hospitals are not restricted to financial considerations, and salary gaps can no longer uniquely explain this movement pattern. The consequences for the catchment area of faith-based hospitals are potentially severe and erode cooperation potential between the public and private health sector.

MǸtodos Se implementaron dos herramientas complementarias en 10 hospitales pǧblicos y 6 centros sanitarios religiosos del sur de Tanzania. Un cuestionario hospitalario evalu�� la magnitud y la direcci��n de la migraci��n del personal entre 01/2006 y 06/2009. Las entrevistas con 42 enfermeras de maternidades pǧblicas y 20 de maternidades religiosas evaluaron las diferencias en la perspectiva del personal sanitario y los motivos subyacentes a los patrones migratorios observados. Resultados La direcci��n predominante en el movimiento del personal sanitario era desde los centros religiosos hacia los del sector pǧblico: un 69.1% ( n = 105/152) del personal hospitalario se va y un 60.6% ( n = 60/99) del personal hospitalario entra. El de las enfermeras era, entre el personal sanitario, el grupo con mayor migraci��n. Los hospitales religiosos perdieron un 59.3% ( n = 86/145) de las enfermeras y un 90.6% ( n = 77/85) de las enfermeras registradas al sector pǧblico, mientras que los hospitales pǧblicos reportaron que un 13.5% ( n = 59/436) de sus enfermeras y un 24.4% ( n = 41/168) de sus enfermeras registradas hab��an sido previamente empleadas en centros sanitarios religiosos. Las entrevistas revelaron unas perspectivas significativamente inferiores entre el personal perteneciente a los centros sanitarios religiosos que entre sus colegas de centros pǧblicos. Las principales diferencias identificadas ten��an que ver con el desarrollo profesional, el entrenamiento, el apoyo administrativo, el compromiso de los empleados y la carga de trabajo. Conclusi��n Este estudio revela una importante migraci��n interna de trabajadores sanitarios desde los centros religiosos hacia el sector pǧblico. La retenci��n del personal y la motivaci��n dentro de los hospitales religiosos no estǭ restringida a consideraciones econ��micas y las brechas salariales ya no pueden explicar por s�� solas este patr��n de movimiento. Las consecuencias para el ǭrea de influencia de los centros sanitarios religiosos son potencialmente severas y podr��an erosionar la cooperaci��n entre los sectores sanitarios pǧblico y privado.

According to the authors, differing concepts of mothering as biological reproduction of the nation and as undesired cultural transmission illustrate the social construction of otherness in Argentinian society. Details on incarcerated migrant mothers in Argentina are presented

AB  - The article comments on the issue of health worker migration. According to the authors, the emigration factor is a more specific measure of the impact of emigration on a country than is the number of emigrants. They also support a suggestion that source countries should take greater responsibility for the losses of their health professionals by implementing policies that promote retention. They suggest the need to address the issue using a global justice framework

AB  - Maricopa Community Colleges provide numerous resources and services for a diverse student population. However, educational resources for adult refugees are limited and institutional constraints preclude recognition of adult refugee students' educational needs. Additionally, refugees may not fully understand the resources available to them within the collegiate infrastructure. Refugees struggle against barriers that could be eliminated or minimized with informed advising and sensitivity training for faculty, staff, and administration. This exploratory study defines the criteria characterizing adult refugee students and identifies their educational needs. A statistical analysis determines the potential relationship of refugee student experience and student engagement to student success and retention in Maricopa Community Colleges

AB  - Background: The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) serological markers and the prevalence of VDRL positive subjects in a population of refugees of various nationalities, living in the Asylum Seeker Centre in Bari Palese, Southern Italy. Methods: The study was carried out in the period May-July 2008 and recruited only voluntarily enrolled healthy refugees. HBsAg, anti-HBc, anti-HCV and anti-HIV virus antibodies were detected. VDRL syphilis screening was also carried out on the serum samples. Results: A total of 529 refugees, 442 males and 87 females, aged between 7 and 52 years, were studied. Of these, 510 were from Africa and 19 from Asia. Forty-four individuals (8.3%) were HBsAg positive and 241 (45.6%) were anti-HBc positive. A total of 24 (4.5%) individuals were anti-HCV positive. Eight asylum seekers (1.5%) were HIV positive. VDRL tests were performed on 269 subjects and 4 (1.5%) were positive. 12.3% of the study population had serological markers of chronic and transmissible infections with potential blood-borne or sexual transmission. Conclusions: In Italy, a suitable protocol is necessary for the early diagnosis of infectious diseases on entering Asylum Centres, so allowing the adoption of prevention measures to safeguard the health of the individuals, the residents and workers in the Centres and the general population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) is a social disease that is common in immigrants who are forced to live in difficult circumstances. In Italy, the guidelines for preventing TB include X-ray screening and application of the Mantoux test for migrants from high-TB-endemiccountries as soon as possible after admission to Italy. This article describes a field survey conducted in the reception center for asylum seekers in Bari Palese in southern Italy following the death of a center resident from pulmonary TB METHODS: A Mantoux screening test, followed by chest X-ray, was carried out in March 2009 on 982 immigrants, representing 97.5% of the residents of the center RESULTS: A positive Mantoux test result was seen in 60.7% of the residents screened. The chest X-rays were performed on 92.9% of cuti-positive patients and on cuti-negative patients who were recent contacts of the deceased TB case and/or with symptoms suspicious for TB. Eight residents were diagnosed with active TB (0.8% of residents), and 117 residents (11.9%) had TB sequelae. In our survey, the Mantoux test demonstrated 88% sensitivity, 17% specificity, and a positive predictive value of 1% for active TB CONCLUSION: The survey results suggest that residents in asylum centers are a special type of immigrant. Specific risk factors, such as overcrowding, may expose these residents to a greater risk for infectious diseases.

AB  - Sultan Cem (Djem), who was called 'Zizim' by Europeans in the 15th century, is not only a historical personage but also the hero of a dramatic story which has often inspired Western writers and artists. His struggle for the throne with his elder brother, Bayezid II, his thirteen-year long exile and imprisonment, his colorful personality, and his an original and interesting personality. This topic, which equally draws the attention of both the East and the West, also constitutes the beginning of our relationship with Europe. The topic, therefore, possesses political, diplomatic and historical signifiance. This study aims to evaluate Sultan Cem and his life as exile in Egypt, Rhodes, France and Italy by analyzing three works by three European writers whose perspectives were that of the 'other'. The works in ouestion are 'The Damned Yard' by Ivo Andric, 'Sultan Cem' by Vera Mutafciyeva and 'Djem Sultan: The Prisoner of Bourganeuf' by Eduard Sablier.

AB  - My thesis makes a critical intervention into both scholarship and activism that privileges a heteronormative Filipino/American subject at the center of its political and ethical claims. Using the historical cases of the Iwahig and Bilibid prisons, the Culion Leper Colony, the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair, and the contemporary YouTube videos of Filipino dancing prisoners, I explore the ways that all Filipino subjects have been produced as queer or non-heteronormative through the technique of banal spectacles of performance and display by both the colonial and the contemporary neoliberal regimes. This history, I believe, has been disavowed by leftist Filipino/American scholars and activists, who instead focus their human rights appeals on explicitly heterosexual, feminized 'victims'--the trafficked women, the mail-order bride, and the self-sacrificing overseas migrant worker--to the exclusion of any and all others. I argue that due to their reliance on heteronormative notions of the family and the nation in their political discourse, liberal and radical political activists and scholars are stymied in their ability to imagine a Philippine nation-state that is not economically and politically dependent on the United States and on global institutions such as the World Bank and the IMF. Rather than claim the heteronormative Filipino/American subject as the only one deserving of rights and recognition, how can we as committed scholars and activists develop a radical queered politics of liberation for all?

The decision was made ''in consideration of our national interests,'' said the minister, Chiang Yi-hua. A visit by Ms. Kadeer could harm recently warming relations between Taiwan and China, which split amid civil war in 1949. Ms. Kadeer was exiled to the United States in 2005 after having been imprisoned by China.

First, the defection of Olympic athletes from the Soviet Union and Rumania. Second, the shooting of an Italian driver passing a road from East to West Germany. Third, another shooting by a West German tourist in the Schleswig-Holstein between West and East German territories. While, the first incident magnifies the successful escape of defectors from their own country, the last two incidents glorify the punishment of death to those who attempt to escape or seemingly attempt to do so as in the case of the unknowing tourist

N1  - Date revised - 2013-06-12 SuppNotes - This paper examines how and why an ethnic community perpetuates itself over generations, drawing on ethnographic research conducted among later-generation Japanese-Peruvians in Lima, Peru. After their 100-year-long presence in Peru, Japanese-Peruvians, now mostly in their second and third generations, are highly acculturated. They are also integrated economically, and now politically - as exemplified by the election of Alberto Fujimori as the first President of Japanese descent (1990-2000). Despite increased levels of integration, Japanese-Peruvians have maintained an institutionally well-established ethnic community that has grown, rather than diminished, in each generation. How have they been able to preserve such a community, and why have they done so? I seek answers to these questions in the nature of their community institutions and the role of Japan. A key to their ethnic community maintenance lies not in the preservation of the 'old culture', but rather in recreating 'Japanese culture' anew through community activities with a backing of Japan Last updated - 2013-09-16 SubjectsTermNotLitGenreText - 8040; 4435; 6946 1335 4424; 6230 6232 8037 559 3087 3105 3198; 4413 2603; 6229 539 3105 3198; 539 3105 3198; 9721; 3952; 10053 3143 3192 12867; 191 300 30; 329 386 14

AB  - We consider a model composed of two patches. One patch has three competing species forming a heteroclinic cycle within the path. The other is a refuge for one of the three species, which can diffuse between the two patches. The remaining two competitors are confined to the competitive patch and cannot diffuse. A new heteroclinic cycle can exist in the model, and the underlying cycle in the competitive patch cannot appear with a positive diffusion rate. It is proved that the model can be made persistent under appropriate diffusion conditions even if the underlying heteroclinic cycle is an attractor in the competitive patch and the patch is not persistent without the refuge. Further it is shown that the model with a specific structure is globally stable if the underlying cycle is a repeller

AB  - In November 2001, during the early stages of the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, a three-person medical team crossed from Tajikistan into northern Afghanistan. This was the first team sent by Northwest Medical Teams International Inc., based in Portland, Oregon, to help fill the needs of thousands of refugees who had fled from marauding Taliban forces. The refugee camps had disappeared virtually overnight, however, as the inhabitants returned to their villages as the Taliban retreated south. Erda Fuller, of Fairbanks, Alaska, team leader Mike Pendleton of Hood River, Oregon and Henry Reitzug of Puyallap, Washington, made harrowing journey to the remote mountainous region of Takhar Province in northern Afghanistan

Tempered by the frustration of twenty-six years in exile, prison or the underground, Party leaders are reluctant to boast about their resurgence. They believe it may take another decade or longer to overthrow South Africa's heavily armed white minority government. And they are painfully aware that a protracted war would destroy much of the nation's affluence and productive capacity, which they hope to preserve and extend to South Africa's exploited Black majority

AB  - This is the first comprehensive account of the diversity and complexity of censorship practices in Italy under the Fascist dictatorship. Through archival material it shows how practices of censorship were used to effect regime change, to measure and to shape public opinion, behaviour and attitudes in the twenty years of Mussolini's dictatorship. From its violent beginnings in the spring of 1919, the impulse of Italian Fascism was to silence opposition, through intimidation or coercion. Fascism's first spectacular event was the destruction of a newspaper office: the Socialist newspaper of which Mussolini had been editor until 1915. In power Mussolini inherited established practices of censorship which came to be extended to school reform, media regulation and innovative cultural policy. Mussolini's first press officer, when he fell from grace, spent years in prison and internal exile. Over the twenty years in power the Prime Minister's Press Office developed into an independent industry, first presided over by Mussolini's son-in-law, Galeazzo Ciano, becoming in 1937 the world's first Ministry for Popular Culture. (Ciano was shot as a traitor in 1944). Censorship and Common Sense in Fascist Italy, 1922-43 tells the stories of policy makers and implementers, and of the ordinary people caught up in its machinations, whether as eager supporters or as victims

It analyses the problematic and abundance of various indicators of national identity formation and / or preservation in the context of migration, integration policy. The possible directions of national identity politics significant to the formation and preservation of Lithuanian national identity are explored. The article correlates with the project "Retention of Lithuanian national identity under conditions of Europeization and globalization: patterns of Lithuanian-ness in response to identity policies in England, Ireland, Norway, Spain and the USA" (funded by the Lithuanian State Science and Studies Foundation) which aims at revealing the ways the Lithuanian national identity is changed when exposed to migrant experiences.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of stainless steel (Fe alloy) cooking pots in reducing Fe-deficiency anaemia in food aid-dependent populations DESIGN: Repeated cross-sectional surveys. Between December 2001 and January 2003, three surveys among children aged 6-59 months and their mothers were conducted in 110 households randomly selected from each camp. The primary outcomes were changes in Hb concentration and Fe status SETTING: Two long-term refugee camps in western Tanzania SUBJECTS: Children (6-59 months) and their mothers were surveyed at 0, 6 and 12 months post-intervention. Stainless steel pots were distributed to all households in Nduta camp (intervention); households in Mtendeli camp (control) continued to cook with aluminium or clay pots RESULTS: Among children, there was no change in Hb concentration at 1 year; however, Fe status was lower in the intervention camp than the control camp (serum transferrin receptor (sTfR) concentration: 6.8 v. 5.9 microg/ml; P < 0.001). There was no change in Hb concentration among non-pregnant mothers at 1 year. Subjects in the intervention camp had lower Fe status than those in the control camp (sTfR concentration: 5.8 v. 4.7 microg/ml; P = 0.003) CONCLUSIONS: Distribution of stainless steel pots did not increase Hb concentration or improve Fe status in children or their mothers. The use of stainless steel prevents rusting but may not provide sufficient amounts of Fe and strong educational campaigns may be required to maximize use. The distribution of stainless steel pots in refugee contexts is not recommended as a strategy to control Fe deficiency

AB  - This article describes the political situation facing Iran in 2001 and its implications for U.S.-Iranian ties. On March 4 of this year, Mostafa Tajzadeh--Iran's deputy interior minister and another Khatami confidant--was sentenced to a year in prison by the conservative judiciary. The trumped-up conviction, ostensibly for rigging votes in last year's parliamentary victory by the reformists, was an attempt by hard-liners to prevent Tajzadeh from overseeing the June 8 presidential election. The vehemence of the conservative backlash may stem from the hard-liners' fear that they are soon to be eclipsed. Still, the fate of Iran's democratic movement remains very much uncertain. American policy toward Iran should therefore proceed very carefully. The right American policy--one characterized by subtle but significant shifts--could make an important contribution, encouraging Iran's evolution in a direction that would eventually benefit both countries. Given the legacy of mistrust between Tehran and Washington and the fluid nature of Iranian politics, rebuilding ties will take time. But Washington should start making the investment now, for Iran's strategic value is difficult to overlook. Most important, Iran's potential for democratic development far outstrips that of many of its troubled neighbors. In fact, the Bush administration has a choice of three broad options to follow in its Iran policy. The U.S. could seek cooperation with Iran on one of several limited issues, such as the effort to stop narcotics trafficking. In addition, Washington could support American nongovernmental organizations that could provide humanitarian assistance to the two million Afghan and Iraqi refugees now living in Iran

AB  - Hitler's attempt to murder all of Europe's Jews almost succeeded. One reason it fell short of its nefarious goal was the work of brave non-Jews who sheltered their fellow citizens. In most countries under German control, those who rescued Jews risked imprisonment and death. In Poland, home to more Jews than any other country at the start of World War II and location of six German-built death camps, the punishment was immediate execution. This book tells the stories of Polish Holocaust survivors and their rescuers. The authors traveled extensively in the United States and Poland to interview some of the few remaining participants before their generation is gone. Tammeus and Cukierkorn unfold many stories that have never before been made public: gripping narratives of Jews who survived against all odds and courageous non-Jews who risked their own lives to provide shelter. These are harrowing accounts of survival and bravery. Maria Devinki lived for more than two years under the floors of barns. Felix Zandman sought refuge from Anna Puchalska for a night, but she pledged to hide him for the whole war if necessary - and eventually hid several Jews for seventeen months in a pit dug beneath her house. And when teenage brothers Zygie and Sol Allweiss hid behind hay bales in the Dudzik family's barn one day when the Germans came, they were alarmed to learn the soldiers weren't there searching for Jews, but to seize hay. But Zofia Dudzik successfully distracted them, and she and her husband insisted the boys stay despite the danger to their own family. Through some twenty stories like these, Tammeus and Cukierkorn show that even in an atmosphere of unimaginable malevolence, individuals can decide to act in civilized ways. Some rescuers had antisemitic feelings but acted because they knew and liked individual Jews. In many cases, the rescuers were simply helping friends or business associates. The accounts include the perspectives of men and women, city and rural residents, clergy and laypersons - even children who witnessed their parents' efforts. These stories show that assistance from non-Jews was crucial, but also that Jews needed ingenuity, sometimes money, and most often what some survivors called simple good luck. Sixty years later, they invite each of us to ask what we might do today if we were at risk - or were asked to risk our lives to save others.

AB  - This dissertation inquires into how and why nation-states as interactive collectives attempt to control women's bodies by regulating their fertility. My theoretical framework draws on feminist, critical race, and organismic theories of the state, and on Foucault's concept of biopower. I question the disembodied conception of the nation-state and maintain that nation-states seek to regulate women's bodies and fertility, because states are imagined to have some characteristics of biological organisms and because they have racial and patriarchal interests. In the name of protecting their organismic integrity, patriarchal states sanction gendered and racialized hierarchies of exclusion and privilege, which affect women in fundamental ways. The empirical part of the dissertation employs ethnographic and historical methods in conjunction with discourse analysis. I analyze how the state-mediated fertility discourse of 'increase and multiply' changed throughout the life-course of a group of Estonian women, and how ideas about the racial origin of Estonians contributed to these changes. I also examine how women promoted, negotiated, and resisted the discourse which sought to transform Estonian women's bodies into public territory, charged with the task to 'naturally' reproduce and strengthen the ethnoracial state. The interview participants were born in the 1910's and 1920's and reached young adulthood in interwar Estonian Republic (1918--1940). They fled from the Soviet occupation of Estonia and spent a few years in refugee camps in Germany. Around 1950, they resettled in the United States, spending the rest of their lives in America (1950--2003). The main finding of the empirical section is that the increase and multiply discourse was used in interwar Republic (1918--1940) and after 1991 (the post-Soviet independence period); however, it was not used in the exile/Soviet occupation period (1945--1991). This pattern can best be explained in reference to Foucault's thesis that nation-states have forged a special relationship between the individual's body, reproduction, population size, and biopower. In other words, the nation-state has become one of the few contexts in the West within which the otherwise private issue of family size can be discussed publicly. Because Estonians did not have their own nation-state between 1945--1991, the exiles did not engage in a public discourse about the national and political significance of having more children

AB  - Nisei Soldiers Break Their Silence is a compelling story of courage, community, endurance, and reparation. It shares the experiences of Japanese Americans (Nisei) who served in the U.S. Army during World War II, fighting on the front lines in Italy and France, serving as linguists in the South Pacific, and working as cooks and medics. The soldiers were from Hood River, Oregon, where their families were landowners and fruit growers. Town leaders, including veterans' groups, attempted to prevent their return after the war and stripped their names from the local war memorial. All of the soldiers were American citizens, but their parents were Japanese immigrants and had been imprisoned in camps as a consequence of Executive Order 9066. The racist homecoming reception that the Hood River Japanese American soldiers received was decried across the nation. Linda Tamura, who grew up in Hood River and whose father was a veteran of the war, conducted extensive oral histories with the veterans, their families, and members of the community. She had access to hundreds of recently uncovered letters and documents from private files of a local veterans' group that led the campaign against the Japanese American soldiers. This book also includes the little known story of local Nisei veterans who spent 40 years appealing their convictions for insubordination.

AB  - "Malaya, 1951. Yun Ling Teoh, the scarred lone survivor of a brutal Japanese wartime camp, seeks solace among the jungle-fringed tea plantations of Cameron Highlands. There she discovers Yugiri, the only Japanese garden in Malaya, and its owner and creator, the enigmatic Aritomo, exiled former gardener of the emperor of Japan. Despite her hatred of the Japanese, Yun Ling seeks to engage Aritomo to create a garden in memory of her sister, who died in the camp. Aritomo refuses but agrees to accept Yun Ling as his apprentice "until the monsoon comes." Then she can design a garden for herself. As the months pass, Yun Ling finds herself intimately drawn to the gardener and his art, while all around them a communist guerilla war rages. But the Garden of Evening Mists remains a place of mystery. Who is Aritomo and how did he come to leave Japan? And is the real story of how Yun Ling managed to survive the war perhaps the darkest secret of all?"--P. [4] of cover

AB  - Abstract: Little is known about HIV infection risks and risk behaviours of refugees living in resource-scarce post-emergency phase camps in Africa. Our study at Nyarugusu Camp in Tanzania, covering systematically selected refugees (n=1140) and refugees living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) (n=182), revealed that the level of HIV risk of systematically selected refugees increased after displacement, particularly regarding the number having transactional sex for money or gifts, while radio broadcast messages are perceived to promote a base of risk awareness within the refugee community. While condoms are yet to be widely used in the camp, some refugees having transactional sex tended to undertake their own health initiatives such as using a condom, under the influence of peer refugee health workers, particularly health information team (HIT) members. Nevertheless, PLWHA were less faithful to one partner and had more non-regular sexual partners than the HIV-negative group. Our study revealed that community-based outreach by refugee health workers is conducive to risk behaviour prevention in the post-emergency camp setting. It is recommended to increase the optimal use of �_oradio broadcast messages�__ and �_oHIT,�__ which can act as agents to reach out to wider populations, and to strengthen the focus on safer sex education for PLWHA; the aim being to achieve dual risk reduction for both refugees living with and without HIV/AIDS.

AB  - The Karen, an ethnic minority group in Burma, have experienced a prolonged state of exile in refugee camps in neighboring Thailand because of ethnic conflict in their home country. Nursery schools in the three largest Karen refugee camps aim to promote the psychosocial development of young children by providing a child-centered, creative, learning-friendly environment. Psychosocial development and potentially concerning behaviors of two to five-year-old children in nursery schools were examined by use of a psychosocial checklist. The results showed that psychosocial development of the children increased with age, with most five�year olds being proficient in playing cooperatively with other children. Sadness or emotional outbursts were observed for a third of the children. Difficulty separating from parents was also observed. The results also showed that children who attended the nursery schools for more than a year were better at playing cooperatively with other children and were more aware of their own and others�_T feelings. On the other hand, children who were newer to the nursery schools were more polite and better at following rules and controlling their feelings when frustrated. The results indicate that nursery schools can be a promising practice to promote healthy psychosocial development of children in protracted refugee situations.

AB  - Conducted a preliminary investigation into the experiences and mental health of Senegalese refugees. It is noted that although research has established that refugees are more prone to psychiatric illnesses than the general population, little has been written about West African refugees. 80 adult refugees (18 yrs of age and older) from the Casamance region of Senegal were randomly selected from refugee camps in The Gambia. The Harvard Trauma Questionnaire and the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 were used to assess levels of traumatization and mental health status. Typical of refugees of war, participants reported suffering a large number of various traumas. High prevalence rates of anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder were also found in this group. The authors conclude that a substantial mental health problem exists within the Senegalese refugee population that may signify a potential human crisis.

AB  - The article reports that among three endangered cats that roam the U.S.-Mexico border, only the ocelot still breeds on the northern side. Of the three cats, all federally listed as endangered, only the ocelot is confirmed to live in the United States today. Scientists believe that these sleek, spotted predators once ranged across the southern United States as far north as Arkansas and Arizona. But over the past 60 years, much of the cat's habitat has been destroyed to make way for farms, ranches and, more recently, subdivisions and shopping malls in the rapidly developing border region. Mexican biologist Arturo Caso and other researchers have discovered that ocelots have very specific habitat requirements. One can find them in many ecosystems, from tropical rain forest to dry deciduous forest. Scientists estimate that only between 80 and 100 ocelots remain in the United States today. More alarming, all of the cats are confined to one of two isolated populations, one in Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge and the other on private ranchland some 30 miles away.

AB  - Some categories of human beings are particularly vulnerable vis-a-vis medical research. Vulnerability could be considered as the liability to be harmed, exploited, deceived, cheated, wronged, or otherwise unfairly treated, in roughly that descending order of importance. Vulnerable human beings obviously include the incompetent (minors and mentally handicapped adults), the desperately poor, ill or ignorant, prisoners, refugees, pregnant women, subordinates in highly authoritarian systems, etc. Vulnerability in itself does not imply that no research whatsoever should be carried out with such categories of humans but only that it should be carried out only under very special conditions. In this paper I treat of vulnerability in research of particularly developing world populations; of the types of research which exploit such vulnerability, and of why and how research subjects should be protected. The aim in this paper is to stimulate practical reflection on the possible vulnerabilities of potential research subjects that researchers or investigators need to avoid exploiting rather than on an adequate theoretical treatment of the issue.

AB  - Sexual violence during war and other conflict situations is increasingly recognized as a severely traumatic event with serious consequences for the physical and psychological health of the person affected by it. A growing amount of research has been done on the functions and meanings of sexual violence in war and on how women experience this violence. Most of those studies have been carried out in conflict areas, however, and not among refugee women who fled to Western countries for their safety. This lack of research is understandable because, although many refugee women have experienced sexual violence during the conflict in their country of origin, during their flight, or in an asylum seekers center, only a few will reveal their experiences to others and try to seek specific treatment. It is well known that sexuality and sexual violence are taboo subjects among many people, in some cultures more than others. They are connected with feelings of fear, shame, guilt, and loss of respect. Most women who are traumatized by the experience of sexual violence do not trust other people, and are afraid that their secret will be passed on, resulting in accusation or rejection. Sometimes, while these women are still in a violent and traumatizing situation, such as war, they seem to be more willing to tell people outside their community what happened, presuming that testifying may lead to some help in ending the violence. However, the moment the women arrive in a peaceful environment in which they try to rebuild their life, the expected negative impact on their daily lives and their future of revealing sexual violence becomes an extra reason to keep silent. In other words, from the little we know, the coping strategies women adopt are not only culture-bound but also context-bound. There is a lack of knowledge about the way in which experiences of sexual violence affect the personal lives of refugees, the relations they have with others, and their health and well-being. There is also little known about the kind of health strategies women develop in an attempt to overcome their health problems or live with them. In order to address these gaps in knowledge the first author did medical anthropological research among refugee women in the Netherlands from Afghanistan, Bosnia, and South-Sudan who experienced sexual violence as part of the conflict in their countries of origin or during their flight. This chapter deals with some of the results of this research by focusing on refugee women from South-Sudan. The main question to be addressed is: How do these women cope with their experiences of sexual violence? Sub questions are: Why and to what extent do they hide or disclose their experiences of sexual violence in their contacts with others? How do those others react to the disclosure? What are the effects of their reactions on the women concerned? And how do the latter respond to these effects? On the basis of the life history of one South-Sudanese woman we will discuss these questions. The concepts of cultural master narrative (the story a particular social group has about itself) and silence will guide the analysis. First we will give some historical background of the conflict in South-Sudan. [Text, pp. 191-192]

AB  - Since the 1990s, Ghana has been hosting refugees from neighbouring West African countries and other parts of Africa but not much information is available on their experiences in the country. The main objective of this paper therefore is to examine the experiences of the refugees using the Liberian refugees in the Buduburam Refugee Camp as a case study. Using an in-depth interview guide, 44 refugees of both sexes were interviewed through a convenient sampling procedure based on their consent and willingness to participate in the study. The study employed the structuration theory of migration to examine their experiences and the Kunz's (Int Migr Rev 15:42-51, 1981) typology of refugees to classify the refugees. Through their own capabilities and opportunities offered by both structure and institution, some refugees were able to sustain themselves through petty trading and artisanship while others were unemployed and had to depend occasionally on their social networks for economic support. Cultural shocks, acculturation, tension and occasional quarrels with the indigenes, stigma and discrimination against refugees in schools and at health centres, inaccessibility to formal sector employment, poor security and inadequate infrastructural facilities were some of their experiences in and outside the camp. The need for proper identification of refugees for security reasons, provision of better security and adequate infrastructural facilities and skills training for refugees to engage in livelihood activities were some of the recommendations from the refugees themselves.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Health Information System is a primary source of routine nutrition program data and provides a comprehensive assessment of UNHCR selective feeding programs in more than 90 refugee camps in 18 countries worldwide OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the coverage and effectiveness of UNHCR supplementary and therapeutic feeding programs for malnourished children under 5 years of age in Kenya and Tanzania refugee camps METHODS: Analysis of Kenya and Tanzania refugee camp population, growth monitoring and nutrition program data from the UNHCR Health Information System RESULTS: UNHCR-supported implementing partners in Kenya and Tanzania admitted nearly 45,000 malnourished refugee children in selective feeding programs between January 2006 and May 2009. Average recovery rates of 77.1% and 84.6% in the therapeutic and supplementary programs, respectively, mortality rates of less than 1%, and average readmission below 5% suggest that feeding programs had a beneficial effect on enrolled children CONCLUSIONS: Increasing admission and enrollment in supplementary feeding programs was successful in preventing cases of severe malnutrition in some camps. Further attention to these camps would be likely to yield sizeable benefits in terms of absolute reductions in malnutrition prevalence and mortality rates

AB  - AbstractPollen and plant macrofossil data from northern Eurasia were used to reconstruct the vegetation of the last glacial maximum (LGM: 18,000 �� 2000 14C yr bp) using an objective quantitative method for interpreting pollen data in terms of the biomes they represent (Prentice et al., 1996). The results confirm previous qualitative vegetation reconstructions at the LGM but provide a more comprehensive analysis of the data. Tundra dominated a large area of northern Eurasia (north of 57��N) to the west, south and east of the Scandinavian ice sheet at the LGM. Steppe-like vegetation was reconstructed in the latitudinal band from western Ukraine, where temperate deciduous forests grow today, to western Siberia, where taiga and cold deciduous forests grow today. The reconstruction shows that steppe graded into tundra in Siberia, which is not the case today. Taiga grew on the northern coast of the Sea of Azov, about 1500 km south of its present limit in European Russia. In contrast, taiga was reconstructed only slightly south of its southern limit today in south-western Siberia. Broadleaved trees were confined to small refuges, e.g. on the eastern coast of the Black Sea, where cool mixed forest was reconstructed from the LGM data. Cool conifer forests in western Georgia were reconstructed as growing more than 1000 m lower than they grow today. The few scattered sites with LGM data from the Tien-Shan Mountains and from northern Mongolia yielded biome reconstructions of steppe and taiga, which are the biomes growing there today.

AB  - From various perspectives and for numerous purposes the issues of transition and immigration had been researched independently. Although the two vary in content, they find themselves entwined in the hearts and lives of many immigrants, often as a single entity. The present study examines transition and immigration from the perspective of new immigrants to Canada. The research questions are discussed within the scope of a phenomenological paradigm. The interviewees represent various walks of life and different cultures. The common element of the interviewees is that they are newcomers to Canada who have been here not longer than two years. Each person was interviewed separately and the direction of the conversation was modified by using supportive guiding questions. The major themes were as follows: major markers of successful and unsuccessful transition toward full enculturation, language acquisition, self-actualization 'now' and 'before,' and ethnic-cultural-identity retention. The proposed recommendations are based on the interviewees' perceptions of what worked and what did not, with respect to their enculturation. The suggestions for psychological assistance are derived from the analysis of the interview material. Specific areas of counselling interventions are related to cultural sensitivity especially in the area of understanding the immigrant's cultural background, the client's life history, and altered self-image. Emphasis is on understanding the immigrant's social and psychological spheres of entity in relation to new situations, within the context of transitional processes which are also considered

This study was confined to cities in...the United States and certain Asian and African countries with relevant published data.... This paper has shown that some lifetime population movements were exceptionally high. Two-thirds of the residents of the major U.S. cities in 1970 were born elsewhere. The major cities in sub-Saharan Africa were second highest with 60 percent. Asian cities followed with 48 percent of their residents being lifetime migrants and the cities of North Africa were lowest with less than a third. Finally, the native population born and reared in most urban agglomerations will probably comprise a larger percentage of the total population in those areas in the future."

AB  - In 1927 the playwright, storyteller and essayist Rudolf Leonhard (1889-1953), one of the first German radio-play authors as well as a film writer, expressionist and pacifist, settled in Paris. After 1933 he became an increasingly ardent critic of National Socialism. He was the co-founder and organizer of the "League for the Protection of German Writers in Exile" and helped many emigrant friends. He was interned, an experience that resulted in over 600 poems, the tragedy Hostages and the Dream-Book in Exile. The period from May 1941 to July 1944 is captured in dreams - the time of Rudolf Leonhard's internment in the Le Vernet camp on the edge of the Pyrenees and Les Milles near Aix-en-Provence, as well as his imprisonment in Castres, near Toulouse. This essay shows that the reality of Rudolf Leonhard's many journeys, part of his political and propagandist mission in his country of exile, France, surfaces in countless dream journeys. Exile and travel in spirit, journeys into the unknown, escapes, continuous traveling: descriptions of movement. Hotel lobbies, stations, and trains are the locations for many episodes. Secret arrivals are just as frightening as journeys to the underworld.

AB  - On the surface, Southern Rhodesia was a melting pot into which people of European origin were absorbed, mixed with one another and forged new identities. In reality, Rhodesia failed to permit non-British Europeans such as Poles, their fair share of the Rhodesian dream. Behind this lay not only British Rhodesians' self-perception of their superiority to other Europeans but also the fear that other European immigrants might have communist connections. The British placed different white ethnic groups on a scale based on their perceived distance from white British cultural and political values. Polish people found themselves near the bottom of the scale because British whites suspected them of being communists or Jews and of holding different cultural values, such as greater liberality about race relations. British Rhodesian discrimination against the Poles was revealed especially in the reception Polish refugees received upon arriving in Rhodesia during the Second World War, evidenced in the placement of refugee settlements and the provision of social services, as well as discrimination in the employment sector. Although ethnic prejudice lay at the centre of Rhodesian discrimination, the immigration policy and treatment of the Poles also reflected conflicting concerns. On the one hand the Rhodesian government had an obligation to accommodate war refugees on behalf of the Imperial government, while, on the other hand, they did not want a deluge of non-British whites which might dilute British ethnic purity and spread communist ideas. We examine the nature, application and impact of this discriminatory policy on Polish refugees during and immediately after the Second World War, arguing that ambivalence towards Polish refugees constituted a larger feature of Rhodesian society.

AB  - Supplementary feeding programmes (SFP) that were functioning in Somali refugee camps were evaluated in March 1981 in order to describe their process of operation and to measure their effect on the refugees' nutritional status. While those children enrolled in SFPs gained weight, many malnourished children in camp had not been identified so that the programme's overall effectiveness was reduced. Even among children who attended SFPs regularly, the rate of weight gain diminished rapidly each succeeding month of attendance. This underlines that supplementary feeding is a short-term, remedial measure in disaster relief and should be quickly incorporated into a broader plan for relief assistance so that resources can be used most efficiently

AB  - The epidemiology and etiology of acute diarrheal disease were determined in a Hmong refugee camp on the Thai-Laotian border from April 11 to May 14, 1985. DNA hybridization techniques were used to detect Shigella species, enteroinvasive Escherichia coli, and enterotoxigenic E. coli. A monoclonal enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect rotavirus, and standard microbiology was used to detect other enteropathogens. The age-specific diarrheal disease rates were 47 episodes per month per 1,000 children less than five years old and 113 episodes per month per 1,000 children less than one year old. Rotavirus, enterotoxigenic E. coli, Campylobacter, and Cryptosporidium were the predominant pathogens in children less than two years old. The DNA probe hybridized with 94% of 31 specimens identified as enterotoxigenic E. coli by the standard assays and with none of the specimens in which the standard assays were negative. The probe for Shigella and enteroinvasive E. coli hybridized in eight of 10 stools that contained Shigella and four of 314 stools from which Shigella and enteroinvasive E. coli were not isolated. The use of DNA probes allows specimens to be collected in remote areas with a minimum amount of equipment and technical expertise so that they can be easily transported to a central laboratory for further processing.

AB  - The administrative and instructional practices in a rapidly changing multicultural school were analyzed to identify those practices which could be transmitted to other schools experiencing similar change. Effective schools research correlates provided a reference for analysis. Oral history techniques were employed in a qualitative design. Through extensive interviews with administrators, teachers, parents, and students, the administrative and instructional practices that guided the school successfully through initial racial desegregation and later through the integration of Asian-Pacific non-English speaking refugee students were revealed. Within the parameters of effective schools research correlates, the years of greatest and least effectiveness were also identified. Practices identified that other school systems should consider for implementation included a pervasive and genuine caring for students; local school autonomy in decision making affecting concerns unique to the local school; innovative and flexible approaches to traditional practices such as scheduling, awarding of Carnegie units, promotion and retention, and assessment of student achievement

AB  - From September 1991-January 1992, there was a measles epidemic in an established refugee camp for 7000 Vietnamese 'Boat People' living in Hong Kong. This 16 week outbreak occurred against a backdrop of poor uptake of measles vaccination and overcrowded living conditions. Two hundred and sixty-two children were affected (155 boys, 107 girls); 235 children (89.7 %) were < 2 years old, age range 5-39 months. Children age 6-11 months had the highest crude attack rate (AR) of 54.3%. The highest age specific crude AR was 83.8% in children aged 14 months. Measles complications affected 234 (89.3%) children. Sixty-six children (25.2%) were admitted to hospital. There were two deaths from pneumonia, giving a case fatality rate of 0.76%. Measles control in refugee camps continues to be a public health challenge

AB  - SETTING: Two closed camps in Hong Kong for Vietnamese refugees OBJECTIVE: To determine the referral times by clinicians (doctor's delay) of cases of tuberculosis (TB) from refugee camp clinics to the hospital/chest clinic DESIGN: Retrospective case-note study of 97 Vietnamese patients receiving treatment for tuberculosis RESULTS: The sites of TB were pulmonary (n = 61), glandular (n = 15), pleural effusion (n = 15), and other (n = 6). The median referral time was 18 days (range 0-417). Median consultations numbered three (range 1-16). Fifty-three (54.6%) patients were prescribed antibiotics. Thirty-nine (40%) patients were referred within 10 days; of these, 18 were referred the same day. These 39 patients were less likely to have received antibiotics (9/39 [23.1%] vs 44/58 [75.9%], relative risk [RR] 0.3 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.17-0.55), but were equally likely to have been physically examined (RR 0.66, 95%CI 0.39-1.1). Sixteen (16.5%) patients were referred after 90 days. They attended the clinic more often (median attendances 6.5 vs 3, P = 0.0002), and were prescribed more antibiotic courses (mean antibiotic prescriptions 1.6 vs 0.7, P = 0.03) CONCLUSION: Referral times by these clinicians varied widely, with long delays for approximately 60% of patients. Guidelines pertinent to primary care clinicians are needed to heighten their awareness of tuberculosis to prevent referral delays and subsequent TB treatment

AB  - "I thought upon coming to a free State like Ohio, that I would find every door thrown open to receive me, but from the treatment I received by the people generally, I found it little better than in Virginia...Thus I found every door closed against the colored man in a free State, excepting jails and penitentiaries, the doors of which were thrown wide open to receive him." 1 These are the words of John Malvin, a freed slave who migrated from Virginia to Cincinnati in 1827. He settled in the city at the height of the population swell in the city, undoubtedly drawn by the promise of social and economic freedom. Cincinnati was a town with competing identities: geographically northern, economically and culturally southern, with economic aspirations in the expanding American West. These identities shaped a unique urban condition for blacks that was marked by mob violence, proscription, and legislative assaults. '"Frontiers of Freedom:' The Black Experience in Cincinnati, 1802-62," examines the emergence of this free black community within this context. The study is framed between the Ohio Constitution's denial of citizenship rights for African Americans and the impressment of African American men into the Union Army during the Civil War. These events illustrate how black citizenship was contested throughout the era. More important than simply revisiting how unfree African Americans were in antebellum Cincinnati, this study examines this community's journey to self-determination. African Americans employed numerous strategies to expand the frontiers of freedom, including institution-building, mutuality, spiritual and intellectual enhancement, and agitation for the repeal of repressive laws. When that was not enough, the community built coalitions with other black communities, sought alliances with local abolitionists, assisted fugitive slaves to freedom, or emigrated to cooperative settlements. Of the myriad of strategies, education was, by far, the most important. Cincinnati's black community sustained a battle for public education for two decades. Thus, in Cincinnati the school was the predominant black institution, unlike other black communities in the north where the black church was the most important institution. Cincinnati's black community moved from alienation and vulnerability in the 1820's toward political self-respect by the 1840's. Each battle the community waged and won encouraged its maturation by 1841. In 1841, black Cincinnati united in defense of their homes and property against mob violence. At that moment, African Americans demonstrated that they believed they had a right to be in Cincinnati. No longer willing to allow conditions or violence to force them from the city, African Americans stood their ground. In the ensuing years this community moved toward self-actualization by successfully lobbying to dismantle disabling laws and building stable institutions. 1 John Malvin, Autobiography of John Malvin, A Narrative (Cleveland: Leader Printing Company, 1879), 39-40

AB  - We use unique information on migration behaviour and reasons for migration to study the impact of tied migration on labour market outcomes among husbands and wives. Fewer than 2% of couples migrate for job-related reasons and the majority of these move for reasons associated with the husband's job. Estimates from dynamic random-effects models indicate that husbands and wives in couples that migrated for job-related reasons suffer lower job retention rates than non-migrants. Tied migration reduces the probability of subsequent employment for both husbands and wives and in particular has a large negative impact on job retention rates among wives.

AB  - The UK government has recently consulted on proposals to exclude some �_ooverseas visitors�__, including asylum seekers, from NHS care. This discussion paper examines the wider ethical, moral, and political issues that may arise from this policy. In particular, it explores the relationship between immigration and health and examines the impact of forced migration on health inequalities. Studies suggest that on almost all indices of physical, mental and social wellbeing, asylum seekers and refugees suffer a disproportionate burden of morbidity. This population is already disempowered and restricted access to services may therefore be unjust and exacerbate inequalities. The authors argue that it is both unethical and iniquitous to use health policy as a means of enforcing immigration policy. They suggest that the founding principle of the NHS of equal access on the basis of need should be borne in mind when considering how to meet the needs of this population

AB  - The movement of humans across borders is increasing exponentially - some for benign reasons, others nefarious, including terrorism, human trafficking, and people smuggling. Consequently, the policing of human movement within and across borders has been and remains a significant concern to nations. Policing Global Movement: Tourism, Migration, Human Trafficking, and Terrorism explores the nature of these challenges for police, governments, and citizens at large. Drawn from keynote and paper presentations at a recent International Police Executive Symposium meeting in Malta, the book presents the work of scholars and practitioners who analyze a variety of topics on the cutting edge of global policing, including: Western attempts to reform the policing of sex tourists in the Philippines and Gambia Policing the flow of people and goods in the port of Rotterdam Policing protestors and what happened at the 2010 G20 Summit in Toronto Mexico's use of the military in its war against drug trafficking Public-private cooperation in the fight against organized crime and terrorism in Australia Recommendations for police reform in Afghanistan Sweden's national counterterrorism unit Treatment of asylum seekers in a privately run detention center in South Africa The policing of human trafficking for the sex trade in sub-Saharan Africa, Vietnam, Australia, and Andhra Pradesh, India. Examining areas of increasing concern to governments and citizens around the world, this timely volume presents critical international perspectives on these ongoing global challenges that threaten the safety of humans worldwide.

AB  - In the past decade Australian immigration policy has emphasised settlement of refugees/humanitarian entrants in rural and regional locations, in preference to metropolitan areas. The settlement outcomes of a case study of African humanitarian entrants of South Sudanese background in Murray Bridge, a regional centre in South Australia, are examined. These participants were self-settled secondary movers from metropolitan Adelaide. The factors which attracted them were centred on employment. Settlement outcomes for Murray Bridge respondents were better than their urban counterparts, in terms of both housing and employment outcomes. However, some later left Murray Bridge because of a lack of opportunities for tertiary education. The results highlight issues of sustainability of settlement and retention, in regional centres in Australia, and of the fluidity of attraction and retention factors and therefore settlement in regional centres.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To counter pervasive disparities in healthcare and guide public health prevention programs, culturally sensitive recruitment and retention strategies for Chinese immigrants participating in health-related research studies are needed OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to develop and implement recruitment and retention strategies with Chinese immigrants in a Tai Chi exercise study METHODS: After substantial project planning and incorporating community-based research principles, a multidimensional approach was used to ensure minimal loss to follow-up. Recruitment strategies included partnering with a community-based agency, distributing study information using a multimedia approach, communicating in the native language, and demonstrating cultural sensitivity. Retention strategies included establishing a tracking method during recruitment, providing personalized feedback, maintaining the same location for all aspects of the study, eliminating potential linguistic barriers, providing personal attention and encouragement, monitoring attendance, utilizing a charismatic Tai Chi instructor, respecting Chinese culture, providing appropriate incentives, and maintaining good communication RESULTS: Sixty persons showed interest in the study, 52 persons were screened, and 39 persons were enrolled. Recruitment was completed within 3 weeks. An advertisement in the Chinese newspaper was the most fruitful recruitment source, yielding approximately 60% of the study participants. Retention in the study was also very high (97%, n = 38) DISCUSSION: The successful recruitment and retention of Chinese immigrants in this Tai Chi exercise study are due to a variety of factors on many levels, including the participants, study investigator, and community-based agency

AB  - This paper explores the emergence of social movement action on the rights of asylum seekers in the Australian case. It focuses on new and growing collective action in the context of the neoliberal and neoconservative government of John Howard (1996-2007) and situates this rise within a generalizable and universal human rights movement. The detention and deportation of asylum seekers, which resulted in revitalized collective action, is detailed as the trigger for collective action. The paper argues that a combination of neoliberal values and new nationalism created a hostile environment for newcomers and proved a difficult environment for the solidarity evident in this new social movement.

AB  - This article deals with the British policy towards Baltic displaced persons in post-war Germany. After World War II millions of refugees were spread over Europe. Over five millions of them were stranded in the Western occupation zones of Germany. About a million decided to stay there. The others were repatriated by the allies to their home in Eastern Europe. Among those who stayed, the Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians formed a special group. On the one hand they were a small group about 120 000 people, while on the other hand their political position was high-explosive. Different from other peoples like the Poles their home was incorporated in the Soviet Union and didn't exist anymore. So they couldn't be treated like UN nationals, whose treatment was fixed in international agreements. One problem was, that in camps of the UNRRA (United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) there existed no liaison officers to articulate the will of Baltic DPs towards the occupation authorities. Another difficulty were the permanent attempts of the Soviets to get `their' citizens home into the Soviet Union. While the UNRRA ran the camps with regard to social affairs, the British occupation administration formed a division to do so politically. In the beginning the PW & DP Division (Prisoners of War/Displaced Persons Division) was busy to ban Baltic organisations, because their existence provoked diplomatic complications. As a representative of British democracy the PW & DP Division established the Baltic Welfare, Education and Employment Organisation to support self-government of the Balts, while in fact the British authorities controlled this organisation. It was also the PW & DP Division that organised the first resettlement of Baltic DPs. After the war capable manpower was needed on the labour market in Great Britain. So in 1946 a programme called Balt-Cygnet was started: about 1000 Baltic women were brought to Britain to work in hospital as nurses. One year later the more extensive programme Westward-Ho marked the beginning of the total resettlement of the Balts. Although overseas, especially in Canada, Australia and South America, workers from Europe were highly welcomed. So the IRO (International Refugee Organization), which succeeded the UNRRA, organised the resettlement of the majority of the DPs. Only about two per cent of the Baltic displaced persons, the so-called hard core, stayed in Germany. They became homeless foreigners (heimatlose Ausl+�nder) in the Federal Republic of Germany. The resettlement meant the final act of this aspect of Baltic history in Germany, whose most successful chapter was the scientific work. In Munich, but still more in Hamburg, where the so-called Baltic university lasted for three years, academic life could be established. This can be seen as the basic condition for a restart overseas for thousands of Baltic DPs. Abstract printed by permission of Franz Steiner Verlag, Stuttgart, Germany

AB  - <p>Human security is becoming increasingly pronounced in recent years due to changes in the security landscape of world politics. Yet, inter-state relations have continued to dominate security concerns in East Asia. This has, unfortunately, eluded the broader understanding of issues and challenges facing the peoples of East Asia.</p><p>-�</p><p>Home to nations with rapid economic growth and development, East Asia is at the core of what some individuals have termed as the coming Asian Century. Years of economic liberalization and exposure to globalization have permitted the region to achieve high levels of interconnectedness from within and without in unprecedented ways. This has certainly reduced state control and opened up spaces for cross-border human activities. While economic wealth have increased substantially over the years, it has also brought about bigger income disparities, unsustainable safety nets and a surge in social problems from health issues to migratory concerns that threaten the safety and well-being of individuals.</p><p>-�</p><p><i>Human Security: Securing East Asia�_Ts Future</i> timely examines the fundamental issues causing human insecurities and evaluates the extent of which human security plays a role at the state and regional levels. Covering the different areas of threats to humans and applying case study materials, this volume provides an intellectual mix of perspectives that captures the relationship between people, state and region. This book will be of interest to those studying traditional and non-traditional security/threats, Asian human development and critical policy analysis.</p>

AB  - The article focuses on immigration multiplier. Many analyses of the effects of immigration policy alternatives implicitly portray them as regulatory and selection mechanisms operating upon exogenously-determined demand for immigrant slots. Applicants are seeking immigrant visas because of economic, political and other forces that are external to the immigration policy. The bracero program was adopted in 1942 to provide needed labor during the World War II emergency. Yet when the war ended three years later, employers who had become dependent upon bracero labor lobbied for its retention, while Texas agricultural interests sought to legalize their long term practice of employing so-called wet labor from Mexico, an effort that culminated in the adoption of the Texas Proviso in 1952. The asylum provisions of the 1980 Refugee Act were inserted as an afterthought and the bill's sponsors never expected this to become a large category of demand. The governments of France, Belgium and other West European countries did not intend to stimulate a powerful right-wing political movement when they adopted their immigration and refugee policies

One of them (0.22%) was infected with Schistosoma mekongi. Since there are freshwater hydrobiid snails, Lithoglyphopsis aperta, the intermediate host of S. mekongi in that area, it is probable that the disease may become established in Northeastern Thailand in the future, which will eventually lead to health and economic problems in Thailand

AB  - Postcolonial migrants appear in European space as the figure of a paradox, continuously re-insinuating the problem of cultural multiplicity and of political borders between citizens and others. This work is an attempt to reformulate the terms of this encounter as played out in the Algerian-French case, by focusing on two parallel manifestations: the political and the literary. The long-standing state discourse on, and policies for, the "integration" of migrants function by creating anew, rather than eliminating, discrepancies between those it grants a legal status and those it casts as clandestines. However, the logic of representation and recognition that are the main tenets of this discourse and its multiculturalist varieties still prevail in cultural, and more particularly, literary criticism. Turning to the contemporary migrant movements that since the latter half of the 1990s have broken from a multiculturalist politics of recognition, I ask: what may be the possible openings of this shift for the way we think about postcolonial literature? These transnational movements take shape not on the basis of particular identities but rather through collective statements that delineate a community. I discuss this specific articulation of political community through literary performances of "collective assemblages," a term I borrow from Gilles Deleuze and F+�lix Guattari, and elaborate through the works of Jacques Ranci+�re and Mikhail Bakhtin. I find the literary expressions of a synthesis of multiplicity in the works of Algerian author Assia Djebar. In the texts written during the escalation of civil war in Algeria, Djebar frames the struggle against official Islamic-Arab culture in the form of a collective assemblage. Particularly in response to the Berber question, Djebar resists the confinement of the Berber movement to the identitarian closure dictated by the confrontation with the state. The genealogies of Berber culture offered in these texts move beyond the assertions of cultural unity to follow the lines of dispersal and bifurcations into other lineages. An originary bilingualism becomes a tool for the genealogy to displace the notion of culture as embodied in a distinct people, and thereby redefine the direction of minority politics both in the postcolonial state and the diaspora

AB  - Variation in limb proportions between prehistoric Jomon and Yayoi people of Japan are explored by this study. Jomon people were the descendents of Pleistocene nomads who migrated to the Japanese Islands around 30,000 yBP. Phenotypic arid genotypic evidence indicates that Yayoi people were recent migrants to Japan from continental Northeast Asia who likely interbred with Jomon foragers. Limb proportions of Jomon and Yayoi people were compared using RMA regression and "Quick-Test" calculations to investigate relative variability between these two groups. Cluster and principal components analyses were performed on size-standardized limb lengths and used to compare Jomon and Yayoi people with other groups from various climatic zones. Elongated distal relative to proximal limb lengths were observed among Jomon compared to Yayoi people. Jomon limb proportions were similar to human groups from temperate/tropical climates at lower latitudes, while Yayoi limb proportions more closely resemble groups from colder climates at higher latitudes. Limb proportional similarities with groups from warmer environments among Jomon foragers likely reflect morphological changes following Pleistocene colonization of the Japanese Islands. Cold-derived limb proportions among the Yayoi people likely indicate retention of these traits following comparatively recent migrations to the Japanese Islands. Changes in limb proportions experienced by Jomon foragers and retention of cold-derived limb proportions among Yayoi people conform to previous findings that report changes in these proportions following long-standing evolution in a specific environment.

AB  - Pregnant inmates at Nashville's jail will no longer be restrained, according to a policy change after an illegal immigrant said she was shackled during labor. Sheriff Daron Hall of Davidson County announced the changes this week, but he said pregnant inmates would still be restrained during trips to the hospital or to court if they presented a danger. Last month, a Mexican immigrant, Juana Villegas, was arrested on charges of careless driving and was held at the jail. Ms. Villegas said she went into labor July 5 and was taken to the hospital, where she was handcuffed to the bed by her right wrist and left ankle until shortly before the birth. The sheriff said her treatment followed the jail's old policies, but he also said that in his opinion the old policy was ''a little more than may have been necessary in every case.''

AB  - This study seeks to reground concepts of 'diaspora' and 'transnationalism' in the realities of everyday life through examining the lived experiences of immigrants. Based on in-depth household interviews and focus groups, it examines the newest Chinese diaspora in Vancouver-skilled immigrants from the People's Republic of China. It explores the challenges that they face in an unfamiliar city, including employment and language barriers as well as domestic anxieties surrounding childcare, education and marital difficulties. The strategies that they adopt to counter these problems are at times transnational-in the form of astronaut families or transnational childcare-but almost always familial. Ultimately, the settlement challenges that they face, coupled with the available transnational possibilities, raise the question of whether they are settlers or 'immigrant prisoners', temporarily serving their time in Vancouver before a further relocation.

AB  - This report is concerned with the dynamics of bee communities and their floral resources on two shortgrass prairie sites in southeastern Wyoming, a region of rigorous, unpredictable climate. Phenology and abundance of floral resources were recorded weekly from permanent quadrats for two years. Each site was composed of three distinct plant communities. Results suggest considerable spatiotemporal variability in floral resources. Specifically, most species at both sites showed the following temporal variation: (1) bloom times were between one and two weeks earlier in the second year; (2) differences of approximately 1-2 weeks in bloom span between years; and (3) substantial differences in abundance of flowers between years. Species blooming during the last half of the census period were significantly more variable in flower abundance between years than those blooming earlier. Spatial variation was shown both by differences between sites and between plant communities within sites in the direction and magnitude of between year changes in floral abundance. For example, floral production at the Boulder Ridge site in 1976 was much lower than in 1975 but at The Dirt Farm site between-year differences were less pronounced and depended upon season. Evidence from other studies supports the hypothesis of spatiotemporal unpredictability of floral resources. Composition of the bee fauna was also quite dynamic. Of the more than 140 bee species recorded at each site only about 25% could be considered permanent residents. A variable portion of the community (7.0-40.0%) was composed of fugitive individuals whose presence was unpredictable from site-to-site and year-to-year. Qualitative changes in the bee fauna were particularly evident at the Boulder Ridge site, where bumblebees declined from 65.0% of all individuals recorded in one year, to 9.0% in the next year when resource supply was much reduced. The virtual disappearance of high-energy requiring bumblebees was compensated for by the increase of lower-energy requiring solitary species, particularly of the families Andrenidae and Halictidae, and the fauna changed from one dominated by long-tongued individuals in one year to domination by short-tongued individuals in the next. Although species-abundance distributions of both bees and flowers fit a lognormal curve for most site-years; there was no straightforward relationship between resource and consumer diversity. Bee abundance, species density and diversity were not consistently related to flower abundance, species density or diversity. Nor did the number of flowers produced by each plant species determine the number of bee visitors. Under reduced resources floral niche breadth of resident bee species increased, especially for more specialized species, supporting the hypothesis of an increase in the kinds of resource items utilized in times of scarcity. Niche breadths of fugitive species were consistently lower than those of residents and most fugitives confined their foraging activities to plants which were also attractive to residents. In general, niche overlap was positively related to niche breadth. When resources were reduced, resident species significantly increased the number of competitive interactions in which they engaged and diffuse competition also increased. However, mean overlap, calculated with non-zero entries excluded, actually declined, i.e., the average intensity of competitive interactions was inversely related to the number of competitive interactions, thereby supporting the concept of diffuse competition. Guild structure was extremely loose: a moderate percentage of resident species remained linked in guilds through both years and only one guild of two species at one site remained completely unaltered. For many species there were substantial changes between-years in their closest competitors. The community is likely to be organized by non-equilibrium dynamics in a spatiotemporally unpredictable environment. Competition is diffuse, intermittent and relatively unimportant

Amsterdam was declared an anti-apartheid city in 1986 - the first city of this nature in the Netherlands. Large anti-apartheid demonstrations were held over the years in Amsterdam. In 1988, for example, there was a mass demonstration of 50 000 people of Amsterdam. Reverend C.F. Beyers Naud+� and Govan Mbeki received honorary doctorates from Amsterdam universities as a gesture of solidarity. Important conferences for South African artists in exile were held in Amsterdam, for example `The cultural voice of the struggle' (1982) and `Culture in Another South Africa' (1987). These conferences were organised in solidarity with the ANC. The ANC also opened an office in Amsterdam in 1989.

It explored the applicability of western conceptualizations of reactions to traumatic events among this cultural group. A randomly selected sample of refugee camp students was assessed on measures of psychological and physical complaints, and on impact as well as severity of traumatic experiences. Respondents had experienced multiple traumatic events. The majority reported ongoing health problems. More than half demonstrated symptoms of intrusion�_"avoidance. Those with more traumatic experiences reported more symptoms of anxiety and depression (psychologically and, particularly, somatically manifested). Cultural differences in types of experienced traumatic events and manifestations of distress are discussed, as are implications for cross-cultural trauma research using western conceptualizations and instruments.

AB  - Eugenio Montale's affinity for British and American culture is well represented in his short stories, critical essays and translations. Despite the use of different perspectives, his portrait of the Anglo-American world always results from a process of identification and detachment. His judgments, often to be inferred by the reader, are not based on cultural stereotypes, but rather on contradictions inherent in the characters and their environment. Emigres and exiles, among Montale's favorite types, elicit pity contained by an irony rooted in his vision of them as geographically and existentially maladjusted, and often betrayed by their linguistic idiosyncrasies. Only at a high personal cost can these characters mediate between two or more cultures. By mediation, which indeed contributes to the accuracy of an ideal interpretation, Montale examines both English writers and their social context always bearing in mind a comparison with his own national culture. Unconditional enthusiasm or bitter sarcasm are unknown to his criticism and he forms his points of view through contrast and exclusions. Because of the intellectual and concrete features of his verse Montale includes himself in the tradition of metaphysical poetry that from John Donne continues up to the present. Accordingly, he shows his preference for the authors of this tradition, many of whom he studies and translates. Nevertheless, the Quaderno di traduzioni does not always include their most representative poems, nor is it confined strictly to metaphysical verse. Montale gives proof of his versatility by approaching texts of different periods, themes and languages (besides the majority of versions from English, some are from Spanish, French, and Catalan). The manifold solutions introduced in this selection testify to Montale's concept of poetry and often reflect, as in the case of his translations from Shakespeare, a specific phase of his development. His versions are affected by his multiple cultural approaches to the Anglo-American world and exemplify a mutual learning exchange between the translator and the poet

AB  - ABSTRACT IN ENGLISH: This paper examines the displacement and vulnerability associated with the migration of unaccompanied illegal Romanian minors who came as economic migrants to Western Europe, found no legal opportunities for work or education, and were forced into criminal activity on the streets of French cities such as Paris, Lyon, and Nice. Beginning in 1997 growing numbers of unaccompanied Romanians, mostly boys, some as young as age ten, many younger than age 15, were subject to systematic prosecution rather than protection in Paris, the site of the largest and most influential juvenile court in the nation. They were arrested, detained, indicted, released pending trial, judged, and sentenced in absentia, multiple times with different identities. The Romanian minors were caught without legal papers or visas, claimed to be squatters living in abandoned buildings, trailers, or camps outside Paris, and gave little reliable information about their families or lives. Initially arrested for the destruction of city property and the theft of the proceeds from city parking meters, they gradually turned to begging, shoplifting, and prostitution when the city switched from coin to card payment. Deeply concerned by the penalization of a vulnerable population, the president of the Paris juvenile court created a special court to deal more humanely with unaccompanied minors in general, and Romanian children in particular, by establishing their identities and reconnecting them with their families. This article explores the contradictions that emerged between the representation of Romanian children in the media, the legal establishment, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and the Government, on the one hand, and their treatment in the juvenile justice system, on the other. It examines the discourse and the context of judging as well as the interactions between court personnel and Romanian minors from in-take interviews in jail and indictment hearings in chambers to judgment in absentia in the formal court. It compares and contrasts cases heard before and after the creation of the special court and centres on the gaps between official rhetoric, legal norms, and judicial practice. It concludes that the creation of the special court may be having the unintended effect of reinforcing and institutionalizing the very judicial practice it was designed to prevent, namely the penalization of marginality. // ABSTRACT IN FRENCH: Cet article examine le d+�placement et la vuln+�rabilit+� associ+�s +� la migration de mineurs roumains non accompagn+�s, en situation ill+�gale, qui sont venus en Europe occidentale comme migrants +�conomiques, n'ont eu aucune possibilit+� l+�gale de travailler ou de s'instruire, et ont +�t+� contraints d'exercer des activit+�s criminelles dans les rues des villes fran+�aises comme Paris, Lyon et Nice. +_ partir de 1997, de plus en plus de Roumains non accompagn+�s, des gar+�ons pour la plupart dont certains n'avaient que dix ans, et beaucoup moins de quinze ans, ont +�t+� syst+�matiquement poursuivis plut+�t que prot+�g+�s +� Paris o+� se trouve le plus grand et le plus influent tribunal pour mineurs de tout le pays. Ces mineurs +�taient arr+�t+�s, incarc+�r+�s, inculp+�s, remis en libert+� dans l'attente de leur proc+�s, jug+�s et condamn+�s par d+�faut +� de multiples reprises sous diff+�rentes identit+�s. Les mineurs roumains, arr+�t+�s sans papiers ni visas, affirmaient squatter des immeubles abandonn+�s, des caravanes ou des camps en dehors de Paris, et ne donnaient gu+�re de renseignements fiables sur leur famille ou sur leur vie. Interpell+�s au d+�but pour destruction de biens de la ville ou pillage des horodateurs, ils se sont graduellement tourn+�s vers la mendicit+�, le vol +� l'+�talage et la prostitution quand la ville est pass+�e du paiement par pi+�ces au paiement par carte. Tr+�s pr+�occup+� par la p+�nalisation d'une population vuln+�rable, le pr+�sident du tribunal des mineurs de Paris a cr+�+� un tribunal sp+�cial pour enfants dans le but de traiter avec plus d'humanit+� les mineurs non accompagn+�s en g+�n+�ral, et les enfants roumains en particulier, en +�tablissant leur identit+� et en les remettant en rapport avec leur famille. Cet article examine les contradictions entre, d'une part, la repr+�sentation des enfants roumains dans les m+�dias, le milieu juridique, les organisations non gouvernementales et le gouvernement, et d'autre part, le traitement que leur r+�serve la justice des mineurs. Il +�tudie le discours et le contexte des jugements ainsi que les interactions entre le personnel des tribunaux et les mineurs roumains pendant des entretiens en prison, des audiences de mise en accusation dans le cabinet des juges ou des jugements par d+�faut prononc+�s par le tribunal. Il compare les affaires jug+�es avant et apr+�s la cr+�ation du tribunal sp+�cial pour enfants et montre le foss+� qui s+�pare le discours officiel, les normes juridiques et la pratique judiciaire. D'apr+�s la conclusion de cet article, il se pourrait que la cr+�ation du tribunal pour enfants ait un effet inattendu, celui de renforcer et d'institutionnaliser la pratique judiciaire m+�me, qu'il +�tait cens+� pr+�venir, +� savoir la p+�nalisation de la marginalit+�. // ABSTRACT IN SPANISH: ? documento examina el desplazamiento y la vulnerabilidad asociada con la ?graci+�n de menores rumanos ilegales no acompa+�ados que ingresaron como ?antes econ+�micos en Europa occidental, y al no encontrar oportunidades ?gales de trabajo o estudio se vieron forzados a realizar actividades delictivas ? las calles de las ciudades francesas de Par+�s, Ly+�n y Niza. A principios de 1997, crecientes n+�meros de menores no acompa+�ados rumanos, principalmente ?rones, de edad entre 10 y 15 a+�os, se vieron sujetos a un enjuiciamiento ? condena sistem+�ticos en lugar de la protecci+�n en Par+�s, sede del Tribunal ?venil m+�s grande e influyente de la naci+�n. Fueron arrestados, detenidos, acusados, liberados en espera de juicio, juzgados y sentenciados in absentia, en multiples oportunidades y con distintas identidades. Los menores rumanos atrapados sin papeles o visados legales, dijeron ser ocupas que viv+�an en edificios abandonados, caravanas o campamentos fuera de Par+�s y dieron poca informaci+�n fidedigna sobre sus familias o vidas. Inicialmente arrestados por la destrucci+�n de los bienes de la ciudad y por delitos de robo de los parqu+�metros de la ciudad, gradualmente pasaron a mendigar, robar en las tiendas y prostituirse cuando la ciudad transform+� los sistemas de pago y reemplaz+� las monedas por tarjetas. Sumamente preocupado por la penalizaci+�n de la poblaci+�n vulnerable, el Presidente del Tribunal Juvenil de Par+�s cre+� un tribunal especial para encarar de manera m+�s humana la situaci+�n de los menores no acompa+�ados en general, y la de los ni+�os rumanos en particular, estableciendo sus identidades y retomando contacto con sus familias. Este art+�culo examina la representaci+�n contradictoria de los ni+�os rumanos en los medios de comunicaci+�n, las instancias jur+�dicas, las organizaciones no gubernamentales (ONG) y el gobierno, por un lado, y su trato por el sistema jur+�dico juvenil por otro. Asimismo, examina el discurso y el contexto del juicio as+� como las interacciones entre el personal de los tribunales y los menores rumanos desde sus entrevistas en la c+�rcel, las audiencias de acusaci+�n y el juicio in absentia en el tribunal oficial. En este art+�culo se comparan y contrastan los casos audicionados antes y despu+�s de la creaci+�n del tribunal especial y en los centros comparando las brechas en la ret+�rica oficial, en las normas jur+�dicas y en las pr+�cticas judiciales. Se llega a la conclusi+�n de que la creaci+�n de un tribunal especial podr+�a tener el efecto adverso de reforzar e institucionalizar la pr+�ctica judicial propiamente dicha que supuestamente deb+�a prevenir, es decir, la penalizaci+�n de la marginaci+�n.

KW  - eppi-reviewer
AB  - This volume brings together an interdisciplinary group of scholars around an important question: how has migration changed in Europe as the European Union has enlarged, and what are the consequences for countries (and for migrants themselves) inside and outside of these redrawn jurisdictional and territorial borders? By addressing this question the book contributes to three current debates with respect to EU migration management: 1) that recent developments in EU migration management represent a profound spatial and organizational reconfiguration of the regional governance of migration, 2) the trend towards the externalization or subcontracting of migration control and, 3) how the implications of Europe�_Ts changing immigration policy are increasingly felt across the European neighborhood and beyond.-� Based on new empirical research, the authors in this collection explore these three processes and their consequences for both member and non-member EU states, for migrants themselves, and for migration systems in the region. The collection indicates that despite the rhetoric of social and spatial integration across the EU region, as one wall has come down, new walls have gone up as novel migration and security policy frameworks have been erected �_" making European immigration more complex, and potentially more influential beyond the EU zone, than ever

AB  - I examine the return preparations of Sri Lankan Tamil refugees in India from the perspective of the Organization for Eelam Refugees Rehabilitation---a Sri Lankan Tamil refugee organization that works with Sri Lankan Tamil refugees in India and, returned refugees and internally displaced populations in Sri Lanka. I explore how OfERR conceptualizes and practices preparations for the return of Sri Lankan Tamil refugees. This thesis on the preparation for return as conceptualized and implemented by OfERR adds to the literature on the return process by: (i) applying a critical refugee lens on return issues; (ii) looking at return from the perspectives of an organized refugee group that has its own NGO and runs various relief and development programs among Sri Lankan Tamil refugees in the refugee camps in India and among returnees and internally displaced in Sri Lanka. The thesis examines whether the concept of voluntary repatriation as articulated by UNHCR adequately covers the realities of Sri Lankan Tamil refugees in India. It explores some of the similarities and differences between the return experiences of Guatemalan and Eritrean refugees and the preparation for return of Sri Lankan refugees. It examines mobility issues and how these impact on the spaces refugees have or do not have in discussions, preparation and decision-making processes concerning return. Return is examined in the context of understanding power relations, where despite obstacles, marginalized populations create space for themselves to take control of their destiny. Preparation for return begins from the time of arrival at the first country of asylum

AB  - Former political prisoners in Chile gave testimony of their traumatic experiences, which resulted in diminishing their posttraumatic symptoms. Based on this experience, testimony therapy has been developed and used in treatment of traumatized victims of war or other organized violence. This short-term therapy, as it applied in the treatment of traumatized asylum seekers and refugees in Centrum '45/De Vonk in the Netherlands, is described in this article. The therapy consists of 12 sessions in which patients tell their life stories, including the traumatic experiences. The narrative is reflected in a written document that, for example, can be read to family and friends, or be sent to a historical archive. This article discusses the preliminary research data on the effects of testimony therapy. Finally, hypotheses on the working mechanisms of testimony therapy are offered

The agent, who was not identified, chased the man into a Kwik Pantry convenience store in Kingsville after he and other people ran from a vehicle the Border Patrol was pursuing around 8 a.m., said an agency spokesman, John Lopez. Inside the store, the man fought the agent's efforts to detain him and wrested away the agent's collapsible baton. At that point, the agent, ''fearing for his life,'' shot the man, Mr. Lopez said. The man, who was shot in the abdomen, Mr. Lopez said, was flown to a hospital in Corpus Christi. The man was out of surgery and recovering in the intensive care unit, Mr. Lopez said.

Federal officials announced last month that the Hutto facility would no longer hold the families of illegal immigrants. Instead, they will be detained at the much-smaller Berks Family Residential Center in Leesport, Pa. Hutto opened as a family detention center in 2006.

AB  - The last of 14 people indicted in the nation's deadliest human smuggling attempt pleaded guilty, federal prosecutors in Houston said. The defendant, Octavio Torres-Ortega, 42, was accused of leading one of the subordinate rings involved in the smuggling attempt that led to the deaths of 19 illegal immigrants packed in a sweltering tractor-trailer five years ago. He pleaded guilty to conspiring to harbor and transport immigrants illegally in the United States resulting in death and serious bodily injury, the United States attorney's office said. More than 70 immigrants were being transported to Houston from Harlingen in South Texas when the truck driver abandoned the trailer at a truck stop near Victoria, about 100 miles southwest of Houston, in 2003. The victims died of dehydration, overheating and suffocation. Mr. Torres-Ortega faces a term of life in prison.

AB  - A federal grand jury indicted a soldier on Tuesday on three charges in a plot to bomb Fort Hood soldiers. Pfc. Naser Jason Abdo, 21, was indicted in Waco on charges of possession of an unregistered destructive device, possession of a firearm and possession of ammunition by a fugitive from justice. He faces up to 10 years in prison on each charge. He was arrested two weeks ago at a Killeen motel near Fort Hood after going AWOL from Fort Campbell, Ky. Investigators say they found a handgun, an article titled ''Make a bomb in the kitchen of your Mom'' and the ingredients for an explosive device, including gunpowder, shrapnel and pressure cookers. An article with that title appears in an Al Qaeda magazine.

AB  - We examined the prevalence and nature of comorbid post-traumatic stress reactions and depressive symptoms, and the impact of exposure to traumatic events on both types of psychopathology, among Palestinian children during war conflict in the region. The 403 children aged 9-15 years, who lived in four refugee camps, were assessed by completing the Gaza Traumatic Events Checklist, the Child Post Traumatic Stress Reaction Index (CPTSD-RI), and the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ). Children reported experiencing a wide range of traumatic events, both direct experience of violence and through the media. CPTSD-RI and MFQ scores were significantly correlated. Exposure to traumatic events strongly predicted MFQ scores while controlling for CPTSD-RI scores. The CPTSD-RI items whose frequency was significantly associated with total MFQ scores were: sleep disturbance, somatic complaints, constricted affect, impulse control, and difficulties in concentration. Children living in war zones are at high risk of suffering from PTSD and depressive disorders. Exposure to trauma was not found to have a unique association with PTSD. The relationship between PTSD and depressive symptomatology requires further investigation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)

CPTSD-RI and MFQ scores were significantly correlated. Both CPTSD-RI and MFQ scores were independently predicted by the number of experienced traumatic events, and this association remained after adjusting for socioeconomic variables. Exposure to traumatic events strongly predicted MFQ scores while controlling for CPTSD-RI scores. In contrast, the association between traumatic events and CPTSD-RI scores, while controlling for MFQ scores, was weak. The CPTSD-RI items whose frequency was significantly associated with total MFQ scores were: sleep disturbance, somatic complaints, constricted affect, impulse control, and difficulties in concentration. However, not all remaining CPTSD-RI items were significantly associated with exposure to traumatic events, thus raising the possibility that the association between depression and PTSD was due in part to symptom overlap CONCLUSIONS: Children living in war zones are at high risk of suffering from PTSD and depressive disorders. Exposure to trauma was not found to have a unique association with PTSD. The relationship between PTSD and depressive symptomatology requires further investigation

AB  - Refugee children suffer from extreme atrocities and are often neglected or go unheard in refugee situations. Sport is a valuable cost effective tool that when used exclusively or in combination with existing recovery and development programs can aid and address child refugee health development issues. This 6-month internship with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) examined the benefits of sport for refugee children, sport in the United Nations and Sport in the UNHCR. Specifically addressing psychosocial issues associated with war, psychosocial issues associated with being a refugee, environment and health issues from everyday refugee camp life, being a refugee ex-child soldiers, unaccompanied or separated refugee child, a refugee child living with a disability, issues due to a lack of basic education, being a victim of sexual violence, affected by Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS) or other sexually transmitted infections (STI's), and issues of gender inequality

AB  - The United Nations refugee agency requested access on Tuesday to 126 refugees from Myanmar being held in southern Thailand, amid allegations that mistreatment by Thai security forces had led to the deaths of other refugees. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said that 80 ethnic Rohingya boat people were being held on Koh Sai Daeng island in the Andaman Sea and that the whereabouts of 46 others, intercepted Friday on a boat and turned over to the Thai military, were unknown. Rights groups say that hundreds of Rohingya, a Muslim minority fleeing oppression in Myanmar, were detained by the Thai military last month and forced back to sea with little food or water in boats without engines. Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva of Thailand denied the claims. ''Let's be clear that Thailand has not violated the human rights of the refugees,'' he said Tuesday.

AB  - This study examines the educational implications of the Mong resettlement in the Chicago area during 1978-1987. The Mong, an ethnic tribe, migrated from China in the eighteenth century to settle in Laos. They assisted the French during their colonial rule and the United States in its Secret War against the Communists during the Vietnam Conflict. After the United States withdrew its troops from Southeast Asia, the Mong were persecuted for political reasons. In 1976, Congress recognized them as former CIA (Central Intelligence Agency) employees and authorized the Department of State to admit some refugees to the United States. This study seeks an answer to the following question: What were the major trends that shaped the Mong society? What were their problems of cultural and educational adjustment during their resettlement in the Chicago area? The Mong experienced a series of formative episodes: with the Chinese, with French colonialism, with the Vietnam Conflict, with the refugee camps during their transition to resettlement in the United States. Through use of historical and qualitative methods, the study examined four categories of persons: officials of VOLAGs, Mong parents and community members, Mong students, and school officials using ethnographic interviews along the framework of Neuenschwander's Oral History. The investigation examined two principal areas: resettlement and education. Since the Mong's culture is diametrically different from American's, they experienced tremenduous frustration during their initial resettlement in the Chicago area. Their illiteracy and lack of formal education and marketable skills make it difficult for them to live in a high technologically-developed city such as Chicago. Educationally, language problems continued to impact their developing of their full potential as contributing members in the society. Their difficult adjustment problems consequently contributed to their massive secondary migration from Chicago to California, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. Despite the difficulties described, the Mong adjusted amazingly well. As a unique cultural pattern, the Mong clustered as a community influenced by the clan system. The future of the Mong depends on education. The Mong will continue to successfully acculturate into the American society and grow as a community in the future. The younger Mong are expected to advance to their full potential and to contribute to the advancement of life in the United States

AB  - Despite the rapid growth of the Nepalese population, presently very little is known about the Nepalese in the United States. This dissertation examines the adaptation of the Nepalese in the United States. It focuses on the following three research questions: 1. How do the Nepalese in the United States adapt culturally, structurally, maritally, identificationally, and receptionally to American life? 2. What factors influence the cultural, structural, marital, identificational, and receptional adaptation of the Nepalese in the United States? 3. Which factors play a more important role in the adaptation of the Nepalese in the United States? The theoretical framework for guiding this study is built upon the synthesis of the following theories: classical assimilation, melting pot, cultural pluralism, selective assimilation, revisionist assimilation, and transnationalism. I proposed a series of hypotheses related to Nepalese's cultural, structural, identificational, marital, and receptional adaptation for testing. The data were collected through an online survey using the online survey software tool, PsychData. The sample (N=768) was collected from the Nepalese who were 18 years old or older and currently living in the United States. I tested the hypotheses using ordinary least squares regression, logistic regression, multinomial logistic regression, and ordinal regression depending on the measurements of the dependent variables. The results show that the majority of the Nepalese celebrated both Hindu and American holidays/festivals. Nepali was the dominant language spoken at home and with children. Most of them had friendship with Nepalese and socialized with Nepalese. The majority of the Nepalese interacted with whites in the workplace and lived in white neighborhoods. The majority of the respondents had a Nepalese spouse and consistently preferred to marry Nepali, if given a choice. More than half of the respondents would allow their children to marry non-Nepalese. The Nepalese not only identified themselves as Nepalese, but also felt closeness to their own ethnic group. The majority of the Nepalese had been mistaken as "Hispanics." Half of the respondents had been treated well in the host country but discriminated sometimes, and had never had unwelcomed feelings. The results also reveal that age of entry is a significant predictor of celebrating Hindu festivals, attending Hindu religious services, attending Nepali functions, having a Nepalese spouse, disallowing children to marry non-Nepalese, and identifying self as Nepalese. Legal status significantly contributes to celebrating American holidays, identifying self as Nepalese American or Asian American, and facing less discrimination and prejudice. Length of stay increases proficiency in English language: it facilitates living in white neighborhoods, having friendship and socialization with whites, obtaining membership in Nepalese organizations, marrying a non-Nepalese, and self-identifying as Nepalese American or American/other. Education in the United States facilitates working mostly with whites and obtaining membership in American organizations. Travel to homeland increases attending Hindu religious services, being close to Nepalese, working mostly with whites, and living in white neighborhoods. Sending remittance is associated with closeness to one's own ethnic group. Similarly, reading Nepali newspapers contributes to attendance of Hindu religious services, attendance of Nepali functions, cooking of Nepali food, retention of ethnic language, self-identification as Nepalese, and closeness to one's own ethnic group. It is found that the relative importance of the predictors in predicting Nepalese adaptation varies depending on the dependent variables. Age of entry has the strongest effect on celebrating Hindu festivals, attending Hindu religious services, attending Nepali functions, and disallowing children to many non-Nepalese. Gender has the strongest effect on attending religious services, cooking Nepali food, and obtaining membership in Nepalese organizations. Legal status not only has the strongest effect on celebrating American holidays and attending Nepali functions, but it also has an effect on a lack of racial/ethnic discrimination experience. Length of stay has the strongest effect on speaking English at home and with children, having friendships and socialization with whites, living in white neighborhoods, and marrying a non-Nepalese, if given a choice. The highest level of education has the strongest effect on socializing and working with whites, and allowing children to marry a non-Nepalese. Interestingly, education in the United States has the strongest effect on working with whites and obtaining membership in an American organization. Travel to homeland has the strongest positive effect on living in white neighborhoods and experiencing less racial/ethnic discrimination. Reading Nepali newspapers has the strongest positive effect on cooking Nepali food, having a Nepalese spouse, speaking Nepali language at home and with children, hindering English speaking ability, and socializing with Nepalese. This dissertation is the first large-scale survey study of Nepalese in the United States. It offers wealth of information on the adaptation of Nepalese unavailable elsewhere. In particular, it systematically analyzes the status and determinants of Nepalese's cultural, structural, marital, identificational, and receptional adaptation. In addition, this dissertation proposes a multidimensional theoretical framework to depict the adaptation experiences of the Nepalese in the United States. It tests this theoretical framework and its derived hypotheses using data from Nepalese, a brand new group of immigrants in America. The results provide support for cultural pluralism theory and challenge classical assimilation theory. It also analyzes the role of transnational activities in adaptation. The results may help the understanding of the adaptation experiences of other new immigrant groups. In addition, it may help to reduce prejudice and discrimination against the Nepalese in America

AB  - This thesis investigates the effects of immigration status, country of origin, and duration in Canada on three main health outcomes, namely health care utilization, occurrences of hypertension and heart disease, and body mass index. The first two chapters are cross-sectional studies that utilize data derived from linked national health survey and Ontario databases, whereas the third chapter is a longitudinal study which draws data from the longitudinal National Population Health Survey (NPHS). The first chapter examines the role of immigration status and country of origin in explaining the use of three types of health services: primary care physicians, specialists, and hospitals. The findings suggest that immigrants, especially those who are male and have low educational attainment, use more primary care physicians than comparable non-immigrants. However, immigrants are found to use fewer expensive health services, i.e. specialist and hospital care, compared to Canadian-born residents. Likewise, immigrants from non-traditional source countries make even fewer visits to specialists than do those who came from traditional source countries. The second chapter investigates the associations of immigration status, occurrence of hypertension, and occurrence of heart disease. Findings from this chapter show that immigrants have comparable odds of hypertension and heart disease to those of Canadian-born residents after adjusting for other factors. The third chapter examines the effects of time since arrival in Canada on the change in BMI over the 14-year period. This chapter shows that, holding other factors constant, an additional year in Canada leads to a 0.14% increase in an individual's BMI. This association is found to be more pronounced for women than men and for married than non-married individuals. The effect of time since arrival in Canada on the change in BMI is reduced to 0.07% after controlling for sample selection bias, suggesting that by ignoring the sample selection issue, the effects of time since arrival in Canada on the change in BMI may be overestimated

AB  - The United Nations refugee agency says it is ''alarmed'' at the conditions at a Greek detention center where hundreds of illegal immigrants are being held, including scores of children. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said Friday that 200 unaccompanied children were among 850 people detained on Lesbos island in the eastern Aegean Sea. It also said many of the 50 babies there had illnesses ''related to the cramped and unsanitary conditions of the center.'' The agency has urged Greece, which faces a major illegal immigration problem, to overhaul its asylum system.

T1  - The Administrative Detention of Non-Nationals Pursuant to Immigration Control: International and Constitutional Law Perspectives
JF  - International & Comparative Law Quarterly
A1  - Daniel Wilsher
KW  - eppi-reviewer
AB  - Immigration detention is controversial because it presents a clash between traditional notions of individual liberty and the territorial sovereignty of States. This paper is a comparative study of the immigration detention policies of different jurisdictions at legislative, international and judicial levels. The range of legislative systems of immigration detention is very wide. Countries that have experienced large-scale influxes of illegal migrants by sea (USA and Australia) have the most draconian systems. Canada is the most relaxed, possibly because migration has never been viewed as such a serious problem there (rather the opposite). The UK occupies the middle ground, with a statutory system that is discretionary rather than mandatory. Judicial attitudes have generally favoured protecting the liberty of non-nationals across jurisdictions. Arguments that the executive should have power to detain indefinitely because inadmissible or deportable non-nationals have no liberty interest have not been followed. Only in Australia, has the legislature succeeded in such a policy by the use of express words and the absence of a higher bill of rights. The paper also considers the compatibility of domestic detention regimes with international human rights law

AB  - Objective: To examine the mental healthconsequences of contemporary Australian policies pertaining to asylumseekers and to consider the possible roles of psychiatrists in responding tothis issue. Methods: Historical and political factors drivingpolicy are considered. The results of Aus��tralian studiesexamining the mental health of asylum seekers are reviewed. Results: Available research shows high ratesof trauma, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression inasylum seekers. The conditions of the postmigration environment influenceoutcomes. Psychiatrists working with other agencies continue toadvocate for this group. Important roles include the provision ofclinical services, undertaking and disseminating research, actingas expert witnesses and consultants, and writing reports for refugee applicants. Conclusions: Complex political motivations steerasylum policy. Psychiatric formulations are important in consideringthe impact of contemporary policy, but a wider ecological model isneeded to understand acts of desperation displayed by asylum seekers,particularly those in long-term detention. Sustained effort willbe needed to alter a policy of exclusion that has become entrenched

AB  - This article reports on the debate between United States presidential candidates John Kerry and George W. Bush, in the midst of continued violence and fighting in Iraq. As is often said about electoral debates, there was no knockout punch. As Republican President George W. Bush and Democratic Senator John Kerry ascended the dais for their first presidential debate, it was as if the world they sought to shape had decided to put on its own combative display, with more than enough blood to go around. Earlier that day, in what was supposed to be a community celebration in a Baghdad suburb--U.S. troops were handing out candy to youngsters while inaugurating a new sewage system--two suicide bombers drove explosives-packed cars into the crowd, killing over 40 people, 34 of them children. Add to that Israel's harsh push into a crowded Gaza refugee camp--100 Israeli tanks, nearly 40 Palestinians dead--and Pakistan boasting it had killed 100 al-Qaeda in a recent border offensive, and the U.S. presidential debate on foreign policy took on increased urgency. In the end, focus groups and quickie polls had Kerry winning the debate over the front-running Bush

China's current leaders complain of continued U.S. sanctions, the refusal of the administration of U.S. President George Bush to engage in high-level official exchanges and the deterioration in the quality of consultations on matters of common strategic interest. They protest President Bush's April 1991 meeting with the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan leader. They believe the United States has sought to restrain other leading industrialized nations in the Group of Seven from restoring relations with China to the levels that existed prior to the events in Tiananmen Square in June 1989. Washington is also accused of discouraging a rapid and full restoration of lending to China by international financial institutions. And behind these charges are more deep-seated fears--of another era of U.S. global hegemonism and a U.S. design to undermine China's communist regime. Meanwhile, at least among key opinion molders in Congress and the U.S. media, China's leaders are scorned and disdained. Memories of the June 4, 1989, massacre in Beijing remain vivid in the U.S. mind

T1  - The condition of health services in the Gaza Strip

AB  - The Association of Israeli and Palestinian Physicians for Human Rights was established during the first months of the uprising, against the background of a severe situation in which people were killed and wounded daily. AIPPHR works for the protection of human dignity and human life; defending physicians and patients in a state of political conflict out of loyalty to the principles of universal morality which constitute an inseparable part of the medical profession. This report, which is the result of months of research and investigation, is aimed, among other purposes, at bringing reliable information to the knowledge of the medical community in Israel and the Israeli Medical Association (IMA)--the body which organizes them. The silence of the medical community in the face of the phenomena described above is foreign to the spirit of doctors and medicine. The association's activity is aimed at creating a change in this situation out of the belief that the silence on the part of a large section of the medical community in Israel stems from a lack of regular and reliable information. In order to describe the situation of the medical services in the Gaza Strip, one must note two contrasting trends: on one hand, there is advancement in the population's health conditions, which is expressed by a decline in the infant mortality rate (from 86/1000 in 1970 to 28.1/1000 in 1988); a decline in the number of cases of whooping cough among children (30.1 in 1970 in contrast to 0 in 1988); and a decline in the number of cases of polio (14.3 in 1970 in contrast to 1 in 1980). On the other hand, the tendency of stagnation must be noted, especially in the development of independent local health services. Medicine in the Gaza Strip has been during the entire period of the occupation, and remains, completely dependent on Israeli medicine. Modern equipment and modern medical technology have been at the service of the residents of the Gaza Strip in Israeli hospitals, but they were not given the chance to develop high-standard medicine in their own hospitals. The Gaza Strip population has no representation at the decision-making level on issues of budget, development and distribution of resources--which are completely in the hands of the Civil Administration and the Israeli authorities. During the uprising there was a steep rise in medical needs. Residents in need of medical services are completely dependent on the decisions of the military government and the state leadership and the giving of these services is tied to political, not medical/professional policy. Since the beginning of the uprising in the Occupied Territories, a new tendency has appeared; the use of medicine as an additional means of repression against the population. This means that medicine has been removed from the status of a basic human right and recruited as a means of punishment. This is a phenomenon which no physician or person of conscience can accept

AB  - The Committee to Protect Journalists has named 12 countries -- including Iraq, Russia, the Philippines, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Mexico -- to its annual ''impunity index'' because they allow deadly violence against the press to go unpunished. The threats to journalists are also highlighted in a welcome, new State Department initiative. From now until World Press Freedom Day, May 3, the department's HumanRights.govWeb site will tell the stories of people who have been killed, jailed or otherwise blocked from reporting the news and exercising the fundamental right to free speech. The first case, posted Wednesday, involves Dieu Cay, a Vietnamese blogger who has been imprisoned since 2008 on the trumped-up charge of property tax evasion. His real ''offense'': writing on sensitive human rights and corruption issues in Vietnam and criticizing China's human rights record. On Thursday, it called attention to Natalya Radzina, a prominent democratic activist from Belarus, who was beaten and jailed by her government before going into political exile in Lithuania last year.

AB  - Media and political representations of asylum seekers and refugees have been infused with language denoting images of 'danger', 'criminality' and 'risk'. Despite attempts to provide for those seeking asylum in the UK, those in need have frequently been stigmatized and criminalized. Policies and practices, intended to respond to those fleeing economic hardship or political persecution, have been guided by such depictions. This article illustrates the use of detention as a mechanism for purportedly securing the containment and removal of 'illegals'. 'While the use of detention may be seen as an attempt to deter 'undeserving' asylum seekers from seeking sanctuary in the UK, this article argues that this practice is, in effect, a fundamentally punitive method to assuage public fears concerning supposed 'risk' and potential dangers to 'security'

AB  - The purpose of this study was to elucidate the experience of Bosnian refugees currently living in the United States. 7 adult female, Bosnian refugees each participated in an audio recorded interview lasting from one to two hours. The method used was the phenomenological praxis operationalized by Amedeo Giorgi, in which four steps are employed to arrive at the intersubjective constitution of the phenomenon being studied. In this study, the results constituted the phenomenon of "living elsewhere." Results of the study showed the presence of six main categories and two major themes. The categories were: mixing blood, which in a state of ethnic warfare was dangerous and even lethal; deracination, where human disturbances caused by being uprooted manifested themselves as numbness, illusions of invulnerability, dreaming, timelessness of sleep, and the search for lost objects; nostalgia, in which a state of perpetual mourning caused a time warp where past, present, and future collapsed into one frame; transgenerational and vicarious lives, wherein children and grandchildren became custodians for an ethnic group's past; reciprocity, which served as a measure of genuineness and well-being in human relations; and, language and belonging, where linguistic ability became a carrier of the sense of devastation caused by one's sense of not belonging. The two major themes were: belonging, in which the refugees lost their sense of belonging in their old homes, and were searching for a sense of belonging in their new homes; and adapting, wherein the refugees changed their environment and themselves in their new environment. In addition, they used specific coping mechanisms to survive, such as sleeping, dreaming, changing their cognitive frameworks, tolerating psychic ambiguity, and working very long hours. The process of belonging and adapting found in this sample of Bosnian refugees living in the United States represents a part of the human response to having survived war trauma and to being resettled.

T1  - THE FUGITIVE: EVIDENCE ON PUBLIC VERSUS PRIVATE LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM BAIL JUMPING
JF  - Journal of Law & Economics
A1  - Helland Eric

KW  - eppi-reviewer
AB  - On the day of their trial, a substantial number of felony defendants fail to appear. Public police have the primary responsibility for pursuing and rearresting defendants who were released on their own recognizance or on cash or government bail. Defendants who made bail by borrowing from a bond dealer, however, must worry about an entirely different pursuer. When a defendant who has borrowed money skips trial, the bond dealer forfeits the bond unless the fugitive is soon returned. As a result, bond dealers have an incentive to monitor their charges and ensure that they do not skip. When a defendant does skip, bond dealers hire bounty hunters to return the defendants to custody. We compare the effectiveness of these two different systems by examining failure-to-appear rates, fugitive rates, and capture rates of felony defendants who fall under the various systems. We apply propensity score and matching techniques

AB  - While the savagery of the Palestinian conflict continues to drive the Israeli electorate ever rightwards, a wave of scandal in the Likud may now be hurting the prime minister's party. On December 29, 2002 a boy aged eight and a girl aged nine were killed by army fire within hours of each other: he during stone-throwing clashes in Tulkarm; she while standing outside her shelter in Gaza's Khan Yunis refugee camp. On December 31st Israel's Prime Minister Ariel Sharon peremptorily fired a Likud deputy minister, Naomi Blumenthal, for refusing to co-operate with the police investigators who are looking into the party primaries in November. The tough and sullen mood pervading much of the electorate was reflected in the disqualification of two prominent Arab candidates, Ahmed Tibi and Azmi Bishara, both members of the present Knesset, by the Central Elections Committee. The committee, comprising representatives of all Knesset factions and presided over by a Supreme Court judge, refused to disqualify a rightist candidate with a long record of anti-Arab racism

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of mental illness and factors associated with poor mental health of underserved Guatemalan refugee communities located in Chiapas, Mexico since 1981. METHODS: Cross-sectional, household survey in five refugee camps in Chiapas with an estimated 12,500 residents, five were surveyed, representing an estimated population (adults and children) of 1,546. All adults (ages 16 >) in all households were asked to participate; on average one adult per household completed the questionnaires. An estimated 95% of all households were surveyed. Respondents (N = 179) received the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire, Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 and answered demographic questions. RESULTS: 95% of respondents were born in Guatemala. The prevalence rate for PTSD was 11.2%, the prevalence rate of scores indicating anxiety and depression were 54.4% and 39.1%, respectively. Participants with PTSD were five times more likely to have experienced a disappearance. Other factors associated with PTSD, anxiety and depression are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Psychiatric morbidity related to trauma events and refugee status was common among survey respondents. Guatemalan refugees surveyed may benefit from culturally appropriate and sustainable mental health assistance twenty years after the Guatemalan civil conflict. [Author Abstract]

AB  - The article discusses the conditions of the migrant worker class in Western Europe. The social history of industrialization is the history of labor migration: concentration of capital requires movement of labor. Temporary labor recruitment and contract labor have been significant for centuries throughout the capitalist world. Nineteenth-century industrialization in Europe led to large-scale migrations, both internal rural-urban and inter- national. Most were unorganized, but Germany, France and Switzerland did develop systems of temporary recruitment between 1870 and 1914, making considerable efforts to prevent workers from settling. The largest and most exploitative temporary labor system was that developed by the Nazis to fuel their war economy. After the Second World War, several countries rapidly introduced systems of temporary labor recruitment to speed up reconstruction and to compensate in part for wartime manpower losses. In 1945, the British government set up the European voluntary worker (EVW) scheme to recruit about 90,000 workers from refugee camps and later from Italy as well. Only single persons were eligible. They were not regarded as permanent residents and their civil rights were severely restricted

KW  - eppi-reviewer
AB  - This paper looks at aspects of the detention of irregular migrants in Australia, Malaysia, and Thailand. The principle intention of the paper is to study detention of irregular migrants as a means of understanding politics and how notions of political participation and of sovereignty are affected by the detention of certain sorts of individual. What does the identification of certain �_oforms of life�__ to be detained say about the political norms of different societies? The conduit for this examination will be the Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben's concept of homo sacer. Homo sacer is a term Agamben extrapolates from �_oancient Roman law�__. It denotes a naked or bare life that is depoliticized. Homo sacer is the excess of processes of political constitution that create a governable form of life. Homo sacer is thus exempt or excluded from the normal limits of the state. At the same time, however, homo sacer is not simply cast out but is held in particular relation to the norm: it is through the exclusion of the depoliticized form of life that the politicized norm exists. This essay seeks to contextualize aspects of Agamben's argument by looking at detention as a form of exclusion in three different contexts

They show that surviving Jews returning from the camps or emerging from hiding were met with distrust. After the war the survivors were once again faced with the "Jewish problem", for they continued to be seen as aliens, and it was not long before a resurgence of antisemitism became evident."--BOOK JACKET

AB  - The article focuses on the negligence of police in bringing to justice Muhammad Bijeh, a man who raped and killed at least 20 rural migrants and Afghan refugees in Iran. A young man develops a taste for raping and killing people, mostly small boys, and hiding their corpses in the wasteland of the open-air brick factories that he inhabits. The police are indifferent to the pleas of distraught parents, who are mostly rural migrants and Afghan refugees. Embarrassed by the media's attention, the authorities are trying to make amends. Negligent policemen have been referred to the courts. Iran's top policeman, Muhammad Baqer Ghalibaf, pledges to absorb the appropriate lessons. Ghalibaf gave warning against "imagining that there can be security in a society that does not possess the minimum needed for living." Bijeh's charge sheet records the human consequences of Iran's two-decade-long wave of rural-urban migration. His accomplice, who was sentenced to 15 years in prison, is a drug addict, as was one of the adult victims. The only woman killed by Bijeh seems to have been a prostitute. Another victim was a child laborer. Child or adult, Iranian or Afghan, all were poor

T1  - The Metamorphosis of Juvenile Correctional Education: Incidental Conception to Intentional Inclusion
JF  - Journal of Correctional Education
A1  - Keeley James H
KW  - eppi-reviewer
AB  - Juvenile Correctional Education has been evolving in the United States for over 360 years. From inclusion in an indentured servant/foster care type of placement legislated in the Massachusetts Colony in 1642, it has become manifest today as an entitlement regardless of juvenile justice disposition. The education for juveniles was wrapped in the cocoon of the dominant justice system throughout the history of the United States. Its emergence was initially indistinguishable because education was incidental to other incarceration management and treatment modalities. As differentiated placement was adopted, education for religious purposes from the ministerial community edged into prison regimens Juvenile offenders benefited because they were commingled in the common jails and workhouses of the Colonial Era. A dear distinction in providing education to juveniles appeared during the Refuge House and Reform Era of the Nineteenth Century. The judiciary and social reformers touted education as a basis for new types of institutions such as reformatories and industrial schools. This era established education within juvenile justice with a focus on basic and practical skills. It was generally accepted by correctional authorities and social reformers that this level of education was the most appropriate for these youth. A more comprehensive pro vision of education gradually emerged during the Professional and Political Patronage Era of the Twentieth Century. Through the efforts of special interests in the greater society after World War Il, the actions within the professional and political domains enriched the requirements of free and appropriate education for all youth. Juvenile offenders have benefited through inclusion as an identified group within the mandates of education for all youth. The impact of these influences is having a positive effect on the education programs in residential placement institutions across the United States

AB  - This article discusses the refugee problem in Trieste, Italy. During 1954, 35,000 refugees from Venezia Giulia came to Trieste. Accommodations have been provided for all these refugees. A total of 1,412 are lodged in five hotels; 800 are living in a refugee camp in Opicina; 412 families are installed in grain storehouses and the remaining refugees are living in temporary quarters provided by friends or acquaintances. After the Allies declared their intention to withdraw from Trieste in October 1953, the problem of the refugees from Zone B became more acute. The persecution of the priests and peaceful citizens continued. The emigration of the Balkan refugees from Trieste to overseas countries started in 1953 when the National Catholic Welfare Conference (NCWC) presented projects to immigration countries for non-sponsored cases. NCWC is responsible for the assistance and spiritual welfare of the refugees in camps. Future plans for refugees in Trieste include the effort to resettle, in Canada or Australia, those who will not be able to migrate to the U.S. and provide training and instruction programs in favour of refugees from communist countries

AB  - Scope: An epidemiological study on the prevalence of stress related experiences and personality disorders was conducted on two groups of migrants who came to Germany from the former Soviet Union (Group 1, incarcerated offenders, n = 60; Group 2, migrants living in the German community, n = 30) and a group of individuals with German ancestry who stayed in Russia (Group 3, n = 30). Hypotheses: (1) Incarcerated migrants experience more stress than those living in the community; (2) migrants to Germany show higher stress levels than those who have stayed in Siberia. Results: Poor German language skills were associated with the high stress level of incarcerated migrants, but no evidence was found for an association between high stress levels and an elevated prevalence rate for personality disorders. Stress levels were highest in Group 1; and the prevalence rate of personality disorders was 61.7 per cent. For Group 2, the prevalence rate was 16.7 per cent and for Group 3 it was 20 per cent. Conclusions: Stress levels in migrants from the former Soviet Union are generally elevated. They are also elevated in comparable individuals who have not migrated. Antisocial behaviour is associated with poor language skills and high stress levels, but stress does apparently not relate to the presence of a personality disorder.

T1  - The role of the physician and the medical profession in the prevention of international torture and in the treatment of its survivors. American College of Physicians

AB  - The prevention of torture and the treatment of survivors are issues that concern an increasing number of physicians in their daily work. Every day, thousands of men, women, and children are subjected to violence and are forced to flee their homelands. There are more than 18 million refugees in the world and hundreds of thousands of persons seeking asylum, many of them in the United States. Physicians are often the first to interview these victims of abuse. Torture has serious and long-lasting health consequences. Thus, physicians can play a key role in documenting and preventing many forms of abuse and in treating survivors. In some areas, physicians may become the targets of arrest because of their work as clinicians or as influential members of their communities. They may also face disturbing ethical dilemmas as they witness torture or its results. As members of the medical profession, physicians have an obligation to their peers around the world. This report reviews the current state of physicians' involvement in the prevention of international torture and in the treatment of its victims. We propose ways in which physicians can become involved by caring for survivors of torture and by providing expert testimony on behalf of victims who seek asylum. We discuss how the medical profession complements the efforts of individual physicians by providing an infrastructure to support and guide their work. Medical organizations can adopt and disseminate ethical principles that specifically address human rights and their violation. They can coordinate letter-writing networks for human rights, organize or sponsor fact-finding missions, and develop continuing medical education courses on topics such as the identification and treatment of victims of torture. We conclude that physicians can make a difference, both as clinicians and as advocates for the health of the public and the protection of the human rights. The American College of Physicians will continue to advocate for the rights of persons and communities to live in dignity and peace, free of the fear of unjust imprisonment or torture

JF  - Journal of Palestine Studies

KW  - eppi-reviewer
AB  - The films of Rashid Masharawi, one of the leading Palestinian "exilic" directors of the younger generation, are set almost entirely in the occupied territories, especially in refugee camps, and unfold in a seemingly timeless present shaped by a past catastrophe (1948) never explicitly evoked. The author examines Masharawi's some dozen films, both documentary and feature, thematically and technically, showing how the films" structure and camera work emphasize the sense of confinement, narrowing horizons, and psychological siege depicted. The author concludes that though almost relentlessly bleak and stripped of any hint of romanticism, the films also convey a stubborn will to survive and endure, and together present a powerful allegory of life in the occupied territories

KW  - eppi-reviewer
AB  - The article focuses on the value of temporary institutionalization in habilitating the mentally retarded. An examination of the relationship between institutionalization and mental retardation reveals a strong body of evidence pointing to the deleterious and undesirable effects which confinement in an institution exerts upon the intellectual and emotional development of a growing child. The residential facility for the retarded can not only be seen merely as a permanent repository for the highly dependent, severely retarded individual, but also as a temporary refuge for the retardate living in the community who is indeed capable of meaningful self-realization but who finds himself momentarily in a psychological quandary. The value of temporary institutionalization would be two-fold: the institution would act to reduce psychological pressures by allowing the retardate to live within a community of peers whose demands upon him would be no greater than the demands he would make upon himself; and the institution would be able to offer the retardate an individually tailored program designed to permit him to realize his inner potentialities and to come to terms with himself

AB  - Theseus (th�"�_�syo�"o�"s, �_"s�"�Ts), in Greek mythology, hero of Athens; son of either King Aegeus or Poseidon. Before Aegeus left Troezen he placed his sword and sandals beneath a huge rock and told his wife Aethra that when their son, Theseus, could lift the rock he was to bring the gifts to his kingdom in Athens. At the age of 16 Theseus lifted the rock and began his journey, during which he freed the countryside of various monsters and villains (e.g., Procrustes). When Theseus arrived at Athens, Medea, then wife of Aegeus, tried to kill him. Aegeus, however, recognized the sword and sandals, saved Theseus, and exiled Medea. Theseus subsequently had numerous adventures. His most famous exploit was against the Minotaur of King Minos of Crete. Theseus insisted on being one of the seven youths and seven maidens of Athens to be sacrificed to the monster as an annual tribute. He promised his father that if he were successful in killing the Minotaur he would on his return voyage replace his ship's black sails with white ones. Ariadne, daughter of King Minos, fell in love with Theseus and gave him a magic ball of thread to be dropped at the entrance of the labyrinth; it led Theseus to the Minotaur, which he killed, and he then followed the unwound thread back to the entrance. He left Crete with Ariadne but abandoned her at Naxos. When Theseus reached home he forgot to raise white sails. Aegeus saw black sails, and, thinking his son dead, the grief-stricken father threw himself into the sea, thereafter called the Aegean. As king of Athens, Theseus instituted several reforms, most notably the federalization of the scattered Attic communities. He journeyed to the land of the Amazons, where he abducted Antiope, who bore him Hippolytus. A vengeful Amazon army invaded Athens, but Theseus defeated it. Some say Antiope died fighting beside him in the battle; others claim that Theseus killed her when she objected to his marriage to Phaedra. For helping PirithoǬs to carry off Persephone, Theseus was imprisoned in Hades until Hercules rescued him. Upon his return to Athens, he found his once great kingdom a turmoil of corruption and rebellion. He regretfully sailed away and came to rest at Skyros, where he was treacherously murdered by King Lycomedes. Although Theseus is generally thought of as legendary, the Athenians believed he had been one of their early kings.

AB  - This report captures information on the profile of Black, Asian, Minority Ethnic and Refugee (BAMER) women and children accessing refuge and other support services in the UK. It describes a project between 2008 and 2009 with the BAMER violence against women (VAW) sector to develop and pilot a shared system of data collection. The data toolkit captures information on the profile of BAMER women and children accessing refuge and other support services, the nature and extent of the violence and abuse, specialist support needs, and the factors that may prevent them from accessing external support as well as any outcomes and issues that arise through their engagement with the criminal justice system, housing, legal, advocacy, health and other relevant support services. The pilot project provides information on the largest ever research sample of BAMER women and children experiencing violence in the UK. Ten BAMER services from across the UK participated in a 3 month pilot providing detailed data on 124 women who had accessed their refuge, advice and outreach services. The majority of the services that agreed to participate in the pilot were South Asian. This report provides a summary of key findings from the pilot phase of implementation. The full report will be launched later in 2010

AB  - Based on a research project with migrants from Iran this paper focuses on the influence of a strictly regulated German asylum life situation on autobiographical telling in research contexts. Regardless of the specific research topic the interview situation and the relationship between interviewer and interviewee always influence shape, form and fashion of the biographical narration. As a result of the strict regimentation of the asylum procedures and their far-reaching impact on biographies in the "total refugee space," an intensification of the hierarchical structure in the interview situation can be observed. Considering the empirical results this paper calls for a reflexive biographical research. This approach has to analyze the power relations in the transnational space and their consequences on the research process. It also has to recognize that researchers and interviewees are not only confined to their culture differences, but that the setting comprises all intersectional localizations, which are defined by social and economic status, nationality, gender, sexuality etc

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Data from observational cohorts may be influenced by population structure and loss to follow-up (LTFU). Quality of care may be associated with participation in cohort networks. We aimed to study the participation, characteristics and retention rates of immigrants in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) METHODS: We compared enrolment over time (1996-1999, 2000-2003 and 2004-2008) and LTFU between individuals from different geographical regions. In 2008, we performed a cross-sectional survey to investigate the proportion of individuals not participating in the SHCS but who were in care at SHCS institutions. Predictors for LTFU were analysed using Cox proportional hazard models, and those for nonparticipation using logistic regression RESULTS: A total of 7840 individuals entered the SHCS during the observation period. The proportion of immigrants increased over time, especially the proportion of women from sub-Saharan Africa, which increased from 21 to 48% during the observation period. Overall LTFU was 3.76 [95% confidence interval (CI) 3.58-3.95]/100, with the highest hazard ratio in men from sub-Saharan Africa (2.82/100 patient-years; 95% CI 2.30-3.46/100), compared with men from northwestern countries. Other predictors for LTFU were age <30 years, lower education, injecting drug use, and higher baseline CD4 cell counts. Participants taking antiretroviral therapy had reduced LTFU. The survey showed that 84% of HIV-infected patients in care at SHCS institutions were enrolled in the cohort. Nonparticipation was more likely among men from non-European regions (odds ratio 2.73; 95% CI 2.29-3.24), women from sub-Saharan Africa (odds ratio 3.01; 95% CI 2.40-3.77) and women from Latin America/Caribbean (odds ratio 2.10; 95% CI 1.30-3.39) CONCLUSIONS: Numbers of HIV-infected immigrants are increasing but they are underrepresented in the SHCS, and immigrants are more likely to be lost to follow-up. 2011 British HIV Association

AB  - Several studies have reported that Asian Americans, including Cambodian and Laotian Americans, tend to under utilize mental health services, both inpatient and outpatient although they display high levels of psychological problems related to significant psychological trauma experienced in their native land or while living in refugee camps. Underutilization may not be related to the lack of need but it may relate to cultural factors such as shame and stigma as well as acculturation and lack of health insurance. Although some Asian American research about help seeking exists, no previous research has specifically addressed this question with a Cambodian and Laotian population. This study was designed to investigate demographic and acculturation variables that might help understand why. This study used data from 108 Cambodians and Laotians adults (18+) living in Rhode Island. Participants completed (1) a demographic questionnaire sheet; (2) the Sin-Lew Asian Self Identity Acculturation Scale (AS-ASIA); (3) the Attitude Toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help Scale (ATSPPHS). Results show that only one demographic variable, gender, demonstrated a robust relationship with help seeking, with females being significantly more likely than males to recognize the need for help, have less stigma about seeking help, be more open to discussing problems and more confident that professional services would be of assistance. In contrast, neither age, nor education having health insurance was significantly related to help seeking. Level of acculturation was strongly related to help seeking, contributing, in hierarchical regression analyses, unique variance over and above the set of demographic variables. Further, acculturation was related to two specific dimensions of help seeking (e.g., openness to discussing problems and confidence in professional help). A discussion of tailoring change efforts to these particular dimensions as well as females is offered as useful in engaging Laotian and Cambodian populations. Further, females are not only likely to seek help but they are also able to influent others, especially males, to seek help through their traditional role as a "wives and mother." Limitations of this research are discussed and suggestions made for future research efforts

AB  - An estimated 165,000 Sahrawi men, women and children are living in four refugee camps in south-west Algeria. Many fled their country, the Western Sahara, when it was ceded by the then colonial power, Spain, to Morocco and Mauritania in 1975. Since that time the Government of the camps has made considerable efforts to build technological capability in manufacturing processes, as a contribution towards refugee �_~self-sufficiency�_T and in recognition of its long-term importance to economic development. This paper focuses on the development of textile production capability and notes that, while the achievements are impressive, there are serious blockages to significant further development, namely: frequent and extended disruption of production, lack of short term incentives and lack of institutional encouragement for experimentation in design. While these blockages result, inpart, from the refugee environment and are linked to broader issues of social organization at the camps, possibilities do exist to alleviate them.

AB  - The history of America's southern music--blues and country--is based on the assumption that one is "black" and the other "white." Centuries of cohabitation on the southern landscape, however, reveal that the two race cultures have intermingled since their introduction. Music was the first bridge between blacks and whites in America, beginning even before the slave ships and immigrant Europeans arrived offshore. The Color of Music is an original and unprecedented look at the exchange of black and white cultures, their music, and the mutual attraction and aversions they expressed. It discusses the historically neglected similarities between lower class blacks and whites; more significantly, it challenges the assumption that a specific race can claim ownership of a uniquely American music, The Color of Music proceeds from three perspectives--race, culture, and music. The topic is relevant because of the peculiar American racial development in which a uniquely obvious minority has been simultaneously integrated and legally ostracized from dominant "white" culture. In many ways American race relations are based on what W. E. B. DuBois calls the "twoness" of American life, a blend of push and pull, antipathy, envy, and absolute theoretical segregation. African-Americans consistently affected a dominant white culture in which they had virtually no control. Whites were equally affected in the exchange, incorporating black musical traditions into their repertoire while simultaneously denying the credibility of their sources. Rather than engage in yet another racial custody battle over southern music, The Color of Music addresses the significance of the exchange and demonstrates the need for reconciliation and acknowledgment. In modern culture everyone knows that rock `n' roll is bigger than Elvis Presley. Country music reflects an interracial southern birth as well. While jazz is known as America's greatest gift to the world, it is but one intrinsic unit in a large body of work that American musicians have originated, refined, and mastered. Spirituals, country, blues, gospel, and rock `n roll are the product of an interracial experience, reflecting the real, deep, and true exchange more effectively than any other medium

AB  - It is now a truism that the Australian population is ageing, and ageing more rapidly in some groups than others. Specifically, the number of older immigrants of non-English-speaking backgrounds has been growing at five times the rate of the Australian-born aged population in recent years. It follows that the current generation of Australians looks towards old age with the most diverse cultural faces in the Australian history. While the psychology of ageing is important to all of the U.S., this paper is confined to an overview of issues related to older migrants and their families. The dynamics of a substantial long-term migration program generate two groups of overseas-born aged, those who migrated young and grew old in Australia, and those who came here when they were already comparatively older. Those who came to Australia in the post-war years as young migrants have now been in Australia for most of their adult lives, and their children were either born here or came as young children. The later groups of older migrants consist predominantly of those who came under family reunion programs, sponsored by their adult children. The two groups have different settlement experiences, but now share several similar experiences in terms of family interactions

AB  - This dissertation explores narrative strategies of self-identity in autobiographies by six pioneering women writers, each of whom lost what has traditionally been woman's place: her home. The accounts of emigration, expatriation, and exile by Anna Brownwell Jameson, Catharine Parr Traill, Susanna Moodie, Ada Cambridge, Isak Dinesen, and Alyse Simpson illustrate the implications of this loss, as each woman struggled to recover a sense both of home and of grounded identity. The writings span more than a hundred years, from the 1830s to the 1950s, and tell of lives lived in locations as different as Canada, Australia, and British East Africa (now Kenya), places that variously proved to be confining and/or liberating. By narrating the ways in which identity adapts to and is transformed by a new environment, these texts provide access to the construction and alteration of the self in relation to place. This study probes this process by using the concept of place, rather than the more conventional one of time, as the dominant category of analysis. My readings are both intertextual and interdisciplinary: they rely on theorizing by sociologists and psychologists concerned with the relationship between place and identity, studies on the same subject by literary scholars, and formulations by women's autobiography theorists. My investigation reveals, among other discoveries, that the gender-specific aspects of the process of adaptation persistently centre on the notion of homecoming and that they are articulated with reference to the figure of the mother

AB  - Safeguarding refugee and asylum-seeking children is an area of work that presents complex challenges, for practitioners internationally and for researchers aiming to explore how best to meet the needs of children and families in such situations. Mention of detention and refusal reminds us that official policy in this area is not solely concerned with the welfare of refugee and asylum seeking children. It is also concerned with ensuring that borders are effectively policed, that those who cannot demonstrate entitlement are not allowed to remain and that those claiming services are dealt with according to a variety of rules governing eligibility, based on age and other factors. We are reminded that safeguarding children can sometimes mean protecting them not only from family members but also from agents of the state. These kinds of tensions are reflected in the papers which compose this special issue. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In this study, language transition among the children of Caribbean immigrants in the US is examined from two main perspectives. First, speeds of language transition among children in French- and Spanish-Caribbean immigrant families are compared. Second, the mediating roles of socio-demographic factors and sibling characteristics in language transition are also examined. The results reveal that, with increasing assimilation, children in French-Caribbean families experience a faster transition to English monolingualism than their counterparts with Spanish-Caribbean parents. Transition to English monolingualism is also negatively associated with the number of first-generation siblings within a household. However, increases in the number of second- and first-generation monolingual-English siblings significantly shift children's language use towards complete Anglicisation. Instructively, this impact offsets the influence which ethnically endogamous parents have on the retention of the mother-tongue within immigrant families.

He was trained in medicine at the Univ. of Edinburgh but abandoned that field for law and gained a brilliant reputation as a barrister in Ireland, particularly in defending members of the Society of United Irishmen. Imprisoned in 1798 for his activities in the Irish cause, he was later released on condition of perpetual exile and emigrated to the United States in 1804. He established a practice in New York and became one of the most notable American lawyers. His interest in the Irish cause continued, and he was of invaluable assistance to many of the early Irish immigrants who came to America.

It is argued that circulation is not confined to commuter-type mobility but in the Caribbean it is also a feature of long-stay migration and the establishment of what are effectively transnational households. Though the characteristics and spatial behaviour of the household vary with the specific migration type, the transnational household provides a more appropriate model for analysing Caribbean migration and its implications than does the model based on migration as displacement." excerpt

AB  - Originally published in Contemporary Psychology: APA Review of Books, 1997, Vol 42(8), 713-714. Reviews Children and political violence (see record 1996-97287-000). Understanding the developmental consequences of political violence and providing a framework for further inquiry are the primary goals of Ed Cairns in writing this book. Cairns wrote this volume to integrate the disparate literatures concerning the effects of political violence on children worldwide. Drawing on contemporary research on children in townships, refugee camps, settlements, urban ghettos, and other settings, as well as studies of young wartime survivors of the Holocaust and the British bombardment, Cairns synthesizes what is known and highlights what remains unknown about the consequences for children of the violence they observe and experience. Direct and indirect effects of political violence on family and school life, children's play and moral development, and their tendencies toward aggression and criminality are insightfully discussed. In addition, Cairns examines the nature of stress on children as well as the multifaceted determinants of their coping capacities. The author explores what little is known about children as political activists and, in a complementary chapter on "Children and Peace," considers interventions to strengthen children's resistance to violence. Although necessarily constrained by limitations in the quality and quantity of research, the author offers a provocative heuristic analysis that both synthesizes existing knowledge (much of it found in unusual or obscure sources) and frames important questions for further study. In an important subtext, he also explores the proper role of psychologists as investigators of political change and inquires whether an objective, dispassionate scientific stance is feasible or desirable.

AB  - This study investigated the perceptions of six "middle" generation Hmong refugee students who were matriculating at The University of Montana during the late 1990s to shed some light on their perspectives of the college experience. The researcher selected a qualitative, phenomenological/psychological methodology developed by Amedeo Giorgi to access, analyze, and explicate the subjective and psychological dimensions of the phenomenon. The results of the analysis revealed that the subjects felt apprehensive, lonely, overwhelmed and frustrated in the college setting but were, nevertheless, highly motivated to persevere. The themes of hope, courage, resilience, and tenacity emerged as important strategies used by the students to counter the adversities they experienced. While their problems were situated in the college setting, their motivations to endure those situations appeared to come from outside campus--from their cultural traditions, their history of migration, and from the leadership role they have assumed for the perpetuation of their cultural group in the United States. The study hoped to benefit the subjects themselves, by providing a forum in which they could express, examine, and understand their own experiences. The study has implications for college retention program developers, educators, and school counselors interested in improving the quality of experience for students considered "at risk" for success in higher education

AB  - Objective: Few studies have assessed the outcomes of runaway/homeless youth that seek assistance from shelter or crisis services, which would provide much needed documentation of intervention effectiveness and point to new directions for service provision. The goals of the current study were to: (1) assess short-term outcomes among runaway/homeless youth using emergency shelters and crisis services and (2) compare short-term outcomes achieved by runaway/ homeless youth in crisis shelters with similar youth using other, longer-term treatment modalities. Method: The study sampled 261 youth using runaway/homeless shelters from four midwestern states at intake and six-weeks post discharge and 47 high-risk youth using longer-term services at intake and six weeks post intake; ten key outcome variables were assessed. Results: Every outcome variable demonstrated improvement post intervention: days on the run, school suspension and/or detention, and sexual activity decreased; perceived family support and selfesteem increased; and youth were more likely to be currently employed and less likely to have been fired. In comparing runaway/homeless crisis shelter users with day treatment users on the ten outcome variables, there were no significant differences across any of the outcome variables. Conclusions: Despite limitations, the research provides evidence for the short-term effectiveness of crisis shelter services for runaway/homeless youth.

AB  - There have been many changes in the practice of medicine in the UK in the recent past, including major changes in training and trainees�_T hours, treatment options and patient expectations. These, in combination with a need for better accountability and improved continuing medical education, have increased the demands on senior doctors, and made apparent the need for increased medical resource. There would seem to be four areas through which this is being addressed �_" increased production of doctors; changes in medical training; changes in medical practice, and retention of seniors in post. This paper examines some of the perceived advantages and potential disadvantages of these approaches. It concludes that if the health service is to have a viable long-term future, its survival in the short term depends on maintaining within the service the skills of those seniors who have borne the brunt of recent change.

The Thailand Burma Border Consortium agreed with the Karen and Karenni Refugee Committees to set up the camp in 2004. It informs that the Camp Management Project supports relationships with local communities in whose land the refugees live. The Project provides support for activities of community-based organizations (CBO) and helps to maintain relationships with local authorities. Thai authorities along with non-governmental organizations, CBOs, and United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees work in coordination to provide services through resettlement, child protection, donor interests and general information updates

AB  - Senior Obama administration officials are scheduled to travel to Honduras this week in an effort to resolve a political crisis that began nearly four months ago when soldiers detained President Manuel Zelaya and forced him into exile. This will be the first time since the coup that the Obama administration has taken a leading role in pressuring the leaders of the de facto government to restore democratic order in Honduras. The stepped-up pressure comes after months of apparently fruitless talks about whether Mr. Zelaya will be returned to power.

AB  - Folk customs, and in particular the festivals and celebrations, of the members of the Chinese Association of Newfoundland and Labrador are described and analyzed to determine what effect folklore and folklife have on the acculturation process and vice versa. The methodology involved participant observation in organized celebrations of the community and the attendance at more informal settings such as Mandarin classes in the Chinese Language School, and forty-one interviews of the first generation. The research results are analyzed in the context of the folklore of ethnicity and ethnic folklore. The results support the assertion that folk customs and acculturation do impact upon each other. This is visible in the retention of non-verbal elements such as food practices, rather than the retention of the Chinese language. A significant group through which acculturation occurs is the children. Children act as a catalyst for both maintaining Chinese traditional observances and adopting Newfoundland festivals. Other significant factors influencing acculturation include migration patterns, physical environment, technological changes, and the traditions and folk customs of the host society. This research basically supports earlier research findings on the maintenance of immigrant folklore as compared with the transition to ethnic folklore amongst minorities in North America. Despite a diversity of mother country origins, the immigrant generation of Chinese Newfoundlanders were in the "transitional" stage

AB  - To qualify for third-country resettlement, refugees must convince aid representatives that they have been individually persecuted and continue to fear such persecution. This article focuses on the official documents Congolese refugees collect as evidence of their persecution to bolster their resettlement claims before their refugee camp in Tanzania closes. To illuminate the creation, collection, and circulation of such documents, I trace one Congolese family's story as it is folded, literally and metaphorically, into an envelope that I hand-delivered to a United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) resettlement official. Following this envelope led me to an investigation of the bureaucratic institutions involved, which both produce and then later receive the documents. I argue that the apparent transparency of the resettlement process facilitates and justifies its concomitant opacity.

AB  - The HIV epidemic in central Asia (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan) has accelerated since 2000. This expansion in the epidemic is largely attributable to escalating injection drug use, reflecting central Asia's geographic position along major drug trafficking routes. Although up to 75% of cumulative HIV cases have been among injection drug users (IDUs) so far, HIV infections are increasing in other population groups, including female sex workers and their clients, prisoners, and migrants. Among IDUs, risky injecting practices are highly prevalent, and the intersecting epidemic of sexually transmitted infections, particularly syphilis, highlights the potential for sexual transmission of HIV to bridging populations. Few HIV cases in children have been reported so far, with most resulting from nosocomial outbreaks in hospital settings. Some recent progress has been made towards scaling-up prevention, treatment, and care services, including harm reduction for IDUs, although key challenges remain. Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Aftermath of Hurricane Katrina sparked the largest influx of Hispanic laborers in the metropolitan New Orleans area ever recorded in Louisiana's history. Inhabiting impoverished neighborhoods with minimal resources, unable to speak the language and illegal in status, may prime this migrant class as vulnerable targets of robbery. Hence, robberies against Hispanics have increased in Jefferson Parish, which is the basis for the present study. The intention of this research is to ascertain whether such robbery victims sustain greater secondary violence during the commission of the crime than that of Non-Hispanics and also if geographic confinement is contributory factor to Hispanics being robbed

AB  - The Supreme Court this week continued its disturbing campaign of closing the courthouse door to people who allege unfair treatment. This time, its target was Javaid Iqbal, one of many Muslim men rounded up and detained after Sept. 11, 2001. Mr. Iqbal, a Muslim and a Pakistani citizen, was arrested soon after the attacks on immigration charges. He argued that the F.B.I. designated him of ''high interest'' and held him in maximum-security conditions -- where he said he was abused by the prison staff -- based on his religion and national origin.

AB  - Tanshishan site is an important prehistory and bronze age site that was seated in the area of the lower reaches of Minjiang River . It has been excavated for eight times and there is no doubt that it had four main layers . A lot of basic study has been done but there still are disputation about what the relationship between the low and the middle layer is and how about the time of each layer . As to researching on the settlement pattern or the environment then or interaction between people and environment , only few scholar did a little .For the reason above , this thesis firstly reanalyze the question about each layers' time and got the conclusion as followed : the time of the low layer was from 5000B.P. to 4500B.P. , the time of the middle layer was from 4000B.P. to 3300B.P. , the time of the upper layer was from 3300B.P. to 2700B.P. .Based on this established frame of time, the thesis gave a detailed analysis on the economic and settlement pattern of each layer , the changes of the environment during the site was dwelled and how the development of the society was promoted or restrained by environment around it .The sea level along the Fujian coast was rising when people of the low layer of Tanshishan site lived . They made their living mostly by collecting plants , hunting and fishing for the shellfishes in Minjiang River and they had began to fishing for marine products sometime . They had to move frequently to ensure getting enough food so that their settlement pattern was unsteady. The act in a small amount and the tie between them was rather loose .The declining incident of climate in about 4000B.C. might be one of the reasons than result in the interval between the low and the middle layer .Around 4000B.C. , the sea level along Fujian coast achieved its climax and began to ebbing after then . From 4000B.P. to 3300B.P. , people of the middle layer of Tanshishan site built up planed hamlet and marine shellfish played a marked role in their recipes . The plenty of nature resource and the situation of residence assured the scale extending of the settlement and the rising of the population .In the later phase of the middle layer , equal of the members in property and status was broken . Private ownership and class constrict sprung .From 3300B.C. to 2700B.P. , sea water rapidly ebbed out of the Fuzhou Plain , marine shellfish were no more obtained .The resident of the upper layer of Tanshishan site again put stress on hunting and collecting ,but the deteriorated nature could not afford the increased population . People chose to quit their way of life and merge with people emigrated from Zhejiang and Jiangxi instead of immigranting themselves . Influenced by advanced culture outside , the area of Tanshishan also progressed into slavery

AB  - With the rapid expansion of China's cities since the 1978 economic reform, more and more villages have been swallowed up by urban sprawl. The retention of collective land ownership in chengzhongcun has, on the one hand, made low-rent housing affordable for migrants; on the other hand, however, it has exposed chengzhongcun to many social, economic and environmental problems. Based on a case study of chengzhongcun in Guangzhou, and using an analytical framework of property rights, this article has found that maintaining collective land ownership in chengzhongcun has been socially and economically costly, but a redevelopment strategy without a complementary affordable housing scheme may be problematic. In order to solve the problems of chengzhongcun, an institutional reform of collective land is required.

AB  - This article analyses the sentencing judgment issued on 11 January 2007 by the Ethiopian Federal High Court in the case of Mengistu Hailemariam and his co-accused who had been tried, among others, on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity. This was the first African trial where an entire regime was brought to justice before a national court for atrocities committed while in power. Twenty-five of the 55 accused found guilty, including Mengistu, were tried in absentia (Mengistu remains in exile in Zimbabwe). The trial took 12 years, making it one of the longest ever trials for genocide. In December 2006, Mengistu was convicted by majority vote of genocide and crimes against humanity pursuant to Article 281 of the 1957 Ethiopian Penal Code, which includes 'political groups' among the groups protected against genocide. A dissenting judge took the position that the accused should have been convicted of aggravated homicide because the relevant part of the provision had been repealed. A few weeks later, the Court, by majority, sentenced the top tier of the accused to life imprisonment, taking into account certain extenuating circumstances. If not for these, the death penalty would have been imposed. In addition to ensuring some accountability, the judgment is important for providing an official and detailed account of what happened in those years in Ethiopia under Mengistu's reign. Given that in Ethiopia there are no official gazettes where court judgments are published, it is unlikely that the public will be able to read the judgment and thus become aware of what had happened. In addition to analysing the reasoning of the court, this article also looks into the prevailing political circumstances in the country and reflects upon the trial and the reception that this important decision has had, and will receive, in the wider community.

AB  - Taking the issue of immigration in France as the entry point to a discussion of law and order, this essay examines what this focus on law and order masks: the manner in which law, in certain critical realms, operates according to the logic of exception, rather than as a regime of normative justice based on general rules and rights. Joining the renewed debate on Carl Schmitt's political theories while rejecting his larger political project, I suggest that the significance of this point is not primarily legal, but political. I locate my argument in the context of changing notions of both sovereignty and political power, suggesting that the situation in France constitutes just one instance of a larger struggle over sovereign power by national and transnational institutions. I focus on two specific and complementary spaces of what I have called `juridical indeterminacy', each of which illustrates the enactment of this differently configured rule of law. These are policing and humanitarianism. In particular, I examine the policing of prostitutes, the phenomenon of detention centres, the Refugee Appeals Commission, and a humanitarian clause for undocumented immigrants who are gravely ill, to suggest that policing and humanitarianism represent two sides of the same coin - two essential elements of a moral economy in which law as a regime of systematic justice is not central, and where a democratic political realm has been displaced in favour of a regime of sovereign exceptions. Ultimately, this essay suggests that this logic of exceptionalism creates and privileges non-rights-bearing, apolitical, non-agentive victims. The underlying goal therefore is to point instead to the need for a more radical political project, one that sees a degree of legal regularity and predictability necessary to achieve the autonomous political action of a democratic society.

AB  - Despite the region's reputation for ethnic and religious tolerance, the Middle Colonies served as the setting for debates about cultural integrity, ethnic superiority, and enforced assimilation. Throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, authorities fretted over the presence of non-English inhabitants. For their part, German and Dutch settlers resisted absorption into an Anglicized mainstream, establishing enclaves of cultural continuity such as churches and congregations. The resolution of this cultural standoff has generally been depicted as a gradual capitulation of non-English tradition to Anglo-American ways. However, the cultural adaptation of non-English immigrants to the New World may best be described as a series of overlapping processes, all involving the careful reworking of continental European customs: while settlers may have assumed apparently English manners in some areas of their lives, in others they retained their Dutch and German traditions. Institutional pressures and economic considerations prompted fairly quick adaptive measures, seen in such public acts as the adoption of oaths of allegiance and naturalization. In contrast, spiritual and sentimental connections to Europe, expressed by church affiliation and language retention, lingered through the very end of the eighteenth century. Certain traditions, then, proved more immediately responsive to the environment. The experience of Dutch and Germans in the Middle Colonies should suggest that the manner in which settlers adapted to life in the New World was inspired by a multitude of objectives. Even in areas where immigrant traditions were modified, however, such alterations in Old World practice should not be taken as evidence of Anglicized behavior. To a large degree, cultural adaptation in the Middle Colonies was reflective of a struggle to transplant Old World customs and attitudes to a setting neither structurally similar nor institutionally conducive to such relocation. In the choices Middle Colonists made, one can detect attempts to rework their traditions, to preserve their essential nature. To settlers, the discarding of the original expression did not mean the loss of the original idea. Rather, they sought to relocate the meaning of their culture to a new setting, and thereby to infuse their ethnicity with new significance

AB  - Analysis of personal interviews from a sample of 42 Kashmiri Pandit families living in large community halls indicated the migration affected the intra- and interfamily interactions. In trying to keep their ethnic identity, they also had to adapt to their new environment. For the Kashmiri Pandits the sense of being uprooted was felt very strongly as there was a complete change in ecology and loss of status, property, and prestige. The community had taken over the role of socialization. The younger children (4-11 years) expressed enjoyment of communal living more than the older group (12-18 years). Children reported being closer to their mothers. Incidence of child abuse was reported as higher since migration. Girls disliked camp living more than boys. Most of the children were performing above average at school. Children preferred to speak in their native language at home

AB  - This study traces the career of Rossoni from 1903, when he first appeared as a labor organizer operating within the ranks of revolutionary syndicalism until 1928 when he was fired as head of the Fascist unions. After five years of constant labor agitation Rossoni fled Italy in 1908 in order to escape imprisonment. After a brief stay in France Rossoni went to Brazil where he remained nearly one year organizing Italian immigrant workers. His labor militancy led to his expulsion from Brazil at the end of 1909. Shortly thereafter Rossoni emigrated to the United States (1910-1916) where his observation of the abominable manner in which Italian workers were treated by their fellow "proletarians," both American and foreign, led to a complete rejection of the revolutionary syndicalist tenet of international proletarian solidarity. By 1914, while still in the United States, Rossoni had become a staunch nationalist. He demanded Italy's immediate entry into World War I on the Allied side and, in mid-1916, returned to Italy in order to fulfill his military obligations. Two years later Rossoni was instrumental in the founding of the Unione Italiana del Lavoro, a labor union based on the precepts of "national" revolutionary syndicalism. He continued his militant labor agitation until, in early 1922, Rossoni emerged as the secretary general of the Fascist union confederation. Rossoni was convinced that he could improve the conditions of the Italian working-class within the context of a Fascist Italy. However as the 1920's progressed Fascism as movement slowly gave way to Fascism as regime with a consequent diminution in the influence of the Fascist left. Rossoni's militant defense of labor interests became an embarrassment to Mussolini who was more concerned with placating the representatives of Italian capital. In 1928 Rossoni was ousted from his position as Fascist labor leader, a victim of the regime's increasing conservatism

AB  - This thesis examines the unusually enduring retention of ethnic culture by the Walloon Belgian immigrants who settled in northeastern Wisconsin between 1853 and 1857, as well as the combination of circumstances which enabled this ethnic island to form and continue, well into the twenty-first century. A review of the historiography focusing on European immigrants to the United States from the post-revolutionary period to the present reveals an emphasis on urban settlement and the assumed inevitability of the weakening of ethnic identity. Less attention has been given those immigrants settling in rural areas and even less to those few rural immigrant groups who were able to retain their ethnic culture and identity for several generations. A more complete understanding of the immigrant experience requires closer research into the circumstances experienced by unusual groups such as the Walloons. Data used have come from a variety of sources, both primary and secondary. Primary sources include letters from Walloon immigrants to relatives still in Wallonia, letters from missionary priests working in the settlement area, Belgian Consul reports, newspaper articles, census data, ownership maps, school records, and the firsthand accounts written by immigrants themselves. Secondary sources include not only the work of historians, but also that of Cultural Geographers, Social Scientists, Anthropologists, and theologians resulting in a variation of focus and perspective. Research shows a specific combination of circumstances, not often occurring together, resulted in the successful continuation of the ethnic island formed by the Walloons. The addition of these research results to the study of immigration adds new insight to understanding the immigration experience

AB  - Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is a rare genetic disorder with late-onset progressive myopathy affecting mainly head and neck striated muscles. It is more common in certain ethnic communities. Dysphagia was usually attributed to the malfunction of striated pharyngeal muscles. We studied a group of Bukharan immigrants affected by this disorder (N = 13). Esophageal studies, including endoscopy, manometry, and scintigraphic emptying were performed. Very low pharyngeal pressures were measured. Upper esophageal pressures (UEP) were in the normal range in eight patients, and above normal in three patients. Four also had low lower esophageal sphincter pressure. Esophageal body peristaltic activity was grossly impaired in all patients: mainly nonpropulsive, simultaneous, retrograde, and failed activity was recorded. Marked retention of isotopic material was demonstrated in all patients studied, usually in the middle and lower parts of the body, ranging from 17 to 100% retention. The dysphagia in OPMD is due not only to dysfunction of pharyngeal and upper esophageal striated muscle, but also has a significant smooth muscle component

He gained his nickname, which means tooth-puller, working as a healer in his youth. He later became an army officer. In the late 1780s he joined and soon became the leader of the InconfidǦncia Mineira, a movement against Portuguese rule and for revolutionary democracy in Brazil that was inspired by the American Revolution and was based in Vila Rica (now Ouro PrǦto). In 1789 the movement was betrayed and its leaders were imprisoned. They were freed and exiled in 1792 with the exception of Tiradentes, who was executed in Rio de Janeiro.

AB  - The growing number of people seeking asylum in the Netherlands compromises the provision of adequate medical services to all. This development may have a negative impact on refugee children especially. International literature indicates that many children, especially the ones coming from tropical areas or the ones who resided in refugee camps, are suffering from diseases such as tuberculosis, hepatitis B, anaemia, parasitic diseases, caries, malnutrition, hearing and seeing impairments. Many children have psychosocial problems due to traumatic experiences in their country of origin and/or during their flight. These problems lead to a diversity of complaints such as difficulty to sleep, enuresis, feeding problems and hyperactivity. Both the somatic and the psychosocial problems may impede the growth and development of these children. It is therefore imperative to identify the children at risk and to formulate guidelines for providing medical care to refugee children. Special care should also be given to the housing, the living conditions and the provision of specialised personnel and to limiting the duration of the asylum procedure in the case of families with children and other minors

It notes that the national policy was endorsed in 1982 when rapid population growth posed challenges to people's standard of living, health care and employment. Arguments for the abolition include China's low birth rate with annual new births at 15 million compared to 25 million in 1988, an aging population, and shortage of young, migrant labor. Arguments for retention include suitability to the country's conditions that have allowed China to prosper

AB  - In May 1955, the local Ulm newspapers reported on a curious lawsuit brought before the labor court. Earlier that year, authorities had forced the director of the nearby refugee camp to resign upon learning that he had been an SS officer under the Nazi regime. Now the former Nazi, Bernhard Fischer-Schweder, felt he had been unfairly victimized by the regional government and was suing to be reinstated to his post. Far from solving this perceived injustice, the lawsuit instead signaled the end of Fischer-Schweder's postwar rise from door-to-door vacuum cleaner salesman to prominent director of a displaced persons camp. In the coming weeks, he lost his lawsuit and, more seriously, allegations regarding his Nazi past surfaced. Once authorities began to investigate, they uncovered a broader web of entanglement, and three years later the case culminated in Fischer-Schweder's conviction along with nine other defendants in one of the largest Nazi trials put before West German courts, the so-called Ulm Einsatzkommando trial of 1958. Although most scholarship has focused on the legacy of this trial, this article looks at the unusual origins and escalation of the case in order to draw attention to the trial's complex but overlooked relationship with postwar political and social attitudes toward the Nazi past.

AB  - (from the book) This chapter describes patterns of escape or retreat associated with unsuccessful or clumsy acting-out behavior. To cope effectively, one must first face one's problems and decide what to do about them. Reacting to challenges by running from them is a dereliction of appraisal, which is the first step in coping transactions. It can also be dysfunctional behavior and, in some settings, such as prisons, it can be a transgression of rules that prescribe participation.

AB  - This article is the second in a series of several by members of the Committee on the Control of Foodborne Illness of the International Association of Food Protection, and it continues the analysis of 816 outbreaks where food workers were implicated in the spread of foodborne disease. In this article, we discuss case morbidity and mortality and the settings where the 816 outbreaks occurred. Some of the outbreaks were very large; 11 involved more than 1,000 persons, 4 with more than 3,000 ill. The larger outbreaks tended to be extended over several days with a continuing source of infections, such as at festivals, resorts, and community events, or the contaminated product had been shipped to a large number of customers, e.g., icing on cakes or exported raspberries. There were five outbreaks with more than 100 persons hospitalized, with rates ranging from 9.9 to 100%. However, overall, the hospitalization rate was low (1.4%), and deaths were rare (0.11% of the 80,682 cases). Many of the deaths were associated with high-risk persons (i.e., those who had underlying diseases, malnutrition, or both, as in a refugee camp, or young children), but a few occurred with apparently healthy adults. An analysis of the settings for the food worker-related events showed that most of the outbreaks came from food service facilities (376 outbreaks [46.1%]), followed by catered events (126 outbreaks [15.4%]), the home (83 outbreaks [10.2%]), schools and day care centers (49 [6.0%]), and health care institutions (43 outbreaks [5.3%]). However, many cases resulted from relatively few outbreaks (<30 each) associated with community events (9,726), processing plants (8,580), mobile/temporary service (5,367), and camps/ armed forces (5,117). The single most frequently reported setting was restaurants, with 324 outbreaks and 16,938 cases. Improper hygienic practices in homes, on picnics, or at community events accounted for 89 of the 816 outbreaks. There were 18 outbreaks associated with commercial travel in air flights, trains, and cruise ships over several decades, although only the last seems to be a major concern today. Sixteen outbreaks occurred where food, primarily produce, was harvested and shipped from one country to another. Sometimes the presence of an infected worker preparing food was only one of several factors contributing to the outbreak.

AB  - Hundreds of millions of people cross borders annually, traveling and migrating for work or school, for family reasons, or to flee persecution or natural disasters. Migrants often face discrimination, language and cultural barriers, and other obstacles to health care, but those who are living with HIV face even greater problems: they can be denied legal entry, turned away from care, and deported because of their infection. Discrimination, Denial, and Deportation: Human Rights Abuses Affecting Migrants Living with HIV identifies how violations of international law threaten both the lives of HIV-positive migrants and their families, and the goals of universal access to prevention and treatment that governments have pledged. Governments worldwide should immediately eliminate HIV-related restrictions on entry, stay and residence, and remove discriminatory barriers to access to HIV prevention and treatment services for internal and international migrants. Individuals in detention awaiting deportation need to be provided with access to care and treatment. Governments must ensure that individuals previously receiving antiretroviral therapy are able to maintain access to treatment in detention and take steps to facilitate continuity of treatment upon deportation

AB  - This thesis argues that the elite and urban women leaders of the Palestinian women's movement neglected to engage rural women and women living in refugee camps as their equals in a women's movement. Further, despite women's active presence in the public sphere, the sphere remained defined in masculine terms. As a result, Palestinian women, as "guests" in the domain of men, were easily pushed out after they had served their purpose in the nationalist crisis. What is remarkable is that even after Palestinian men reclaimed the public sphere, Palestinian women remained politically active in the private sphere. In order to understand how this was possible, we must look more closely at the terms "public sphere" and "private sphere"

AB  - Human rights law groups began a major policymaking initiative in the 1980's to persuade U.S. courts that new international norms have binding legal effect. Since the 1950's the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the American Civil Liberties Union, and environmental and consumer public law interest groups have successfully used litigation to change government policy on racial segregation, prisoners' rights, conservation, and product liability. Human rights advocates had no such success until the 1980's, when several Federal courts made unprecedented decisions based on international law. The human rights attorneys raising international law claims in domestic courts have a major policy goal: to make the rule of international law directly enforceable by individuals against government officials in domestic courts. Human rights attorneys have both won and lost major cases on alien tort claims, refugee detention, and asylum and deportation procedures. The conflicting results reached in cases that could go either way reveal four significant factors that contribute to successful litigation: congressional authorization, executive approval, vulnerable defendants, and responsive judges. 92 notes

AB  - Background There is strong evidence that the rates of psychiatric admission for psychosis in the UK are elevated for the Black adult population compared with the White population. Black adults also have a higher rate of involuntary psychiatric admissions. There have been no studies in this country investigating links between ethnic background and psychiatric admission in the adolescent population. Aims To investigate whether Black compared with White adolescents from London are overrepresented in psychiatric in-patient settings and whether they are more likely to be detained under the Mental Health Act 1983. Method Cross-sectional survey of London adolescents aged 13-17 years, who were in-patients in psychiatric units. Results Adolescents from the Black group (Black African, Black Caribbean, Black British) were overrepresented among those admitted with a diagnosis of a psychotic disorder when compared with adolescents from the White group (White British, White Irish, White Other): odds ratio=3.7,95% CI 2.0-6.7.They were also more likely to be detained on admission and more likely to be born outside the UK and have refugee background. Conclusions The possible impact of various background factors influencing admission is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB  - Sources of data included national questionnaire surveys, information supplied by governments, and information collected by nongovernmental organizations. Countries studied included Austria, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Columbia, Costa Rica, Denmark, England and Wales, West Germany, France, India, Jamaica, Japan, Morocco, Netherlands, Nigeria, Pakistan, Romania, Scotland, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, Thailand, the United States, Israel (West Bank), Yugoslavia, and Zaire. While the scope and focus of the national surveys varied from country to country, some form of incarceration of children in adult penal facilities was found to occur internationally. Incarcerated children included homeless and abandoned children, offspring of incarcerated offenders, child refugees, and those in political internment camps. From a children's rights perspective, these findings are examined in terms of (1) delinquency prevention and the criminalization of children and (2) standards for the protection of children within the criminal justice system (in custody, court, and prison), including minimum age legislation to protect children and international minimum standards for the treatment of children. Special attention also is given to the political victimization of children and to the plight of the offspring of female offenders. Finally, mechanisms for monitoring prison conditions and for protecting children from institutional abuses are examined and alternatives to child imprisonment are reviewed. Country-by-country summaries of the survey results are provided. Index

AB  - An agreement was concluded on 24.02.1941 between the University of Edinburgh and the Polish Government in Exile in London that brought into being the Polish School of Medicine at the University of Edinburgh. The School was intended for soldier-students in the Polish Forces in Gr. Britain. This agreement was meant for the time of war. With the end of the war a number of medical student-soldiers liberated from the German prisoner of war camps, applied to the Polish Medical School at the University of Edinburgh. In accord with the agreement the University discontinued the official admission of new students to the Polish School in Edinburgh. The students, numbering 37, who could not be admitted as regular students, were given facilities by Professor Jurasz, the Dean of the Polish School, to carry on their studies at the Polish Paderewski Hospital in Edinburgh (at the Western General Hospital). Thus there came into being two Schools: one regular, authorized Polish School of Medicine within the University, and the other, an unofficial School at the Paderewski Hospital, undertaking the teaching of students but with no power to grant a medical qualification. The teachers attached to the official Polish Medical School in Edinburg co-operated in the instruction of the students of the unofficial School. Nearly 20 of the 4th and 5th year students finished their courses and passed their examinations. Each of them was given a certificate that he had concluded his medical studies and had passed all the examinations which were necessary in Poland to obtain a medical diploma. A number of those who obtained the certificate applied to the Conjoint Examining Board in London and succeeded in obtaining the diploma L.R.C.P. London and M.R.C.S. England, and the licence to practice from the General Medical Council. A few third year students studied and obtained the degree at the Universities of England, Ireland and Canada; and some returned to Poland. A few settled in the U.S.A. and in South America. The unofficial School was active for two years

AB  - Previous studies of the left have tended to focus on groups or movements within the confines of national boundaries. Yet the adherents of these organizations were often migrants who traveled to and lived in multiple states. The Italian anarchist movement emerged during the latter half of the nineteenth century during the process of that country's unification.

AB  - Previous studies of the left have tended to focus on groups or movements within the confines of national boundaries. Yet the adherents of these organizations were often migrants who traveled to and lived in multiple states. The Italian anarchist movement emerged during the latter half of the nineteenth century during the process of that country�_Ts unification. As the need for cheap labour in the industrializing nations of north-western Europe and North and South America grew, a mass exodus of migrants left Italy. Among those migrants were anarchists who established networks that spanned continents and the Atlantic Ocean. Wherever Italian anarchists settled they began to publish journals, engage in anarchist activism, and re-create the radical culture that had its roots in Italy. This dissertation examines a portion of the transnational anarchist movement that existed in Canada and the United States between 1915 and 1940. The themes explored in this work include the formation of these transnational anarchist networks, the divisions within the Italian anarchist movement and their repercussions, how transnational activism was conducted, and the culture these transnational radicals created.

AB  - This study investigates contestations over spatiality in one culturally composite nation, Australia, where contemporary theatre stages competing cultural and political agendas through space and place. Covering a wide range of plays it will have wide appeal for issues of space, spatiality and territory in all forms of theatre, in all nations. Unsettling Space combines a study of Australian theatre since 1979 with the spatial politics that structure Australian cultural identity. Proposing a highly original theoretical framework for analyzing drama (not just in Australia, but across the world), this fascinating study examines the anxieties that emerge from contested spatiality. Theatre draws attention to 'unsettlement' in Australia, the disruptive process by which 'settlement' took place. Unsettlement emerges in recurring anxieties regarding the difficulties in settling the landscape, Aboriginal dispossession, and/or fears of invasion. Rather than reading theatre chronologically or geographically, Unsettling Space focuses on monuments, contamination and borders. Staged monuments have the potential to destabilise a culture's symbolic memory by exploring absence and loss, in addition to their role as placeholders for sanctioned history. Including chapters on 'contamination' (in the form of asylum seekers in Australian detention centres, or theatrical investigations of nuclear fallout in Maralinga) and an exploration of how 'identity spaces' are established and reworked in theatre to productively reinterpret history and politics, Joanne Tompkins' study uses the Australian context as a basis for constructing analytical frames which can be usefully applied to other countries and cultures

AB  - This study profiles 127 cases of Vietnamese, Cambodian, Laotian and Chinese refugee outpatients diagnosed with PTSD. Traumatic etiologies included victims of wars such as political refugees, concentration camp prisoners and victims of rape, severe personal losses (property or human lives). These traumata were experienced by our subjects during the period between the end of the Vietnam war in April 1975 and recent times, when they finally arrived in the USA. Clinical symptoms of these subjects reflected many influences of their oriental culture background and are characterized by internalization that needs to be overcome for assessment as well as for therapy. Symptomatic treatment with psychopharmacology and supportive therapy are helpful while cultural approaches have been adopted by many patients to reach the inner self pathology that could be of both mental and organic in nature. These facts need to be taken into consideration in the future description of the PTSD clinical picture. Recommendations are made for future PTSD studies in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, and to promote a global movement for prevention of any socio-political situation that may generate PTSD.

AB  - West Indians have lived in North America since the arrival of Black people in the Americas. After slavery was abolished many of them voluntarily moved to the United States. The largest numbers came in the 1920s, and 1970s, but throughout the period a quiet immigration continued to take place. West Indians lived in all the major cities of the East Coast, but the majority settled in New York City. The migrants created societies within the confines of the larger native Black community. The study uses migrants from St. Vincent living in New York to show how a culture of migration developed from the time of emancipation in 1838, to the coming of independence in 1979. The life styles and patterns of adjustment in New York were largely conditioned by the "migration ethic" which had developed on the island. During this period, the government and people of St. Vincent created a society which accepted emigration as perhaps the most viable means of economic survival. Furthermore, the social structure, educational system, and political activities, all played a role in encouraging emigration. The habit became so entrenched, that emigration became the norm, and staying at home, almost a sign of failure. Physical departure from the island did not result in severed ties. Conditions in the Caribbean continued to affect the way in which the migrants adjusted to American society. Unlike some other ethnic groups, the Vincentian migrants in New York created a life style, and institutions which took their cue from the society they left behind. Their voluntary organizations ignored the situation in the host society, and concentrated on the development of their homeland. This response was partly a reaction to the deprived political, and social position of native Blacks, and partly a result of the efforts of people left at home. Rather than strive to enter a society where they would decline in status, Caribbean migrants found their identities in the societies they left behind. Their continued emphasis on home perpetuated the stream of emigration from the island, by reminding those left behind of the advantages of migrant life

AB  - This dissertation explores Fanny Fern's literary position and her role as a social critic of American lives and attitudes in the nineteenth-century. A reexamination of Fern's literary and non-literary works sheds light on her firm stand for the betterment of all mankind. The diversity and multiplicity of Fern's social criticism and her social reform attitudes, evident in Ruth Hall, Rose Clark, and in voluminous newspaper articles, not only prove her concern for society's well-being, but also reflect her development of and commitment to her writing career. Chapter one concentrates on the social background in nineteenth-century America with regard to conventional women's roles and status, education, health, religious beliefs, job opportunities for women, men, and immigrants, racism, and abolitionism that led to the Civil War. It also focuses on Fern's emergence as a novelist and columnist, her reception, and her immediate faded fame after her death. Chapter two shows Fern's gradual, but persistent revolt against what Barbara Welter defines as "The Cult of True Womanhood." It traces Fern's development and growth of her ideas in relation to her attitudes toward women's roles and status, her denigration of the romantic notion of marriage and the revered picture of the husband, and her rebellion against the "virtue" of submissiveness. Chapter three examines Fern's strong support of equal opportunities for women's higher education, financial independence, the right to vote, and the acceptance of "the new woman." Chapter four emphasizes Fern's advocacy of children's rights and individuality. It illustrates Fern's concern for their education, health, manners, and religious knowledge. Chapter five analyzes Fern's attitude toward religious practices with regard to the hypocrisy of churches, ministers, and parishioners. It also shows Fern's concern for the less fortunate: the poor, prisoners, and fallen women, and her agitation for improved conditions. I conclude that Fanny Fern is primarily a social critic who firmly stands for such good causes as Women's Rights, women's education, and equal opportunities for all regardless of sex, class, and race

AB  - The grassland earless dragon (Tympanocryptis pinguicolla) is a habitat specialist restricted to the highly fragmented native temperate grasslands of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and nearby New South Wales (NSW). These grasslands, which are listed as an endangered ecological community, continue to be affected by a range of processes including development and overgrazing. Although changes to its habitat present a significant threat to the grassland earless dragon, little is known about its spatial and habitat requirements. We used radio-tracking to study the home-range areas and habitat requirements of 10 adult lizards in native grassland adjacent to Canberra, ACT. We found that burrows excavated by arthropods are an important resource for grassland earless dragons, with individuals having one or two home burrows around which they maintained home ranges of between 925m2and 4768m2. Fidelity to these burrows increased with the onset of winter, indicating their importance as over-winter refuge sites. Within the native grasslands, grassland earless dragons were found to use a broad range of grassland structure as habitat. This result contrasts with the prevailing view that these dragons are confined to well drained, minimally disturbed areas, which include large patches of short grass dominated by Austrodanthonia. We conclude that habitat management (i.e. grazing, mowing, burning) for this species should aim to retain structural heterogeneity of native grasslands rather than impose a uniform structure.

AB  - The discussion notes that members of some disadvantaged minority groups in every Western country are disproportionately likely to be arrested, convicted, and imprisoned for violent, priority, and drug crimes. In addition, important social policy dilemmas that are regarded in individual countries as uniquely their own are actually variations on common themes of social structure that characterize many countries. The discussion focuses on the difficulties involved in researching these issues; racial and ethnic differences in offending, victimization, and system processing in individual countries; research findings relating to immigration and crime; and recommendations on how future comparative research might advance understanding and policymaking. It concludes that research needs to move beyond analyses of single countries to combine findings from different countries and provide policymakers with the information they need to anticipate and work to prevent or reduce the kinds of problems that particular kinds of migrant groups are likely to experience. 54 references

AB  - Research findings show that in developed countries where some ethnic groups are substantially less successful than the majority population, there are bias, disparities, and disparate-impact policy dilemmas endemic to these societies. On the basis of the experiences of Western European immigrants to Canada and the United States early in the 20th century, it has often been asserted that first-generation immigrants are typically more law-abiding than residents, with higher crime and imprisonment rates in later generations. To some extent, contemporary research has validated this traditional model; however, recent research has shown this model to be simplistic and only partially accurate. One reason is that self-selected economic migrants from many Asian cultures have lower crime rates than the resident population in the first and later generations. The traditional model does not account for many groups deriving directly and sometimes indirectly from South and East Asia. A second reason is that this model does not sufficiently take into account the cultural differences between groups that differentially affect adaptation. Third, the model does not adequately account for differences in receiving countries' social welfare (and settlement) policies. Research in Sweden, for example, shows that Swedish social welfare has reduced the 'second-generation effect.' Fourth, why groups migrate powerfully shapes criminality and indications of successful adaptation; and fifth, the traditional model does not describe the experiences of many immigrant groups that have economic or social characteristics that fundamentally shape predicted criminality. The next step for research is suggested

AB  - A review of mortality data from refugee camps in Thailand (1979-80), Somalia (1980-85), and Sudan (1984-85) indicates that crude mortality rates (CMRs) were up to 40 times higher than those for the non-refugee populations in the host countries. In eastern Sudan, approximately 5% of the population of eight camps died in the first 3 months of the emergency and daily CMRs as high as 14 per 10 000 were reported. These rates dropped to values comparable with those of the host country within 6 weeks in the Thai camps; however, in Somalia and Sudan this process took 12 months. Mortality rates among under-5-year olds in the early phases, which were as high as 32.6 per 10 000 per day, are six times greater than those in the world's least developed countries during non-emergency times. Among severely undernourished children in one camp in Sudan, the death rate reached 114 per 10 000 per day. Acute respiratory infections, diarrhoeal diseases, malaria, measles, and undernutrition were the causes of most reported deaths, the majority of which could have been prevented by adequate food rations, clean water, measles immunization, and an oral rehydration programme

AB  - Outbreaks of measles continue to be a common occurrence among refugee and famine-affected children in emergency relief camps. Extremely high measles-associated mortality rates have been reported from refugee camps--where undernutrition is common--in several countries over the past 10 years. Mortality from measles is, however, preventable, and immunization against the disease is a high priority in emergency relief programmes, second only in importance to the provision of adequate food rations. All children aged 6 months to 5 years should be immunized with measles vaccine as soon as they enter an organized camp or settlement. Should supplies of measles vaccine be inadequate, children in feeding centres, or those otherwise identified as undernourished, are the top priority for immunization. The occurrence of measles in a camp is not a contraindication to conducting an immunization campaign. Strong coordination by a designated lead agency is needed if such campaigns are to be successful; however, cooperation with the local expanded programme on immunization is essential to ensure that existing cold chain equipment, training protocols, and management manuals are used. If additional equipment is necessary, a complete immunization kit developed by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the World Health Organization, and Oxfam can be procured from Oxfam headquarters in the United Kingdom. Vitamin A supplements should be given routinely at the time of measles immunization in situations where malnutrition is severe. Mortality and morbidity in children with clinical measles can be reduced by administering high doses of vitamin A

AB  - This dissertation focuses on the nexus between political and social history in the lives of Italian-American syndicalists in the early twentieth century. My analysis of debates, both within the Italian Socialist Federation, the central vehicle for Italian immigrant radicalism in the years before World War I, and among those leading members who later left the organization--on strategy and ideology, on gender, race, and regional differences, and on the relevance of continuing ties to Italy--sheds light on the process by which political and cultural identities are repeatedly constructed and reconstructed. Methodologically, I examine Italian-American syndicalists and their ideology in a transnational context, exploring their political activism both in the United States and in Italy. Using Italian-language newspapers, essays and correspondence from archives in both countries, I analyze the relationship of these radicals to their homeland on a number of levels: in terms of cultural retention; their reaction to events in their country of origin; their exchanges of philosophical and strategic advice with radicals in Italy; and their physical movement back and forth between countries. The importance of the continuing and complex connections between an ethnic group and its homeland is just beginning to receive attention from immigrant historians. The assumption underpinning much of the current work in this field is that both the culture of origin and the mainstream United States culture were static entities. I show instead that there was an ongoing dynamic interplay between the cultures, and identify how this interplay shaped immigrant identity in continually shifting ways. I also suggest ways in which working-class and radical history in the United States need to be revised. This study complements and extends the work done by scholars on the "new unionism" and on ethnic radicalism in two ways. First, it emphasizes the centrality of Italian-American syndicalists in the prewar labor and radical movements, specifically in the struggles waged by the Industrial Workers of the World. Second, it traces the enduring influence of immigrant syndicalism in mainstream unions like the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America after the end of World War I and the demise of the IWW

AB  - Up to December 2002, a total of 56, 566 and 109 cases of human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-I), HTLV-II and human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) infection, respectively, were identified in Spain. Most HTLV-I- and HIV-2-infected subjects were immigrants from endemic areas or Spaniards who had traveled to, or had sexual contacts with natives from, these areas. In contrast, HTLV-II infection was mainly limited to Spanish intravenous drug users (IDU) who were frequently coinfected with HIV-1. Among HTLV-I-infected patients, 12 developed subacute myelopathy and 4 adult T-cell leukemia. As for the HIV-2-positive subjects, only 20 (18.3%) developed AIDS. There was no evidence of an increase in the incidence of HIV-2 and HTLV-I infections over time. In contrast, HTLV-II infection has spread in recent years among the HIV-1-positive IDU population in prisons, with a rate of 18% in some regions of Spain. Nevertheless, the prevalence of HTLV-II infection in HIV-1-positive IDU outpatients is still low (4.7%)

AB  - In 1959 a small group of Namibian workers organized a liberation movement, the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), to oppose South African illegal control of Namibia. This small group of leaders brought the "Namibian issue" to the international arena and established global support. SWAPO moved to secure assistance from countries on both sides of the Cold War arena, as well as from international organizations while it organized its armed wing, the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN), and established camps in neighboring countries to give shelter to its followers. In exile, SWAPO survived many setbacks and each time grew stronger. They built a leadership that did not allow opposition. The political organization was authoritarian and severely limited changes at the top, or any participation of the rank and file. Any attempt by the young people in the camps to participate in decision making, was considered rebellious. During 1975-1976 and during the 1980s, this attitude led to the repression of young leaders who wanted a say in the organization. This dissertation focuses on the building of the features of a democracy from a liberation movement. It argues that the party suffered an internal coup masterminded by a small group inside the leadership which led to a severe abuse of human rights. Once back home, when the country became independent in 1989 and SWAPO won the elections, their leaders adapted their authoritarian political behavior. The aim of this dissertation is to analyze the many obstacles SWAPO encountered on all fronts while it was abroad through the experiences of the leaders, freedom fighters and opponents who participated in the process. These included PLAN's war in northern Namibia against South Africa, SWAPO's internal organization of the refugees' camps in Angola and the constant reminder to the international organizations of the fairness of their fight. All this was done with an extreme concern for unity that became the unwavering ideal and an end in itself

AB  - The aim of the study was to compare torture victims from six different nations and analyse differences and similarities.From the files of the Centre for Trauma Victims in Stockholm (KTC), 160 patients were selected: 53 patients from Bangladesh, 21 from Iran, 16 from Peru, 24 from Syria, 25 from Turkey, and 21 from Uganda.The data was classified into: (i) information about social conditions and circumstances pertaining to alleged torture, (ii) type of trauma and torture methods, and (iii) acute and late sequel to torture. Descriptive and non-parametric statistics were used in the analyses.There was a strong male dominance in all but the Ugandan group where 43% were women. The majority in all but the Turkish group had college exams and/or university studies. Over 84% were members of a political organisation except in the Iranian and Syrian groups, where more than 40% had no political affiliation. The majority in all groups had travelled to Sweden alone to apply for asylum, but most refugees from Turkey, Iran, and Syria had close relatives already living in Sweden.The stories of circumstances and torture methods were similar within each group but differed a great deal between groups. Typically, in Bangladesh, Peru, and Turkey, the periods under arrest were short: from a few hours to 3 days. In Iran, Uganda, and Syria, the time in custody varied from several months to several years. A prison sentence preceded by trial was common only in Iran. Many patients, especially from Bangladesh and Turkey, had been arrested several times. Sensory deprivation by isolation and blindfolding was common in all countries except Uganda and Peru. Beating with fists, sticks, truncheons, etc. were reported in 100% in every group. In Bangladesh, police batons (lathi) were used more commonly than in any other group. Whipping with electric cords occurred frequently only in Iran and Syria. Rape was most often reported among the Ugandans. Genital torture was frequently alleged by patients .

AB  - With this study, we aimed to determine the different male ancestral components of two Native American communities from Argentina, namely Toba and Colla. The analysis of 27 Y-chromosome SNPs allowed us to identify seven different haplogroups in both samples. Chromosomes carrying the M3 mutation, which typically defines the Native American haplogroup Q1a3a, were seen most frequently in the Toba community (90%). Conversely, Q1a3a was represented in 34% of the Colla Y-chromosomes, whereas haplogroup R1b1, the main representative of western European populations, exhibited the highest frequency in this population (41%). Different M3 sublineages in the Toba community could be identified by observing point mutations at both DYS385 and M19 loci. A microvariant at DYS385, named 16.1, has been characterized, which helps to further subdivide Q1a3a. It is the first time the M19 mutated allele is described in a population from Argentina. This finding supports the old age of the lineages carrying the M19 mutation, but it contradicts the previous hypothesis that the M19 mutated allele is confined to only two Equatorial-Tucano population groups from the north region of South America. The detection of M19 further south than previously thought allows questioning of the hypothesis that this lineage serves as an example of isolation after colonization. This observation also affirms the strong genetic drift to which Native Americans have been subjected. Moreover, our study illustrates a heterogeneous contribution of Europeans to these populations and supports previous studies showing that most Native American groups were subjected to European admixture that primarily involved immigrant men.

AB  - Previous research on racial bias in the legal system has focused primarily on African American defendants to the exclusion of other racial/ethnic groups. One ethnic group, Hispanics, continues to represent a disproportionate number of incarcerated individuals in the United States prison system today, though it is underrepresented in the criminal justice literature. The purpose of the present study was to address the dearth of research involving Hispanics' interaction with the legal system using aversive racism as a likely explanation for these differences. Specifically, juror decision making bias was examined when defendant ethnicity (Hispanic or White), immigrant status (legal or illegal), and SES (low or upper middle class) were varied. Twohundred and eighty-four mock juror participants read a criminal court trial transcript and were randomly assigned to one of eight conditions in a 2 (Mexican or Canadian defendant) X 2 (immigrant status: legal or illegal) X 2 (SES: low or high) between-groups design. Dependent measures consisted of verdict (guilty or not guilty), sentencing (parole after 20 years, 30 years, or death by lethal injection), culpability, and defendant trait attributions. Based on an aversive racism explanation, low SES, illegal, Mexican defendants were more often found guilty, and more culpable, and were rated lower on a number of trait assessment measures compared with all other conditions. No significant differences were found for sentencing

AB  - This dissertation undertakes the examination of two embedded languages against a matrix language. It provides a comparative and sociolinguistic description of language contact phenomena among German and Hungarian speakers in the greater San Francisco Bay Area. The linguistic and biographical data were gathered by fieldwork. The study approaches the problem from an interdisciplinary angle, combining anthropological and linguistic frameworks, and is based on a questionnaire of 25 utterances elicited from twenty consultants of each language. In the larger contact-linguistic context of examining a particular stage in the attrition/loss process of these immigrant speakers who live in a non-native linguistic and cultural environment, my aim is to research how these two non-related languages react to the pressures of the matrix language English. Through the investigated differences and similarities in the structural transformation of German and Hungarian, new insights are offered about the behavioral characteristics of these languages in contact settings (chapters 3, 5 and 7). The fieldwork questionnaire focuses on the grammatical areas pragmatics, lexicon, morphology, and syntax. Phonetic information is not included. Chapters 3 and 5 taxonomically organize the changes that the structures of these languages undergo, and, in chapter 7, I contrast these results. This latter chapter also sheds light on features and properties that tend to be susceptible to change and loss, and points out those that are more resistant. In other words, the characteristic tendencies and dominant statistics are highlighted within the individual languages first, followed by an inter-linguistic comparison of the findings. Grammatical violations that are typical of the first vs. successive generations are summarized and illustrated in sections 3.3 and 5.3. Accordingly, emphasis is placed on the separation of bilingual vs. interlingual results. Chapter 7 confirms the hypothesis that those grammatical features of German and Hungarian that typically pose hurdles in language learning (such as German case and gender marking vs. Hungarian agglutination or subjective and objective conjugation) get lost early in the attrition/shift process. Chapters 3 and 5, and appendices B and C show that the recorded contact-linguistic phenomena result partly from attrition-related deterioration, and partly from English interference. In chapters 4 and 6, the biographical and sociolinguistic data of the participants are scrutinized, and those characteristics are stressed that support the grammatical data. Section 2.3 describes the bilingual and bicultural experience of the informants. It also examines whether, in the light of the attested linguistic demise, long-term language retention is a plausible prospect of expatriate speech communities that are widely confronted with the replacive role of English

AB  - Adolescent refugees in Quebec tend to have high risk for emotional disorders when separated from their parents or exposed to hunger and bad treatment in refugee camps before arrival to Canada. A father's unemployment is another important risk factor. Epidemiological data cannot generally confirm if immigration is made easier or not in a bicultural setting. We only know from this review that immigrants coming to Quebec enjoy a similar level of mental health as the host population. Refugees are the exception, but this is probably the case in many other countries.

AB  - Although poor immigrants were welcome in Canada as labourers, the famine in Ireland brought thousands of destitute and diseased newcomers during the summer of 1847. This extraordinarily large and diseased migration forced the Canadian government to provide the new arrivals with unprecedented medical and welfare facilities in order to protect the health and property of Canadians and to assist the immigrants to become self-supporting as quickly as possible. Once they recognized the extraordinary nature of the immigration, the government financed twenty-eight emergency relief Boards of Health in Upper Canada. The establishment of these relief agencies financed by the government but administered at the local level by community-appointed authorities created tensions. Both Toronto and Kingston authorities and the government designed relief to ensure their ability to control immigrant behavior in order to get them working as soon as possible and to reduce the number dependent upon charity. Through legislation and institutionalization, they used physical force, confinement and the limitation of relief to make the immigrants conform to prescribed codes of behavior.

AB  - This study investigates similarities and differences between Japanese Americans and Japanese Brasilians in ethnic identity, retention of Japanese values, conditions of assimilation, perceived feelings of discrimination, attitudes toward other ethnic groups, and other demographic characters. Major concerns are ethnic identity and assimilation. Previous studies of ethnic identity and assimilation suggested varieties of adjustment processes among immigrants. Both the United States and Brasil have similar and yet different historical backgrounds in race and ethnic relations. Historical comparisons of the Japanese migration process and their adjustments to the U.S. and Brasil show some differences. The data for the present study were obtained through a three-stage postal mail survey both in the U.S. and in Brasil. The exact same questions were asked in both countries. The total sample obtained from the U.S. was 433, and the total sample obtained from Brasil was 359. Analysis indicated that Japanese Brasilians maintain a stronger ethnic identity than Japanese Americans. The main factors for this were that Japanese Brasilians indicated less assimilation, and Japanese Brasilians, mothers were more likely to be either Japanese nationals or Japanese Brasilians. Both Japanese Americans and Japanese Brasilians maintained similar Japanese values; however factor analysis indicated that Japanese Brasilians emphasize more behavioral values. Japanese Americans feel more discrimination than Japanese Brasilians. Japanese Brasilians have a more favorable attitude toward Whites and Blacks than do Japanese Americans, but they also indicate some negative attitudes as well, especially toward Blacks. More Japanese Brasilians practiced Japanese customs, reported fluent Japanese usage, and frequently read ethnic newspapers. Case studies suggested that ethnic identity is socially constructed and that identity changes are based on individuals' life experiences and surrounding circumstances, whether they are Japanese Americans or Japanese Brasilians. Further assessment is suggested to determine whether Brasilian social structure and culture have some effects in maintaining stronger ethnic identity among Japanese Brasilians. Further assessment is suggested to determine whether Brasilian social structure and culture have some effects in maintaining stronger ethnic identity among Japanese Brasilians

AB  - The alteration in penal practices that occurred in Britain during the 18th and 19th centuries has long been a favorite topic among legal historians and theorists. The literature on penal transformations in this period, however, tends to focus on the transition from "scaffold to penitentiary." Penal exile - or "transportation" - is often ignored in the face of the more dramatic contrast between public execution and a national system of incarceration. The study of exile, as a punishment that spans (in a temporal, ideological, and institutional sense) the regimes of the "scaffold and the penitentiary" is central to illuminating intriguing questions of penal and social transformation. This paper is primarily concerned with how the practice of transportation "imagines" both the offender and the goals of punishment. Rather than treating transportation simply as an instrument states used to control crime, it looks at how the practice was interpreted and justified, and how it resonated with (and constituted) the community's system of social values and cultural expectations. Transportation, which occurred in two distinct phases, reveals a shift in understandings of the legitimate scope of techniques of public coercion and in the meaning of a "reformed" offender. ..PAT.-Unpublished Manuscript [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]Copyright of Conference Papers -- Law & Society is the property of Law & Society Association and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

AB  - Passerine birds migrating long distances arrive at stopover sites to refuel having lost as much as 50%of their initial body mass (mb) including significant losses to digestive organs that may serve as a reservoir of protein catabolised for fuel during flight. Birds newly arrived at a stopover show slow or no mb gain during the initial 2-3 days of a stopover, which suggests that energy assimilation may be limited by reduced digestive organs. Measurements of migrants and captive birds subjected to simulated migratory fasts have shown reductions in intestine mass, morphological changes to the mucosal epithelium, and reductions in food intake and assimilation rate upon initial refeeding. We found that blackcaps (Sylvia atricapilla, Linnaeus) newly arrived at a migratory stopover after crossing the Sahara and Sinai deserts had significantly increased paracellular nutrient absorption (non-carrier mediated uptake occurring across tight junctions between enterocytes) that may provide partial compensation for reduced digestive capacity resulting from changes to intestinal tissues. Indeed, newly arrived birds also had a slightly reduced capacity for absorption of a glucose analogue (3-O-methyl-D-glucose) transported simultaneously by both carrier-mediated and non-mediated mechanisms. Increased paracellular absorption coupled with extended digesta retention time may thus allow migratory blackcaps to maintain high digestive efficiency during initial stages of refuelling while digestive organs are rebuilt.

AB  - The factor structure and criterion validity of the English Language Acculturation Stress scale are evaluated in a sample of 300 elderly Russian immigrants who had lived in the USA for an average of seven years. The 11-item scale encompasses basic English skills, survival English skills and social involvement English skills. Correlation analysis of the scale with depression, physical health status and length of residence suggests that the scale has good criterion validity and potential as a screening instrument of language acculturation stress for this group of immigrants. Implications for research and social work practice are discussed.

AB  - Analyzing three waves of data from the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Survey, this article explores the process of language assimilation among second-generation Latinos. Although previous studies have focused on the shift from mother tongue to English across immigrant generations, few have examined change in language proficiency over time within the second generation. Results from a series of growth-curve models suggest three findings. First, both English and Spanish proficiency increased over time. Second, significant differences exist across Latino ethnic groups, with Mexicans being least proficient in English and most proficient in Spanish. Third, use of Spanish at home and in school has no effect on English acquisition, but significantly promotes Spanish retention. Overall, these findings lend support for the emergence of a new context for bilingualism. Adapted from the source document

AB  - This dissertation examines the relationship between Israel's counter-terrorist policy and the extent and intensity of terrorism in Israel. The time frame of the study is from 1968 to 1987. Israel's counter-terrorism policy has been characterized as an iron fist approach to terrorism because of a consistent use of three categories of repressive actions: military reprisals, collective punishment, and legal imprisonment. It has been suggested by a number of scholars that a repressive policy is the only way a government can combat terrorism. However, the evidence to date has not supported this claim, rather it indicates that repression increases rather than decreases terrorism. Because Israel has been consistent in its application of a repressive strategy, the policy of Israel was examined as a test of this assumption. The dissertation has revealed three major findings. First, military actions covary with the extent and intensity of terrorism. Second, the largest reduction of terrorism in Israel was caused by the Jordanian civil War. When Jordan exiled the leadership of the PLO and a bulk of PLO fighters to Lebanon, terrorism staged in Jordan completely disappeared. Moreover, even though the PLO was able to stage terrorism in Lebanon, the extent and intensity of this violence did not reach proportions similar to levels of terrorism originating in Jordan from 1968 to 1970. Lastly, Israel's indiscriminate application of military force and collective punishment has radicalized the Palestinian population on the West Bank and Gaza Strip and is thought to be an important cause of the Intifada that began in January of 1987

AB  - This dissertation is about the people living at the Buduburam Liberian refugee camp in Ghana and how they navigate their position within a social hierarchy that is negotiated on a global terrain. The lives of refugees living in Ghana are constituted through vast and complex social relations that span across the camp, Ghana, West Africa and nations further afield such as the United States, Canada and Australia. The conditions under which these relations have developed and continue to unfold are mediated by structural forces of nation-state policies, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the international governing body for refugees, and the global political economy. Situated within the broader politics of protracted refugee situations and the question of why people stay in long-term camps, this research is a case study of one refugee camp and how its people access resources, build livelihoods and struggle with power. In particular, this dissertation uses concepts of the Liberian-American dream and the shadow colony to explore the historic and contemporary terms and circumstances through which Liberian refugees experience and evaluate migratory prospects and restrictions

AB  - This Project Demonstrating Excellence consists of a contextual essay and a manual developed in response to people traumatized by Hurricane Mitch and political violence in Central America. The PDE investigated the issue: Body-mind-spirit practices promote the healing of traumatic stress in grassroots people. Research included a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods, including questionnaires, focus groups, and in-depth interviews. The problems addressed were the lack of resources for grassroots people affected by personal and communal trauma, and the lack of research regarding the use of holistic methods for healing trauma. Research was carried out in 1999 in Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Guatemala through pilot trainings with grassroots people affected by the trauma of Hurricane Mitch and years of political violence. Using methods of popular education, body-mind-spirit practices, such as Tai Chi, acupressure, visualization, and breathing exercises, were taught to grassroots; leaders as a way to release energy blocked by traumatic stress. Leaders in turn shared the practices with their communities as a way to empower people to take on their own healing process. Research findings from questionnaires supported the issue and showed a lessening of symptoms related to traumatic stress as a result of using body-mind-spirit practices. Findings from focus groups and in-depth interviews also supported the issue investigated and showed the value of specific practices with different kinds of populations. Leaders used the practices with a variety of people: indigenous, refugees, prisoners, youth, battered women and children, religious, and unionists. Based on the research, a manual was developed to serve as a popular education resource. The manual, following a holistic view of the person and the society, offers body-mind-spirit practices to promote and support the inherent healing capacity of the person and the community. The manual is not a treatment program, nor is it meant to replace one-on-one therapy where available for persons whose signs of trauma are severe. The manual can complement and support already existing community resources, cultural practices, and mental health programs. [Author Abstract]

AB  - Treason, legal term for various acts of disloyalty. The English law, first clearly stated in the Statute of Treasons (1350), originally distinguished high treason from petit (or petty) treason. Petit treason was the murder of one's lawful superior, e.g., murder of his master by an apprentice. High treason constituted a serious threat to the stability or continuity of the state. It included attempts to kill the king, the queen, or the heir apparent or to restrain their liberty; to counterfeit coinage or the royal seal; and to wage war against the kingdom. Especially cruel methods were used in executing traitors. Court decisions developed the English law of treason into an instrument for suppressing resistance to governmental policy. Any degree of violence in expressing opposition to parliamentary enactments was held to be a levy of war and a threat to the king's life. In the 19th cent., the English law was reformed; petit treason was abolished, cruel methods of executing traitors were forbidden, and many types of treason (e.g., counterfeiting) were made felonies that involved a lesser penalty than death. To avoid the abuses of the English law, treason was specifically defined in the U.S. Constitution (definitions of other crimes were not deemed necessary). Article 3 of the Constitution thus provides that treason shall consist only in levying war against the United States or in giving aid and comfort to its enemies and that conviction may be had only on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act or on confession in open court. There have been fewer than 40 federal prosecutions for treason and even fewer convictions. Several men were convicted of treason in connection with the Whiskey Rebellion (1794) but were pardoned by George Washington. The most famous treason trial, that of Aaron Burr in 1807, resulted in acquittal. Politically motivated attempts to convict opponents of the Jeffersonian Embargo Acts and the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 all failed. In the 20th cent., treason has become largely a wartime phenomenon, and the treason cases of World Wars I and II were of minor significance. Most states have provisions in their constitutions or statutes similar to those in the U.S. Constitution. There have been only two successful prosecutions for treason on the state level, that of Thomas Dorr in Rhode Island and that of John Brown in Virginia.

AB  - This book examines experiences of Romani political participation in eastern and western Europe, providing an understanding of the emerging political space that over 8 million Romani citizens occupy within the EU, and addressing issues related to the socio-political circumstances of Romani communities within European countries. Europe in the last two decades has gone through unprecedented political, social, and economic transformations. The restructuring of post-WWII welfare systems, the disintegration of Yugoslavia through a series of fratricidal wars, the rise of racist and nationalist movements, and the enlargement of NATO and of the EU to include former socialist countries after the end of the Cold War characterize this period. The new geopolitical order has affirmed a neo-liberal economic doctrine throughout Europe. A by-product of this phenomenon has been increasing marginalization of groups which do not 'fit' the new socio-economic regime. Amongst them are millions of Roma, for whom chronic unemployment and social exclusion have become the norm. As a response to their increasing social marginalization, human and minority rights discourses and regimes have emerged, consolidating alongside an embryonic Romani political movement. This book sheds light on experiences of political participation of Romani citizens in both Eastern and Western Europe, thus contributing to a deeper understanding of the political space that Roma occupy in states within an enlarged EU. The contributors are leading activists, politicians, and scholars involved in critical debates and policy making vis-a-vis Romani citizens. The book analyzes key political experiences and debates salient for the European Union, as well as implications for other ethnic minorities in Europe. It also offers new perspectives on core issues and paradoxes surrounding Romani political participation and mobilisation at the EU, national, and local levels, including case studies from both Eastern and Western Europe 'The literature of Gypsy Lore is being left behind as Romani Studies emerges as a discipline demanding serious attention. A proper understanding of our history, culture and (especially) current situation is relevant not only to the various Romani peoples but to the others among whom we live as well. The chapters in this book break new ground in addressing head on the challenges faced by Romanies today, and should be in the library of everyone concerned with establishing diversity and harmony in the New European societies.' - Professor Ian F. Hancock, Director, The Romani Archives and Documentation Center (RADOC), The University of Texas at Austin, USA 'This book is an original and crucial intervention in various fields of scholarship. Decolonizing the coloniality of power experienced by Roma people should be part of the broad project of decolonizing Europe!' - Ramon Grosfoguel, Professor of Ethnic Studies at the University of California at Berkeley, USA and Senior Research Associate, Maison des Science de l'Homme in Paris, France

AB  - Immigration from developing regions to Western countries has resulted in an increased rate of non-B subtypes in the HIV population. However, it is unclear whether these HIV variants remain confined to foreigners or are already spreading among natives. Since many immigrants come from regions in which hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are endemic, HIV-hepatitis coinfection might be more frequent in newly diagnosed HIV persons. Herein, we report changes in the prevalence and distribution of HIV-1 subtypes in Madrid, Spain over the past 10 years as well as the rate of chronic HBV and HCV coinfection in 1854 newly diagnosed HIV-1 individuals. Overall 18.2% carried HIV-1 non-B subtypes, although the prevalence increased over time reaching a peak of 19.4% in the last period (2007-2010). The most common non-B variants were CRF02_AG (37%), G (12%), A (9.9%), and C (7.8%). In native Spaniards the rate of non-B subtypes increased from 1.5% in 2000-2002 to 7.2% in 2003-2006 and to 11.4% in 2007-2010 (p = 0.04). Chronic hepatitis B and C were found, respectively, in 4.2% and 8.3% of the study population. While the prevalence of chronic hepatitis B has remained fairly stable over time across distinct populations, the rate of chronic HCV infection has experienced a significant decline, mainly in native Spaniards as a result of a reduction in intravenous drug use. In summary, the prevalence of HIV-1 non-B subtypes is rising in newly diagnosed HIV-1 individuals in Spain, including the native population. In contrast, the rate of HBV coinfection remains unchanged and the rate of HCV coinfection has declined

AB  - This book considers the origins, performance and diffusion of national immigration policies targeting highly skilled immigrants. Unlike asylum seekers and immigrants admitted under family reunification streams, highly skilled immigrants are typically cast as �_owanted and welcome�__ as a consequence of their potential economic contribution to the receiving society and putative assimilability. Testing the degree to which this assumption holds is the principle aim of this book. In contrast to publications which see highly skilled immigration as functional response to labor market needs, the book probes the political and sociological dimensions of policy, drawing on contributions from an international group of established and new scholars from the fields of history, law, political science, sociology, and public policy. The book is organized into four parts. Part I probes the origins of post-WWII immigration policies in Canada, Australia, and the United States. Part II analyzes recent debates on highly skilled immigration policy in the United States, whose origins go back to the 1965 Act by Congress which favored family reunification over skilled immigration. Part III considers the degree to which highly skilled immigrants are welcome, by focusing on the integration trajectories of foreign trained professionals in Canada. Paradoxically, just as Canada has succeeded in orienting its admissions system more explicitly toward privileging highly educated and skilled professionals, highly skilled immigrants have experienced worsening economic outcomes as reflected in rates of unemployment and falling earnings. Part IV considers the internationalization of highly skilled immigration policies, focusing on Europe�_Ts most important immigration countries, Germany and Britain. As is true in Canada, the labor market outcomes for highly skilled immigrants in Europe are disappointing, and the final chapter discusses why this is the case and what might be done to improve matters. Given its combination of cross-disciplinary insights, cross-national comparisons, and empirical richness, the book will be of interest to both scholars and policymakers concerned with immigration policy

AB  - Describes a program for war widows residing in refugee camps in Sri Lanka. The country has been traumatized by civil conflict for over 15 years and one in seventeen people have been displaced. The explicit aim of the program is to promote mental health among the refugees, mainly by facilitating coping strategies. Self-help principles are utilized. An additional aim of the program is to help foster relationships between women from the different sides of the conflict, thereby providing an opportunity for changing perceptions, attitudes and stereotyped beliefs. A blend of traditional models based on expert knowledge and a more radical model, which maximizes the resources of the women themselves, is used. The cultural and socio-political issues defining the intervention at micro- and macro-levels are also discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - (from the chapter) This chapter describes a community-based intervention for internally displaced widows living in refugee camps in Sri Lanka as a result of the 19-year-long civil war. The Women's Empowerment Programme was one of a series of interconnected programs run by the Family Rehabilitation Centre (FRC), a Sri Lankan nongovernmental organization committed to promoting ethnic harmony and community development, and to assisting victims of war by providing medical and psychological care and increasing socioeconomic knowledge. The FRC advocates a holistic, psychosocial model and philosophy and views mental health as embedded in a broad matrix of well-being and functioning. This matrix of interrelated factors encompasses psychological, social, and community functioning, cultural or spiritual belief and support systems, as well as economic and sociopolitical factors. The Women's Empowerment Programme offered brief, small group, supportive interventions designed to empower Sri Lankan war widows by providing them with access to information, facilitating individual and community-level coping strategies, and drawing on the considerable inner resources of the women themselves. Although the program is no ner longer active due to a shift in FRC funding priorities, the WEP held more than 40 interventions in most of those areas within Sri Lanka containing refugee camps.

AB  - This paper discusses one psychosocial intervention, a children's play activity programme, which has been run in a number of refugee camps within Sri Lanka since 1992 to the present. It is a multi-level intervention which works with children, their carers, health and education professionals and community leaders, some of whom later take over the running of the programme. The programme has changed and evolved in a number of ways as the result of participant feedback and evaluations. This paper discusses the intervention and its theoretical underpinnings. The play activity programme is one of a series of interlocking programmes run by the Family Rehabilitation Centre (FRC), a Sri Lankan non-governmental organization whose aim is to assist those affected by armed conflict in all areas of Sri Lanka irrespective of ethnicity, religion and political ideology. Objectives include promoting non-violence, ethnic harmony and the prevention of torture. The intervention is based on the FRC philosophy, which holds that well-being is multi-faceted and that psychological health is embedded in a matrix of well-being. A holistic or psychosocial model has evolved which views psychological health as being embedded in a matrix of factors. These may include social, community, spiritual, and socio-political issues. How an individual construes all these factors is likely to be important, particularly in the context of a civil war with a possible return to peace-time.

AB  - In a companion paper the authors argue that working with interpreters can add value to therapeutic work, and that it is viewed more negatively than is warranted. This paper explores the reluctance of clinicians to engage with therapeutic work with interpreters. Difficulties are often due to anxieties provoked by working in a 3-way therapeutic relationship. This paper considers the relationship between the 3 participants, and specifically describes alliances between client and interpreter, clinician and interpreter, and clinician and client.� Another issue of concern which is discussed in the article is the impact of highly traumatic material arising in therapy, for example with refugees or asylum seekers fleeing from political violence, on the 3-way therapeutic relationship.� Overall, the paper argues that the therapist and interpreter need to offer a relationship as a co-working couple so that they can manage the relationship between the 3 parties

Usage and retention during the subsequent intervention trial were investigated using focus group discussions and market monitoring SETTING: Three refugee camps in western Tanzania SUBJECTS: Refugee health workers were selected for pre-trial research. Mothers of children aged 6-59 months participated in the investigation of retention and use RESULTS: Pre-trial research indicated that the stainless steel pot would be the only acceptable type for use in this population due to excessive rusting and/or the high weight of other types. Cooking three typical refugee dishes in stainless steel pots led to an increase in Fe content of 3.2 to 17.1 mg/100 g food (P < 0.001). During the trial, the acceptability of the stainless steel pots was lower than expected owing to difficulties with using, cleaning and their utility for other purposes. Households also continued to use their pre-existing pots, and stainless steel pots were sold to increase household income CONCLUSIONS: Pre-trial research led to the selection of a stainless steel pot that met basic acceptability criteria. The relatively low usage reported during the trial highlights the limitations of using high-value iron-alloy cooking pots as an intervention in populations where poverty and the availability of other pots may lead to selling

AB  - This article reports a field investigation (N = 328) of a folk-healing practice (matiasma) among a population of urban Greek immigrants in Ohio. While orthodox Western health care is used by this community, the Greek population has also retained ethnomedical beliefs and practices that differ dramatically from those of scientific health care. This study delineates specific facets of matiasma, the configuration surrounding the evil eye. By tracing the retention of knowledge and use of this configuration over a four-generation period, this paper demonstrates the importance of generation depth as a variable in transcultural nursing research

AB  - The GAO focused on determining the extent and nature of interagency coordination problems among FBI, DEA, USMS, and other Federal agencies involved in fugitive investigations and on what actions had been or could be taken to address such problems. Officials contacted in the course of the GAO review reported they did not have extensive interagency coordination problems in the fugitive apprehension area. Nonetheless, the GAO identified some interagency coordination problems that could adversely affect the efficiency and effectiveness of Federal fugitive apprehension efforts. These problems primarily involved failure of the FBI and the USMS to participate in each other's fugitive task forces, disagreements over responsibility for prison escapes involving possible conspiracy charges, and failure to cooperate in efforts to capture fugitives from other countries. During the GAO review, FBI and USMS officials took or began taking actions to improve interagency coordination. Similarly, USMS officials said they would address coordination issues with other agencies regarding postarrest fugitives. Supplemental information is appended on the scope and methodology of the GAO review, key provisions of the Department of Justice's policy on fugitive apprehension, FBI and USMS fugitive apprehension responsibilities, Federal fugitive cases, offense types for which Federal fugitives are wanted, and dangerous Federal fugitives. 11 footnotes

AB  - Report is given on the tuberculosis (TB) prevalence and the new diseases monitoring in Czech Republic (CR) in 1999 using the register of notifiable TB diseases. 1631 new TB cases and relapse were notified (15.9/100,000 citizens). Majority TB cases, 1369 (13.3/100,000 citizens) were of the respiratory system and 262 TB cases were in other locations. 63% of the respiratory system diseases were bacteriologically verified. In comparison with the year 1998, the number of newly notified TB patients was 9.6% lower, number of TB cases of the respiratory system which were bacteriologically verified was 12.3% lower, cases of microscopically positive TB were 17.4% less frequent. Among the notified TB patients there were 91 foreigners. TB relapse was identified in 61 patients. Among the notified TB cases, 987 (60.5%) were males and 644 (39.5%) were females. In both sexes patients over 65 predominated. Prevalence of TB cases higher than the average for the whole state was found in Prague, northern and western Bohemia. Groups with TB prevalence higher than 50/100,000 citizens were identified (the risk groups). They include homeless people, drug addicts, asylum applicants, and prisoners. Due to subjective troubles of patients TB was diagnosed in 70.2% cases, by active investigation in 13.9% patients. Late TB diagnosis at autopsy came in 6.8% cases. Decease due to TB was notified in 79 patients. In 77 of them TB had not been diagnosed premortally. 106 new cases and relapses of non-TB mycobacterial disease were notified in 1999. The case of tuberculosis in CR was in 1999 restrainable. In comparison with 1998 significant decrease of TB prevalence in individual subgroups of TB disease was described (10 to 17%). Also the decrease of the long-term trend (10 years) of newly notified TB patients and TB of the respiratory system was depicted. It is necessary to maintain the quality and extend of the TB control program in order to prevent the new outbreak of TB disease

T1  - Are transit users loyal? Revelations from a hazard model based on smart card data

AB  - Smart card fare collection systems for public transit produce a huge quantity of data on a daily basis. The ability to follow the use of a single card throughout the months gives the opportunity of measuring the loyalty of the individual to the service. Then, operators can have quantitative knowledge of the loyalty in their network. However, it is also important to know what are the factors that influence the survival of the users. This paper presents the application of a discrete time hazard model to 5 years of data of a medium-size transit authority in Canada. The concept of the hazard model relates to the fact that the probability to continue the use of a smart card by user i, at time t, is conditional to the probability of not cancelling the card before the time period. Hence, its use is appropriate in this case. Results for the regular adult fare show that loyalty is positively influenced by residential density and by the transit share in the area. A younger population will also be retained longer in the system. However, a high unemployment rate has a negative impact on survival. A high share of transit and walk trips is also affecting the loyalty, suggesting that the retention is reduced when there are more mode choices available to the commuter.

La capacitǸ �� suivre l'utilisation d'une seule carte pendant plusieurs mois permet de mesurer la fidǸlitǸ des individus �� ce service. Les opǸrateurs peuvent alors avoir une idǸe quantitative de la fidǸlitǸ dans leur rǸseau. Toutefois, il peut sembler important de connaǩtre les facteurs qui influencent la durǸe de fidǸlitǸ des utilisateurs. Cet article prǸsente l'application d'un mod��le, en temps discret, du risque �� cinq annǸes de donnǸes d'une sociǸtǸ de transport en commun de moyenne dimension au Canada. Le concept du mod��le de risque aborde le fait que la probabilitǸ de continuer �� utiliser la carte �� puce par l'utilisateur i, �� un temps t, soit conditionnelle �� la probabilitǸ de ne pas annuler la carte avant la fin de la pǸriode de temps. Son utilisation est donc appropriǸe dans ce cas. Les rǸsultats pour les droits de passage adulte montrent que la loyautǸ est positivement influencǸe par la densitǸ de la population rǸsidentielle et �� la part du transport en commun dans cette zone.

AB  - The present report commemorates the persecution of five renowned Italian physiologists of Jewish descent that lost their chairs in medical schools because of the anti-semitic policies of the fascist regime. In 1938, Mussolini promulgated the Racial Laws, officially with the aim of safeguarding the purity of the Italian race in conquered African colonies. However, their true intent was to persecute the Italian Jewish community in agreement with the policy of Nazi Germany. In accordance with the Racial Laws, all non-Aryans were banished from professional activities and were evicted from public, social, and academic life. As a result, 98 full professors in Italian universities were removed from their academic positions. In medical schools, physiology, more than other discipline, lost the most prominent faculty members. Of the 17 full Professors of Human Physiology, five were of Jewish descent, and all were evicted: they were Camillo Artom from Palermo, Mario Camis from Bologna, Carlo Foa from Milan, Amedeo Herlitzka from Turin, and Ugo Lombroso from Genoa. All were talented and famous scientists who were forced to leave Italy and take refuge in foreign countries. At the end of World War II, Camis, Foa, Herlitzka, and Lombroso returned to Italy and resumed their previous academic positions, whereas Artom remained in the United States. Unfortunately, Camis died later that year. During the postwar period, some of the fascists responsible for the Jewish persecution were killed or committed suicide while the survivors were imprisoned and prosecuted. However, all were soon released and resumed their former positions

AB  - The sexual mutilations, a fairly topical subject, remain very frequent (between 80 and 100 millions). The excisions are in practice mainly in Africa (in at last 20 countries), but also in the Far-East and Indonesia. In some cases, such practices are very mutilative (Pharaonic infibulation). They may drag to the death, through haemorrhage or infection. The short and long term medical complications are fearful, tetanus, vesicovaginal fistulae, vaginal or vulvar sclerosis, forbidding any sexual involvement and hampering delivery. The grounds of these practices are basically customary and not religious. Women shall be subservient to men and any manhood mark, embodied by the clitoris, shall disappear. However these manoeuvres are decreasing, due to the women emancipation, and, particularly, in Africa, some leaders are aware of their graveness and are punishing heavily the excision, taking model of the French Penal Code. The immigrants, who, in France, have these mutilations undertaken, are incurring imprisonment sentences (precedents are frequent). They must comply with the French laws

AB  - [The mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment for people smuggling have attracted substantial judicial criticism in recent years. A series of legislative amendments has broadened their application; decisions of intermediate courts of appeal have increased their effect; and a Senate inquiry has recommended against their repeal. Difficult questions of law surround the constitutionality of the regime and its compatibility with Australia's obligations at international law. In addition, the effect of these developments on indictees and their families raises important questions of policy. Does the punishment match the culpability of offenders? If not, is it justified by the need for deterrence? If so, does the scheme achieve that objective? An analysis of the laws and their application reveals that the answers to all three are in the negative. This article contends that mandatory sentencing for people smuggling is unjust and unnecessary, if not invalid, and locates areas for change in all three arms of government.] [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]Copyright of Melbourne University Law Review is the property of Melbourne University Law Review Association Inc. and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

AB  - In seventeenth-century France, Madeleine de Scud+�ry's novels were best-sellers. However, due to the satirical works of Moli+�re and Boileau, she was labeled a prudish pr+�cieuse . Around that appellation grew a misogynous mythology that clouded the concept of pr+�ciosit+� and Scud+�ry's reputation. The twenty-first century ushers in a renewed appreciation of Scud+�ry's work and a reassessment of pr+�ciosit+� . La Promenade de Versailles was written in 1669. In Part 1, it describes the extravagant beauty of Louis XIV's pleasure palace and the celebrations he staged for conquering Franche-Comt+� and Flandres and for a "secret" guest, his mistress Louise de LaValli+�re. The novel, using exemplarity and subversion of the example, becomes a brilliantly cloaked +�criture politique . Scud+�ry's text eulogizes Louis XIV, but also subtly critiques the Sun King's preoccupation with conquering territory for France at the expense of his subjects. La Promenade de Versailles demonstrates a dramatic shift from the exteriority of the heroic novel, whose main purpose is to relate the exploits of the hero, to the interiority of the modern novel, wherein dialogue replaces the narration of heroic action. Joan DeJean contends that this narrative shift of focus originated in Scud+�ry's longer works of fiction, Cyrus and Cl+�lie . Scud+�ry perfects her narratological invention in La Promenade de Versailles . The story-line, interspersed with conversations , a narrative form that Scud+�ry appropriates from the salon, creates a positive space for pr+�ciosit+� and for an egalitarian discourse in the novel. Scud+�ry uses pr+�ciosit+� as a seventeenth-century +�criture f+�minine . The classic love story in La Promenade de Versailles finds both a feminist and a political focus and offers yet a second and indirect critique of seventeenth-century society. From the frontispiece of Cupid to the myriad of textual ekphraseis , the secret and powerful signs of Eros literally and figuratively decorate the novel. In Part 2 of La Promenade , entitled "Histoire de Celanire," the heroine of the title loves Cleandre, but she is determined to set the parameters of their relationship. She demands that it be kept secret. When Celanire's uncle orders her to marry the wealthy cad Cleonte, she seeks her freedom by a self-imposed exile. Celanire reunites with her lover in the end, but only on her own terms. Along with unveiling a protofeminist claim for self-assertion, Part 2 of the novel allegorizes the difficult years during which Scud+�ry's closest friends, Paul Pellisson and Nicolas Fouquet were imprisoned. Once disparaged as a mauvaise pr+�cieuse , Scud+�ry, the pr+�cieuse , in fact stands as an avatar of early +�criture politique and +�criture f+�minine. La Promenade de Versailles may offer praise of Louis XIV and Versailles but it is through a mirror darkly

He says that the war on terror as it has been conducted since 2001 has done nothing but increase fear worldwide and that the Canadian security certificate institutionalizes it. He uses the example of the detention of Syrian refugee Hassan Almrei to support his point

He suggests that the health professions have a proud history of standing up for powerless and abused people. He argues that concern does not stop at the surgery or the hospital and that the self worth and freedom of physicians depend on physicians taking action immediately

AB  - The National Dementia Strategy (NDS) is a five year plan that sets out initiatives designed to improve awareness and knowledge of the issue, ensure early diagnosis and improve GP training, services in General hospitals and Care homes as well as services aimed at Carers. While recent government policy in health and social care has highlighted the need for local partnerships across sectors to deliver improved healthcare and reduce health inequalities, there has been limited research on dementia in minority ethnic groups. Despite the cosmopolitan mix of the capital's population, black, minority ethnic and refugee (BMER) communities have historically been marginalised from strategic health initiatives.� This article highlights the work undertaken by the London Region Dementia Implementation Task Group to support commissioner engagement with BMER communities in planning dementia services, and to help these communities to have more influence on the implementation of the NDS in London. The article ends by describing the potential health access and economic risks of failing to improve the involvement of BMER communities when planning dementia care

AB  - The aim of this exploratory study was to look at how internationalisation, globalisation, and regionalisation are manifested in social work education. The study focused on how undergraduate social work students perceive international aspects of their education, using a survey of students attending courses at Stockholm University in Sweden and Hochschule Darmstadt, an applied sciences university in Germany. Information about students' views and experiences was collected through questionnaires covering information and knowledge about international issues, meeting foreign students, courses or practice abroad, preparation for working with refugees and immigrant groups, and preparation for international social work. The article describes the study methodology and presents the findings. It reports that a majority of students in both countries wanted more education about refugee social work and social work in other countries, and that 78% of students in Sweden and 23% of students in Germany responded that they were prepared to do social work with immigrants or refugees. The authors discuss the results and highlight the importance of increasing awareness in social work education of the international influence on domestic social work

AB  - This study categorized 751 chronically homeless adults enrolled in supported housing programs into three groups: participants who reported no history of incarceration (n = 221; 29%), those who reported being incarcerated for a total of one year or less (n = 267; 36%), and those who reported being incarcerated for a total of more than one year (n = 263; 35%). Although participants who reported an incarceration history also reported more extensive histories of substance abuse and homelessness than those who reported no incarceration history, there were no differences in these outcomes over one year in supported housing. However, participants with incarceration periods longer than 10 years did have worse drug use outcomes than those with no history of incarceration. These findings underscore the benefits that chronically homeless adults with incarceration histories can derive from supported housing programs and support efforts to eliminate barriers to independent housing for this population.

T1  - When human capital does not matter: local contexts of reception and immigrant wages in Japan

DA  - 2011/12//

AB  - Although research on immigrants in the US provides strong evidence that human capital is more important than social capital in determining their wages, data from Hamamatsu, Japan indicates that social capital variables are the primary determinant of immigrant earnings and human capital does not have a significant effect. The divergent impact of these two variables on the earnings of immigrants are a result of the different economic and social conditions that immigrants encounter in Japan compared to the United States. In a recent country of immigration like Japan where immigrant labor markets are relatively undeveloped and foreign workers are confined to unskilled, marginal jobs, the human capital that they acquire over time is not reflected in better jobs with higher earnings. In contrast, immigrants with access to social capital in the form of immigrant networks, gender, and ethnicity are able to obtain jobs with higher wages in Japan. Because foreign workers are still temporary target earners, they therefore rely heavily on their immigrant social networks to find better-paying jobs. In addition, Japan is a country with significant gender and ethnic discrimination where employers strongly prefer male foreign workers and ethnically similar nikkeijin (Japanese descendants born and raised abroad) and are willing to pay them significantly higher wages. Therefore, depending on the local context of immigrant reception, the relative importance of human versus social capital in explaining economic outcomes among immigrants can vary considerably.

AB  - ABSTRACT IN GERMAN: Von den derzeit 20 Mio. Einwohnern des "f++nften Kontinents" ist fast jeder Vierte nicht in Australien geboren. Zuwanderung aus dem asiatischen Raum aber war jedoch bis in die 1990er Jahre aufgrund staatlicher Reglementierung kaum m+�glich. Erst mit dem Ende der "White Australia Policy" hat sich das Zahlenverh+�ltnis von asiatischen zu europ+�ischen Zuwanderern ver+�ndert. Vor allem in den Metropolen des Landes gewinnt die asiatische Kultur mit der steigenden Zahl asiatischer Australier an Bedeutung. // ABSTRACT IN ENGLISH: The international migration to Australia has undergone fundamental changes since the end of the 'White Australia Policy' in 1975. The proportion of Australia's resident population born in Asia has increased from 1,1% in 1976 to 5,5% in 2001. In Sydney even 9% of the population were born in Asia and 12% state an Asian ancestry. The early Asian migrants have mainly been refugees, followed by persons who migrated under the family reunion program. Nowadays the majority arrives as highly skilled professionals or students. Most of the Asian communities with refugee background concentrate in a few local government areas around the migrant reception centres (hostels), whereas the new highly skilled migrants from Asia spread around the initially 'white', high income suburbs. None of the birthplace groups in Sydney face segregation. Apart from the birthplace groups from Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos the population of Asian origin does not segregate stronger than the birthplace groups of the early European migrants. In times of globalisation and a growing Asian market, highly skilled Asian population gain importance

AB  - Beginning in late 1931, Japan expanded and consolidated its colonial management of Northeast China by seizing the entire region and establishing the puppet state of Manchukuo. Until the collapse of the Japanese Empire in 1945, Manchukuo's Japanese managers carried out an extensive program of state, economic and infrastructure development. Considering state and economic planning to be closely related, they integrated them. Physical planning, city building and architecture were at one intersection of their concerns for economic development, state power, and representation of authority and state ideology. Construction was fundamental to the new state, and a central metaphor by which its creators understood and articulated their ambitions to build an ideal state and society, with model cities to enable an ideal way of life. They did not confine these goals to Northeast China. Manchukuo was a project of reconstruction also aimed at the rest of China and Japan. These were utopian ambitions beyond the resources of the Japanese Empire, and the Manchukuo project soon began to encounter obstacles that it was unable to overcome. Nevertheless, planners still envisioned Northeast China as an "empty page," and continued the attempt to construct ideal, utopian cities there. This dissertation approaches the construction of Manchukuo from various perspectives. It examines the development of the flexible concept of Manchuria, which was easily remade into Manchukuo. It examines Japanese systems of regional colonial management before and after the formation of Manchukuo. It traces the development of Japanese city planning, and planners eagerness to find an "empty page" outside of Japan where they could realize the ideal cities denied them in Japan. It examines the practical difficulties of construction labor during the Manchukuo regime and the development of three model plans--for model fortified villages for Japanese agricultural immigrants, for the industrial city of Dadong, and for Shinky+�, the capital of Manchukuo. Shinky+� is examined as ideal capital and model for Tokyo, a cultural center, a publicity project, and as an unfinished site for incorporating the Emperor of Manchukuo into Manchukuo

AB  - PURPOSE: Khat use has been suggested to be associated with psychosis, but its prevalence and associations among mental health service users have not been described in either traditional use countries or countries with immigrant populations from traditional use countries. We aimed to investigate the clinical and demographic associations of khat use in a sample of Somali users of mental health service users in South London METHODS: We used an electronic case register of 150,000 mental health patients to investigate the associations of khat use among all 240 Somali patients in the database. We used logistic regression to generate adjusted estimates for a range of exposure variables and used multiple imputation as a principled approach to missing data RESULTS: Khat use or non-use was recorded for 172 patients (72% of the total), of whom 80 (47%) were current users. Khat use was very strongly associated with ICD-10 primary diagnosis of schizophrenia, psychosis or drug and alcohol disorder (compared to ICD-10 F43 stress-related disorders and other non-psychotic disorders), male gender, harmful or dependent use of alcohol, and detention under the Mental Health Act CONCLUSIONS: Recording and monitoring of khat use need to be more consistent in clinical settings, and further studies are required to investigate the much higher rates of use among those with psychotic disorders compared to non-psychotic disorders

AB  - (from the chapter) William of Ockam, Venerabilis Inceptor, Doctor Invincibilis, is by far the most important philosopher of this period. He was born at Ockam, in Surrey, about the year 1280. It is said that he studied at Merton College, Oxford, where it is possible he had Duns Scotus for teacher. There seems to be some doubt as to his having followed the lectures of Scotus at Paris. He taught at Paris between the years 1320 and 1323. After quitting his chair at Paris, he threw in his lot with the opponents of the temporal power of the popes, was imprisoned at Avignon, escaped in 1328, and sought refuge at the court of Louis of Bavaria, to whom he made the wellknown promise: "Tu me defendas gladio, ego te defendam calamo." It is not known with certainty where and when he died, but it is probable that he died at Munich in 1349. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (chapter)

AB  - Refugee camps are exceptional places that are left to the benevolent governing of international humanitarian agencies, and offer unique opportunities to explore the making and un-making of public authority. This article examines how certain groups of young men in a refugee camp in Tanzania manage to establish public authority by relating to ideas of a Burundian moral order, while at the same time relating to the �_~development-speak�_T of international relief operations. The refugees' attempts to establish public authority are highly contested and highly politicized, clashing with the relief agencies' vision of the camp as non-political. Ironically, the young men who engage in politics in the camp are also closely linked to these relief agencies in their role as brokers between the agencies and the �_~small people�_T. Public authority is partly produced by the powers that are delegated to them by the agencies and partly formed in the �_~gaps' in the agencies�_T system. Similarly, authority rests in part on the respect that these brokers gain from other refugees �_" a respect that is earned in numerous ways, including outwitting the international organizations �_" and in part on the recognition that they get from the very same organizations. In other words, public authority rests on complex relations between legitimacy and recognition and between sovereignty and governmentality.

AB  - In contemporary sociology, there has been significant interest in the idea of mobility, the decline of the nation state, the rise of flexible citizenship, and the porous quality of political boundaries. There is much talk of medicine without borders and sociology without borders. These social developments are obviously linked to the processes of globalization, leading some to argue that we need a 'sociology beyond society' in order to account for these flows and global networks. In this article, I propose an alternative analysis. There are important developments involving the securitization of modern societies that create significant forms of immobility. One striking illustration is the increasing use of walls to quarantine or secure territories and communities against outsiders or to regulate the flow of migrants in Israel, in Europe and along the Mexican-US border. Modern societies are in particular characterized by a deep contradiction between the economic need for labour mobility and the state's political need to assert sovereignty. Gated societies, ghettoes, quarantine zones, prisons, camps and similar arrangements are in many respects pre-modern institutions of spatial regulation for political ends. Contemporary technical developments in biomedicine offer new opportunities for political control and spatial regulation in terms of forensic policing, bio-tattooing and bioprofiling. Globalization paradoxically produces significant forms of immobility for political regulation of persons alongside the mobility of goods and services.

AB  - Background:A third of all deaths in children aged <5 years occur in the neonatal period. Neonatal intensive care is often considered too complex and expensive to be implemented in resource poor settings. Consequently the reductions that have been made in infant mortality in the poorest countries have not been made in the neonatal period. This manuscript describes the activities surrounding the introduction of special care baby unit (SCBU) in a refugee setting and the resulting population impact. Methods:A SCBU was developed in Maela refugee camp on the Thailand-Myanmar border. This unit comprised of a dedicated area, basic equipment, drugs and staff training. Training was built around neonatal guidelines, comprising six clinical steps: recognition, resuscitation, examination, supportive medical care, specialised medical care, and counselling of parents with sick newborns. Results:From January 2008 until December 2011, 952 infants were admitted to SCBU. The main admission diagnoses were early onset neonatal sepsis, jaundice and prematurity. Early prematurity (<34 weeks) carried the highest risk of mortality (OR 9.5, 95% CI 5.4�_"16.5, p<0.001). There was a significant decrease in mortality from 19.3% (2008) to 4.8% (2011) among the infants admitted for prematurity (p=0.03). The neonatal mortality in Maela camp as a whole declined by 51% from 21.8 to 10.7 deaths per 1000 live births over the corresponding period (p=0.04). Staff expressed more confidence in their ability to take care of neonates and there was a more positive attitude towards premature infants. Conclusion:Neonatal mortality can be reduced in a resource poor setting by introduction of a simple low cost unit specialising in care of sick neonates and run by local health workers following adequate training. Training in recognition and provision of simple interventions at a high standard can increase staff confidence and reduce fatalistic attitudes towards premature neonates.

AB  - As immigration detention has increased in the United States over the past two decades, legislative changes have placed LGBTQ immigrants at a higher risk of being detained because of deportation policies that focus on poverty-related crime and increasingly stringent asylum requirements. Once detained, these immigrants are subjected to significantly higher rates of violence and are often denied access to essential medical care. Exacerbating the problems of detention for all detainees, there are no substantive legislative or regulatory standards governing detention conditions, and the Department of Homeland Security's internal standards are poorly enforced and often not even binding. While there are constitutional limits to what detainees can be subjected to, most circuit courts have held that detainees are not entitled to any protections beyond those given criminal prisoners. Litigation by LGBTQ people in criminal incarceration has yielded some successes that may be imported into the detention context to improve conditions, but litigation is an uncertain and difficult route for advocates to take, particularly given uncertainties about detainees' access to the court system. Ultimately, the most meaningful advocacy may be outside of the litigation arena, advocating for legislative and regulatory changes. One obvious goal of advocacy may be to increase standards and oversight for detention conditions, but this may be difficult to achieve meaningfully and may result in an unintended entrenchment of policies favoring increased detention. A more promising route is for LGBTQ-focused organizations to work with other stakeholder communities in advocating for significant decreases in the number of people detained.

AB  - This article suggests a number of ways affecting the ways many Southeast Asian women refugees in the U.S. cope with and integrate themselves into a new society. These factors include the methods by which they maintain their traditional values while adapting to American culture; the changing gender roles they play in marriage and raising children and in paid work; the level of control and related expectations they have over their lives in the U.S. and their strategies for understanding and challenging dysfunctional situations, including teen pregnancy and domestic violence. The concentration of Southeast Asian refugees in Lowell, Massachusetts, has led to dramatic changes in the city. Southeast Asians have had an impact on the city's housing patterns, schools, and businesses in the area. More than one hundred shops and stores are owned and operated by Southeast Asians. At the same time, this level of ethnic retention and cohesiveness has fostered a greater level of resentment toward the settlement of Cambodians, Lao, and Vietnamese in the city. The influx of Southeast Asian students to Lowell public schools was one of the major reasons for the school desegregation movement in 1986 and one of the principal causes for well-established residents to pass a referendum to support English as the official language of the city in 1988. The politics of resettlement will probably continue to impact the Southeast Asian community in Lowell for many years to come

The 200 noisy demonstrators fell silent as they registered the words expressed during a May 20 protest of the destruction of Rafah in front of the Los Angeles Israeli Consulate. Smith noted that Resolution 377 was passed in 1950 because the U.S. was concerned about the Soviet Union vetoing Security Council resolutions. Only 48 hours earlier as news of Israel's devastating raids on the Rafah refugee camp intensified, activist Haitham al-Zabri of Al Awda launched an e-mail call for a demonstration

AB  - Silvicultural treatments prescribed to enhance wildlife habitat by promoting structural heterogeneity via retention of large live trees, snags, and coarse woody debris has been termed wildlife-forestry. Wildlife-forestry has been advocated for management of bottomland hardwood forests on public conservation lands within the Mississippi Alluvial Valley, USA. On Tensas River National Wildlife Refuge in northeast Louisiana, we used distance sampling during 6 visits to 138 point locations to estimate avian densities within stands subjected to variable-retention harvests, within a 13-year chronosequence, and untreated control stands. Densities of 9 species, including 6 species of conservation concern, were greater in treated stands than on untreated stands. Five species responded negatively to treatments and had greater densities in untreated control stands. Based on conservation concern scores established by Partners in Flight and annual detections of each of 30 species, treated stands afforded greater community-wide bird conservation than did untreated stands. For most species, maximum treatment response was between 5 years and 8 years posttreatment with duration of treatment effect ,13 years. Therefore, habitat conditions on treated stands should be reevaluated at circa 15-year intervals and, if warranted, additional silvicultural treatment prescribed to rejuvenate habitat conditions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore roles of family physicians and family practice nurses who provided care to Kosovar refugees at Greenwood, NS DESIGN: Qualitative study based on individual interviews with family physicians and family practice nurses SETTING: Family practices in Halifax, NS PARTICIPANTS: Six family practice nurses, four physician faculty members, four community-based family physicians, and two family medicine residents were interviewed. Participants were purposefully chosen from the roster of service providers METHOD: All interviews were conducted by one of the researchers and were semistructured. Interviews lasted approximately 30 minutes and were immediately transcribed. Key words and phrases were identified and compared with subsequent interviews until saturation was achieved MAIN FINDINGS: Data yielded four analytical categories: the clinical encounter, expectation and experience, role and team functioning, and response. Participants reported how providing care in the context of a refugee camp was both similar to and different from their daily activities in family practice, as were their working relationships with other health care professionals CONCLUSION: Primary care for refugees during complex health emergencies is often underreported in the literature. Yet family practice physicians and nurses recounted that they had the requisite skills to provide care in such a context

AB  - In a measure attempting to reduce the amount of wasted land, all states, except for South Dakota, ban traditional in-ground burials. South Dakota, seeing an opportunity for profit, begins to sell its land off to the highest bidder. As traditionalists and religious sects buy up the land to bury their dead, South Dakota begins to die. Towns sell themselves off, at profit, until all that is left is burial plots and empty grassland. As the land empties, bands of bikers and gangs of Indians begin to re-inhabit Dakota Country. Forced into driving illegal Mexican immigrants over the border, Jack is caught by the police after a transport goes terribly wrong. He is given the option of avoiding jail by volunteering to keep an eye out for the government. He agrees to drive caskets into South Dakota and send word back about the state of things out there. He is paired up with a veteran driver, Lefty, and taught the ins and outs of driving through the harsh land. Along the way, Lefty is killed by the same people that forced Jack into the smuggling job that put him in South Dakota in the first place. Jack finds himself running for his life from a gang of ruthless bikers. He is caught by a group of Indians and barely escapes, only to find himself being chased, once again, by the biker gang. At the end of the story, he finds himself in a Western shootout--of which he survives only through the help of the same Indians that had previously captured him

AB  - Questions of asylum and immigration have taken centre stage in national and international debate and figure prominently in the domestic political agendas of wealthy states and nations. In Australia, Europe and the US, harsh and punitive asylum and immigration laws are being enacted incrementally and asylum-seekers are subject increasingly to detention. Through a focus on the detention of asylum-seekers in the UK, this article makes a critical intervention in current theoretical debates around asylum. Focusing on the writing of Giorgio Agamben, this article suggests that within political and cultural theory, there has been a turn to the figure of the asylum-seeker (and the refugee) as a trope for theorizing the political constitution of the present. By opening up a critical dialogue between humanitarian, media studies and abstract theoretical accounts of immigration detention, this article produces a critique of the ways in which theory appropriates the figure of the asylum-seeker.

AB  - This study examined the effects of an intergenerational service-learning curriculum on refugee/immigrant university students. These students have been identified as the least likely population to perform community service. They have been considered "at-risk" because of cultural isolation and social alienation on campus. The refugee/immigrant elders have also been considered culturally isolated and socially limited. The "young" and "old" were provided the opportunity for weekly interaction over the period of one semester. Evidence indicated that this university-sponsored intergenerational service-learning program had beneficial effects on both the refugee/immigrant students and elders who participated. The research design was "multimodal" in that it employed elements of both quantitative and qualitative data collection. The researcher utilized a posttest only control group design with two treatment groups and one control group. There were four independent variables: respondent group, gender, age, and ethnicity. There were seven dependent variables: social responsibility, attitude toward elderly, acculturation, social isolation, powerlessness, normlessness, and total alienation. Quantitative results indicate that the control group differed significantly from the treatment groups in all dependent variables. Students in the treatment groups experienced a positive change in all dependent variables; but only two variables, attitude toward elderly and acculturation, showed a statistically significant positive change. Qualitative results indicate that the intergenerational service-learning experience had effects on both the students and the elders who participated. These effects are reported as positive changes in attitude of one generation toward another and reduction of stereotypical views towards people on the basis of age and cultural identity

AB  - BACKGROUND Models of engineering retention use high school GPA and mathematics standardized test scores to measure pre-college characteristics and first year of college GPA to measure academic integration in college. This study uses high school and college physics and calculus coursetaking and achievement to predict engineering degree attainment among students on-track for an engineering degree. PURPOSE (HYPOTHESIS) This study predicts that high school accelerated physics and calculus coursetaking and grades influences grades earned in college physics and calculus and both sets of factors influence engineering degree attainment. DESIGN/METHOD Multinomial logistic regression analyses determine the effects of high or low achievement in high school on high and low achievement in college physics and calculus courses and the effects of both on earning an engineering degree. RESULTS Pre-college characteristics and academic integration were not consistently related to the destination of engineering migrants. Community college enrollment was not related to attrition. High school calculus achievement is the strongest predictor of grades in college physics and calculus courses, accounting for the positive effects of accelerated physics and calculus coursetaking. CONCLUSIONS Engineering degree attainment models should include coursetaking and particularly achievement in high school and college physics and calculus courses. Attrition outcomes should include the destination major in order to capture achievement effects on migration to business and non-STEM fields compared to migration to other STEM fields that require quantitative skills acquired in physics and calculus courses.

T1  - Cultural capital and cross-border career ladders: Western professional migrants in Taiwan

AB  - The author argues that cultural capital is an important but neglected aspect of developing cross-border careers, and that it is especially important when social capital is lacking. Most of the supporting information was gathered during in-depth interviews with 40 western professional migrants (36 currently and four previously employed by Taiwanese firms), supplemented by data from interviews with 29 Taiwanese human resource and corporate managers. The data indicate that after using their home cultural capital to find jobs with Taiwanese firms doing business with western companies, the interviewees acquired local cultural and social capital that allowed them to pursue six cross-border career options. Moving to Taiwan is representative of the migration phenomenon from more- to less-developed countries during a period of rapidly expanding economies or economic downturns. The migrants interviewed generally had limited organizational experience (affecting home-country opportunities) and a strong desire for international knowledge and adventure. ABSTRACT IN FRENCH: La d+�tention de capital culturel constitue un facteur important mais trop longtemps sous-estim+� dans l'+�volution des carri+�res transnationales, dont la signifiance devient particuli+�rement visible chez les individus qui en sont d+�pourvus. La plupart des donn+�es mobilis+�es +� la d+�fense de cette th+�se ont +�t+� recueillies lors d'entretiens approfondis aupr+�s de 40 migrants occidentaux dipl+�m+�s (dont 36 toujours en activit+� au sein d'entreprises taiwanaises et 4 anciens salari+�s), ainsi que lors de 29 entretiens avec des responsables de ressources humaines et des managers. Les r+�sultats montrent que, apr+�s avoir mobilis+� le capital culturel acquis dans leurs pays d'origine pour d+�crocher un emploi au sein d'une entreprise taiwanaise travaillant avec des firmes occidentales, les enqu+�t+�s ont cultiv+� du capital culturel et social localement, ce qui leur a permis de poursuivre l'un des six types de carri+�res transnationales identifi+�s. Le choix d'une mobilit+� vers Taiwan repr+�sente un ph+�nom+�ne migratoire particuli+�rement pr+�sent lors de p+�riodes d'expansion rapide ou de ralentissement +�conomique, au d+�part d'une soci+�t+� d+�velopp+�e vers une +�conomie en voie de d+�veloppement. La plupart des migrants interview+�s avait peu d'exp+�rience professionnelle (limitant leurs chances d'insertion dans leur pays d'origine) et manifestait un go++t prononc+� pour l'aventure et les connaissances associ+�es aux mobilit+�s internationales. ABSTRACT IN SPANISH: El autor arguye que el capital cultural, aspecto a menudo olvidado, es un factor importante para el desarrollo de las carreras transnacionales, tanto m+�s cuando falta el capital social. La mayor+�a de los datos que apoyan esta idea fueron recogidos gracias a entrevistas en profundidad a 40 inmigrantes profesionales occidentales (36 actualmente empleados en empresas taiwanesas y 4 empleados con anterioridad) complementados con 29 entrevistas a gestores de recursos humanos de empresas taiwanesas. Los datos indican que tras utilizar su capital cultural de origen para encontrar trabajos en empresas taiwanesas que tuvieran negocios con compa+�+�as occidentales, los entrevistados adquirieron capital cultural y social localmente que les permiti+� optar a seis opciones de carreras transnacionales. La migraci+�n a Taiwan es representativa de los fen+�menos migratorios de pa+�ses m+�s desarrollados a pa+�ses menos desarrollados durante un periodo de r+�pida expansi+�n econ+�mica o de bajones econ+�micos. Los inmigrantes encuestados generalmente ten+�an una experiencia organizacional limitada que afectaba las oportunidades en su pa+�s de origen y un fuerte deseo de aprendizaje internacional y de aventura.

AB  - The Department of Health of the Tibetan government in exile has initiated a programme aiming at alleviating psychosocial consequences of imprisonment, torture, and other traumatic experiences in Tibet among the Tibetan refugees in India and Nepal. After some years' prepatory work and communication, the Department of Health and the Tibet Support Committee, Denmark, began a collaboration in 1996 on the project Psychosocial Support to Tibetan Refugees. The Tibet Support Committee is responsible NGO for the project, which is funded by the NGO section of the Danish International Developmental Assistance (DINIDA), while the Department of Health is coordinating and carrying out the project activities in India. The first phase of the project is due to run for three years, from October 1996. The project strategies include capacity building and social support. This is carried out in two activities: (1) rehabilitation of a number of traumatized refugees, (2) training of a group of Tibetan doctors, nurses, and social workers. A Tibetan project officer has the job of coordinating both activities. [Adapted from Text, p. 50]

AB  - Three years ago, Prime Minister John Howard ordered armed troops to ward off the Tampa, a Norwegian cargo vessel that had rescued Afghan asylum-seekers from the sea off western Australia. He declared that none would set foot in Australia and consigned them to high-security camps on the islands of Nauru and Papua New Guinea. The Tampa affair, followed by the terrorist attacks on America in September 2001, helped Howard win his third election a few months later. A report in May by Australia's human-rights and equal-opportunities commission concluded that Australia's treatment of child detainees had breached its obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The government recently released all bar one boat child from mainland detention camps, though 19 remain on Nauru. The strongest reason for the policy change has probably been the discovery that asylum-seekers can be good for the economy. Many of those with temporary visas have found jobs as fruit pickers and slaughterhouse workers, helping to keep several towns alive

T1  - Irregular and illegal migration through Ukraine

AB  - ABSTRACT IN ENGLISH: With the expansion of Europe's borders, Ukraine has entered the spotlight of attention as a source and transit country for irregular migrants. Irregular migration has risen on the international security and political agendas because it is perceived as a threat to security, and has been linked to problems such as crime and drugs. In the debate about how to manage this migration, the voices of the migrants themselves are often lost. Drawing on a review of the literature and migrants' testimonies, this paper argues that assumptions about irregular migrants in policy and position papers can be revised in light of migrants' experiences. For example, whereas officials and workers in non-governmental organizations often picture irregular migration in terms of an inexorable striving, what migrants emphasize most is the undesirable nature of their movement. And, whereas many sources view irregular migration as symptomatic of globalization and the transnational `flows' of people, capital, and ideas, asylum seekers who become irregular in the absence of a strong asylum system in Ukraine describe highly constrained lives that include detention and isolation. Before more efforts are directed toward combating irregular migration, migrants' descriptions of a traumatic and transformative experience of being 'turned into illegals', and 'broken' can be taken into account. While there is a tendency to view the migrants as the problem, this paper suggests it is international migration regimes and not migrants that need amendment and improvement. // ABSTRACT IN FRENCH: Avec l'+�largissement des fronti+�res de l'Europe, l'Ukraine suscite une attention toute particuli+�re en tant que pays d'origine et de transit de migrants irr+�guliers. La migration irr+�guli+�re occupe d+�sormais davantage de place +� l'ordre du jour international des questions de politique et de s+�curit+� car elle est per+�ue comme une menace pour la s+�curit+� de l'Europe et est automatiquement associ+�e aux probl+�mes li+�s +� la criminalit+� et au trafic de stup+�fiants. Dans le d+�bat sur la mani+�re de g+�rer cette migration, les voix des migrants eux-m+�mes ont parfois bien du mal +� se faire entendre. S'appuyant sur une compilation de textes consacr+�s +� la question et de t+�moignages de migrants, l'auteur estime que les exp+�riences v+�cues par les migrants peuvent jeter sur la question un +�clairage susceptible de modifier la fa+�on dont les migrants irr+�guliers sont pr+�sent+�s dans les documents d'orientation et autres prises de positions en la mati+�re. Ainsi, l+� o+� les fonctionnaires et les agents des organisations non gouvernementales d+�peignent fr+�quemment la migration irr+�guli+�re comme une aspiration inexorable des migrants, ceux-ci soulignent bien davantage le caract+�re non souhait+� de leur d+�placement. Et l+� o+� de nombreuses sources d+�crivent la migration irr+�guli+�re comme un sympt+�me de la mondialisation et des flux transnationaux de populations, de capitaux et d'id+�es, les demandeurs d'asile contraints +� l'ill+�galit+� faute d'un vrai syst+�me d'asile en Ukraine, soulignent surtout les entraves et les difficult+�s qui sont les leurs, +� commencer par la d+�tention et l'isolement. Avant de consacrer davantage d'efforts +� la lutte contre la migration irr+�guli+�re, l'auteur estime qu'il serait utile de prendre en consid+�ration les exp+�riences traumatisantes v+�cues par les migrants, qui ont pour effet de les briser et de faire d'eux des ind+�sirables et des hors-la-loi. Contrairement +� la tendance consistant +� pr+�senter les migrants comme la source m+�me du probl+�me, cet article fait valoir que ce sont les r+�gimes migratoires internationaux qui doivent +�tre amend+�s et am+�lior+�s. // ABSTRACT IN SPANISH: Con la ampliaci+�n de las fronteras europeas Ucrania se ha convertido en el centro de atenci+�n al ser pa+�s de origen y de tr+�nsito de migrantes irregulares. La migraci+�n irregular ocupa un lugar destacado en las agendas internacionales de seguridad y pol+�ticas, porque constituye una amenaza para la seguridad europea y se relaciona con problemas delictivos y de drogas. En el debate sobre c+�mo encauzar la migraci+�n, son contadas las veces en que se escucha la voz de los migrantes. Analizando los art+�culos y testimonios de migrantes, se arguye que cabe revisar las hip+�tesis sobre los migrantes irregulares que se exponen en los documentos pol+�ticos y de trabajo, a la luz de la experiencia propiamente dicha de los migrantes. Por ejemplo, si bien los funcionarios y empleados de organizaciones no gubernamentales describen con frecuencia la migraci+�n irregular como una lucha inexorable, los migrantes por su parte destacan principalmente el car+�cter indeseado de sus movimientos. Asimismo, a pesar de que los pa+�ses de origen consideran la migraci+�n irregular como un s+�ntoma de la globalizaci+�n y de las corrientes transnacionales de personas, capitales e ideas, los solicitantes de asilo que se convierten en ilegales, ante la inexistencia de un s+�lido sistema de asilo en Ucrania, relatan sus vidas sumamente restrictivas que incluyen la detenci+�n y el aislamiento. Antes de encaminar m+�s empe+�os a la lucha contra la migraci+�n irregular, habr+� que tener en cuenta los relatos de los migrantes sobre sus experiencias traum+�ticas y transformadoras cuando pasan a ser 'ilegales' y quedan desconectados del todo. Si bien se tiende a considerar a los migrantes como un problema, este art+�culo apunta a que son los regimenes internacionales de migraci+�n y no los migrantes los que deben enmendarse y mejorarse.

AB  - Each year, over 100,000 children are apprehended entering the United States unaccompanied by parents or legal guardians, and without valid immigration documents. As many as 8,000 of these children are placed in an elaborate system of border patrol detention centers, shelter facilities, and courts. While the Department of Health and Human Services (through the Office of Refugee Resettlement) funds programs that care for the undocumented immigrants, the Department of Justice, (through the Department of Homeland Security) sweeps up and deports the very same children (or their parents). Apprehended children therefore bring to light the competing agendas of security and humanitarianism. Based on interviews with policy makers and program officers, visits to the shelters, and interviews with the children, this article explores the politics of compassion surrounding these migrants. In order to provide more humane and egalitarian response to the migration, the tensions and contradictions inherent in current practices need to be made more conscious. Considering migration from Mexico, Central America, China, and India, the paper challenges the racially and ethnically-coded system that protects some children more than others. Rather than dismantling the politics of compassion, what is needed is a clearer understanding of the children's paths to the United States, and a system without the racial and ethic hierarchies that are currently in place. Otherwise, children will be confined to the space between the war on terror that treats immigrants, even below the age of 18, as security threats, and politics of compassion that emerged from early 21st century immigration reform.

A series of anecdotal reports on the successful use of oral rehydration on refugees, in famine and poverty, on medical students, prisoners, and the well-off people of western countries, is presented. The essential principles of oral rehydration are identified and we show how these can be adapted to a particular health care setting. A clear understanding of local attitudes and beliefs about diarrhoea is essential to professional health workers if they are to act as agents of change.

AB  - The purpose of this dissertation is to understand the recent revival of culture and identity among second, third, and fourth generation Okinawans in Hawaii. This revival challenges the teleological assumption that all immigrant groups willingly and naturally shed their cultures and identities on their way toward becoming less "strange" and more "American." To analyze Okinawan culture and identity in Hawaii, this dissertation takes a global and transnational perspective that includes Okinawa's geopolitical role in East Asia since the 15th century as well as its present role as a site for the bulk of the U.S.'s military facilities in Japan as well as a local perspective that looks at the particular racial and ethnic dynamics that Okinawans were injected into when they began immigrating to Hawaii in 1900. Culture and identity were found to be integral to the efforts of Okinawans in Hawaii to find and create meaning in their diasporic existence. More specifically, this dissertation documented the agency of Okinawans in Hawaii in expressing, preserving, and defining their culture and identity in resistance to being absorbed by both the larger Japanese immigrant community as well as mainstream American society. Consequently, Okinawan culture and identity are approached as formations that change over time and space rather than static "things." Simultaneously, this dissertation also found that Okinawan culture and identity are being influenced by the restructuring of power relations between the U.S. and Japan in which the later is expected to play a greater international role commensurate with its economic power but is restrained by post-war constitutional reforms against militarism. In this context, Okinawa, which has always been seen as on the borderlands between Japan and the rest of the world, and its overseas diaspora have an important role in Japan's efforts to bolster its image as an "internationalizing" nation

Section 11 of the Children Act 2004 places a duty on specified public bodies and key individuals to carry out their functions having regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children. This applies across a wide range of public activity, from schools to prisons. Section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 now places a similar duty on the UK Border Agency. In 2008, the Government lifted its general reservation relating to immigration on the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and in January 2009 introduced a statutory Code of Practice for the UK Border Agency on Keeping Children Safe from Harm. The Code is superseded by this new duty which now places the UK Border Agency on the same footing as other public bodies working with children

AB  - This report has been produced collaboratively by UK NGOs Against Racism, a group of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) from across the UK working to promote race equality and human rights. It brings together their responses to the UK Government�_Ts 18th and 19th Periodic Reports to the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD), and provides an NGO perspective on developments in race relations in the UK. In particular, it highlights some of the most significant changes that have occurred since the Government report was submitted in February 2010, notably the policies and new proposals instigated by the Coalition Government since they came into power in May 2010. The report starts by providing recommendations for actions the Government should take to promote race equality and eliminate racial discrimination in accordance with the International Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD).

AB  - A series of decisions made by successive UK governments with the aim of reducing the flow of immigration has impacted in countless ways on those seeking asylum. The recently published 5-year strategy for asylum and immigration ( Home Office, 2005 ) has potentially very serious implications for unaccompanied asylum seeking children with the government making plans to commence routine detention and deportation of these children if their asylum claim is not accepted. This paper aims to lay out recent legislation in relation to the treatment of unaccompanied 16- and 17-year old young people seeking asylum and to outline the complex asylum process negotiated by these young people

T1  - Understanding the psychological impact of war trauma and the refugee camp experience on Cambodian refugee children residing in Site Two [dissertation]
T2  - Harvard University, 1994.370 pp.
A1  - Son Linda
KW  - eppi-reviewer
AB  - This dissertation focuses on children's psychological and behavioral responses to war trauma, specifically on 182 Cambodian refugee adolescents, ages 12 and 13, who were survivors of the Pol Pot regime and residents of the Site Two refugee camp in Thailand. Subjects were exposed to prolonged war trauma conditions consisting of deprivations of food, water, shelter, and medical care; witnessing the death of family or friends; exposure to shelling and bombing; imprisonment; beatings and injuries; and separation from family. Unlike past studies on children, war trauma and PTSD, this study systematically tests the relationship between specific war trauma events and psychological and behavioral problems, assessed via a culturally sensitive survey and a self-evaluation instrument, the Youth Self Report (YSR). The objectives of this study are to determine the relationship between the total number of behavior problems, chronic problems, and tendencies toward internalizing/externalizing behaviors (from the YSR) with specific war trauma events, levels of trauma, and children's total trauma experience and to identify a set of culture-specific syndromes including a culture-specific trauma syndrome. The Cambodian refugee children in this subject sample had more behavior and psychological problems than the children in Achenbach's normative Western sample. The expectation that Cambodian refugee children use internalization to express their behaviors and emotions was confirmed. Contrary to expectations, the number of war trauma events and levels of war trauma were not highly correlated with the total number of problems experienced. However, a principal component analysis and varimax rotation conducted on the individual behavior problem items listed in the YSR yielded 11 culture- and war-specific syndromes. Correlations of the 11 syndromes with trauma confirmed a culture-specific trauma syndrome for the children in this sample. This 20-item syndrome consisted of symptoms of hyperactivity, poor concentration, attention-seeking behaviors, and fearfulness. Nightmares, a pathognomic symptom of the DSM III-R diagnosis of PTSD and a universal indicator of emotional distress in children, correlated highly with level of trauma and with the trauma syndrome as did specific war trauma events with the syndrome scores on the YSR and the trauma syndrome.

AB  - The American plains bison (Bison bison) was pushed to the brink of extinction in the late 1800s but has since rebounded. Less than 5% of animals currently exist in conservation herds that are critical for maintaining genetic variability. Here, we use 25 microsatellite loci to assess genetic diversity and patterns of mating success over a 3-year period in a managed conservation herd at Konza Prairie Biological Station, Kansas (total number of individuals genotyped = 587). Heterozygosity was comparable to and allelic diversity higher than that in 11 other wild and managed herds for which similar estimates are available. Parentage analyses revealed that males within the oldest age classes (5�_"7 years) sired >90% of calves over the study period, consistent with a polygynous breeding system. Asymmetries in siring success also were observed within age classes, with the same males enjoying high siring success over multiple seasons. Empirical results of paternity will facilitate future modeling and empirical efforts to determine how demographic factors, population size, and variation in siring success interact to determine the retention (or loss) of genetic diversity in natural and managed herds, thus allowing informed recommendations for management practices and conservation efforts of this symbolic North American species.

AB  - This Rule establishes a separate immigration parole review process for certain detained, excludable nationals of Cuba who came to the US during the 1980 Mariel Cuban boatlift. The effect of the Rule is to institute several levels of review to determine whether the Mariel Cubans should be paroled and to set forth procedures governing such parole decisions. It establishes a new Departmental Release Review Program under the general supervision of the Associate Attorney General which will provide eligible aliens, otherwise denied parole, with an additional review. full text

AB  - The handbook provides a brief overview of relevant international standards and norms to aid those with criminal justice monitoring functions. It is designed to serve as a basis for reporting on local law enforcement activities. The handbook can also be used to plan and implement training courses or to develop training curricula. The legal status of the standards and norms varies. Provisions contained in multilateral treaties concluded under the auspices of the United Nations, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, impose specific obligations on parties that ratify or accede to them. Other standards, such as the Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials, aim to avoid possible human rights abuses and to ensure humane practices. Some of the norms, including the Geneva Conventions, have the status of customary international law. The handbook defines the police role in international peacekeeping operations and covers arrest, the use of force, firearms, trials, victims, detainees and prisoners, torture and other cruel treatment, illegal executions, genocide, humanitarian rules, and refugee protection. 20 references and 108 notes

AB  - The Model Treaty on Extradition derives from an assessment of the needs and difficulties of countries in extradition procedures. It imposes clear and concise obligations and contains acceptable safeguards for the requesting States, to whom extradition cannot be arbitrarily refused; the requested state, which maintains sovereignty and rights to protect fugitives and nationals from unacceptable detention or treatment; and the fugitive, who has ample opportunity to have his/her particular circumstances examined. The Model Treaty is guided by new trends in extradition and by useful experiences with existing bilateral treaties. It provides a wider basis for extradition arrangements. Omitting the requirement to establish a prima facie case, it adopts the minimum penalty definition of extraditable offenses, in contrast to the list-of-offenses approach for establishing double criminality. Under the Model Treaty, a state that refuses to extradite one of its own citizens is expected to bring proceedings against that person at the request of the requesting state, or to enforce a sentence imposed by the latter state. The Model Treaty also accommodates the need for temporary surrender for trial of a person in the requesting state to continue existing procedure there or to serve any existing sentence

AB  - Children of asylum-seeking families who are confined in removal centres, experience physical, mental and social harm, according to a new report by the charity organization Bail for Immigration Detainees. The report findings, based on nine in-depth interviews with detained families, says families with children were traumatised by being kept in removal centres for between 81 and 161 days. The report says that the detention process may involve excessive physical force, intimidation and inadequate time for the family to pack their belongings or sort out their affairs. Health care advice and treatment available to families and children in detention is also insufficient. The organization recommends that, as long as it remains legal to detain children, safeguards to limit the damage must be introduced

AB  - The dissertation examines the work of three sansei (third generation) Japanese American artists, Roger Shimomura, Tomie Arai, and Lynne Yamamoto in order to interrogate the complex relationship between memory, history, and Japanese American identity. These artists utilize various forms of memory communication in their art such as diaries, photographs, and oral history. By delving into their families' history and memory, these artists contribute to a broader understanding of their ethnic identity and particularized history in the United States. Their recovery of family memories has translated into bodies of work that highlight aspects of Japanese American experience influenced by each artist's distinct regional upbringing or residence, gender, age and sexuality. Much existing literature in Japanese American studies is dominated by a discourse that engenders a narrow definition of Japanese American identity as inextricably linked with the internment camp experience. The discourse tends to privilege this particular historical event and the stories surrounding internment, while simultaneously marginalizing those narratives that fall outside the purview of incarceration. My study recognizes internment as integral to the formulation of Japanese American subjectivity, particularly through a discussion of Shimomura's work that draws upon his grandmother's memories of internment, yet argues that there are other avenues by which to depict Japanese American experience. The dissertation also asserts that due to the force of internment in Japanese American culture, Japanese American artists, such as Shimomura, struggle with how to acknowledge and explore the history of internment and at the same time prevent it from solely defining their representation of Japanese American identity. Through the chapters on the art of Yamamoto and Arai, we can begin to see more clearly how Japanese American artists are steering away from the singular depiction of internment and instead portraying Japanese American experience in more nuanced ways. Their art creates amore comprehensive conceptualization of Japanese American subjectivity through work that examines subjects such as immigrant women's labor and history, and the racial and social stratification in Hawaii during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries

AB  - Overall, public support for international education and language training has remained very high despite some concerns that such support would decrease post-9/11. However, in some areas and especially for those over the age of 30, the public has concerns about study abroad and international students and international scholars on U.S. campuses (ACE, 2002). While there is generally strong support for these activities and groups, that support decreases when respondents are asked how likely they are to encourage a family member to participate in study abroad or about international students and scholars at their local institutions (ACE, 2002, p.1). This study provides an analysis of the impact of federal policy regulations on foreign student (F-1) enrollment at three distinct U.S. higher education institutions: (1) Yale University, (2) the University of Virginia, and (3) Northern Virginia Community College - Annandale Campus. The two major pieces of legislation affecting international study in the U.S. are the Immigration & Naturalization Act of 1952 and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRAIRA). The INA is enveloped in IIRAIRA due to the latter amending the former. Thus, they are companion pieces of legislation that overlap and reinforce one another. Because of the public outcry following the events of September 11, both laws were amended by the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002 and the USA Patriot Act of 2001. However, while the above acts are related to IIRAIRA, they do not significantly change the legislation. Thus, the major focus of this study is on IIRAIRA. In addition to providing an analysis of the impact of the policy regulations on foreign student enrollments (specifically F-1 students), specific areas of impact will include the notion of student adjustment to U.S. culture, enrollment/retention issues, and the potential impact of the new Immigration and Naturalization Service's (INS) Internet-based system, known as the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS)

AB  - The authors served as psychiatrists during the recent war in Croatia, 1991�_"1995. From the onset of this armed conflict in the former Yugoslavia, their group provided mental health and psychiatric care to waves of refugees, displaced persons, soldiers and former prisoners of war. Such care was also provided to civilians living under the threat of warfare. In this endeavor, the Croatian health service received considerable assistance from international non-governmental organizations. Since the war, professionals in the mental health field have continued to provide help, support and various kinds of treatment to people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, coping difficulties and personality changes. Four regional psychotrauma centers (RPCs) have been established in Croatia, together with a network of counseling centers set up as governmental agencies. The Regional Psychotrauma Center of Split (southern Croatia) that serves war veterans and their families will be described herein. Research data will be presented and discussed.

AB  - This dissertation examines Miguel de Unamuno's two collections of political poetry written in exile: De Fuerteventura a Paris (1925) and Romancero del destierro (1928), as exemplars of the fragility of art within the wider cultural and historical context of dictatorial Spain, especially the Spain of Franco. My argument traces his artistic objectives during his six year exile, as he attempted to create a popular national conscience by shaking each and every citizen with his words. Chapters One and Two set and explain the socio-political stage that gave rise to the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera, and illustrate how Unamuno's public reactions to the times and to the nation's governmental decisions led to his confinement on the island of Fuerteventura. Apart from their historical and biographical significance, specific economic, social and political circumstances (from the explosion of World War I to the establishment of a military state in Spain) are equally essential in order to understand his particular view of politics, and to appreciate fully the poetry he wrote in exile. Chapter Three analyzes the reasons for his dismissal as a poet, and, most importantly, the critical rejection of the aforementioned volumes. I conclude that Unamuno's controversial stands intensified an already overzealous and reactionary state censorship of his works. This fact, in combination with a baffling lack of critical interest about the writer's poetic theory, unjustly diminish the artistic reputation of a poet who deserves a better fate. Chapters Four and Five provide a close contextual and textual reading of De Fuerteventura a Paris. Chapter Six concentrates on the second book, Romancero del destierro. While both collections compose poignant and memorable poetry, they also express the importance of everyday events for a poet who believed that the creative process must serve a social obligation. In addition, these poems function as a key to a period in Spanish history overlapped by yet another oppressive military regime

STATE REPORTS FOCUS ON WOMEN'S ISSUES RANGING FROM EQUAL CREDIT AND EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. A SECOND MAJOR AREA OF RESEARCH HAS BEEN CIVIL RIGHTS IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, PARTICULARLY IN PRISONS AND IN POLICE-COMMUNITY RELATIONS. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MINORITY STAFFING OF CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS REFLECT AWARENESS OF THE NEED FOR EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND FOR ETHNIC AND CULTURAL SENSITIVITY BETWEEN PRISONERS AND THEIR KEEPERS. AT THE SAME TIME, SHIFTING COMPOSITION OF THE CITIES REQUIRES LOCAL POLICE FORCES TO BE SENSITIVE TO THE EVER-CHANGING CULTURAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THEIR COMMUNITIES. INCREASED RECRUITMENT OF INDIGENOUS POLICE OFFICERS AND LOCALLY INITIATED TRAINING ARE RECOMMENDED. IN ALL, THESE REPORTS IDENTIFY 15 ISSUES: EDUCATION; EMPLOYMENT; WOMEN'S ISSUES; SUCH SPECIAL GROUPS AS BLACKS, HISPANICS, ASIAN, AND PACIFIC AMERICANS; HOUSING; CIVIL RIGHTS ENFORCEMENT; INDIGENOUS GROUPS SUCH AS AMERICAN INDIANS AND NATIVE ALASKANS; PRISONS; POLICE-COMMUNITY RELATIONS; ECONOMIC ISSUES; VOTING AND POLITICAL PARTICIPATION; INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS; MIGRANTS; HEALTH AND SAFETY; AND UNDOCUMENTED ALIENS

AB  - Under this program, the FBI helps State and local governments apprehend State and local fugitives believed to have fled the State to avoid prosecution, custody, confinement, or giving testimony. Study data came from interviews with Federal, State, and local criminal justice officials in the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia, and on analysis of budget and program data and other records. A 1984 internal audit by the FBI showed both the FBI and the Marshals Service to be effectively performing fugitive investigations. It is not clear whether money would be saved by transferring the program, because the number of added staff the Marshals Service would need is not known. Transferring the program might free FBI agents to work on higher priority matters such as terrorism and organized crime. However, if the Marshals Service did not receive enough resources, its existing activities might suffer. FBI officials have presented 14 arguments against transferring the service. Reasons include the higher number of FBI locations, better after-hours coverage, and the access to the FBI's detailed case files. Tables and definitions

AB  - Out-of-school youth, including runaways and homeless migrants, and those incarcerated, are at greater peril of acquiring AIDS than other youth, because they are more likely to engage in high-risk sexual and drug activities. In obtaining information on the status of the CDC's efforts to educate out-of-school youth about AIDS, this study examined CDC records and interviewed CDC officials as well as officials of national organizations funded to reach such youth and officials of selected community-based organizations. The study found that the CDC has accomplished relatively little in providing HIV education to out-of-school youth. This is because CDC's Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (CCDPHP), which has the primary responsibility for youth, initially targeted the larger in-school population; the State and local education agencies funded to serve all youth lacked experience with those out of school and the organizations that serve them; and few guidelines and education materials were available. CCDPHP plans to fund local health departments of community organizations to act as focal points for providing services to out-of-school youth, including HIV education; however, this strategy is already being implemented by another center within CDC, the Center for Prevention Services. The CDC should consider whether the out-of-school youth component of CCDPHP should be merged with CDC's existing prevention programs. Appended supplementary information and 2 figures

During 1992, the CRS sought to reduce tensions and conflicts based on race, color, and national origin; to provide outplacement and medical and mental health services to Mariel Cubans; and to provide resettlement services to Cuban and Haitian nationals paroled from detention by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Regional and field offices of the CRS reported 2,117 incidents based on race, color, and national origin and 1,700 calls to the CRS toll- free hotline. Administration of Justice (AOJ) alerts to the CRS totaled 844 in 1992, 325 of which concerned police- community relations, 252 excessive use of force, 41 corrections, and 226 general AOJ issues. General Community Relations alerts numbered 1,526; 523 involved interracial confrontation, 77 community disorders, 130 employment and recruitment, 123 demonstrations, 122 housing and land use, 54 voting rights, 32 health and the environment, 13 transportation, 11 revenue sharing, and 441 general. CRS staff reported 546 incidents of potential conflict involving hate violence or harassment in 1990 and 385 in 1991. During fiscal year 1992, the CRS resettled 10,747 Haitians from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, 428 of whom were unaccompanied minors. The CRS outplaced 507 Mariel Cuban ex-offenders, 435 through halfway houses and 72 through the family sponsorship program.

AB  - Although asylum seekers have been coming to The Netherlands since the 1980s, very few epidemiological studies have focused on this group of inhabitants, or on the refugees who have resettled in this country. The objective of this study is to estimate the use of health care services by refugees and asylum seekers and to identify determinants for this utilisation. Methods: A population-based study was conducted in The Netherlands from June 2003 to April 2004 among adult refugees and asylum seekers from Afghanistan, Iran, and Somalia. A total of 178 refugees and 232 asylum seekers, living in 3 municipalities and 14 reception centres, participated. Results: This study showed that there are no differences between refugees and asylum seekers in the self-reported use of health care services. Respondents from Somalia reported less contacts with a general practitioner, less use of mental health services, and less medication use than respondents from Afghanistan and Iran. Both female gender and older age were related to more contacts with a general practitioner and a medical specialist, and with higher medication use. Poor general health was related to more contacts with a medical specialist and mental health services, and with higher medication use. Conclusion: Asylum seekers and refugees seem to have equal access to the Dutch health care system in general. However, there are differences in the self-reported use of health care services by the different ethnic groups

At least one early-warning system in Indonesia is in place and working. Researchers, now of the Burnet Institute in Melbourne, Australia, published a 1990 study showing that vaccine-preventable measles infections had helped push the mortality rate of children in Ethiopian and Sudanese refugee camps to 60 times the normal rate. In spite of intense efforts, the tsunami's destruction prevented aid workers from reaching the northwest coast of Aceh for nearly 3 weeks, leaving officials worried that preventable disease, especially malaria and leptospirosis, may be spreading

AB  - This investigation is about the theological perspectives in Ezra and Nehemiah on the concept of 'Yahweh's people' during the early post-exilic period (539-350 BC). The study has utilized literary and historical methods with a theological perspective because the text of the Bible is a literary, historical and theological document (cf Gorman 2001:8; McKenzie & Haynes 1999:20-21). The books of Ezra and Nehemiah formed primary sources of the research. The Abrahamic and the Mosaic covenants as well as the Ancient Near Eastern Treaty pattern have also been investigated. The study reveals that there is an exclusive and inclusive theological perspective in Ezra and Nehemiah and in the Abrahamic/Mosaic covenants on the concept of 'Yahweh's people' and other nations, foreigners and aliens. Consequently, the author(s)/editor(s) of the books of Ezra and Nehemiah re-interpreted certain passages from the Pentateuch and from deuteronomic-deuteronomistic history in a peculiar way to support the exclusive religious and social reforms of Ezra and Nehemiah. Hence, an inclusive theological perspective of the Abrahamic and the Mosaic covenants on the concept of 'Yahweh's people' and other nations, foreigners and aliens has been sidelined or at least ignored. On the contrary, this investigation demonstrates that Israel and virtually all other nations, races and people could become 'Yahweh's people' through appropriate covenant means. The covenant framework include: Yahweh's promise to become the God of the patriarchs as well as the God of Israel; the function of Abraham as the father of a multitude of nations; circumcision; the blessing of other nations via Abraham and his descendants; food provision; Sabbath keeping; celebration of Passover, feasts of Weeks and Tabernacles; equality of both the Israelites and the aliens before the law of Yahweh; through intermarriage; sacrificial offering and cities of refuge. As a consequence, the researcher argues that the exclusive theological perspective that has influenced the reforms of Ezra and Nehemiah on the basis of the two above named covenants is a one sided understanding of the Abrahamic and the Mosaic covenant perspective on the concept of 'Yahweh's people'. A close reading of the two covenants reveals the openness of Yahweh, the God of Israel to all nations, races, peoples and ethnic groups. All those who embrace him as their God through appropriate covenant means could be regarded as 'Yahweh's people'. Yahweh cannot be confined to a single place or group of people as presupposed in Ezra and Nehemiah. He cannot be localised!

AB  - This dissertation presents a longitudinal study of the adaptation of Japanese immigrant families to an American environment. It illustrates how the interaction of environment and pre-migration culture molded the families' life strategies in response to specific political, economic, and social conditions in California in the first half of the twentieth century. It examines how families change by analyzing issues of migration, work organization, and gender and generational relationships. This study combines four major sources of government documents. First, Annual Reports of the Commissioner General of Immigration, from 1890 to 1925; second, Census Reports from 1910 to 1950; third, State of California's Bureau of Labor Statistics reports from 1887 to 1928; fourth, War Relocation Authority (WRA), documents, reports, memos and letters. This data is supplemented by Congressional and State of California reports, diaries, letters, autobiographies and published and unpublished individual and family histories. Environmental factors played a key role in shaping the Japanese families' options, particularly a hostile policy reflecting conflicts of race and economic competition. State and federal laws imposed immigration restrictions, denied Japanese and other Asian groups the right of citizenship, and curtailed their economic activities. Japanese families utilized selective aspects of their Meiji culture to challenge racial discrimination and to meet the opportunities of a developing Pacific Coast economy. They adapted the family economy, in which the family was organized as a productive unit. Through hard work, thrift, unpaid family labor, and group cooperation, the Japanese created pockets of specialization in the expansion of intensive crop production and distribution. However with the passage of time, the birth and growth of the Nisei generation, and changing conditions led to new patterns of family interaction. Japanese American's incarceration in World War II accelerated the shift from an Issei to a Nisei-oriented family structure. Family tensions increased as individualistic concerns replaced familial ones. Work shifted from a Issei dominated family economy to one controlled by WRA with Nisei sharing authority. After the war, family wage economy replaced the pre-war Issei family and ethnic economy

AB  - In this article we analyze the independent migration of Moroccan children and youth to Southern Europe. The key issue is represented not just by the appearance of the minor as a new migratory actor, but by the process of institutional manipulation of images and narratives related to them. We argue that this process is new for its way of shaping the public narrative of the migrant in Europe. This contribution aims to demonstrate how the process of derogatory classification set up for these migrants is influencing the representations of childhood in Morocco. We argue that this process is coherent with the �_~outsourcing�_T of the management of European borders. We claim that the transnational alliance in category (re)production hinders the social change, maintaining lower class youth in their assigned social rank and space. In this sense, independent migration represents a breach of the confinement and an investment in an �_~elsewhere�_T which contrasts symmetrically with the prescribed social stillness of the contexts of origin.

AB  - Hong Kong's law is similar to that of Great Britain, but it has been codified. The prison system holds criminal offenders and, since 1988, illegal immigrants. It is generally oriented toward rehabilitative goals, although its conditions are harsh due to efforts at control and inmate discipline. In contrast, the refugee camps hold both refugees and those awaiting screening for refugee status. They represent only a human warehousing operation, and their harsh conditions result from the lack of control and discipline. Overcrowding is an increasing problem, and camp inmates appear to be increasingly prisonized in their responses to authority. Although Great Britain has offered places for some of the refugees and others may be repatriated to Vietnam, most will remain in Hong Kong and additional refugees are likely to arrive. The refugees and the numbers of illegal immigrants in prisons make unlikely any immediate improvements in the living conditions in the camps or the strict policies under which prisons are managed.

AB  - This article is part of a study on the phenomenon of grandparenting in the Tongan culture among grandparents and grandchildren living in the state of Hawaii and the island kingdom of Tonga. Grandparenting remains intrinsic to the Tongan cultural structure and central to the survival of the culture, particularly as Tongan immigrants experience cultural duality and acculturation. The location of Tonga and Hawaii were selected for this study because they reflect the common pattern of migration from Tonga to the US. Interviews were conducted with 12 Tongan grandparents living in Tonga and 12 Tongan grandparents living in Hawaii. In addition, focus groups were held with 30 grandchildren aged 13 to 18. The research aimed to explore grandparent-related family, social, cultural, spiritual, systemic, and economic-based factors that serve as possible sources of risk or protection for grandchildren. The findings show that the strong grandparent-grandchildren relationship can facilitate grandparents�_T ability to teach cultural values, beliefs, and practices as well as grandchildren�_Ts obligations to carry on these cultural customs and traditions. Themes identified as possible risk factors included cultural duality, language and acculturative barriers, low socioeconomic status, and low educational level. Possible protective factors included unconditional love, reciprocity, loyalty, discipline, and prayers

AB  - The study of non-U.S. citizens in criminal justice system outcomes has often been neglected in the sentencing literature. When citizenship is considered, there are generally no distinctions made within this group. The research fails to consider differences according to legal status, race/ethnicity, nationality and other distinctive markers that might play a role in sentencing outcomes. Using federal sentencing data collected by the United States Sentencing Commission for fiscal year 2006 through fiscal year 2008, this study examines the effect of offender citizenship status, legal status, and national origin on the likelihood of imprisonment and length of imprisonment for offenders convicted of drug offenses. The current study considers differences among foreign-born and Latino immigrant subgroups (e.g., Colombian, Cuban, Dominican, and Mexican nationals). The key findings in this dissertation include: (1) non-U.S. citizens have greater odds of imprisonment than U.S. citizens. However, non-U.S. citizen offenders receive significantly shorter prison terms relative to U.S. citizen offenders; (2) undocumented immigrants are more likely to be incarcerated compared to similarly situated authorized immigrants and U.S. citizens. However, legal status does not have an effect on sentence length; and (3) with respect to national origin, Mexican nationals are significantly more likely than Colombians to be incarcerated and are given significantly longer prison sentences than Dominican nationals. The implications of these findings and future research are addressed in the concluding chapter

AB  - The migration of mobile particles through porous networks is restricted when the size of the migrating particles approaches the size of pore throats. In this case, single particle retention or entrapment by bridge formation takes place. Experimental results show that bridge formation and stability are controlled by particle shape, relative throat-to-particle size, and skeletal forces. Forced-vibration studies provide additional insight into bridge stability and the potential for vibration-based unclogging, and show that it is easier to prevent bridge formation than to destabilize already formed bridges. Results from these pore-scale studies are relevant to filter clogging and unclogging, water and oil extraction, sand production in oil wells, and in food grain, aggregate and powder handling operations.

The study findings suggested that participation in Norwegian language training was the most important factor which contributed to user involvement, independence and empowerment of asylum seekers, that resident involvement, in the form of cooperative councils, also made a contribution to empowerment, but that user motivation for participation and involvement could also be undermined by various factors. The authors discuss the wider implications for social work with asylum seekers in other European countries

AB  - In most studies on reception accommodations for asylum seekers, the accommodations are associated with conflicts. Furthermore, reception accommodations are often described as areas, in which ethnic majority encounters ethnic minority. However, few studies take into consideration that the Norwegian reception system has changed and that encounters between residents and staff no longer solely are encounters between ethnic majority and ethnic minority. It is indicated that in most reception accommodations, one third or even half of the staff has immigrant or refugee background. This article focuses on this particular group of employees. On the one hand, our findings show that employees with immigrant and refugee background, who very often are ex-residents, may contribute to reducing conflicts and some of the negative processes usually associated with reception of asylum seekers and the reception accommodations. On the other hand, our findings indicate that their empathic and flexible approach may generate conflicts and is questioned both by their Norwegian colleagues and the asylum seekers.

AB  - In Norway, the labour migrant population, especially from eastern Europe, has been steadily increasing. This article focuses on the reception conditions for labour migrants from new EU member states during the period 2004 to 2009. The article also explores the perspectives of the service providers to the Nordic welfare system, including, for example, eliciting their views on whether and why they think there is a need for a recalibration of existing practice and policies. The article is based on an in-depth qualitative exploration of the experiences of welfare service providers in seven Norwegian municipalities. A total of 48 participants were drawn from relevant providers. Whilst the welfare rights of migrant workers are currently limited, the article proposes actions which may prevent permanent marginalisation and welfare dependence. The article suggests that migrant workers must be empowered to increase their employability through state sponsored integration assistance, thereby facilitating self-sufficiency among this group

AB  - The political Europe offers a specific figure if one considers the current efforts made to multiply within the Union and among its neighbours mechanisms of forced regrouping and confinement of exiles (asylum seekers, refugees, undocumented people, clandestine�_�). These systems are not new. What is new is the facility with which they are exposed in the public space as instruments and purpose to public policies. This reveals a profound transformation of the European cultures and of the governance in respect to exiles previously seen as victims in need of help and currently considered as threatening guilty people. But this European convergence, often imputed to the public opinion, goes through three processes having elite origins : tile asylum rejection spiral, the national-security turn in respect to foreigners and to the European fight against immigration harmonization hidden by �� justice, liberty, security �� (JLS). The European political cultures thereby transform through the effect of the rise of government xenophobia. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] L'Europe politique offre une figure sp��cifique au regard des efforts actuels pour multiplier en son sein et chez ses voisins les dispositifs de regroupement forc�� et d'enfermement des exil��s (demandeurs d'asile, r��fugi��s, sans-papiers, clandestins�_�). La nouveaut�� r��side moins dans l'existence de ces dispositifs que dans la facilit�� avec laquelle ils sont affich��s dans l'espace public, comme instruments ou finalit�� de politiques publiques. Ceci r��v��le une transformation profonde des cultures europ��ennes et de la gouvernance �� l'��gard des exil��s, autrefois victimes �� aider, aujourd'hui coupables mena��ants. Hors cette convergence europ��enne, souvent imput��e aux opinions publiques, passe par trois processus dont on peut montrer l'origine ��litaire: la spirale du rejet des demandes d'asile, le tournant national s��curitaire �� l'��gard des ��trangers et l'harmonisation europ��enne de la lutte contre l'immigration sous couvert de �justice, libert��, s��curit���� (JLS). Les cultures politiques europ��ennes se transforment ainsi sous l'effet de la mont��e en puissance d'une x��nophobie de gouvernement.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Since 1990, 500000 people have fled from Liberia and Sierra Leone to Guinea, west Africa, where the government allowed them to settle freely, and provided medical assistance. We assessed whether the host population gained better access to hospital care during 1988-96 METHODS: In Gueckedou prefecture, we used data on major obstetric interventions performed in the district hospital between January, 1988, and August, 1996, and estimated the expected number of births to calculate the rate of major obstetric interventions for the host population. We calculated rates for 1988-90, 1991-93, and 1994-96 for three rural areas with different numbers of refugees FINDINGS: Rates of major obstetric interventions for the host population increased from 0.03% (95% CI 0-0.09) to 1.06% (0.74-1.38) in the area with high numbers of refugees, from 0.34% (0.22-0.45) to 0.92% (0.74-1.11) in the area with medium numbers, and from 0.07% (0-0.17) to 0.27% (0.08-0.46) in the area with low numbers. The rate ratio over time was 4.35 (2.64-7.15), 1.70 (1.40-2.07), and 1.94 (0.97-3.87) for these areas, respectively. The rates of major obstetric interventions increased significantly more in the area with high numbers of refugees than in the other two areas INTERPRETATION: In areas with high numbers of refugees, the refugee-assistance programme improved the health system and transport infrastructure. The presence of refugees also led to economic changes and a "refugee-induced demand". The non-directive refugee policy in Guinea made such changes possible and may be a cost-effective alternative to camps

AB  - This paper explores the stages of ethnic and religious adaptation and transformation of two immigrant groups: Christian Orthodox Egyptians -- Copts -- and Dutch Canadian Calvinists. While the Copts are relatively new to the religious tapestry of North America, the Calvinists established churches and other ethno/religious structures soon after their arrival in Ontario after World War II. Established Coptic migrant churches are "vessels of faith"; a source of emotional rejuvenation to nostalgic migrants; institutions for the retention and negotiation of an ethno-religious identity in immigrant societies; and facilitators for the integration of newcomers. Religious identity was more important than ethnic identity in the establishment of Dutch Calvinist churches and other organizations. The orthodox Calvinists, who believe that all of life is religious, undertook the building of their own structures because they could not find Canadian organizations based on their ideological and religious beliefs. The literature on other Canadian immigrant groups provides a context for the comparison between the Copts and the Dutch Calvinists. Research for both groups is based on oral histories and on historical information. The theoretical framework for this study is Driedger's (1996, 39) model of voluntary pluralism and integration. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]Cet article porte sur les ��tapes de l'adaptation ethnique et religieuse et la transformation de deux groupes immigrants : les Chr��tiens othodoxes coptes d'Egypte et les Calvinistes canadiens-hollandais. Tandis que les Coptes sont relativement nouveaux dans la toile de fond religieuse de l'Am��rique du Nord, les Calvinistes ont fond�� des temples et d'autres ��tablissements ethno-religieux d��s leur arriv��e en Ontario apr��s la deuxi��me guerre mondiale. Les ��glises coptes sont des "vaisseaux de foi" : une source de r��juv��nation ��motionnelle pour des immigrants nostal-giques, des institutions pour sauvegarder et accomoder une identit�� ethno-religieuse dans leurs associations, et un interm��diaire pour faciliter l'int��gration des nouveaux arrivants. L'identit�� religieuse ��tait plus importante que l'identit�� ethnique pour les Calvinistes quand ils ont fond�� leurs temples et autres organisations. Les Calvinistes orthodoxes, qui croient que tout est religieux dans la vie, ont d��cid�� de bǽtir leurs propres ��difices parce qu'ils ne trouvaient pas d'organisations canadiennes bas��es sur leurs convictions id��ologiques et religieuses. La documentation sur d'autres groupes immigrants au Canada fournit un contexte qui permet de comparer Coptes et Calvinistes hollandais. Les recherches sur les deux groupes sont bas��es sur des r��cits oraux et sur de l'information historique. Le cadre th��orique de cette ��tude suit le mod��le du pluralisme et de l'int��gration volontaire de Driedger (1996, 39).

AB  - Prosper Meniere (1799-1862) was born in Angers, where his father was a merchant. He finished his medical studies in Paris and subsequently became an assistant at the Hotel Dieu, first to the surgeon Dupuytren and later to the internist Chomel. Meanwhile he helped to combat an epidemic of cholera in the south of France, and he was personal physician to the imprisoned Duchess de Berry, who had returned from exile to reclaim the throne for the Bourbon dynasty. In 1838 he specialised in otology after he had been made head of the Institute for Deaf Mutes in Paris. In 1861 he described a group of patients who suffered recurrent attacks of vertigo as well as abnormal sounds and whose hearing deteriorated over the years. He attributed this condition to a disorder of the inner ear; this went against the prevailing opinion, which attributed most vertiginous attacks to cerebral congestion

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify low-risk groups among asylum seekers in the Netherlands that may be excluded from tuberculosis (TB) screening at entry or during follow-up METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of medical records of asylum seekers entering the country between January 1994 and March 1997 RESULTS: Medical records were available for 46,424 of the 96,000 asylum seekers (48%) in this period. One hundred and three pulmonary TB cases were diagnosed at entry (prevalence 222/100,000). Risk factors were age >11 years, history of imprisonment and country of origin at war or with TB incidence >100/100,000. During a mean follow-up period of 10 months, 51 pulmonary TB cases were diagnosed (incidence 134/100,000 person-years). Risk factors were age >11 years, old lesions on entry X-ray, and country of origin whose asylum seekers had a prevalence of TB at entry >200/100,000 CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that 1) those with abnormal X-ray at entry should receive preventive therapy after exclusion of active TB, or undergo intensive follow-up, 2) periodic screening is not indicated for immigrants from countries whose asylum seekers have a low prevalence of pulmonary TB at entry, and 3) children <12 years can be excluded from screening

AB  - The current practice of Islam in the United States prison system is a legitimate religious expression of Sunni Islam that emerged from new religious movements of black Americans during the last half of the twentieth century in Midwestern and Northeastern urban centers. Analysis of the progression of Black Muslim prisoners to a legitimate expression of Sunni Islam is based on historical methods of research. Evidence in support of the hypothesis is drawn from primary source material including archival and published documents of the Bureau of Prisons, and the Congress. Reliable secondary resources complement primary sources. Religious texts are limited to English translations of the Koran and ahadith . The analysis incorporates basic legal research principles. For a quarter century beginning in the late 1950s, incarcerated members of the Moorish Science Temple of America and the Nation of Islam shared the title "Black Muslims." Only a common African heritage tied these movements to global Islam. From that shared heritage, urban black Americans asserted their chosen self-identity as Muslims. This identity ensured an inherent sense of dignity and purpose for men incarcerated in a milieu far from that of their free world experience. The 1980s witnessed the strengthening of the Worldwide Community of Islam in the West, the first of the new religious movements with genuine ties to Sunni Islam. More recently Muslims adhering to the Sunni tradition in the prisons tend toward a strand of Salafism associated with a strict adherence to the Koran and ahadith in religious matters. This development is viewed by some as a threat to national security. Only with a clear understanding of the strands of Salafism can one understand how religious purity may be a positive life-changing experience for the incarcerated. Today the ritual dimension of Islam in prisons is similar to global Islam, but a certain cultural dimension is lacking. Black American Muslims do not share the cultural mores and experiences that shape free-world immigrant Muslim communities. This problem cannot be resolved without immigrant Muslims willing to support their black American brothers during incarceration and upon release from prison

AB  - To provide early diagnosis and prompt treatment for malaria, two interventions were compared in refugee camps in Kalpitiya, Sri Lanka. Community health volunteers (HV's) were trained in diagnosis and management of malaria on clinical grounds, while a field laboratory was established in another group of camps providing treatment after laboratory confirmation of a malarial infection. Patients with fever sought treatment from HV's on average after 2.74 days and from the field laboratory after 3.20 days. Although acceptance of both interventions was high, the effective catchment areas, especially of the HV's were small. Large numbers of health volunteers would be needed to cover all families, making it difficult to sustain supervision and necessary logistic support. For every malaria patient treated by HV's, three others would receive anti-malarial drugs unnecessarily. The maintenance of a field laboratory with a microscopist of the Anti-Malaria Campaign is not an economically viable option. Training of HV's in microscopy with a mechanism for cost recovery should be given serious consideration. HV's and diagnosis and treatment centers should be able to handle a wide spectrum of common diseases. A better option for Sri Lanka in the short term might be to improve existing general health facilities that are accessible to the refugee population

AB  - In this chapter, I will discuss some aspects of psychotherapy with political refugees. The exposition will be limited to political refugees who have had serious traumatic experiences, such as on the battlefield or physical and psychological torture during imprisonment. Moreover, only work with young adult political refugees will be discussed. The term young adult refers to persons who were between 16 and 26 years old at the time they asked for assistance, and who became traumatized during adolescence. Their traumatic experiences occurred during a period which is critical for personality development, and before the developmental tasks of adolescence had been sufficiently completed. In particular, I will discuss two of the issues which are relevant for psychotherapy with these young adults in some detail: (1) the so-called testimony method and (2) the analysis and use of dream material. I will atempt to show how both methods are aimed at the assimilation of traumatic experiences on the one hand, and at the stimulation of normal adolescent development on the other hand.

AB  - This dissertation is about rural, subsistence-level smallholder households' adoption of sustainable natural resource management (NRM) practices within the milieu of enduring disorder and persistent poverty. Theoretically, a sustainable livelihoods framework served to illuminate the interrelationships between households and biophysical and social landscapes, and the corresponding constraints and opportunities to adoption of NRM practices. The research provides insight into whether and how external assistance can be used more effectively to enable smallholder households to secure their basic needs, promote self-reliance, and adopt sustainable NRM practices as a means of breaking the unending cycle of natural resource degradation and persistent poverty. This research was accomplished with a case study of 55 individuals from four villages in upper Nimba County, Liberia, who attended an 18-week Integrated Pest Management-Farmer Field School (IPM-FFS). The training included seven low-external input and sustainable agriculture (LEISA) practices and two productive conservation practices. A grounded theory approach with complementary research techniques to incorporate qualitative and quantitative data collection was employed. Respondents completed in-depth, semi-structured interviews. Photo-documented field observations and interviews with key informants were used to verify and supplement data provided by IPM-FFS participants. The grounded theories regarding adoption under uncertainty are: (1) potential NRM practices must be compatible with predominant livelihood strategies and address sources of vulnerability; (2) anything that increases a household's exposure to risk--or their perceptions of exposure to risk--will seem less attractive, even if it could potentially provide dependable and lucrative sources of income; and (3) NRM practices will not succeed without a commitment to low input requirements--especially financial requirements--for households to be able to adopt. Appropriate ecological design interventions include: context-specific agro-ecosystem diversity, farmscaping, and the use of home gardens for small-scale experimentation of new NRM practices. The results are applicable to similar socio-political contexts and contribute to the fields of Natural Resource Management and Ecological Design. Chronic conflict and political instability present a challenge to development initiatives. Providing 'developmental relief' to households and communities is akin to ecosystem recovery following a perturbation. The flux between periods of peak crisis and stability present numerous opportunities for 'developmental relief' interventions beginning with training opportunities in refugee camps

AB  - Former political prisoners in Chile gave testimony of their traumatic experiences, which resulted in diminishing their posttraumatic symptoms. Based on this experience, testimony therapy has been developed and used in treatment of traumatized victims of war or other organized violence. This short-term therapy, as it applied in the treatment of traumatized asylum seekers and refugees in Centrum '45/De Vonk in the Netherlands, is described in this article. The therapy consists of 12 sessions in which patients tell their life stories, including the traumatic experiences. The narrative is reflected in a written document that, for example, can be read to family and friends, or be sent to a historical archive. This article discusses the preliminary research data on the effects of testimony therapy, finally, hypotheses on the working mechanisms of testimony therapy are offered.

AB  - 1. Within the broad field of optimal foraging, it is increasingly acknowledged that animals often face digestive constraints rather than constraints on rates of food collection. This therefore calls for a formalization of how animals could optimize food absorption rates. 2. Here we generate predictions from a simple graphical optimal digestion model for foragers that aim to maximize their (true) metabolizable food intake over total time (i.e. including nonforaging bouts) under a digestive constraint. 3. The model predicts that such foragers should maintain a constant food retention time, even if gut length or food quality changes. For phenotypically flexible foragers, which are able to change the size of their digestive machinery, this means that an increase in gut length should go hand in hand with an increase in gross intake rate. It also means that better quality food should be digested more efficiently. 4. These latter two predictions are tested in a large avian long-distance migrant, the Bewick's swan ( Cygnus columbianus bewickii), feeding on grasslands in its Dutch wintering quarters. 5. Throughout winter, free-ranging Bewick's swans, growing a longer gut and experiencing improved food quality, increased their gross intake rate (i.e. bite rate) and showed a higher digestive efficiency. These responses were in accordance with the model and suggest maintenance of a constant food retention time. 6. These changes doubled the birds�_T absorption rate. Had only food quality changed (and not gut length), then absorption rate would have increased by only 67%; absorption rate would have increased by only 17% had only gut length changed (and not food quality). 7. The prediction that gross intake rate should go up with gut length parallels the mechanism included in some proximate models of foraging that feeding motivation scales inversely to gut fullness. We plea for a tighter integration between ultimate and proximate foraging models.

AB  - The article discusses the study on the irregular migration issue and the violation of the European Union (EU) on the egalitarian principles on its borders. The study reveals that many migrants have died in the borders due to drowning and hypothermia, as well as the suffocation and asphyxiation during their trip on ships or trucks. On the other hand, significant people have committed suicide while waiting for citizenship or deportation in the detention and deportation centers. The study concludes that EU has violated all three egalitarian principles of a just moral border regime, such as making moral distinction between people, exclusion of bordering practices to the affected people and the unjust administration on people's faith according to their origin

AB  - Patterns of political legitimation in Indonesia experienced rapid transition between about 1910 and 1950. The nationalist reaction against colonialism is well-known, but this study emphasizes the minority views of a collaborating elite who found the colonial regime modernizing, namely middle class Indonesian Christians with political influence. Using a biographical approach, the study uncovers three, broadly Weberian, social mechanisms linking Christianity in Indonesia with the new political moralities. The first mechanism, typified by the Catholic Kasimo and the Protestant Gunung Mulia, is embourgeoisement. They preferred a secularized, technocratic politics of minimal moral consensus. The institutionalized nature of Catholicism led Kasimo's Catholic Party to compromise with power, and to oppose nationalist protest discourse. Gunung Mulia experienced a privatization of ultimate values that gave him an aversion to charismatic politics. The second mechanism, typified by the Protestant Ratu Langie, is re-traditionalization. In his majority-Christian Minahasa he appropriated the missionaries' Christianity for a neo-traditional legitimation discourse. His ideas had something in common with 'organic' ideologies among pre-war rulers in Japan and Europe. In the Netherlands Indies the reassertion of traditional hierarchies was a central element of policy. The third mechanism, typified by the Protestant Amir Syarifuddin, and for a time by the Catholic priest Sugiyopranoto, is radicalization. Like most religions, Christianity provides images of a utopian future. In times of upheaval these are articulated by charismatic 'prophets' against the status quo. Amir Syarifuddin converted to a sectarian form of Christianity whilst a radical nationalist student. Many young Indonesians regarded him as a charismatic hero, especially when he was imprisoned by the Dutch and later by the Japanese. In the early Republic he became Minister of Defence and Prime Minister, but upon his fall from power he reverted to charismatic modes of opposition and was executed for communism by Republican soldiers. Sugiyopranoto, Indonesia's first indigenous Catholic bishop, developed a charismatic role only during the war for national independence in the late 1940s. Though he adhered to hierarchical values, he spoke strongly against human rights abuse by Dutch soldiers when the Republic had almost no international recognition

AB  - BACKGROUND: To improve homelessness prevention practice, we met with recently homeless adults, to explore their pathways into homelessness, problems and service use, before and after becoming homeless METHODS: Recently homeless adults (last housing lost up to two years ago and legally staying in the Netherlands) were sampled in the streets, day centres and overnight shelters in Amsterdam. In April and May 2004, students conducted interviews and collected data on demographics, self reported pathways into homelessness, social and medical problems, and service use, before and after becoming homeless RESULTS: among 120 recently homeless adults, (male 88%, Dutch 50%, average age 38 years, mean duration of homelessness 23 weeks), the main reported pathways into homelessness were evictions 38%, relationship problems 35%, prison 6% and other reasons 22%. Compared to the relationship group, the eviction group was slightly older (average age 39.6 versus 35.5 years; p = 0.08), belonged more often to a migrant group (p = 0.025), and reported more living single (p < 0,001), more financial debts (p = 0.009), more alcohol problems (p = 0.048) and more contacts with debt control services (p = 0.009). The relationship group reported more domestic conflicts (p < 0.001) and tended to report more drug (cocaine) problems. Before homelessness, in the total group, contacts with any social service were 38% and with any medical service 27%. Despite these contacts they did not keep their house. During homelessness only contacts with social work and benefit agencies increased, contacts with medical services remained low CONCLUSION: the recently homeless fit the overall profile of the homeless population in Amsterdam: single (Dutch) men, around 40 years, with a mix of financial debts, addiction, mental and/or physical health problems. Contacts with services were fragmented and did not prevent homelessness. For homelessness prevention, systematic and outreach social medical care before and during homelessness should be provided

AB  - The scarce literature on the social lives of irregular migrants is dichotomized around two positions. The dominant view holds that irregular migrants have neither time nor opportunity to engage in recreational activities and that they are confined to their homes. Challenged by this perspective, a few scholars have described the various social activities their respondents engage in. Drawing on participant observation and 164 interviews with irregular migrants, this article demonstrates that an approach that takes aspirations as the central focus of analysis provides understanding of why irregular migrants value and spend their leisure time differently, and why some irregular migrants travel to see other places while others show limited geo-graphical mobility. Future research on the lives of irregular migrants should therefore take their aspirations into account. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] In de literatuur wordt doorgaans gesuggereerd dat irreguliere migranten vrijwel geen recreatieve activiteiten ondernemen en bovendien een zeer beperkte sociale leefwereld hebben.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We sought to identify personal factors that placed people at risk during an epidemic of medically unexplained illness in a Bhutanese refugee camp in southeastern Nepal. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study, involving 68 cases and 66 controls. Caseness was defined as experiencing at least one attack of medically unexplained fainting or dizziness during the time of the epidemic. We performed hierarchical logistic regression analysis to identify significant predictors of case status. RESULTS: In terms of Western psychiatric constructs, the illness involved somatoform symptoms of both acute anxiety and dissociation. 60% reported visual and 28% reported auditory hallucinatory experiences. Cases and controls were similar on all demographic variables, school performance, number of attacks witnessed, and psychopathology before the onset of the epidemic. Recent loss, early loss, childhood trauma, and pulse-rate were predictors of case status. CONCLUSION: We identified trauma, early loss, and especially recent loss as predictors of attacks during medically unexplained epidemic illness in a Bhutanese refugee community. [Author Abstract]

AB  - Sought to identify personal factors that placed people at risk during an epidemic of medically unexplained illness in a Bhutanese refugee camp in southeastern Nepal. We conducted a case-control study, involving 68 cases (mean age 15.8 yrs) and 66 controls. Caseness was defined as experiencing at least one attack of medically unexplained fainting or dizziness during the time of the epidemic. We performed hierarchical logistic regression analysis to identify significant predictors of case status. In terms of Western psychiatric constructs, the illness involved somatoform symptoms of both acute anxiety and dissociation. Sixty per cent reported visual and 28% reported auditory hallucinatory experiences. Cases and controls were similar on all demographic variables, school performance, number of attacks witnessed and psychopathology before the onset of the epidemic. Recent loss, early loss, childhood trauma and pulse-rate were predictors of case status. We identified trauma, early loss and, especially, recent loss as predictors of attacks during medically unexplained epidemic illness in a Bhutanese refugee community.

AB  - Previous research has indicated a relationship between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and somatic complaints. The authors examined whether this relationship is a result of shared comorbidity with anxiety and depression. Local doctors interviewed a random, community sample of 526 tortured (mean age 41.7 yrs) and 526 nontortured (mean age 41.5 yrs) Bhutanese refugees living in U.N. refugee camps in Nepal. The interview covered demographics, torture, somatic complaints, and PTSD, depression, and anxiety measures. Number of PTSD symptoms, independent of depression and anxiety, predicted both number of reported somatic complaints and number of organ systems involving such complaints. Physicians need to screen for PTSD when survivors of extreme stressors present nonspecific somatic complaints. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: The world's growing population of asylum seekers faces different health risks from the populations of their host countries because of risk factors before and after migration. There is a current lack of insight into their health status. Methods: A unique notification system was designed to monitor mortality in Dutch asylum seeker centres (2002-2005). Results: Standardised for age and sex, overall mortality among asylum seekers shows no difference from the Dutch population. However, it differs between subpopulations by sex, age and region of origin and by cause of death. Mortality among asylum seekers is higher than among the Dutch reference population at younger ages and lower at ages above 40. The most common causes of death among asylum seekers are cancer, cardiovascular diseases and external causes. Increased mortality was found from infectious diseases (males, standardised mortality ratio (SMR) = 5.44 (95% Cl 3.22 to 8.59); females, SMR =7 .53 (95% Cl 4.22 to 12.43)), external causes (males, SMR = 1.95 (95% Cl 0.52 to 2.46); females SI\/IR = 1.60 (95% Cl 0.87 to 2.68)) and congenital anomalies in females (SMR 2.42; 95% Cl 1.16 to 4.45). Considerable differences were found between regions of origin. Maternal mortality was increased (rate ratio 10.08; 95% Cl 8.02 to 12.83) as a result of deaths among African women. Conclusion: Certain subgroups of asylum seekers (classified by age, sex and region of origin) are at increased risk of certain causes of death compared with the host population. Policies and services for asylum seekers should address both causes for which asylum seekers are at increased risk and causes with large absolute mortality, taking into account differences between subgroups.

AB  - (from the chapter) Who was Otto Selz, and what was his principal contribution to psychology? In the first section of this chapter we shall present a brief overview of his career, that untimely was disrupted by his exile and tragic end as a victim of the holocaust. The second section will be devoted to a synopsis of his work, and to the intriguing question why his ideas found only a moderate response in his own time. The meager reception of his work will appear to be due both to an unfavorable scientific climate and to personal factors. During his life-time, as is shown in section three, his influence (apart from one study in musical creativity) was practically confined to the educational domain. It was only after his death that the seed he had sowed began to germinate, not only in the field of psychology, but in an unnoticed way also in philosophy. The fourth section deals with the latter: Selz's hidden influence on Karl Popper's critical rationalism. The fifth section recounts the rediscovery of his work by the "cognitivists", and its mediation by Adriaan de Groot's study of Thought and Choice in Chess. In the final section the fate of Selz is used to discuss the vicissitudes of influence and fame. It will be shown that "greatness" in science (as in other domains of culture) is only partly a matter of the personal genius of an individual, but principally a matter of the reception of his or her work, and the degree to which it becomes instrumental in the development of a new paradigm--in some cases only after several decades. In this transmission personal contacts play a much larger role than is often assumed. Apart from this, the function of "great men" in providing scientists with a respectable pedigree should not be underestimated. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (chapter)

Definitions of sexual violence, ways in which it occurs, and the effects on the victim are discussed. The individual cultural context of the refugee is taken into account. Survey responses from 17 reception centers documents that 129 clients had experiences of sexual violence. It is suggested that fear, anger, and/or powerlessness (feelings evoked by the discussion of violent experiences) may restrain both client and care provider.

AB  - Little is known about the language acquisition of refugees in Western countries. This study examines how pre- and post-migration characteristics of refugees are related to their second language proficiency. Data are from a survey of 3,500 refugees, who were born in Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, former Yugoslavia and Somalia, and who resided in the Netherlands. The analysis shows that speaking and reading skills are better among refugees who received more pre-migration schooling, who migrated from a major city, and who arrived in the host country at a younger age. Post-migration characteristics are also important. Language skills are better among refugees who only lived in a refugee reception center for a short while, who completed an integration course, who received post-migration education, who intend to stay in the host country, and who have fewer health problems.

SV generally happens to men during detention only, but happens to women during detention, house searches, interrogation, or their flight to exile. Refugees, particularly victims of imprisonment and torture and/or SV, may present SPs; however, refugees' cultural norms regarding sexuality often make them reluctant to discuss their experiences with care providers. It is recommended that during provision of care, respect should be shown for refugees' cultural norms and values related to SV and SPs.

AB  - Scientifically informed population management requires quantitatively accurate demographic rate functions that apply at the spatial scale at which populations are actually managed, but practical constraints confine most field measurements of such functions to small study plots. This paper employs an individual-based population growth model to extrapolate the death rate function in a well-studied coral reef fish, the bridled goby Coryphopterus glaucofraenum, from the scale of coral reef �_ocells�__ at which it was measured to the larger scale of an entire coral reef. Density dependence in the whole-reef function actually proves stronger than in the local function because high goby density occasionally arises in local patches with few refuges from predators, producing very high mortality there. This IBM-based approach extends the reach of scale transition theory by examining considerably more realistic models than standard analytical methods can presently handle.

All articles in the national edition of the New York Times related to the summit or Latin America during a two week period, December 5-18, 1994. The Times printed just two articles previewing the summit. On the day the hemispheric summit was to begin officially, December 8, 1994, Latin America finally made the front page of the Times, but only because U.S. soldiers were injured during riots by exiled Cubans being detained in Panama. Perhaps the most striking aspect of the New York Times' summit coverage was its paucity. Only once did the newspaper place the summit on the front page. That the Times chose to neglect the summit can be explained by the present convergence of three trends in global and hemispheric political economies. Each trend challenges certain elements of conventional wisdom or logic about the state of the world and the hemisphere, and the U.S. role in them. First, despite certain trends towards multipolarity in international alliances such as Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation and the non-aligned movement, a high degree of backyardism presently characterizes U.S. relations with Latin America. Exposing and specifying the New York Times' shortcomings takes on considerable importance given the various levels at which the newspaper's coverage of world news can influence political thinking and practice. It must be clear then that there is a need to make use of a wide range of sources in the alternative press in order to draw additional evidence, arguments and framework concerning the world and the U.S. role in it

AB  - (from the chapter) Although volumes have been written on suicide bombers and terrorists in general, the phenomenon of the female Palestinian suicide bomber is so new that little literature exists on the topic and no models account for their behavior. This chapter presents accounts of eight female Palestinian martyrs--or suicide bombers--including their education, marital status, family history, political zeal, significant associations, individual encounters with violence, and suggestions about each woman's breaking point. The term breaking point describes a pivotal experience each woman had almost immediately prior to her recruitment--an important element to help understand the motivation in the act. The eight women described here varied greatly in their relationship status at the time of their mission. Their socioeconomic status also varied; some were raised in refugee camps, but a few came from higher income families. It is useful to identify common characteristics, however. All seem to be educated and, although it has been pointed out that pain and suffering alone do not create the phenomenon, each woman was exposed to violence. For most of the women, loss of loved ones at the hands of the Israeli military seems to be a breaking point that propels them to their self-sacrificial mission. Another common characteristic is religiosity, though ranging from dedication to being extremely devout. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (chapter)

AB  - Research has shown that asylum seekers encounter more mental health problems than refugees, who officially have been granted asylum. It is highly probable that the explanation for this has to be sought in the current living conditions of asylum seekers. In this study, we concentrated on the structure and organisation of asylum seekers facilities. Sixteen in-depth interviews with asylum seekers were carried out, in two different settings: an asylum seeker centre and a small-scale facility. We examined how asylum seekers experience their life in the facility they were allocated, and what features have an impact on their well-being (from their point of view). Results show that the prohibition of work and the lack of meaningful activities are perceived as being most problematic. But worries about their future seem to be even more an impediment for well-being. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Uit onderzoek blijkt dat asielzoekers meer problemen hebben inzake mentale gezondheid dan vluchtelingen. De verkiaring hiervoor moet wellicht in de huidige leefomstandigheden van asielzoekers worden gezocht. In deze studie wordt de invloed van de structuur en de organisatie van de asielopvang onderzocht. Aan de hand van semi-gestructureerde interviews wordt nagegaan hoe asielzoekers de Belgische asielopvang beleven en welke opvangkenmerken naar hun aanvoelen een invloed hebben op hun welbevinden. Wat de opvangsituatie betreft, blijken het werkverbod en het gebrek aan een zinvolle dagbesteding als meest problematisch te worden ervaren. Daarnaast blijken echter vooral zorgen in verband met hun toekomst de asielzoekers te beletten zich echt goed te voelen.

AB  - Ad hoc clusters of settlements are surfacing in various parts of the world. These constellations, swelling at their bellies, are part of a geographical phenomenon involving millions of modern day migrators. The inhabitants are refugees, confined in a state of limbo, unable to return to their country of origin and prevented from integrating into the foreign land within which they sought sanctuary. Performing under strict institutional and governmental frameworks, the camps themselves are planned as temporary environments however the status quo would argue otherwise. What results is a form of exigent city, diagnosed with the ills of overcrowding, dependency and protracted uncertainty. Likened to a form of parasitism where the camps survival is contingent on the welfare of its host, and the continuing imprisonment and impermanency that circumscribe refugee camps enable this unbalance to persist, ultimately encouraging resentment and exhausting the good will of host communities. When it is no longer a matter of life and death, the provision of assistance based on short-term thinking plays out in the most unfavorable of ways when long term realities set in. Piecemeal infrastructure and a lack of foresight in planning and shelter have contributed to significant environmental problems, undesirable living conditions and wasted humanitarian funds. Through a symbiotic agency , can architecture facilitate a mutualism between parasite and host? This thesis hopes to reconcile the unbalanced relationship that exists by providing a series of interventions that prove more sustainable over time and are aimed at encouraging an independent livelihood

AB  - In Darfur, Sudan, since March 2003, between 170,000 and 255,000 non-Arab Darfurians have been killed in a genocidal campaign waged by the Government of Sudan. Diplomats, humanitarian aid workers, medical professionals, academics, human rights activists, journalists and legal scholars have engaged in vigorous and significant debate about whether these killings and related assaults constitute the crime of genocide, as defined in the UN Genocide Convention. This study focuses on the ways in which this conflict has caused sweeping destruction of livelihoods in Darfur, the pervasive effects of this destruction on the possibilities for long-term social survival, and the relevance of a livelihoods analysis to a key clause in the Genocide Convention. Physicians for Human Rights deployed three successive field investigations to Darfur and refugee camps in Chad order to study the destruction of lives and livelihoods and the means of survival. Survey teams selected a random sample of refugees from three pre-identified villages in Darfur, each representing one of the three major non-Arab Darfurian ethnic groups in the region. Survey teams employed structured key informant interviews and focus groups to collect both quantitative and qualitative data to explore the loss of livelihoods and lives to establish patterns of attack. From interviews with 46 respondents and six focus groups, investigators described the systematic nature of the violent attacks on villages, the close coordination of government military forces with the Janjaweed militia, and the patterns of destruction of livelihoods. The government of Sudan and its proxy militia, the Janjaweed, have created conditions of life for many thousands of non-Arab Darfurians that guarantee the destruction of their livelihoods, lives and communities. They have deliberately inflicted on the non-Arabs of Darfur conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction in whole or in part. These actions constitute genocide as such under the UN Genocide Convention, which obliges nations to both prevent and punish the crime.

AB  - This article reports on the release of Mordechai Vanunu. On April 21st, Mordechai Vanunu walked out of a prison in Ashkelon, in southern Israel, after 171/2 years, two-thirds of them spent in solitary confinement. Until 1985, Mr Vanunu worked as a technician at Israel's secret nuclear reactor at Dimona, in the Negev. Though he says he has no secrets left to spill, Mr Vanunu's contacts with foreigners and the media will still be restricted. One answer is that Israel is not a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Quite aside from the question of Mr Vanunu's rights, by cack-handedly helping him to attract the world's attention--rather than letting him drift into exile--Israel may now inadvertently be undermining the policy Mr Vanunu wanted to change

AB  - This paper argues that contemporary hegemonic projects such as �_~Fortress Europe�_T exercise violence at their borders forcing certain people to be borders. Those very borders and the people who inhabit them constitute paradoxically the very conditions of possibility of any hegemonic order. This paper focuses on Sangatte, the site of a Red Cross �_~reception centre�_T outside Calais for refugees and migrants seeking entry into Britain, as one manifestation of the border in the context of asylum and migration in Europe. This paper draws on contemporary Marxist and feminist theory to think through how those on the borders of the state provide real, material insights into practices that subvert the power of the sovereign state and its corollary hegemonic projects of violence, and to argue that attempts to envision alternatives to the contemporary hegemonic political orders in Europe must begin at the political apertures opened up by thinking the border as paradox.

AB  - My dissertation comprises of three essays in labor economics with specific focus on economics of fertility, migration and household behavior. In the first chapter, I empirically test the family bargaining model of collective decision-making within the household. The key issue in empirical analyses of such models is to quantify the bargaining power of wives relative to their husbands. Previous empirical studies have used wage income, nonwage income, current assets, assets brought to marriage, education and measures generated from responses to questions on household decision-making. All these measures are prone to endogeneity since they are correlated with individual and household characteristics and may also be subjected to measurement error. In particular, previous research on intrahousehold bargaining and fertility that use measures based on household decision-making do not instrument for their bargaining power measures and do not find any impact of female bargaining power on fertility. The OLS results in this study are consistent with the findings in the previous literature. However, the instrumental variables estimates reject the unitary model of household decision-making. Using the second wave of Indonesia Family Life Survey, this study analyzes the impact of female bargaining power on total number of births. A measure of power generated from binary responses to questions on wife's participation in expenditure related decision-making within the household is used to proxy for the true female bargaining power. This measure is instrumented using environmental variables, specifically; relative wage, types of credit institutes available and relative education in the community where the couple resides. The findings suggest that female bargaining power has a negative impact on number of live births. Furthermore, to ensure that this negative impact on births is not due to delayed births of younger women in the sample, we analyze the effect of bargaining power on live births for a restricted sample of women who have completed their fertility. We find, even for this restricted sample, a statistically significant negative impact of female bargaining power on number of live births. In the second chapter, which is joint work with Professor Seik Kim, we present a new test for the family investment hypothesis (FIH). We show that a simple two-period labor supply model produces testable implications on the work hours and occupational choices for married women. In credit-constrained households, married women financially support their families by working in dead-end jobs that do not necessarily require much skill. The support decreases as their families overcome credit-constraints. We analyze the occupation choices for married women using a first-order Markov switching model. Our findings, based on the matched March Current Population Survey (CPS) for 1996-2002, are consistent with the FIH. We replicate the annual hours worked specifications used in previous papers and demonstrate that the conventional results get reversed when the sample is confined to women who work in dead-end jobs. In the third chapter, I test the catch-up hypothesis for second generation married immigrant women in the United States by examining the distribution of occupations for first generation and second generation immigrants relative to native-born married women. This hypothesis states that second generation immigrants narrow the foreign-native gap in economic outcomes experienced by their parents. To test this hypothesis, I use March Current Population Survey (CPS) for 2003-2008 to identify first generation immigrants, second generation immigrants and native-born married couples. I also use the job zone classification data provided by the Occupational Information Network Database (O*Net), Department of Labor; which classifies occupations into five job zones; job zone 1 includes occupations which require minimal skill level and occupations in job zone 5 require the most skills. In addition, I categorize women who are not working in job zone 0. I find occupation choices of married immigrant women are different from those of married native women. They are less likely to participate in the labor force, more likely to work in low-skilled jobs (job zone 1) and less likely to work in high-skilled jobs (job zones 2-5). On the contrary, second generation married women have a distribution of occupations that is similar to that of native married women, in cases where they are different, they perform better than natives. Hence, the evidence is consistent with the catch-up hypothesis

AB  - Millions of women migrate to destinations in Asia and the Middle East to earn a living as domestic workers. In host countries, the combination of significant gaps in labour laws, restrictive immigration policies, and socially accepted discrimination against migrant workers has contributed to alarming human rights violations, including excessively long hours with no days off, non-payment of wages, confinement in the workplace, physical abuse, sexual abuse, forced labour, and in some cases slavery. While some governments have started to improve standards incrementally, most have failed to adopt comprehensive reforms. Such change often encounters stiff resistance from employers fearing higher costs and fewer entitlements, labour brokers profiting off a poorly regulated system, and government officials who view migrants as a security threat. Politics of gender, race, class, and national origin permeate these negotiations over human rights. This article examines patterns of change in three areas: labour protections, immigration regulations, and civil society mobilization. Most countries have relied on introducing standard employment contracts to regulate terms and conditions of employment instead of including domestic workers in labour law protections. Despite a growing consensus that the current immigration 'sponsorship' systems in the Middle East contributes to abuse, change has been incremental and slow. More positively, despite struggling against restrictions on freedom of movement and broad constraints on organizing, migrants' groups are growing in size, diversity, and sophistication. // ABSTRACT IN FRENCH: Des millions de femmes +�migrent vers l'Asie et le Moyen-Orient pour gagner leur vie comme travailleuses domestiques. Dans les pays d'accueil, la combinaison de graves lacunes dans les lois sur le travail, de mesures visant +� restreindre l'immigration et le fait que la soci+�t+� accepte la discrimination contre les travailleurs migrants, entra+�ne d'inqui+�tantes violations des droits de la personne, comme de trop longues heures sans cong+�s, le non-versement du salaire, le confinement au lieu de travail, de mauvais traitements physiques, des s+�vices sexuels, du travail forc+� et dans certains cas, des conditions d'esclavage. Bien que certains gouvernements aient commenc+� +� am+�liorer peu +� peu leurs normes, la plupart n'ont pas adopt+� de r+�formes globales. Un tel changement se bute souvent +� une forte r+�sistance chez les employeurs qui craignent une augmentation des co++ts et une diminution de leurs droits, chez les agences de placement qui profitent d'un syst+�me mal r+�glement+�, et chez les fonctionnaires gouvernementaux qui consid+�rent les migrants comme une menace +� la s+�curit+�. Les politiques fond+�es sur le sexe, la race, la classe sociale et l'origine nationale influencent ces n+�gociations sur les droits de la personne. Le pr+�sent article examine des mod+�les de changement dans trois secteurs : les mesures de protection des travailleurs, les r+�glements concernant l'immigration et la mobilisation de la soci+�t+� civile. La plupart des pays ont compt+� sur la mise en place de contrats de travail standards pour r+�gir les conditions d'emploi, au lieu d'inclure les travailleurs et travailleuses domestiques dans les lois sur le travail. Bien que l'on convienne de plus en plus qu'au Moyen-Orient, le syst+�me actuel de recrutement de travailleurs immigr+�s par -� parrainage -+ contribue aux mauvais traitements, le changement advient lentement et graduellement. Sur une note plus favorable, on constate que malgr+� la lutte contre les restrictions +� la libert+� de mouvement et les lourdes contraintes impos+�es aux groupes de migrantes qui cherchent +� s'organiser, ces derniers sont de plus en plus nombreux, diversifi+�s et raffin+�s.

T1  - A STUDY OF THE CIRCASSIAN CULTURE AS REFLECTED IN LITERATURE AND ORAL HISTORY (RUSSIA)

AB  - The motherland of Circassians is Circassia or "Cherkesstan," the land west of Vladikavkaz Pass in North Caucasia; the region east of Vladikavkaz Pass is known as "Lesghistan," or the country of Lesghians. About 75 percent of the 2 million Circassians live outside of Caucasia. Ninety percent of these are the descendants of the Circassians whom the Russian Czarist authorities forced to leave Caucasia in the 1860's. Subsequently, some Circassians immigrated to Turkey and Europe following the Bolshevic Revolution, and others found themselves in displaced-persons camps following World War II. The majority of the world's Circassian population lives in Turkey, mainly on the bleak plateau of Anatolia. In the United States, however, Circassians are undergoing a process of rapid cultural change to the extent that their distinct ethnic heritage is being "lost" to more recent generations. Children are becoming increasingly detached from the cultural continuum of which their parents are a part, and parents are severely restricted in their perceptions of this development and their ability to address it effectively. As a modest contribution to both available information about culture specifically and ethnic education generally, the present effort compares and augments old and contradictory Circassian literature with the cultural knowledge and historical experience of 34 Circassians who were interviewed in New Jersey and New York. All respondents expressed growing concern regarding moral erosion and what it may portend. The text of this dissertation largely consists of the information which was found to be consistent in both the interviews and literature. This study does not seek to offer brisk formulas for the "proper" behavior of Circassians, or "pat" answers to all Circassian-American social problems. It is hoped, however, that it will encourage Circassian pride in their cultural identity, as well as adding knowledge about a distinct and rich culture to ethnic literature in the United States. The findings of this study suggest that a formal educational experience for Circassian youth, based upon the Circassian language and culture, would foster feelings of personal worth and retention of relevant aspects of Circassian culture in the United States

AB  - The lives of refugee and immigrant populations have become central to often intense debates about cultural differences and their implications for multicultural societies. The cultural practices assumed to be characteristic of such populations are the object of media comment and policy initiatives, and preoccupy social service practitioners daily. Drawing on an ethnographic examination of the everyday experiences of Iraqi refugees in a small regional town in Victoria, Australia, this article explores how social service practitioners address cultural difference as they seek to assist and support integration. The wider implications of emphasising cultural difference as a defining feature in determining and evaluating refugee integration are also explored. It is�argued that this emphasis fails to address structural inequalities that contribute to common forms of exclusion and marginalisation experienced by refugees and immigrants in Australia. This emphasis also risks contributing to what, in recent times, has become a dangerous stereotyping of refugees

AB  - This dissertation was aimed to gather information on the acculturation process and the acculturation experiences of individuals from the Southern Sudanese refugee community in San Diego, California. This study was divided into two distinct phases to obtain in-depth narratives through face-to-face interviews. In Phase I Focus Group Interview, 12 participants were asked the following four research questions: (a) How do Southern Sudanese refugees acculturate to life in San Diego, California? (b) Do Southern Sudanese refugees experience acculturative stress while living in San Diego, California? (c) How do Southern Sudanese refugees experience acculturative stress while living in San Diego, California? (d) How do Southern Sudanese refugees manage acculturative stress while living in San Diego, California? In Phase II Key Individual Interviews, six participants selected from Phase I Focus Group Interview, were asked 12 research questions that pertained to their previous life in Southern Sudan and their cultural experiences in the U.S. The data was analyzed using NVivo 10 software. The following is a discussion of the results. In Phase I Focus Group Study, the following nine categories emerged: (a) Raising Children; (b) Patriarchal Society; (c) Education; (d) Governmental Laws; (e) Dependency; (f) Family Support; (g) Infrastructure; (h) Coping with Stress; and (i) Religion. In Phase II Key Informant Individual Interview, the following seven categories surfaced: (a) Culture in the U.S.; (b) Escaping Civil War; (c) Life in Southern Sudan; (d) U.S. Daily Living; (e) Helping New Refugees; (f) Cultural Changes; and (g) Access To Services. The major findings included Southern Sudanese refugees: (a) use assimilation and integration as coping strategies to dealing with acculturative stress; (b) experience isolation, lack of support, dependency, helplessness, and hopelessness; (c) experience frustration, confusion, fear, and anxiety, due to being exposed to the housing and transportation infrastructures in the U.S., that did not exist in Southern Sudan and refugee camps in Ethiopia, Egypt, and Kenya; and (d) expressed their concerns that they do not want what happened to them in Southern Sudan (i.e., family separated and government interfering in their lives) to happen again to them in the U.S

AB  - Psychiatric disorders are highly prevalent among incarcerated youth. However, whereas ethnic minority youths are overrepresented in the juvenile justice system, limited research is available on their mental health. In this study, differences in mental health problems between incarcerated adolescents of native Dutch and Moroccan origin, were examined. Child Behavior Checklist and Youth Self-Report scores were compared between incarcerated adolescents of native Dutch and Moroccan origin. Their scores were also compared to those of native Dutch and Moroccan immigrant youths in the general, non-incarcerated population. Native Dutch incarcerated adolescents showed higher levels of various mental health problems than incarcerated adolescents with a Moroccan background. Compared to the general population, incarcerated youths showed higher levels of mental health problems, but this deviation was much larger for native Dutch than for Moroccan immigrant youths. These ethnic differences in mental health problems could not be explained by ethnic differences in socio-economic background and social desirable answering tendencies. Incarcerated youths of Moroccan origin show less psychopathology than incarcerated native Dutch youths, which might be explained by disparities in sentencing procedures

AB  - Background: Previous research provides support for the existence of the psychopathy construct in youths. However, studies regarding the psychometric properties of psychopathy measures with ethnic minority youths are lacking. Methods: In the present study, the three-factor structure of the Youth Psychopathic Traits Inventory (YPI) was examined for both native Dutch youth (N=158) and an ethnic minority group, Moroccans (N=141), in an incarcerated adolescent population in the Netherlands. Results: Our results showed that the three-factor structure of the YPI is comparable across an ethnic majority and an ethnic minority group in an incarcerated sample in the Netherlands. Moreover, associations between psychopathic traits and mental health problems were similar for both ethnic groups. Conclusion: The results support the cross-ethnic generalizability of the three-factor model of psychopathy as measured through the Youth Psychopathic Traits Inventory. All rights reserved, Elsevier

AB  - Reinaldo Arenas' literary work has been analyzed from the perspectives of Psychology, structure, theme, textuality and intertextuality, and also from the point of view of modernity. The present analysis tries to show that his work is one of exile. Arenas as a human being, as well as an author, suffered all forms of exile and these influence the structure of his work. He lived in exile from the very day he was born. His suicide was his final gesture of exile, now from his very existence. In his literary work, as well as in his life, are present all the definitions of exile given by Sociology; that of inner exile, to which Arenas added a new characteristic, and that of territorial exile as well. His work represents the vision of the marginated, the imprisoned, the persecuted, the rejected, and the exile. In this sense, it can be said that his work is also a search of Cuba's history. Alienation, as Sociology says, is, in itself, a form of exile. In Arenas' work it is present almost in all of his characters. It is present at the unfolding of his first characters. It is also present in the quest of the liberating door in El Portero, and in the cruel satire of national values in El color del verano. His work appeals to every human being. The purpose of his novels and poetry is to reveal, from a historical reconstruction, the explanation of Cuba's constant political problems. Arenas' essays, his autobiography, his novels as well as his poetry--all the subject of this analysis--are the literary expressions of exile and alienation; the norm of the world that he lived and recreated

AB  - Lina Stern (1878-1968), a neurophysiologist and biochemist, was born in Russia. She studied at the University of Geneva, Switzerland, where, after graduating, she conducted original research in physiology and biochemistry. In 1918, Stern was the first woman to be awarded a professional title at the University of Geneva and headed the department of Physiological Chemistry. She is deservedly considered to be one of the first scientists to entertain the concept of a blood-brain barrier. In 1929, Stern founded the Institute of Physiology in Moscow, of which she was director until 1948, when it was discontinued. Under her leadership, multidisciplinary groups of colleagues worked on the problems of the blood-brain and tissue-brain barriers and homeostasis of the brain. In 1939, Stern was elected full member of the Academy of Sciences and became its first female member ever. Most scientists manage to conduct their research by adjusting to the political and social situations surrounding them. Lina Stern did not follow this path. This small woman of complete devotion to science took the drastic decisions that altered her life. Though destiny was not kind to her, Lina Stern did not compromise. Despite a threat of execution, prolonged imprisonment, and exile she was never broken as a scientist and always maintained her dignity.

AB  - With the end of armed struggle in Sri Lanka, there will be now more pressure and anxiety among the thousands of Sri Lankan Tamil expatriates, especially living in the West. As most of them are refugees or asylum seekers, Western countries might intensity their repatriation attempts and can compel them to return home. Sri Lankan Tamil refugees, who formed the largest part of the expatriate population after 1983 Sri Lanka riots, have established themselves comfortably, particularly in Canada, Western Europe and Australia. Since the 1980s, alliance between the Colombo refugee agencies and European mafia has been reported numerous times. Though the Western governments responded with stricter repatriation policies, many Sri Lankan Tamils still managed to escape from their legal grip and continued staying in the West. Through appeals, protests and demonstrations, they tried convincing the Western governments of the human rights violations done by the Sri Lankan government. The Sri Lankan Tamil asylum-seekers also employed eccentric methods when they were detained by hard-line asylum policies in the respective countries. The multidimensionality of relations outside Sri Lanka has further helped in their migration and settlement. The post-1983 scenario created a setting to live an accomplished family and community life for the Sri Lankan Tamils by which they could constantly keep in touch with their relations, friends and culture, just like in homeland. Being born and bred outside Sri Lanka, the second generation Tamils, though curious about their traditions and customs, they are culturally more of West than Tamil. The Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora in the West has political and economic interests in Sri Lanka. However, not more than five per cent Tamil diaspora population is willing to return home. In such a scenario, the earlier conditions during deportation might revive. The Tamils may use their escape mechanisms to sustain in the West. In the light of this analysis, time has come to reconsider the Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora's profile, demography and settlement pattern.

AB  - The first objective of this study is to utilise the case of Dzaleka Refugee Camp in Lilongwe, Malawi, to analyse whether the element of identity/ethnicity is a direct cause of conflict, or whether this element is used to explain conflict that occurs as a result of other issues. Its second purpose is to evaluate some of the conflict management systems in place. In doing so, the researcher hopes to assess their efficiency in managing or dealing with conflict. This study has been sponsored by the UNHCR Office in Malawi. The researcher hopes that this paper will demonstrate two things: first, the importance of investigating intracommunal conflict in refugee camps more thoroughly; and second, the need to start providing and evaluating efficient conflict management systems in the refugee camp context, with the hope of avoiding dysfunctional conflict 1 . 1 See Appendix A for the terms definition - adapted to the sole needs of this study

AB  - During post WW II migration wave, Italians accounted for a large portion of immigrants and they settled extensively in Ontario and Quebec. Within Quebec, over 90 percent live on the Island of Montreal, and the Francophone municipality of Saint-L+�onard has the highest concentration of Italians since 1971. Initially, assimilation was the expected outcome of immigrants' adaptation; however, since 1971, multiculturalism encourages the maintenance of ethnic culture and language, but loss of ethnic languages still occurs. The three-generation language shift model suggests that by the third generation, the dominant language will be this generation's mother tongue. However, the literature cites several factors as countering linguistic assimilation, such as residential concentration and intramarriage. Women have consistently shown higher retention rates than men, yet they have received little attention in the intergenerational process. In addition, research on the third generation is still recent and focuses at macro levels. The objective of this thesis is to investigate the role of women in the inter-generational process of ethnic language maintenance and to identify the forces at work, specifically within the home domain, that encourage the retention of the ethnic language. This study is based on data collected from a pilot survey that served to identify potential family triads and from semi-structured interviews of the family triads of which the grandmother resides in Saint-L+�onard. The results show that intergenerational linguistic change varies by family as a result of the many domains in an individual's life and the particular characteristics of each family history since migration

AB  - The magnitude of the number of refugees and their needs pose serious economic and political problems for the host country, international community, and international aid agencies. This study examines the political background of the causes that have forced refugees to flee to Kenya. It identifies the principal actors involved in refugee relief operations and the major refugee groups in Kenya. The questions asked center on the political dynamics of refugee relief among the principal actors. One major question examined are the recommendations and suggestions for improving refugee relief in Kenya as they relate to different groups of refugees and their needs. The methodology employed in this study included a combination of personal interviews and personal observations in Kenya. Personal interviews were conducted with representatives of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and refugees in Nairobi, Kenya. Personal interviews with NGO representatives in the three refugee camps visited were also used. Personal observations from the refugee camps were also used. Secondary sources in Kenya and the U.S. were utilized to obtain background information on Kenya and the refugee crises throughout the Horn of Africa. The research concludes that the actors involved in the provision of refugee relief in Kenya have different agendas, constituents, resources, and capabilities that affect how refugee policy is formulated and implemented. Since the Kenyan Government is the principal actor in refugee relief, the other actors operate in Kenya within the confines of the sovereignty Kenya holds as a nation-state. The Kenyan Government has used external and internal political and economic variables to shape refugee policy in an attempt to maintain regime survival

AB  - The detention of immigrants in the United States is a rapidly expanding endeavor with serious health consequences for the detainees. This detainee population represents non-criminal immigrants who are detained because of a visa violation or other immigration issue but who are not charged with any crime and do not enter the criminal justice system. HIV-positive detainees are especially vulnerable to lapses in proper medical care, and press reports have highlighted deaths and adverse medical outcomes among HIV-positive detainees. We have examined reports on detainee health issues published by numerous groups and conducted our own analysis of the health plan used to govern much of the specialty care for detainees who are HIV positive. We conclude that the system of immigration detention in the US fails to adequately screen detainees for HIV and delivers a substandard level of medical care to those with HIV. We provide several specific recommendations for improving screening and medical care among this highly vulnerable population

AB  - The lack of transparency in immigration detention in the United States has contributed to serious concerns about the fate of immigrants who are detained in the United States and require medical care. In particular, deficiencies in initial screening, chronic disease management (including referral to outside care), and pain management of detainees have been identified by numerous governmental and nongovernmental groups. We have identified a number of detainee deaths and poor medical outcomes that are related to substandard medical care and suggest system-wide problems in US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) health care. This article provides an overview of the current ICE health care system, presents four cases of detainee deaths and independent reporting of similar systemic problems, and recommends several specific changes to the ICE health care system.

AB  - Detention of immigrants by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is a rapidly growing form of incarceration in the U.S. with almost 400,000 people detained in 2008 (Schriro in Immigration and Customs Enforcement, 2009, http://www.ice.gov/doclib/091005_ice_detention_report-final.pdf ). ICE detainees are predominantly from Mexico and Latin America and only a small minority of detainees are asylum seekers. Immigrant detainees lack a legal guarantee of medical care (unlike criminal arrestees and prisoners) and face challenges in receiving medical care, particularly those with chronic medical conditions (Venters and Keller in J Health Care Poor Underserved 20:951-957, 2009). Although we and others have long been involved in advocating for detained asylum seekers, few resources are dedicated to medical advocacy for the broader population of ICE detainees. At the NYU Center for Health and Human Rights (CHHR), a program of medical advocacy was initiated in 2007 on behalf of ICE detainees focused on improvement of care in detention and medical parole. Our preliminary efforts reveal a pressing need for more involvement by physicians and other health advocates in this area

AB  - Over 350,000 immigrants are detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) each year. An unknown fraction of these detainees have serious mental illnesses and are taken into ICE custody even though a criminal court has ordered them to enter inpatient mental health care. The authors report findings from 16 such cases in which they have provided advocacy over the past four years. In some cases, they were able to secure release of detainees into inpatient care in community (nonforensic) settings, which involved substantial logistical challenges. Given the well-documented concerns about securing adequate care for ICE detainees with mental illness, a logical policy change would be for ICE to allow these patients to enter court-ordered inpatient care. This move would improve care for patients and would also unburden ICE from the untenable proposition of caring for patients that the criminal justice system has deemed unfit for incarceration

AB  - The paper analyzes the economic, political and social situation in Teso, Uganda, from the acute situation of conflict experienced between 1986 and 1992. Rather than as a result of this period, the current crisis must be understood as a result of the colonial model exhaustion, based on the production of cotton, and the absence of a new development model that ensures social cohesion. The insurgency and large population movements into refugee camps have also meant a distorting element in social functioning and in the transmission of knowledge between generations. Many of the old social structures remain still, as clans or traditional churches, the Church of Uganda and the Catholic Church, while appearing new organizations, such as the rapid growth of Pentecostal churches, or the creation of Funeral groups. The expansion of new institutions responds to some extent to the search for a radical change to stop the misery and uncertainty, and at the same time provide the basis for founding a new society

The district has been in existence since the early 1900's and continues to have a more or less stable population of 1,200 inhabitants. It is located in Chicago's Lower West Side Pilsen community. While challenging the "melting pot theory" of assimilation, the research concerns itself with an intervening process, termed here as "ethnic adaptiveness," which begins immediately following the act of emigration. Ethnic adaptiveness consists of the manner in which an ethnic group transports, and, voluntarily but selectively, transplants its learned cultural heritage for the purposes of adjusting to a new culture. Theoretically, the dissertation concerns itself with: (1) The Tuscans of the district have maintained their ethnic identity and social solidarity as an adaptive mechanism. (2) The Tuscans are more self segregating, status conscious, and resistant to assimilation than the southern Italians. (3) The district has continued to persist as a northern Italian-American, primarily Tuscan district, despite the external pressures from mass society to assimilate fully. (4) The first and second generation Tuscans of the district have selectively maintained their Old World Tuscan identity as a result of group identifications rather than the arrival of new immigrants from Italy. (5) Cultural, political, economic, social psychological and ecological factors are together responsible for the stability of the ethnic district. The chapters of the dissertation include: (1) comparisons between northern and southern Italians, (2) Tuscan-American families, (3) intergenerational differences, (4) formal and informal ethnic establishments, and (5) ethnic employment. Data sources and methods comprise: extensive participant observation with detailed ethnographies; comparisons with the research by Gans and Suttles; random sampling of the church's documents (marriage, birth, death certificates, and published bulletins); interviews with northern and southern Italian-Americans, proprietors, leaders, and elected officials of social, commercial, and religious establishments; stratified random sampling of employment records at the International Harvester's McCormick plant

AB  - The AAP is a supervised release program to address problems related to noncompliance by persons who are not detained and inefficient use of available detention space. Program goals are to increase appearance rates of people who are not detained at scheduled immigration proceedings, to increase compliance by persons ordered to leave the United States who not detained prior to court order, and to conserve space in Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) detention facilities to permit the detention of mandatory detainees and other persons not appropriate for release. The plan is to test the AAP in a 3-year demonstration project in the New York City area. Program activities will include the development and implementation of intake screening process to identify individuals likely to appear at immigration court hearings if released under supervision and to provide more consistent and fair criteria for the release of detained persons; the establishment of a Reporting and Assistance Center to carry out supervision, offer useful resource references, and reinforce incentives to appear at court hearings for individuals participating in the AAP; and the development and implementation of procedures to facilitate INS enforcement of removal orders. The AAP will target defensive asylum seekers, detained criminal aliens, undocumented workers, and affirmative asylum seekers. A formal evaluation of the program is planned to identify program strengths and weaknesses and ways in which the program can be improved to meet its primary goals. The evaluation methodology is detailed, the legality and effectiveness of home detention for immigration detainees are discussed, and the intake screening process and associated forms are described. 85 footnotes and 1 table

AB  - Concepts of creativity and the attraction of a 'creative class' have become increasingly prominent in regional economic development literature and policy. Richard Florida's books 'Rise of the creative class' and 'Who's your city?' have encouraged city and regional planners to move away from strategies focused on infrastructure development and the attraction of businesses towards strategies which attract people as migrants, particularly the 'creative class', through a focus on characteristics such as a 24/7 lifestyle, cultural amenity and ethnic diversity. This research explored why people who could be categorised as 'creative class' move to Launceston in Tasmania, and what keeps them there. In the regional centre of Launceston, lifestyle, amenity and diversity were not characteristics that attracted in-migration initially. Instead, characteristics particular to small and rural places attracted creative and other professional workers, such as outdoor amenities, downshifting, time with family, proximity to the natural environment and a strong sense of community. Only after arrival did Launceston's comparative cultural wealth come to be appreciated by in-migrants, instead becoming a factor helping to retain newly arrived migrants.

AB  - This paper deals with some human rights aspects related to the treatment of refugees in Kenya and is based on data collected between March 1997 and April 1998. After giving a brief background on refugee policy developments in Kenya, the paper presents some observations on the situation of refugees living in camps, particularly in Kakuma refugee camp in the northwest of the country. It highlights some of the human rights problems that refugees have to face in this camp, and stresses the fact that camps are legal anomalies, in which the administration of justice is virtually in the hands of the humanitarian agencies that exercise this function either directly, or by delegating it to community leaders. After looking at an example of a human rights violation carried out with at least the complicity of humanitarian organizations�_"the forcible relocation of refugees from the camps in Mombasa�_"the paper finally sketches some of the more �_~classic�_T human rights issues that present themselves with respect to refugees living in Nairobi: police harassment, arbitrary arrest and detention without trial.

AB  - The author studies the school paths of immigrant students from the perspective of social justice and recognition through interviews with schooled teenagers in Belgium's French-speaking community. The integrated approach -distribution, recognition, power- allows to concretely understand the interconnection of these dimensions within school environments in which youths develop themselves as moral subjects and take action. Two major sources of inequality emerge: social and spatial segregation impacts on the school attended by students and traps them into socially deprived environments unfavourable to school competition. The socioethnic stigma is experienced in their relations with their peers and teachers. Three ideal-types claiming equal participation emerge -open school path; confined school path, and unstable school path- and induce contrasted paths and identities. In the face of individual strategies, social inequalities remain in school environments. The victims of inequality seek to accommodate to the negative effects of stigmatisation. When they access quality schools, they need the resources and support of family and friends to gradually remove the stigma of their ethnic and cultural background. // ABSTRACT IN FRENCH: L'auteur +�tudie la scolarit+� de jeunes issus de l'immigration sous l'angle de la justice sociale et de la reconnaissance +� travers une enqu+�te par entretiens aupr+�s d'adolescents scolaris+�s en Communaut+� fran+�aise de Belgique. L'approche int+�gr+�e de diverses dimensions -distribution, reconnaissance, pouvoir- permet de saisir leur imbrication au sein d'environnements scolaires concrets o+� les jeunes se construisent comme sujet moral et d+�veloppent une capacit+� d'action. Deux sources majeures d'in+�galit+�s apparaissent : la s+�gr+�gation socio-spatiale qui marque le choix de l'+�tablissement et inscrit ces +�l+�ves dans des environnements d+�valoris+�s pour la comp+�tition scolaire ; le stigmate socio-ethnique dont ils font l'exp+�rience dans leurs relations avec les enseignants ou les pairs. Trois id+�aux-types revendiquant la parit+� de participation sont d+�gag+�s -"carri+�re scolaire ouverte", "carri+�re scolaire confin+�e", "carri+�re instable"- qui engendrent parcours et identit+�s contrast+�s. Face au travail et aux strat+�gies des individus, les environnements scolaires instituent et perp+�tuent les in+�galit+�s sociales. Les victimes d'in+�galit+�s tentent de s'accommoder des effets n+�gatifs de la stigmatisation. Quand elles acc+�dent +� un environnement scolaire de qualit+�, elles ont besoin de ressources familiales et amicales qui les soutiennent dans la mise +� distance co++teuse du stigmate de leur origine et/ou appartenance ethno-culturelle.

AB  - The present study examined ethnically Dutch preadolescents' understanding and reasoning about asylum seeker peers and friendships. The description of an asylum seeker was compared with that of a Moroccan and a Dutch peer. The findings suggest that asylum seekers were described more negatively than peers from the other two groups. Additionally, we examined the willingness and reasons for wanting or not wanting to be friends with an asylum seeker and a Moroccan peer. It was found that asylum seekers were more often rejected than Moroccans. The negative description and rejection of asylum seekers were strongest among participants living close to a center for asylum seekers. The reasoning about friendship acceptance or rejection was examined in terms of individual reasons as well as peer group interactions. It is shown that fact construction or empirical 'grounding' plays an important role in early adolescents' reasoning about friendship exclusion.

AB  - Cholera is a major global public health problem and remains an important threat in almost every developing country, especially in areas where population overcrowding and poor sanitation are common, such as slums and refugee camps. Cholera is one of the most dreaded diseases in the world, in some cases leading to death within 24 h if left untreated. Without treatment, severe infection has a mortality rate of 30-50%. In 2007, WHO recorded 177,963 cholera cases and 4,031 deaths worldwide. However, the estimated actual burden of cholera is in the vicinity of 3 to 5 million cases and 100,000 to 130,000 deaths per year. The disease is endemic to parts of Africa, Asia, the Middle East and South America. Large outbreaks are common after natural disasters or in populations displaced by war, where there is inadequate sewage disposal and contaminated water. In India, during the 10-y period (1997-2006) studied, the states having the highest number of reported outbreaks were West Bengal, Orissa, Maharashtra and Kerala, which together accounted for 60% of all reported outbreaks. A review of cholera cases in India reported to WHO from 2003-2007 showed that the numbers were in the few thousands with a case fatality rate of < 1%. However, it is believed that the number of cholera cases and deaths occurring annually in India is much greater than the number reported. A literature review covering a four-year period from 2003 to 2006 found reported cholera outbreaks in 18 of the 35 States and Union Territories of India. Of these, 11 had cholera outbreaks reported for multiple years. Vietnam has produced a cheaper variant of killed whole-cell vaccine devoid of the B subunit. This vaccine contains both Vibrio cholerae O1 and O139, and provides 50 per cent protection for at least three years after vaccination. For endemic cholera, population-level immunity is relatively high, making control possible with relatively low vaccine coverage levels. This vaccine should be used in areas where cholera is endemic, particularly in those at risk of outbreaks, in conjunction with other prevention and control strategies

AB  - Net subsidence of most major deltas in the world and related vulnerability are thought to be increasing, and this is often linked causally to human activities. This paper examines this causality against a range of co-varying factors. We do so with a principal component analysis of co-variability of a range of geophysical and socio-economical indicators of 33 deltas mainly derived from the DIVA tool. Land potentially lost and people at risk of flooding are our indicators of vulnerability. The former correlated positively with maximum surge height and negatively with net sea level rise. The latter correlated positively with delta area, average river discharge, and maximum surge and negatively with net uplift (or subsidence). Thus, variation in societal vulnerability across deltas depends on short-term, instantaneous risks linked to lowland area, river discharge and storm surges rather than on longer-term, slow, net sea level rise. Delta management should focus on precautionary spatial planning, and on maintenance or restoration of historical sediment delivery and accretion rates. Especially larger deltas with high population densities combine a high risk with the potential to accommodate flood water and mitigate flooding risks. The deltas of the Yangtze-Kiang and Ganges-Brahmaputra share these characteristics. Here space should allow engineering of flood retention, sedimentation and diversion channels as well as refuges and safe economic hotspots. At the other end, in deltas with a high population density and limited space, like the Chao Praya, means for adaptation must be sought outside the delta proper. In deltas with low population densities, such as the Lena, Yukon or Fly, natural delta dynamics can prevail.

AB  - The article examines issues arising from the refugee population that has fled Colombia for the neighboring nation of Ecuador. The central focus of the article is the activity of the United Nations High Commission for refugees in the region. Also discussed is the continuing guerrilla war in Colombia that has created a significant number of internally displaced persons in that country and has driven others to see refuge in Ecuador. The article notes Ecuador's policy of keeping national borders open, with the result that refugees have not been confined to special camps, but live among the native population

AB  - The authors study a number of internal and external oppressive practices that put Palestinian children's health under physical and psychological risks. Method: four children living in the refugee camp of Jenin were interviewed and their emblematic stories were analysed using an ethnographic approach. The impact of the micro and macro elements of the living context on the developmental features of the four children were examined, context that most of the children in the camp live. Results: the themes appearing in the interviews highlight: the desire to redeem the grandparents' and fathers' past (generations today depressed, anxious and hopeless); the restiveness towards confinement to a constricted, daily violated, living space; the need of recreational areas for the children; the acceleration of the rites of passage towards adulthood, due to violence. Conclusions: the current conditions under which the children of the refugee camps are forced to live suggest their possible future affiliation, as adolescents or adults, to groups ready to fight. This does not mean that their families are encouraging them to join the guerrilla or to operate acts of terrorism. The causes of hazardous behaviours and risk factors are discussed.

Method: Three self-report instruments were administered to a convenience sample of school-age children (n. 226; 8-12 years old): the Youth Life Orientation Test (YLOT), the Subjective Happiness Scale (SHS) and the Face Scale (FS). The scores were analyzed using anovas and correlation tests (Pearson's r). Gender and age differences were explored. Results: Optimism, life satisfaction and perceived happiness characterize the entire group of Palestinian children in general. Very little difference was found as a function of gender. Conclusion: Palestinian children seem to enjoy a satisfactory quality of life with regard to optimism, satisfaction and perceived happiness. We hypothesize that these factors may reinforce resilience and positive adjustment to trauma in children. The implications for clinical psychology are discussed.

AB  - We study welfare gains and losses in a sample of 188 rural households in two Rwandan provinces over the time span 1990-2002. Our sample is unique because it covers a period of extreme and widespread violence. Using an economic mobility analysis, we seek to identify the impact of the shocks of the war, the genocide and their aftermath on long-term household welfare. To measure economic mobility between 1990 and 2002, we use both net income per adult equivalent and an asset index. We find that households experiencing the murder or imprisonment of one of their members moved considerably downwards in the income distribution. However, households affected by other war-related shocks such as the number of months taken refuge and the loss of physical capital were not worse off in 2002 compared with other households.

Torture is reviewed as a concept in this chapter, and torture methods as they are used today will be described, together with the prevalence of torture practices. Furthermore, the consequences for the individual and for society are considered. The review is based on research findings reported in the professional literature and on the clinical experience gained at the International Rehabilitation and Research Center for Torture Victims (RCT) in Copenhagen, Denmark.

Outspoken against the monarchy, Blasco Ibǭ��ez published a radical republican journal, El pueblo, and was imprisoned 30 times for political activism. His novels are primarily realistic in conception. The early ones, set in Valencia, include Flor de mayo (1895, tr. The Mayflower, 1921), La barraca [The Cabin] (1898), Ca��as y barro (1902, tr. Reeds and Mud, 1928), and La catedral (1903, tr. The Shadow of the Cathedral, 1909). He traveled in South America, returning to Spain at the outbreak of World War I. He became a propagandist for the Allies, and his war novel, Los cuatro jinetes del Apocalipsis (1916, tr. The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, 1918), made him world famous. He died a voluntary political exile.

AB  - Women are as likely as men to suffer brutal abuses if they question the status quo, defy their governments or insist on their rights. This is illustrated by the case of the tribal women in Bangladesh who have been raped by members of security forces in apparent reprisal attacks against the men of their community. The world's torturers, executioners and jailers do not discriminate on grounds of sex. Thus, thousands of women are prisoners of conscience, detained for their peaceful opposition to the authorities, sometimes without having been charged or brought to trial. The vast majority (80%) of the world's refugee population is composed of women and young girls. Women refugees bear the brunt of situations arising as a result of man-made violence and are frequently victims twice over. First, their search for protection and safety triggers situations involving violence. They suffer violence, for example, in war, civil disturbances and other forms of armed conflict: they are also persecuted because of their political opinions, religious beliefs, or quite simply for refusing to accept the role that society has sought to impose upon them. Secondly, they suffer violence during their flight, upon arrival in camps and settlements, and even in the process of being integrated into a new society, where they find themselves in exploitative situations, entirely dependent upon others for the basic necessities of life. Prolonged stays in closed refugee camps with no interaction with the local community raises the level of violence, which refugee women are first to suffer. All forms of repression and cruel and inhuman treatment of women and children should be considered criminal

AB  - The author suggests that, in today�_Ts climate of economic crisis, public sector cuts and escalating class struggle, Marxism offers important tools for social workers and service users to understand the structures of oppression they face and to devise effective means of resistance. He uses Marxism's insights and reinterprets them in the current context by focussing on one particular section of the international working class; refugees and asylum seekers in Britain. He aims to demonstrate the general utility of a Marxist approach, how it enables an exploration of the interplay between state policies, how these are experienced by their subjects, and how conflicts are mediated. Drawing on his own original research he highlights the strengths and dignity with which asylum seekers and refugees seek to resist their subjugation as unpaid voluntary workers or marginalised low-paid labour and how their capacity to look after each other stands in contrast to the state's indifference. The focus of the book is twofold: to analyse the material basis of the oppression of refugees in Britain by the state; and to examine the means by which the British state has 'managed' this oppression through the cultivation of a 'refugee relations industry', within a broader narrative of 'social capital building'

AB  - (from the chapter) How, exactly, does immersion in the Israeli-Palestinian political conflict impact the mind, body, and brain? Might insight into the lives of Palestinian youth somehow help us find the path to peace? A recently completed pilot study considered several facts about hormones and behavior, focusing on levels of testosterone and the stress hormone cortisol. Fifty-two 14-year-old Palestinian boys were recruited from schools in refugee camps near Gaza City that had had significant experience with Israeli military incursions during the second intifada, and thus exposure to stress and trauma. The boys' provided 4 morning saliva samples and completed five self-rating questionnaires assessing depression, anxiety, aggression, oppression, and religiosity and political attitudes, including sympathy towards terrorism. Half of the boys' depression scores were in the moderate to severe range, and seven had scores in the range of serious major depressive illness. Half of the boys had anxiety scores in the moderate to severe range. Boys with more anxiety and those with more depression both had lower cortisol levels. Boys with the highest testosterone levels were more likely to express sympathy for terrorism. Regarding attitudes toward religion and political violence, almost every single boy expressed a duty to become a martyr. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (chapter)

AB  - This essay sums up the quest for freedom of thought, speech, press, and association in Tito's Yugoslavia via an attempt to launch an independent magazine, Free Voice, and simultaneously found a Movement of Independent Intellectuals at the Faculty of Philosophy at the Zadar branch of Zagreb University in the 1960s. This was the Movement that Mihajlo Mihajlov joined. And while Mihajlov became famous for his intellectual travelogue, Moscow Summer 1964, published in the West, but banned in Yugoslavia, the would-be founders of the new magazine and Movement were all intimidated and persecuted. Mihajlov himself was imprisoned in August 1966 on the eve of the press conference to announce the project, while Mirko Vidovi�� was in exile in France. Vidovi�� would also face imprisonment in the 1970s, joining Mihajlov in the same prison where they organized hunger strikes demanding better treatment and regime recognition of the status of political prisoners.

AB  - Serving as a metaphor for practice, the concept of navigation has become increasingly popular in anthropological theory. The concept seems to have almost sneaked its way into our analytical vocabulary; it is used when referring to how people act in difficult or uncertain circumstances and in describing how they disentangle themselves from confining structures, plot their escape and move towards better positions. Yet, despite its increasing popularity, the concept is most often used in an unspecified or misunderstood manner - it is generally not well defined! Building on prolonged fieldwork in Bissau, West Africa, and with West African migrants in Lisbon, Portugal, I take a second look at the concept of social navigation, clarifying the notion as an analytical optic, discarding the most unfortunate misconceptualizations of the term and elucidating the contribution that the concept can make to our understanding of the way people act in their social worlds.

AB  - Little is known about the lives of criminal offenders prior to their incarceration in past time. Knowing the background of offenders, however, may explain why they broke the law. This article explores young offenders in the Sundsvall region of Sweden, 400 kilometres north of Stockholm, an area with a booming sawmill-based economy in nineteenth-century Sweden. First, using prison registers, large-scale structural concepts are employed to explain the increasing number of incarcerations of young people reported during the period 1840-1880. Second, to uncover the offenders' demographic backgrounds and their socio-economic circumstances when arrested, they are identified in Swedish parish registers digitized by the Demographic Data Base (DDB) at Umeaa University. These sources permit the application of retrospective life-course perspectives that are increasingly applied in modern criminology. These perspectives show that offenders were not primarily migrants or of poor origin, but that they frequently came from the region. Thus their parents were often also present in the community. In providing informal social control these characteristics-being local and having at least one parent nearby-are thought to lead to lower levels of criminality and imprisonment, but they were of little effect in preventing crime or incarceration. This study thus challenges the view of the criminal in past time as a lone individual arrested in an unfamiliar settings. Among the few female offenders observed, however, these factors were more typical; although gender accounts for low levels of criminality, their isolation and poverty did lead some women to theft

AB  - The first transcontinental railroad in North America, built between 1863 and 1869, drove the territorialization of the U.S. West, accelerating the velocity of westward expansion in the aftermath of the Civil War. Railroad tracks from Omaha to Sacramento sutured the Union and settled the ground for the spread of industrial capitalism. Trains moving on these tracks propelled social and economic revolutions in the relationship between space and time. If the transcontinental railroad was the engine of this history, this dissertation argues that American Indian dispossession and Chinese migrant labor constituted its motor. This dissertation reframes the production of the transcontinental railroad through Chinese, Lakota, Pawnee, and Cheyenne histories, revealing the experiences of indigenous peoples and racialized migrants as centrally productive of expanding industrial capitalism, unsettling American Studies and the history of capitalism at the core. This perspective recasts the relationships between North and South, White and Black, and Capitalism and Slavery, which organize these fields, instead foregrounding questions of political and economic autonomy across imperial encounters. Moving beyond the confines of a national frame, these chapters follow the development of U.S. westward expansion in relation to histories of imperialism in Asia and North America. The railroad, as a vehicle of industrial colonization, generated crises of social reproduction in each of these communities, and their navigations of these crises shaped the ultimate production of the railroad itself. The industrial capitalism that coursed across the Plains along railroad tracks was always, already, racial capitalism. In this analysis, international diplomacy, military policies, and labor control in the nineteenth century U.S. West were forged in response to the lives and struggles of displaced and excluded peoples, leaving an indelible imprint whose traces continue to endure, long after the first trains crossed North America.

AB  - PURPOSE: This article describes the development of, and outputs from, a program in which trained refugee health workers provided spherical lenses to adult refugees along the Thailand-Burma border METHODS: Between 1998 and 2001, the International Rescue Committee trained 48 refugee health workers in basic refraction courses. Once trained, these health workers conduct weekly eye clinics in several refugee camps and one migrant community covering a total population of 142,000. We supplied spherical lenses in 11 powers from +1.00 to +4.00 in 0.50-D steps and from -1.00 to -2.50 in 0.50-D steps. We collected output data from these clinics for the year 2001 RESULTS: In 2001, these clinics provided a total of 7219 eyeglasses. Approximately 84% of all lenses given were for presbyopia, approximately 10% for myopia, and approximately 6% for hyperopia. Our spectacle provision rates per 100,000 persons were 4284 for presbyopia, 482 for myopia, and 317 for hyperopia. Our target provision rates, which would allow the average wearer to get a new pair every 3 to 4 years, was met for presbyopia, but not met for myopia or hyperopia. Few corrections for high errors were needed and only 92 people were found to need powers higher than we provided. In 2001, the cost per eyeglass recipient was approximately $7.00 CONCLUSIONS: Training refugee health workers has allowed for sustainable, low-cost spectacle provision to a large population over an extensive geographic area in a challenging environment

AB  - PURPOSE: Ready-made spectacles are often used in low-resource environments, but to date, there has been little evaluation of the continued use of these spectacles over time. The aim of this study was to assess wearing compliance of those who received ready-made spectacles METHODS: The International Rescue Committee trains refugee health workers to provide simple refractive services and dispense ready-made spherical lenses to residents of refugee camps on the Thailand-Burma border. We conducted follow-up interviews in five camps among all eligible and available spectacle recipients who had been examined either 6 (n = 230) or 12 months earlier (n = 187). Interviewers asked about continued use of spectacles and, among those who had discontinued spectacle use, asked the reason for discontinuing RESULTS: Reported spectacle wear was significantly higher at 6 months compared with 12 months (73.9 vs. 55.6%, p < 0.001). At 6 months, wearing compliance was significantly higher for females than males (79.2 vs. 67.6%, p = 0.033), but gender differences in wearing compliance were not seen at 12 months, and no differences were found between 10-year age groups at 6 or 12 months. Wearing compliance rates among recipients seen at different camps were significantly different at both 6 months (range, 58.1 to 87.5%, p = 0.005) and 12 months (range, 32 to 85.7%, p = 0.002). The top reason given for discontinued spectacle wear was broken frames, followed by vision-related complaints, scratched lenses, lost spectacles, and appearance CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that spectacle wearing compliance studies will not be comparable unless a standard time frame is used to assess compliance. We found assessing self-reported compliance to be a useful tool in guiding our program. Understanding the reasons for non-compliance will help guide corrective action and planning of interventions designed to increase wearing rates

AB  - Abstract: Six taxa of serpulid polychaetes are reported from early Cretaceous to Miocene seep communities and their ecologic and evolutionary implications are discussed. All studied tubeworms belong to Mesozoic to modern serpulid taxa and not to any of the problematic Paleozoic tube worm clades. They are thus not �_~relic taxa�_T that found refuge in these environments. The seep serpulids are not confined to a specific taxonomic group within the serpulids, but belong to at least five different genera, Propomatoceros, Nogrobs?, Hyalopomatus, Protis (or Protula), and Spirorbis? These five genera belong to the two major serpulid clades, filogranins (including spirorbins) and serpulins. No conspicuous tube morphology was observed that could be associated with the adaptation to the life in seep environments. The three identifiable genera have colonized the seep environment recently (geologically) after their first appearance in the fossil record, a pattern seen also among other taxonomic groups of vent and seep inhabitants.

AB  - We examined the factor structure of measured posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in a sample of West African civilian refugees who had fled the civil war in Sierra Leone between 2001 and 2006. Given that such war-affected populations are common but understudied in trauma research, our objective was to examine the similarities and differences in this factor structure compared to prevailing models of PTSD symptom structure. As part of treatment services provided in refugee camps, refugees (2,140 women, 1,662 men, 1 unknown) from Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea completed the 17 symptoms portion of the Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale (PDS). We used exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses to investigate whether there was a factor structure unique to this population, and made comparisons with the numbing, dysphoria, and aroused intrusion models. Results from the confirmatory analyses showed that the dysphoria model best fit the data (root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA] = .062); however, exploratory analyses revealed that 3 items loaded differently than theoretically expected. Psychological distress cross-loaded on reexperiencing and avoidance factors and physiological reactivity loaded on the avoidance factor instead of the reexperiencing factor. The sleep difficulties item was not well explained, generally; the highest loading (�� = .22) was on the dysphoria factor.

AB  - (from the book) In the second edition, we again provide a coherent structure for presenting international perspectives on the state of the field by examining and discussing specific trends and issues currently faced by the community of distance education practitioners and researchers. For this edition, we have divided the book into four separate sections, each with its own assigned section editor. At the beginning of each section, the section editor will provide a brief introduction to the section, providing an overview of the chapters in the section, and sharing some insights on how the section has been developed. Section I, "Perspectives on Global Trends and Issues in Distance Education," presents six unique approaches to exploring what are perceived to be some of the key trends and issues of relevance to the distance education field globally. This section tackles such issues as the fundamental definition (and understanding of) the construct of "distance education," the implications of an international distance education research agenda, gauging short-term possibilities and challenges with the integration of commercial technologies into distance education, the place of post secondary distance education in a time of globalization, and the lessons to be extracted from the concrete and rich case of distance education in Brazil. Section II, "Distance Education in Primary and Secondary Education Settings," focuses on the design and development of a virtual secondary school, discusses e-learning in an ample sense in Portugal, shows us how interactive radio instruction helps students and teachers to learn more effectively when assisted by radio lessons, and in its last chapter analyzes and critically reflects on the often positive results of 30 years of distance education experience in Mozambique. Section III, "Distance Education in University and Other Formalized Higher Education Settings," includes six chapters that focus on distance education in university and higher education settings. This is the largest section of the book, its chapters addressing themes such as the impact of e-learning on the historical trajectory of the university, current research on distance education at the tertiary education level, issues related to quality and accreditation in transnational distance education, opportunities and lessons learned with teacher education programs, the use of personal learning environments for distance education in post secondary settings, and issues with setting up distance education support systems. The wide range of topics and the challenging comprehension and application questions will surely broaden and enrich the reader's understanding of international distance education in higher education settings. Section IV, "Distance Education in the Workplace and in Nonformal Settings," focuses on the increasingly significant topic of how distance education is being used to meet learning needs outside of the primary, secondary, and tertiary education systems. In other words, this section explores the use of distance education for just-in-time or on-the-job learning in both the public and private sectors, as well as the use of distance education for reaching hard-to-reach and traditionally underserved audiences. Chapters in this section cover topics including online corporate training, the use of wikis in informal education, and two different chapters on using distance education to enrich the lives of often forgotten segments of society: refugees and prisoners.

AB  - In Western societies, asylum politics is a highly debated issue, as modern nation states come under increasing pressure from globalization and find it more difficult to remain homogeneous institutions for ruling. In the context of these pressures, asylum-seekers constitute political and constitutional dilemmas deeply embedded in the issue of bordering, securing and sustaining nation state sovereignty. According to Giorgio Agamben, one solution to this dilemma is the creation of 'camps' as institutionalized 'states of exception', i.e. asylum centres, where asylum-seekers are deprived of not only some of the legal rights accorded citizens but also human rights. In Denmark, while the political focus is on increasingly restrictive asylum policies, studies show that asylum-seeking families suffer from deteriorating psychological and physical health and social life. Drawing on Agamben, this article examines the underlying reasons for and the dynamics of illness and family breakdown in Danish asylum centres, particularly given the claims by some that these problems are self-inflicted. The article analyses illness and family breakdown as individualized manifestations of both the camp's dissolution of normal social and symbolic distinctions, and of the (bio-) politicization of the private lives and bodies of asylum-seekers. Understanding asylum centre life through these concepts clarifies the ambivalent and paradoxical nature of illness and family breakdown in asylum centres, and leads to the article reframing the epistemological question of how one can determine asylum-seekers' social and mental health condition to the ontological question of what kind of existence is possible for people living in asylum centres.

AB  - Threatened by voices by popular dissent, some South American governments used massive imprisonments, systematic torture of prisoners, executions, indictments, and forced exile to silence and intimidate thousands of men and women. This profoundly disturbed all aspects of �_onormal�__ life from the co�__existence of different groups of the population to the core of the family. The traumatic effect produced by these events, which are both repressive to, and sustained in children's personality development, and the family as a whole, cannot be ignored. This article will look at the way in which terror is imprinted upon the psyche of victims of violence, and the effects of the transmission of that imprint from one generation to the next if there is no treatment intervention. The word �_omark�__ is used to describe this imprint, its manifestations, and its effects on the psychic life of survivors and their children. The word �_oinscription�__ is used to describe the way in which this mark is burned into the psyche, just as the tattoos of Auschwitz were burned into the skin. Four case examples will elucidate how these histories of violence disturb the individual capacity to examine reality. They will explore the ways in which the defense mechnisms, built to insure psychic survival, are strained by the struggle between keeping the secret of umentionable and irresolvable horrors and the need to restore psychic continuity.

AB  - This volume has two purposes. First, it looks at why migrant welfare is not always acknowledged as forming part of the general well-being of host countries. And second, by suggesting alternative approaches, it sets out to help bring about a �_ojust, multicultural society�__, in which rights and mobility are realities for everyone. The radical changes currently under way in the welfare state, in private enterprise and in the various manifestations of citizenship are a perfect starting point for showing that the rights of migrants and nationals, far from being in competition, actually reinforce each other. While rejecting the essentialisation of �_odiversities�__, the authors call for greater cultural accommodation in all walks of life �_" in institutions and businesses, social services and hospitals, families and associations �_" to better meet the needs of multicultural societies

AB  - This paper is a response to R. Jureidini's 'Trafficking and contract migrant workers in the Middle East', published in International Migration. Jureidini discusses the difficulty of establishing whether migrant domestic workers are victims of trafficking. He discusses the questions of (i) whether trafficking can be determined ex post or whether it must also be ex ante, and (ii) whether there must be a proven intent to engage in trafficking. On the basis of data concerning domestic workers in Saudi Arabia and the Emirates, I argue that they often are victims of trafficking. In these two countries, forced confinement and exploitation do not concern individual cases, but standard labour conditions. Agents in the countries of origin regularly misinform or even deceive domestic workers, while agents in the countries of destination actively stimulate confinement and exploitation. Furthermore, the lack of prosecution of traffickers is not caused by legal obscurities, but by societal issues. The paper concludes with some policy suggestions to better address the issue of trafficking. Reprinted by permission of the International Organization for Migration

AB  - The article focuses on a medical mission held by three women physicians from Boston, Massachusetts in Chad. The physicians traveled to the Farcana refugee camp in Chad unprotected. At the camp, the physicians were greeted with an atmosphere of intimidation. The physicians interviewed Darfuri women and documented incidents of sexual assaults, violence and their physical and mental statuses. They discovered that women living in the camp have experienced beatings, rape and stigma at the hands of Sudanese Army and Janjaweed militiamen. An overview of the report published by the physicians concerning their medical mission in Chad is also provided. A discussion on the prevalence of violence and rights abuses in Chad is also presented

AB  - This thesis examines four Louisiana Supreme Court cases: Metayer v. Noret (1818), Metayer v. Metayer (1819), Bazzi v. Rose and her Child (1820), and Bernardine v. L'Espinasse (1827). Adelaide Metayer, Rose, and Marie Louise Bernardine each had a different path to manumission, yet they shared a common history as slaves in the French Caribbean colony of Saint Domingue. The women survived the 1791 slave uprising, which culminated in the creation of the Republic of Haiti in 1804. The women became refugees, first in Cuba and later in New Orleans. Each woman was manumitted along the way. In Metayer v. Noret and Metayer v. Metayer , the Court examined whether Adelaide should retain her freedom when her former master's son attempted to "reclaim" his property. Adelaide's lawyers successfully argued that Adelaide had lived without her master for a prescribed number of years. She was, by law, free. In Bazzi v. Rose and her child , Rose defended her freedom against her former master whom she had followed from Saint Domingue, to Cuba, and New Orleans. Rose claimed that Bazzi manumitted her in Cuba. In New Orleans, Rose tried to leave Bazzi. He sued to affirm his possession. Ultimately, Rose lost her struggle. In the third case, Bernardine v. L'Espinasse , Bernardine claimed that she was free based on her deceased master's will. The executor of the estate, L'Espinasse, maintained that Bernardine had to serve him to work off debts. The Court ruled that L'Espinasse did not have a legal case to detain Bernardine, so she was emancipated. The four cases illustrate the complicated legal environment in early nineteenth century Louisiana in regards to slavery and emancipation. As free persons of color in the American South, freedom was precarious. Slaves were an economic resource. That was not lost upon those who believed they had legitimate claims on the women as slaves. Adelaide, Rose, and Marie Louise resisted efforts at re-enslavement in court with varying success

AB  - For reasons well known and researched in detail,worldwide prevalence rates for mental disorders are much higher in prison populations than in general, not only for sentenced prisoners but also for prisoners on remand, asylum seekers on warrant for deportation and others. Moreover, the proportion of imprisoned individuals is rising in most countries. Therefore forensic psychiatry must deal not only with the typically young criminal population, vulnerable to mental illness due to social stress and at an age when rates of schizophrenia, suicide, drug abuse and most personality disorders are highest, but also with an increasingly older population with age-related diseases such as dementia. While treatment standards for these mental disorders are largely published and accepted, and scientific evidence as to screening prisoners for mental illness is growing, where to treat them is dependent on considerations for public safety and local conditions such as national legislation, special regulations and the availability of treatment facilities (e.g., in prisons, in special medical wards within prisons or in secure hospitals). While from a medical point of view a mentally ill prisoner should be treated in a hospital, the ultimate decision must consider these different issues. In this article the authors propose an algorithm comprising screening procedures for mental health and a treatment chain for mentally ill prisoners based on treatment facilities in prison, medical safety, human rights, ethics, and the availability of services at this interface between prison and medicine.

AB  - Abstract: For reasons well known and researched in detail, worldwide prevalence rates for mental disorders are much higher in prison populations than in general, not only for sentenced prisoners but also for prisoners on remand, asylum seekers on warrant for deportation and others. Moreover, the proportion of imprisoned individuals is rising in most countries. Therefore forensic psychiatry must deal not only with the typically young criminal population, vulnerable to mental illness due to social stress and at an age when rates of schizophrenia, suicide, drug abuse and most personality disorders are highest, but also with an increasingly older population with age-related diseases such as dementia. While treatment standards for these mental disorders are largely published and accepted, and scientific evidence as to screening prisoners for mental illness is growing, where to treat them is dependent on considerations for public safety and local conditions such as national legislation, special regulations and the availability of treatment facilities (e.g., in prisons, in special medical wards within prisons or in secure hospitals). While from a medical point of view a mentally ill prisoner should be treated in a hospital, the ultimate decision must consider these different issues. In this article the authors propose an algorithm comprising screening procedures for mental health and a treatment chain for mentally ill prisoners based on treatment facilities in prison, medical safety, human rights, ethics, and the availability of services at this interface between prison and medicine.

AB  - Reports how a community of Cypriot Turks, confined in enclaves under refugee conditions during hostilities with Greece in the 1960s, displayed an exaggerated preoccupation with raising parakeets. The symbolism of the birds and the psychodynamics of the situation are discussed. It is concluded that regression occurred among the Turks, who tried to externalize their problems of political stress, unconsciously dramatizing the simile "free as a bird" as a safety valve for mass anxiety.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Over the past decade, there has been growing interest within ethnobiology in the knowledge and practices of migrating people. Within this, scholars have given relatively less attention to displaced people and refugees: to the loss, maintenance, and adaptation of refugees' ethnobiological knowledge, and to its significance for refugees' wellbeing. This study focuses on cosmetics and remedies used to heal skin afflictions that are traditionally used by Sahrawi refugees displaced in South Western Algerian refugee camps METHODS: The research methods included a structured survey carried out with 37 refugee households, semi-structured interviews with 77 refugees, 24 retrospective interviews with refugees and other knowledgeable informants, and a voucher specimen collection of the plants and products cited RESULTS: We recorded the use of 55 plant species, nine animal species, and six mineral products used within the three main use categories discussed in this paper: 1) Remedies for health issues that are typical of the desert environment where the Sahrawi once lived as nomads and now live as refugees (e.g. eye afflictions); 2) Remedies for wounds that are influenced by the Sahrawi's recent history of guerrilla warfare; and 3) Cosmetics and products used for body care, decoration and perfuming (e.g. hair care, teeth cleansing, henna use) and for aromatizing the air inside of tents and which are widely used in everyday life and social practices CONCLUSIONS: We discuss the changes that have occurred in the patterns of use and procurement of these products with exile and sedentarization in refugee camps, and conclude that refugees are not simply passive recipients of national and international aid, but rather struggle to maintain and recover their traditional ethnobiological practices in exile. Finally, we suggest further research into the ethnobiological practices and knowledge of displaced populations

AB  - Westphalian notions of nation-state sovereignty, and in particular, the idea that a sovereign nation may determine who may enter its territory, formed the initial grounding for the notion that the United States possessed an inherent power to exclude, and later, deport noncitizens. This power was premised upon a clear connection between sovereignty, jurisdiction, and territory, whereby the state's legitimate power was contained in a single sovereign body, which controlled a defined territory congruent with its jurisdiction. (There were exceptions to this premise, in the form of jurisdiction necessitated by empire, and, less obviously, extraterritorial consular courts popular in the 19th century.) This paper will examine the puncturing of Westphalian sovereignty in state processes that seek to surveil, exclude, and detain noncitizens. While one might assume that the issue of immigration is an issue that only surfaces at the border of the nation-state, immigration law has always featured legal fictions about space, with, in particular, doctrines about entry and admission which treat a physically present noncitizen as if he were overseas. But in recent years we have seen the increasing delinking of sovereign control over immigration from territory. States have demonstrated great flexibility in their territorial sovereignty, through, for example, removal programs designed for use at the border deployed within the interior, immigration officers stationed overseas, the sovereignty/territoriality distinction posited by the U.S. government in Guantanamo, and Australia's excision policy. This paper will discuss these examples and their consequences for how we understand contemporary immigration control strategies, sovereignty, and space. ..PAT.-Unpublished Manuscript [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]Copyright of Conference Papers -- Law & Society is the property of Law & Society Association and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

AB  - Despite Western Australia (WA) having the highest proportion of overseas-born residents of any Australian state, no previous study has examined the general patterns of obstetric health of foreign-born women in WA. To examine the obstetric profiles of foreign-born women in WA using routinely collected perinatal data. The records of 59 245 confinements to foreign-born women were compared with those of 149 737 Australian-born, non-Indigenous women in WA between 1998 and 2006 using chi-square tests and ANOVA procedures. Foreign-born women were generally older, more likely to be married and have partners in highly skilled occupations, and were less likely to have private insurance or be teenage mothers. They were more commonly grand multiparae and were more likely to give birth at age 35 or older. On average, foreign-born women experienced increased risk of gestational diabetes, pre-labour rupture of membranes, failure to progress, fetal distress, perineal laceration and post-partum haemorrhage. They were less likely to have an induced labour and more likely to use fetal monitoring. Instrumental delivery, episiotomy and caesarean sections varied with maternal region of origin. Several important differences in the obstetric profiles of foreign-born women were found. These differences have useful implications for obstetric services in culturally and linguistically diverse populations. Collection of further variables would also benefit the future provision of equitable and culturally appropriate care to diverse immigrant groups.

AB  - During World War II at least 13.5 million people were employed as forced labourers in Germany and across the territories occupied by the German Reich. Most came from Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Moldavia, the Baltic countries, France, Poland and Italy. Among them were 8.4 million civilians working for private companies and public agencies in industry, administration and agriculture. In addition, there were 4.6 million prisoners of war and 1.7 million concentration camp prisoners who were either subjected to forced labour in concentration or similar camps or were 'rented out' or sold by the SS.

AB  - The general question about labor force migration Which regions gain, which regions lose labor force due to migration and why? is modified to Which regions gain, which regions lose human capital due to migration and why? A description of the distribution of human capital and migration patterns is followed by a micro analysis of migration propensities and labor force retention. A macro model of human capital selectivity in migration forms the core of this study. This model deals with the relationship between migration and change of employment taking into account the human capital structure of migrants as well as the human capital structure of employment. The hypothesis most central to the model links human capital selectivity in migration--brain drain or brain gain--to human capital requirements of jobs gained or lost. The use of a simultaneous equations methodology allows for an examination of concurrent effects between the human capital embodied in migrants and the human capital structure of jobs. The human capital specific model of migration and employment growth is tested with data for medium-sized regions, namely county groups, for the Northwestern states of Idaho, Oregon and Washington. This study area consists of diverse regional types, from resource-based to high-tech manufacturing and service. Throughout the Northwest, considerable variability exists in the human capital structure and the region is therefore well suited to identify the simultaneous effects between human capital selectivity in migration and the human capital structure of employment. The model fails in explaining the migration of the labor force with low and medium human capital, but attracting a labor force with medium human capital contributes significantly to employment growth. The model does a good job in explaining migration and employment growth of the human capital rich: the human capital rich follow knowledge intensive jobs, and growth of these human capital intensive jobs is fueled by migration gains of the human capital rich. The distinction of jobs and labor force by human capital characteristics reveals that the migrant attractive power of new jobs varies by their quality, and that the type of migrants gained differentially affects the kinds and volumes of new jobs created

AB  - The city's Department of Investigation has opened an inquiry into how a well-connected inmate was able to schedule, cater and host a bar mitzvah for his son -- with 60 invited guests and live music -- inside a jail in Lower Manhattan. The inmate, Tuvia Stern, a former fugitive who was facing charges that he stole $1.7 million, held the six-hour kosher-catered party in December in the gymnasium of the Manhattan Detention Complex, apparently with the knowledge of two Correction Department chiefs and the jail's warden, city correction officials said Thursday.

AB  - In 2003, the USA began resettling the first of 12,000 Somali Bantu refugees in cities and towns across America. This study provides a case example of a Somali Bantu refugee�_Ts resettlement journey in order to explore how to better meet the needs of future refugees. It provides a glimpse into the experiences of one family and the services provided to them by a social service resettlement agency. The case study information for this family was gathered from agency case files, including the family�_Ts initial case notes, an extensive interview videotaped in March 2008 with the mother detailing her experience as a refugee fleeing her home country and her family�_Ts resettlement journey to the USA, and in-depth qualitative interviews with the family�_Ts caseworker. As the number of refugees grows worldwide, it is essential for social work professionals to actively explore various options to address global refugee concerns

AB  - This dissertation examines the literary corpus of the modernEgyptian short story writer Mohammad al-Makhzanj+�. It provides a critical reading of approximately one quarter of the author's work. The fundamental issue linking the four chapters of the dissertation is the examination of the responses of individual characters to the exercise of power by a variety of actors. The latter include physicians, imagined representatives of the Islamist movement, and prison officials. Although the sample of texts studied is minority of the author's literary corpus, the theoretical basis of our analysis is wide-ranging and varied as we examine such issues as the body, detention, and exile. Our first chapter examines the author's use of the hospital and the nature of the relationship linking the patient and the physician. We conduct our readings in light of the work of such writers as Y++suf Idr s and Nawal El Saadawi. We pay special attention to the patient's response to the powerful and socially valued physician. Next, we analyze those stories that present a vision of the impact of a powerful Islamist movement on the individual citizen. The third chapter shifts to the issue of the prison. Al-Makhzanj+� offers powerful images of the conditions of incarceration in the state's prisons. Moreover, the author suggests that the methods of control prevailing in the prison exist outside the detention center, devaluing the citizen just as they do the inmate. Finally, we consider the notion of escape, both from the control of the state, through exile, and release from a painful existence, through paranormal experience

AB  - Examined past differences in family-related values and behavior patterns of Irish and Italian American Catholics compared with contemporary patterns for intermarriage compatibility. The major data source was a series of social surveys (J. A. Davis and T. W. Smith, 1984). Irish vs Italian opinions on ideal family size and divorce laws were further apart in younger than in older age groups, with little change in the extent of differences in socialization values and some convergence of opinion on women's roles. Overall, there was a tendency toward more modern opinions in the more recent generation, with some retention of old world culture or the effects of the migrant assimilation process.

AB  - Despite low rates of labor force participation and employment, internal and international migrants continue to flow toward Abidjan. This has raised the following questions: Can one attribute these low rates to an ever growing number of immigrants to Abidjan? Are newcomers channelled toward the so-called informal sector? Some studies of Sub-Saharan Africa suggested that migrants are confined to the informal sector and to its lowest tier. Other studies have challenged that view by showing that migrants are able to adapt themselves rapidly to a new environment and become as productive or even more productive than people in their destination area. This paper uses data from the 1985 and 1986 Living Standards Measurement Surveys in Cote d'Ivoire to answer at least partly these questions. It investigates the relationships between migration and the labor market in Abidjan and analyzes the impact of migration on labor force activity, employment, sectoral labor force distribution, and earnings, taking into account age, gender, education, citizenship and ethnic origin. The findings are that male migrants are as likely as male nonmigrants to be active participants in the labor force and to be employed. Female migrants from rural origin are the least likely to be in the labor force, whereas female migrants from urban origin are the most likely to be unemployed. However, migrants have the same chances as nonmigrants to be wageworkers, to work for the public sector, to have formal work, and to have high earnings. Other findings not related to the migration status are that women have very little access to wage work in the private sector. Compared to men, they are more likely to be self-employed than wageworkers. But once women are wageworkers, they are more likely to enter the public sector than the private sector. Finally, women's earnings are lower than men's earnings. These results reveal that internal male migrants do not represent a target group requiring special social and economic measures and add to previous research on women in development by identifying female migrants as the most deprived group in the labor market when labor force participation and employment are concerned

AB  - This paper, by providing a profile of Andrew Voyce, describes a journey of recovery, from a life of being a �_orevolving door�__ patient, to homelessness, to re-establishing an ordinary life in the community. The inmate's perspective is one that has largely been absent from narratives of asylum care. Andrew gives a short biography and is then interviewed by the author. Areas covered in the interview include the central role of Mrs Thatcher in closing down the old asylums, homelessness, education, benefits and digital art. Andrew's recovery from long term mental health problems has seen him return to higher education. He failed to get his undergraduate degree, but decades later and with the encouragement of workers in the community, he completed both undergraduate and postgraduate studies. He talks of the negative impact of asylum care, especially the terrible side effect of akathisia, which resulted from the depot neuroleptic medication

Two crucial news events in particular, the 1999 landings of Fujian Chinese migrants off the coast of British Columbia, and the focus on the ostensibly porous Canadian border following the September 2001 attacks in the United States, are analyzed in terms of their impacts on the introduction and intensification of trafficking and security policies, as well as selection, interdiction and enforcement (deportation/detention) practices. This project draws on and reworks theories of biopolitics and governmentality, along with the emerging literature on affect in cultural studies, to consider the effects that spectacular news events around migration have on the governmental formation of immigration policies. Methodologically, it draws on elements of interpretive and discourse analysis, qualitative interviews, along with an approach developed to account for the affective dimensions of news events in everyday life. The thesis argues that these highly affective news media events have been crucial to the formation of an increasingly racialized and sexualized biopolitics of migration focused on the preventative targeting of "risky" migrant bodies and their precarious movements and labour, as crystallized in the recent Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (2002) and the Safe Third Country Agreement (2004)

AB  - Long-term prospective data (more than 10 years) about the mental health of refugees is limited. This paper reports the long-term course and predictors of psychological distress as revealed in the third interview phase of a longitudinal, community cohort study of Vietnamese refugees settled in Norway. Eighty people, 57% of the original cohort interviewed in 1982 (T1) and 1985 (T2), completed a self-report questionnaire prior to a semi-structured interview. Mental health was measured using the Symptom Checklist�_"90�_"Revised (SCL�_"90�_"R). There were 12 women and 68 men, with a mean age of 47.5 years at T3. A Norwegian normative sample was included for comparison. The SCL�_"90�_"R mean Global Severity Index (GSI) decreased significantly from T1 to T3 (2005�_"6), but there was no significant change in the percentage reaching threshold scores (GSI =1.00). No gender differences were seen. Trauma-related mental disorder on arrival and the trajectory of symptoms over the first 3 years of resettlement predicted mental health after 23 years. Although self-reported psychological distress decreased significantly over time, a substantially higher proportion of the refugee group still reached threshold scores after 23 years of resettlement compared with the Norwegian population. It is suggested that refugees reaching threshold scores on measures such as the SCL�_"90�_"R soon after arrival warrant comprehensive clinical assessment

AB  - Haya de la Torre, V��ctor Raǧl (v�"k�_�t��r r��o�"o�"l�_� �σ_�y�� d�_ l�� t��_�r� ), 1895�_"1979, Peruvian political leader, founder of the APRA party. Although he never held power and spent much of his political life in exile or in prison, he had great influence on contemporary hemispheric politics. A leading advocate of nationalist revolutions in Latin America, he championed the cause of the indigenous people and fought for radical, although expressly non-Communist, social and economic reforms. He was exiled in 1923 and after eight years returned to Peru, where he ran unsuccessfully for the presidency in 1931 and was imprisoned for 15 months. Because APRA advocated the overthrow of the oligarchy that had ruled Peru since colonial days, the party was outlawed from 1931 to 1934 and from 1935 to 1945, when JosǸ Luis Bustamante y Rivero became president with APRA's support. Dissident Apristas revolted in Callao in Oct., 1948; the party was again outlawed. In November, Manuel Odr��a seized power and forced Haya to seek asylum in the Colombian embassy in Lima. The Peruvian government granted him safe conduct in 1954 only after years of bitter denunciations from liberals throughout the hemisphere. APRA was legalized in 1956, but Haya continued to live mostly abroad until 1962 when he returned to campaign for the presidency. He obtained a slim plurality but not enough to be constitutionally elected; a military junta nullified the elections. Running again in 1963, Haya was defeated, but APRA remained popular.

AB  - Abstract: The Jurassic brachiopod fauna of the Alpine�_"Mediterranean region is dominated by smooth rhynchonellids and spiriferinids and sulcate or perforate terebratulids, in contrast to the typical coarsely ribbed brachiopods of the contemporaneous European and African epicontinental areas. The best studied example of the Mediterranean brachiopod province is the Pliensbachian fauna of the Bakony Mountains (Hungary). There the five most abundant genera are all smooth (Linguithyris, Securithyris, Apringia, Bakonyithyris, Pisirhynchia). These smooth genera represent different morphological types (sulcate, axiniform, uniplicate). Phylogenetically related forms are known from several evolutionary lineages of discontinuous record ranging from the Triassic to the Recent. The Triassic�_"Jurassic and the Neogene�_"Recent parts of these evolutionary lineages are represented by several genera, while in the Late Cretaceous�_"Paleogene interval they seemingly disappear, at least they have no record. The Recent relatives of the above Pliensbachian genera live mostly in the deep sea: three are shallow bathyal (200�_"400 m), three deep bathyal (800�_"1200 m) and three abyssal (2000�_"4500 m). The abyssal genera occur mainly in the East Pacific. The geographical distribution of the bathyal genera shows peculiar features: they are more or less confined to the western sides of the great ocean basins (West Pacific, West Indian Ocean, Caribbean region) and they are �_othalassobathyal�__, i.e., they are living on submarine plateaus, seamounts or island aprons and not on the continental slopes. This pattern, extrapolated to the past, shows good analogy with the Jurassic palaeogeographical model developed for the western part of the Tethys Ocean. It is hypothesized that smooth, mainly sulcate, articulate brachiopods flourished in the bathyal or even abyssal zones during the Palaeozoic; they were not refugees but formed well-adapted communities. This stable, conservative fauna may have survived the crises manifested in the shelf seas and, in cases of appropriate palaeogeographical situations, may have implanted its descendants to the shallow bathyal or even sublittoral regions of the western margins of the ocean basins. The Mediterranean microcontinent system at the western part of the Jurassic Tethys might have been such an invaded region. Correlation between plate tectonic changes of ocean/continent configurations, the presence of ocean basins closed on the west, and the occurrence of smooth articulate brachiopod groups in shallow bathyal to sublittoral settings collectively suggest that the deep-water forms invaded the shallow environments of the western Tethys in Early Mesozoic times and the W Pacific and W Indian Oceans in the Neogene. They stayed in the deep-sea reservoir when a circum-equatorial ocean existed in the Late Mesozoic.

AB  - A plethora of instructional design theories, models, and strategies have been developed. Many of them have been applied and researched in mainstream academic settings and in training and performance settings. At the time of the collection of data of this study, little was known about how instructional design strategies are applied in schools in the camps of refugees and internally-displaced people (IDP). These settings provided a window of opportunity for new research to shed light on how instructional design is used in unusual instructional settings. With millions of people living in refugee and IDP camps every day, there is a need to understand how teachers, who are instructional designers by assignment, do their work. This qualitative phenomenological study aimed at understanding the integration and application of instructional design theories in refugee/IDP settings based on the experiences of nine teachers: two taught in an IDP camp while seven taught in a refugee camp. The study was based on the ADDIE framework. The collection of the data included nine individual interviews and some analysis of instructional design documents. Due to potential security risks, the interviews were conducted in cities outside the refugee/IDP camps. Verbatim transcriptions followed after the oral interviews. Data analysis involved coding the data according to the codes developed based on the theoretical framework. The initial codes were improved during the coding process. Emerging themes, together with the theoretical framework and the research questions, guided the complete analysis of the data. Findings reveal that teachers of refugee/IDP learners learn their teaching strategies from teacher training colleges. However, they do not receive any formal training in instructional design. They use some elements of instructional design theories, but not all of the important elements found in most instructional design theories. The study also demonstrates that refugee/IDP learners and their schools have several issues. Consequently, teachers assume several responsibilities to try to meet these needs, while lacking some of the fundamental skills in dealing with the complexities of these issues of the students. This dissertation ends with a proposal for an instructional design model for refugee/IDP education and new avenues for further research

AB  - ABSTRACT IN ENGLISH: Rather than producing an analytically robust concept of 'ghetto', the social sciences have used the term descriptively, not rarely attributing to it the common sense meaning that is given in the societies where the phenomenon is identified. Through the historiographic production on the Jewish diaspora in renaissance Europe, the sociology of black experience in the Fordist metropoles of the USA, and the anthropology of ethnic marginality in East Asia, this article constructs a relational concept of the ghetto as a Janus- faced instrument of enclosure and etho-racial control. Through this procedure, the ghetto reveals itself to be a socio-organizational device that is made up of four elements (stigma, boundaries, spatial confinement and institutional encapsulation) that use space to reconcile its two contradictory goals: economic exploitation and social ostracism. The ghetto is not a 'natural area' produced by the 'history of migration' (as Louis Wirth argued) but a special form of collective violence concretized in urban space. The articulation of the concept of the ghetto makes it possible to reveal the relationships between 'ghettoization', urban poverty and segregation, as well as clarifying the structural and functional differences between ghettos and ethnic agglomerations. This way of proceeding also makes it possible to highlight th role of the ghetto as matrix and symbolic incubator for the production of a tainted identity, indicating that its study can be carried out through analogy to other institutions oriented toward the forced confinement of dispossessed and dishonored groups such as refugee camps and prisons. // ABSTRACT IN FRENCH: Au lieu de produire un concept analytiquement solide de -� ghetto -+, les Sciences Sociales utilisent le terme de fa+�on descriptive, et souvent elles lui attribuent des significations originaires du sens commum des soci+�t+�s o+� le ph+�nom+�ne est rep+�r+�. A partir de la production historiographique sur la diaspora juive en Europe renaissante, de la Sociologie de l'exp+�rience noire dans la m+�tropole fordiste des Etats-Unis et de l'Anthropologie de la marginalit+� ethnique en Asie Orientale, cet article construit un concept relationnel de ghetto comme un instrument biseaut+� [Janus faced] d'enfermement et de contr+�le ethno-racial. Par l'interm+�diaire de ce proc+�d+�, le ghetto est vu comme un dispositif socio-organisateur compos+� de quatre +�l+�ments (stigmate, limite, enfermement spatial et mise en capsule institutionnelle) qui se sert de l'espace pour r+�unir ses deux propos oppos+�s: exploitation +�conomique et ostracisme social. Le ghetto n'est pas un -� espace naturel -+, r+�sultat -� de l'histoire de la migration -+ (comme Louis Wirth pr+�nait), mais une forme sp+�ciale de violence collective accomplie dans un espace urbain. L'articulation du concept de ghetto favorise le d+�voilement de la relation entre -� la mise en ghetto -+, la pauvret+� urbaine et la s+�gr+�gation, ainsi que l'+�claircissement des diff+�rences structurales et fonctionnelles entre ghettos et agglom+�rations ethniques. Ce d+�marche permet +�galement que nous soulignions le r+�le du ghetto comme la matrice et le g+�n+�rateur symbolique de la production d'une identit+� macul+�e, pour que son +�tude soit faite par analogie +� d'autres institutions tourn+�es vers l'enfermement de groupes de d+�poss+�d+�s et deshonor+�s comme le camp de r+�fugi+�s, la r+�serve et la prison.

AB  - With the supranational integration of the EU, the visible presence of non-white foreigners has become an anomaly, since the Union is predicated on a clear-cut opposition between �_^us�_T Europeans and �_~them�_T, the Third World migrants who are no longer welcome. The building of �_~fortress Europe�_T in the age of labour flexibility and generalised social insecurity has accelerated a twofold movement of ostracism of unwanted Gastarbeiter turned Ausl��nder �_" through external removal via expulsion, and internal extirpation via expanded incarceration �_" directly aimed at those populations embodying the social and symbolic �_~exterior�_T of the emergent post-national Europe. In the process, the penal arm of the state has assumed a pivotal role in articulating the discursive and organizational construction of internal and external insecurity to the point where they have been fused, projecting the darker-skinned illegal or criminal alien �_" the two adjectives have become virtual synonyms �_" as the living antithesis of the New European in the making. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Binnen de Europese Unie wordt de zichtbare aanwezigheid van niet-blanke migranten steeds meer een anomalie. De EU is immers primair gebaseerd op een scherp onderscheid tussen �_~ons�_T Europeanen en �_~de rest�_T. De verwijdering van migranten uit �_~Fort Europa�_T vindt op twee manieren plaats: extern, door uitzetting, maar ook intern: de populaties van gevangenissen bestaan voor een steeds groter deel uit migranten. Lo��c Wacquant betoogt dat Europese staten, net als de vs, niet-blanken in toenemende mate uitsluiten door middel van criminalisering, bestraffing, en opsluiting. Zo vervult de �_~strafstaat�_T een centrale rol in de constructie van de gekleurde illegaal en de criminele buitenlander �_" twee categorie��n die steeds moeilijker te onderscheiden zijn �_" als de belichaming van alles wat niet Europees is.

AB  - In the USA Blacks are overrepresented in prisons, in the European Union we have the same phenomenon with immigrants from postcolonial states and certain ethnic groups. In both cases the overincarceration is not caused by a special propensity to criminal acts of these groups, but by a certain neoliberal strategy to react with the penal system against urban poverty. In the case of the EU it is also a ritual response to processes of immigration, producing boundaries, which allow to confirm a European citizenship. The further result of this strategy is depoliticization of social and political problems as well as a certain racialization. Reprinted by permission of Verlag Westf+�lisches Dampfboot

AB  - The article addresses the incarceration or expulsion of migrant populations in Europe. The rate at which foreigners are imprisoned in Europe is compared to incarceration rates of African Americans in U.S. prisons and the increase of mass expulsions of illegal or convicted aliens throughout the European Union is compared to shaming punishments used against African American convicts throughout U.S. history. Anti-immigrant sentiments in Europe, the displacement of foreigners, and the fragmentation of the working class are also discussed

AB  - The majority of unaccompanied asylum seeking children arrive in England in their mid-teens. Planning for transition to adulthood should therefore be at the forefront of care-giving and social work agendas. This paper reviews current research evidence on the response of social work services to this group of young people, with a specific focus on what is known about the circumstances in which young people may be best prepared for adult life, how they fare in comparison to other young people in public care, and on the challenges presented for pathway planning. The paper notes that: changes to the legal duties of agencies have led to some increase in legal protection; stable, supportive placements are important for education, health and well-being; pathway planning must take account of likely outcomes of asylum claims; and current pathway planning and support arrangements for this group are highly variable. The author concludes that there is a need for a broader research agenda in order to strengthen the evidence base to support policy and practice

AB  - Unaccompanied asylum-seeking young people form a small but significant part of the UK looked after children population. This research study details and examines the results of a census survey of four disparate local authorities, collectively looking after over 2000 unaccompanied young people. The circumstances and needs of these young people are complex and as a group they require careful and sensitive assessment, planning and placement. Foster carers are at the heart of this task, providing family care against a background of uncertainty, anxiety and potential risk. The study examined: how these young people and foster carers build relationships; how local authorities address the challenge of caring for unaccompanied asylum-seeking young people; and whether their actions result in successful integration into UK society of these young people, or continuing problems. Postal surveys and interviews were undertaken with a number of foster carers (23 interviews) and young people (21 interviews) to understand their experiences in placements, and a policy and practice study included focus groups to gather the views of social workers (n=31), young people (n=19) and key stakeholders. The results of the study revealed ongoing changes in the way in which unaccompanied asylum-seeking young people are looked after and the main features of the fostering task, insights into how young people and foster carers felt about their placements, and key implications for policy and practice

AB  - North and South America were first populated by three waves of migrants from Siberia rather than just a single migration, say researchers who have studied the whole genomes of Native Americans in South America and Canada. Some scientists assert that the Americas were peopled in one large migration from Siberia that happened about 15,000 years ago, but the new genetic research shows that this central episode was followed by at least two smaller migrations from Siberia, one by people who became the ancestors of today's Eskimos and Aleutians and another by people speaking Na-Dene, whose descendants are confined to North America. The research was published online on Wednesday in the journal Nature.

AB  - In British Columbia, Oregon, and California, coastal Ascaphus populations are designated 'at risk.' Local extirpation is a concern because recolonization may be slow, even if post-logging habitats recover quickly. In coastal BC streams flowing through clearcuts, second growth, and old growth, I investigated movements of larval Ascaphus and associations with stream parameters using area-constrained stream surveys. In old growth, larvae moved seven times farther than in clearcuts. Embedded logs, abundant in clearcut streams, may explain shorter larval movements. Using pitfall traps, I examined terrestrial movements of Ascaphus in clearcuts and old growth. More juveniles were trapped in clearcuts but more mature adults were trapped in old growth, suggesting fewer effective migrants in clearcuts. Many frogs moved at least 100 m from streams, and exhibited weaker stream affinity compared to inland Ascaphus that moved at least 12 m. In fall, I trapped frogs farther from streams in old growth than in clearcuts, and more frogs were trapped within 25 m of streams in clearcuts. Long distance overland movements appear more likely where forested stands are present. Using RAPDs, I examined population genetic structure of Ascaphus in an old growth and clearcut stream. In the clearcut, larvae were less diverse than in the old growth and exhibited no relationship between physical distance and genetic relatedness. In the old growth, larvae decreased in genetic similarity with increasing physical distance. Lower heterozygosity in the clearcut suggests that Ascaphus may be less able to adapt to environmental fluctuations and more susceptible to disease than larvae in the old growth. Maintaining viable populations throughout the range of Ascaphus is an underlying assumption of my thesis. My results suggest reduced recolonization potential and lower genetic variation where forest cover is absent. Aggregations of Ascaphus at individual streams may not represent distinct populations, and should not be managed as distinct units. Connectivity between multiple streams within a watershed will be a more meaningful unit of management than individual streams with forested buffers. Conservation measures more likely to promote long-term population persistence should be considered, such as the retention of a partial forest matrix between streams

AB  - "Examining a century of twists and turns in anti-cancer campaigns, this path-breaking study shows how American cancer awareness, prevention, treatment, and survival have been refracted through the lens of race. As cancer went from being a white woman's nemesis to a "democratic disease" to a fearsome threat in communities of color, experts and the lay public interpreted these trends as lessons about women, men, and the color line. Drawing on film and fiction, on medical and epidemiological evidence, and on patients' accounts, Keith Wailoo tracks cancer's transformation--how theories of risk evolved with changes in women's roles and African-American and new immigrant migration trends, with the growth of federal cancer surveillance, economic depression and world war, and with diagnostic advances, racial protest, and contemporary health activism. A pioneering study of health communication in America, the book skillfully documents how race and gender became central motifs in the birth of cancer awareness, how patterns and perceptions changed, and how the "war on cancer" continues to be waged along the color line"--Provided by publisher

AB  - Mahathir Mohamad turned Malaysia into one of the developing world's most successful economies. He adopted pragmatic economic policies alongside repressive political measures and showed that Islam was compatible with representative government and modernization. He emerged as a Third World champion and Islamic spokesman by standing up to the West. The grandson of an Indian immigrant and the first Malay commoner to become prime minister of Malaysia, Mahathir Mohamad turned the Muslim-majority Southeast Asian country into one of the developing world's most successful economies. During his 22 years in power he adopted pragmatic economic policies alongside repressive political measures, and showed that Islam was compatible with representative government and modernization. Abrasive and outspoken, Mahathir emerged as a Third World champion and Islamic spokesman by condemning the West, not least for trying to impose liberal democracy and neo-liberal economics on developing nations. By raising living standards and winning international acclaim, he contributed to a sense of national identity, pride and confidence among ethnically diverse Malaysians. But in mixing business and politics, Mahathir encouraged cronyism and failed to prevent the spread of corruption. Authoritarian and impatient, he jailed opponents, sacked rivals and undermined institutions as he pursued his obsession with development. In retirement, he broke a promise to stay out of politics, falling out with his two successors while using all available means to protect his legacy '...an astute and thorough new biography...' The Economist ...it reads like a thriller...this is a book about Malaysia that must be read.' The Jakarta Post 'Mr. Wain's book is biography at its best.' The Wall Street Journal '...a masterful biography...Malaysian Maverick is both meticulous and magisterial. This is journalism of the highest order.' Lowy Institute for International Policy 'Barry Wain's Malaysian Maverick will, for a long time to come, be the best companion for a painful national soul-searching for Malaysia...Wain spent two-and-a-half years painstakingly putting together this revealing book...For those who want a peek into the rollercoaster years under Dr. Mahathir and at the same time search for a different future for Malaysia, this is an indispensable guide.' - Malaysiana

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review is designed to update readers on recent discussions and research regarding vulnerable populations in medicine, including patients who are socioeconomically disadvantaged, queer, in prison or labeled with a stigmatizing complex medical disease RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have more closely examined the effects of being part of a vulnerable population. Greater societal income inequality impacts those at the lower end of the income curve by increasing mortality and heightening the importance of individual personal situations. Recommendations from an extensive WHO report on the social determinants of health may affect social policy and use of public resources in Europe. Clinicians are undereducated about the lives and concerns of vulnerable populations, including LGBTQI persons, immigrants, physicians, prisoners, and families of patients with diseases considered 'incompatible with life' SUMMARY: Greater understanding of the cause of the health effects of being socioeconomically disadvantaged or being a member of a vulnerable population may be the first steps toward specific policy recommendations. Professional medical organizations and advocacy groups should raise awareness, provide education, publish guidelines and define the goals for the medical care for certain vulnerable populations.Vulnerable populations are at risk for disparate healthcare access and outcomes because of economic, cultural, ethnic or health characteristics. Vulnerable populations include patients who are racial or ethnic minorities, children, elderly, socioeconomically disadvantaged, underinsured or those with certain medical conditions. Members of vulnerable populations often have health conditions that are exacerbated by unnecessarily inadequate healthcare

AB  - The highly seasonal nature of Yakima Valley agriculture requires much transient labor, especially during the months of September and October. The workers involved in the seasonal influx include immigrants from the drought states, "bindle tramps' migratory family workers, and casual agricultural workers. While most of the migratory workers have no fixed pattern of migration, large numbers of them follow one of several definite movements. Many of the casual workers come from the nearby cities and stay only during the harvest season; some travel coastwise following the seasons from California to Washington; others follow shorter routes which are confined to the Northwest. The drought refugees usually come directly into the valley and scatter over the state when the working season doses.

AB  - (from the chapter) This chapter discusses the space within which therapy in schools occurs. Before looking at the practical aspects of the room�_"what's involved in booking and preparing it for sessions�_"it's useful to think about the symbolic significance of the space, both on a conscious and unconscious level. Using the same room each week communicates to the child that the physical boundaries framing the work are reliable and dependable, echoing the consistency and availability of the therapist for the child. Ensuring that the same room is available each week contributes to creating a therapeutic culture both within the room and outside, in the school at large. Staff and pupils come to know what the room is used for and when sessions take place. This should result in fewer disruptions, especially once the school therapist has established the service. As the therapeutic relationship unfolds, the room in which the ongoing narrative takes shape acts as a symbolic container. The room itself holds the client's story as well as the emotional history of past and present relationships, including both the real and the transference relationship between client and therapist. On a deeply unconscious level, the room comes to stand for the outer receptacle holding the contents of the client's mind, a concrete manifestation of the therapist's mind, which contains and processes what is revealed, both verbally and non-verbally, as well as all that is fantasised about in that particular space. Because of the symbolic power of the room, most practitioners choose to arrange it in the same way each week and have a fixed set of art and play resources available. This conveys the message that in the face of powerful primitive feelings, fantasies and mental states, the room�_"and, by association, the therapist's mind�_"can function as a robust enough container. It goes without saying, however, that the most important component of this process is the therapist's mind: her capacity to go on thinking and not be overwhelmed by the material presented. So, while a dedicated and secure room is the ideal, many therapists do their work day in and day out in less than perfect circumstances ranging from different rooms every week in the school setting to providing out-of-door sessions in refugee camps.

AB  - Trichuriasis may be asymptomatic or, in heavy infection, lead to profuse, bloody diarrhea and rectal prolapse. Diagnosis is made by finding the distinctive barrel shaped eggs in the stool or in the heavily infested patient, by anoscopy and identification of worms attached to reddened and ulcerated rectal mucosa. Mebendazole is the drug of choice in treatment. Capillariasis, a parasitic infection encountered mainly in the Philippine Islands, is of interest in that the eggs may be confused with the eggs of trichuris. Hookworm disease is generally asymptomatic, but in heavy infection, leads to iron deficiency and hypochromic, microcytic anemia. Diagnosis is made by finding the characteristic hookworm eggs on a examination of a direct fecal film. Accidental invasion of humans by dog and cat hookworm leads to cutaneous larva migrans, also known as "creeping eruption." Human hookworm is treated most effectively with mebendazole, while the rash produced by creeping eruption responds to topical thiabendazole. Strongyloides is fairly common in rural areas of the southeastern United States and may be seen in the urban setting among inmates of mental institutions, prisons, and in immigrants who formerly resided in endemic tropical regions. Because of its remarkable capacity for dissemination of larvae throughout the body, this parasite is now recognized as a serious problem for the patient who is immunocompromised. Diagnosis is made by finding larvae in the stool or by the Enterotest. All infected patients should be treated with thiabendazole. I consider the issue on Drugs For Parasitic Infections, published annually or biannually by The Medical Letter on Drugs and Therapeutics, to be the single best source of information on the treatment of parasitic diseases for primary care physicians.

AB  - Concern with the prospects and experience of the `new' second generation now stands at the top of the immigration research agenda in the United States. In contrast to the past, many immigrant offspring appear to be rapidly heading upward, exemplified by the large number of Chinese, Korean, Indian and other Asian-origin students enrolled in the nation's leading universities, some the children of workers, others the descendants of immigrants who moved straight into the middle class. On the other hand, knowledgeable observers tell us that the offspring of today's poorly educated immigrants are likely to experience a very different fate. In their view, post-industrial America is an inhospitable place for low-skilled immigrants and their offspring, as the latter are likely not to be integrated into the mainstream but acculturated into the ways and lifestyles of their underclass neighbours. We advance an alternative perspective, not captured by these two opposing views: namely, that the children of recent immigrants will follow in the footsteps of the offspring of Italian or Polish labour migrants of the turn of the last century, gaining incorporation into working-class America. Using samples of the Current Population Survey (CPS), we evaluate these hypotheses, comparing job holding and job quality patterns among the descendants of immigrants and their native counterparts.

AB  - The original inhabitants of North America have experienced great social upheaval since the arrival of the first Europeans after 1492. While not immigrants per se, they have experienced the negative consequences of the arrival of immigrants, initially from Europe, and have been forced to abandon their traditional territories and ways of life. Some were forcibly removed as entire communities or populations to other regions; some were confined to small "reserve" lands; some were taken away to residential schools; and some were enticed to move into cities. Throughout these events, government efforts at assimilation proved variably successful. The purpose of this chapter is to describe the current mental health implications of these processes with a particular focus on the aboriginal population of Canada. [Text, p. 169]

AB  - Many American elders retire to age-restricted planned retirement communities in the Sun Belt, often choosing to live at great distance from supportive family and friends. The social costs and opportunities associated with these migrations are of interest to researchers as well as prospective retirees. This longitudinal study examined changes in supportive relationships reported by 255 residents of an age-restricted planned retirement community located in the Southwest. Residents reported on their sources of social support prior to relocation and after approximately four years of residence. Those who had relocated from distant (out-of-state) communities were contrasted with those who moved from the local metropolitan area. After four years, long distance migrants reported a social support deficit compared to what they had experienced in their previous communities. In contrast, local movers reported a significant increase in supportive relationships over the four-year period. These results held for a global (average) measure of support and more specific indices of emotional support and assistance with an ill spouse. However, long distance migrants appeared to be making more new friends within the confines of the community. The data suggest that, for some older persons, relocation to a local planned community might be more advantageous than a long distance move. Implications for environmental theories of aging and communication are discussed.

AB  - In 1598 the monastic life for English women was revived, sixty years after Henry VIII dissolved the last convents. Over the next century twenty-two expatriate cloisters were established in the southern Netherlands, France and Portugal, recruiting the daughters of the English Catholic gentry and aristrocracy. In contrast to the better known educative and missionary order founded by Mary Ward, these religious houses were strictly contemplative and thus enclosed. Yet neither exile nor incarceration constrained the nuns' activities within the narrow confines of their convent walls. Instead they participated in the major political and confessional controversies of the seventeenth century. As craftswomen, musicians, patrons, political activists, authors, mystics and sprirtual advisors, the English abbesses and their nuns reveal how early modern women successfully negotiated the strictures imposed by a patriarchal church and society to create female spaces outside the usual spheres of domestic household and royal court '...Walker has broken new ground in early modern women's history.' - J.

AB  - This paper is the written counterpart to a presentation given in Ha Noi, Vietnam, May 15, 2008 during the United Nations Day of Vesak 2008 Convention, on the effects of war and healing. The paper introduces the work of the Harvard Program in Refugee Trauma (HPRT) located in Boston, Massachusetts. It describes the HPRT Global Mission of education and capacity building of health care professionals, international relief workers, and policy makers in the area of mental health in nations suffering post-conflict and disaster recovery. In particular the paper discusses the HPRT's unique approach to assisting individuals with severe traumatic histories as seen through the lens of the author's work as a psychopharmacologist with Southeast Asians and a team member of the HPRT in Lynn, Massachusetts, through the Lynn Community Health Center (LCHC). LCHC is a multi-disciplinary outpatient health service clinic located north of Boston, Massachusetts. Many patients who have survived genocide, torture, imprisonment, and war suffer from chronic PTSD with the sequellae of depression, nightmares, inability to work gainfully, and panic anxiety. Two stories of actual patients (their identifying data protected) are presented to illustrate self-healing and the role of mindfulness, the function of memory in storytelling and recovery, and the value of spirituality, work, and altruism in healing.

Glenys Kinnock chair of One World Action cites that women refugees are always depicted negatively as anguished women, helpless and needing to be saved. Many women who suffered the consequence of emergencies lead the fight for survival. During emergency situations, women play the roles that are previously undertaken by men. It was further cited hat women have become involved in every aspect of life and has taken responsibility in all aspects of life

AB  - Immigrants from Jamaica represent the largest number of migrants to the United States from the English speaking Caribbean. Research indicates that of all Caribbean immigrants they are most likely to retain the ethnic identity of their home country for the longest period of time. This dissertation explored the nature of ethnic identity and sought to determine its impact upon the additional variables of self-esteem and academic factors. A secondary analysis was carried out using data collected in the Spring of 1992 by Portes and Rumbaut on the children of immigrants attending the eighth and ninth grades in local schools in San Diego and southern Florida. A sample of 151 second-generation Jamaican immigrants was selected from the data set. Six hypotheses yielded mixed results. Both parents who have a Jamaican ethnic identity present in the household are the best predictor Jamaican youth who retain a Jamaican ethnic identity. It was expected that ethnic identity would be a predictor of positive academic factors. The study showed that ethnic identity was not associated with one of the academic factors which were examined: help given with homework. Neither family economic status nor parents' level of education played a significant role in the retention of Jamaican identity. Other findings were that there was no mean difference in the self-esteem scores of respondents who had similar ethnic identities to their parents and those who did not. There was also no difference found in the academic factors of either group. The study also showed that there was a small correlation between parent-child conflict and self-esteem. Specifically, the study found that the higher the conflict between youth and their parents, the lower the self-esteem of the youth. Finally it found that time lived in the U.S. was the best predictor of a higher GPA and it was also related to lower self-esteem. Surprisingly, the study found that the relationship between ethnic identity and SES was the opposite of what was expected in that it found that SES was higher when there was no Jamaican identity.

AB  - Immigrants from Jamaica represent the largest number of migrants to the United States from the English speaking Caribbean. Research indicates that of all Caribbean immigrants they are most likely to retain the ethnic identity of their home country for the longest period of time. This dissertation explored the nature of ethnic identity and sought to determine its impact upon the additional variables of self-esteem and academic factors. A secondary analysis was carried out using data collected in the Spring of 1992 by Portes and Rumbaut on the children of immigrants attending the eighth and ninth grades in local schools in San Diego and southern Florida. A sample of 151 second-generation Jamaican immigrants was selected from the data set. Six hypotheses yielded mixed results. Both parents who have a Jamaican ethnic identity present in the household are the best predictor Jamaican youth who retain a Jamaican ethnic identity. It was expected that ethnic identity would be a predictor of positive academic factors. The study showed that ethnic identity was not associated with one of the academic factors which were examined: help given with homework. Neither family economic status nor parents' level of education played a significant role in the retention of Jamaican identity. Other findings were that there was no mean difference in the self-esteem scores of respondents who had similar ethnic identities to their parents and those who did not. There was also no difference found in the academic factors of either group. The study also showed that there was a small correlation between parent-child conflict and self-esteem. Specifically, the study found that the higher the conflict between youth and their parents, the lower the self-esteem of the youth. Finally it found that time lived in the U.S. was the best predictor of a higher GPA and it was also related to lower self-esteem. Surprisingly, the study found that the relationship between ethnic identity and SES was the opposite of what was expected in that it found that SES was higher when there was no Jamaican identity

AB  - This dissertation describes a qualitative research study about the educational experiences of Cambodian American students conducted in a community in the northeastern United States from January to November of 2003. The study investigated the experiences of fourteen Cambodian American young people, ages 16-23, in a small college community using both individual and group interviews as the primary source of data collection. The study examined how the participants' cultural identities and family expectations influenced their interaction with the school system and how teachers' practices and institutional policies affected the young people's striving for academic achievement. This study contributes to understanding why schools are not providing successful educational experiences for Cambodian American students as suggested by their disproportionate rates of dropping out and classification as learning disabled, and by views held by their teachers and sometimes themselves that they are low achieving students. The participants reflected the diversity among Cambodian American students: some were still in school; some had graduated; some had dropped out. They included males and females, those who had been born in Cambodia or in refugee camps and those who were born in the United States. They all presented their perspectives on both the supportive aspects of school and those aspects that had hindered their success. The study described in this dissertation explored the participants' experiences through the theoretical perspectives of multicultural education, culturally relevant pedagogy and critical race theory. An important aspect of this study was the centering of the young people's voices as the primary source of knowledge. This study generated a number of significant findings that emerged from the data. One finding illustrated the extensive influence their families and cultural teachings exerted on the students' lives, most relevantly in the school context. Another finding portrayed the dynamic nature of the students' identities in their lives as adolescents and bicultural border crossers. Other findings depicted the school experiences that supported the students in their educational journey as well as the obstacles that hindered their progress

AB  - Foreign domestic workers play an essential role in nearly every Kuwaiti household. More than 660,000 foreign domestic workers from Asia and Africa, the majority of whom are women, work for Kuwait's 1.3 million citizens, as well as for foreign residents living in the country. While some employers develop an affectionate and caring bond with the women who care for their children, cook their meals, and clean their homes, others take advantage of weak legal protections and an isolated home environment that shields human rights abuses from outside scrutiny. The sponsorship system, through which Kuwait currently regulates domestic labor migration, prevents workers from changing employers without sponsor consent and criminalizes workers for leaving their workplace without employer permission. These restrictions make it very difficult for a worker to terminate her employment with an employer, and effectively pressure workers to remain in the employment of even abusive employers. In particular, the 'absconding provision' in the implementing regulations of the Aliens' Residence Law penalizes workers whose employers report them as 'absconding' with up to six months in prison, or KD 400 in fines, or both of these punishments. This report makes recommendations to Kuwait's Parliament and government ministries regarding ways these issues may be addressed

AB  - Approximately 165 Spanish-language newspapers were published in the borderlands of Texas-Mexico from 1830-1910, but few issues survive. These publications provided official information, preserved the Spanish language, acted as a cultural anchor for new immigrants, and assumed an activist role in Mexicano/Tejano affairs. Before the Texas Rebellion and the Mexican-American War, most Spanish-language newspapers in northern Mexico adopted a militaristic "invaders" view of the United States and Anglos. The newspapers emulated the model of the Mexico City publications. With the coming of Anglos in greater numbers, borderlands publications in Spanish copied features of both Mexican and American models. After the two wars, some newspapers grew more introspective about the role and future of the displaced Mexicano in Anglo culture. Editors often promoted retention of cultural identity, made Hispanic residents aware of their rights in their new country, an encouraged improvement through education, morality, and political involvement. San Antonio briefly became the site of the first significant and sustained Spanishlanguage newspapers inside the state's present borders, but was temporarily supplanted when growth in Laredo, El Paso, and Brownsville encouraged varying degrees of successful publication there. After the Mexican-American War, some Spanish-language newspapers were published by Anglos, frequently to reach a target audience for commerce or political influence. When not focusing on Mexico, Mexicano/Tejano-published newspapers became more pointed in their criticism of Anglo abuses of power, but not to the degree which might be expected at the local level. Editors were members of the business community, and may have sought some accommodation between themselves and local Anglo colleagues who could assist long-term goals such as bilingual instruction in public schools, suffrage, and decreased discrimination. Most such editors might be characterized in post-modern terms as the sort of moderate leaders more likely to be members of the Chamber of Commerce and League of United Latin American Citizens than of more radical activist organizations such as La Raza Unida. They remained critical of certain institutions such as the legal and education systems. Such publications provided the first opportunity for Tejana women to express themselves on public issues

AB  - The article reports that Minnesota is set to become the first state of the U.S. to require schools to perform lockdown drills to practice their response to student shootings. Schools would have to conduct the drills at least five times a year. Under the proposed legislation, students will be confined inside locked classrooms to practice taking refuge from and isolating intruders or armed students before police arrive. The legislation has been cosponsored by Democrat Minnesota senator John Marty. The proposed statute would cut the number of fire alarm tests schools would perform annually, to make time for the lockdown drills

AB  - The Irish are the largest and longest-established non-British minority ethnic group in Britain, but their difference is recognised only in the migrant generation. Unlike the second generations of the so-called �_~visible�_T ethnic groups, children of Irish-born parents in England are assumed to be British (or English) because they are (mostly) white and have no Irish accent. The invisibility of Irish-British identities reflects both an assumption by the majority society of �_~white�_T cultural sameness and self censorship because of ongoing anti-Irish attitudes. This paper reports on the findings of the Irish 2 Project, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council to examine the social positionings and identities of people born in Britain to one or two Irish-born parents. Group discussions and interviews with people of immediate Irish descent were carried out in four English locations (London, Manchester, Coventry and Banbury). These show that significant elements of Irishness persist in a multitude of ways which have no public recognition. Their expression is confined to interstitial spaces of resistance�_"the home, school friendship groups, community organisations. They are strongly contextualised in space and over time, and are also socially differentiated by class, gender and age.

AB  - We used multiple lines of evidence to assess habitat selection, dietary choice, and nutritional outcomes for a population of North American elk ( Cervus elaphus), confined to a relatively small and isolated landscape of public and private land in south-central Great Plains, USA. The area of suitable elk habitat was a topographically diverse matrix of mature oak savannah, C4-dominated grasslands, and C3-dominated agricultural fields surrounded by unsuitable lowlands fragmented by anthropogenic activities. We hypothesized that such disparity in habitat availability and quality resulted in subpopulation differences in the overall elk population. We used 3 methods to evaluate this premise: radiotelemetry to determine home range and habitat use, microhistology of plant fragments in feces to determine dietary selection, and fecal nitrogen (N) and stable isotope ratios of nitrogen (��15N) and carbon (��13C) to assess nutritional outcomes of habitat use and dietary choice. By comparing these 3 approaches, we wanted to determine if fecal indices alone could efficiently and accurately identify subpopulation structuring. Compositional analyses from radiotelemetry observations of 21 female elk identified 2 subpopulations that occupied relatively disjunct areas and showed differential preferences for forested and cultivated fields in summer but comparable preferences for cultivated fields in winter. A third unmarked subpopulation of elk was known to be largely confined to an adjacent wildlife refuge. Microhistological analyses of feces collected in all 3 areas highlighted distinct diets, outcomes of habitat occupation by the 3 subpopulations. Increased use of cultivated forages in winter was evident for 2 of the subpopulations, but the extent of use by elk was dependent on availability of cultivated forages in areas they occupied. The refuge subpopulation had no access to cultivated forage. Fecal N, fecal ��13C, and fecal ��15N supported the premise that the subpopulation with the greatest access to cultivated forages was on a higher nutritional plane than the other 2 subpopulations. Changes in fecal N, fecal ��13C, and fecal ��15N paralleled percentages of cultivated forages in the diets highlighting the utility of such fecal indices as supplemental to or surrogates for traditional methods of habitat use and dietary selection in free-ranging ungulates.

AB  - ABSTRACT IN ENGLISH: Government officials and academics have voiced concern over the sustainability of immigrant concentration in Canada's three largest cities. Although research on the effects of such concentrations suggests both negative and positive outcomes, geographic dispersal has been suggested as an alternative to metropolitan concentration. This paper presents findings from research on immigrant settlement in Kelowna, a second-tier city, and Squamish, a small urban, resource-based community, both in British Columbia. I examine the factors that contribute to immigrant settlement and integration in these regions, and evaluate the urban policies and practices employed by municipal governments in each region to attract, retain, and integrate immigrants. Findings suggest that the municipal governments interviewed do not actively attract immigrants, but they are involved in funding services that assist in immigrant settlement. The successful attraction and retention of immigrants is linked to the pre-existing social and economic context, but it is not necessarily determined by the size of the community. Research findings suggest that in order to succeed, any regional immigration policy must involve all levels of government in a commitment to address credential recognition problems and adequately fund settlement and language service provision. // ABSTRACT IN FRENCH: Les repr+�sentants gouvernementaux et les universitaires ont formul+� leurs inqui+�tudes quant aux cons+�quences de la concentration d'immigrants dans les trois plus grandes villes canadiennes. Bien que l'+�tude des effets de la concentration d'immigrants sugg+�re des r+�sultats +� la fois n+�gatifs et positifs, la dispersion g+�ographique a +�t+� propos+�e comme solution alternative +� la concentration m+�tropolitaine. Cet article pr+�sente les conclusions d'+�tudes portant sur l'+�tablissement des immigrants +� Kelowna, une agglom+�ration urbaine secondaire, et +� Squamish, une petite communaut+� urbaine dont l'industrie est ax+�e sur les ressources, toutes deux en Colombie Britannique. L'auteur examine les facteurs qui contribuent +� l'+�tablissement et +� l'int+�gration des immigrants dans ces r+�gions et +�value les politiques et pratiques urbaines employ+�es par les autorit+�s municipales dans chaque r+�gion pour attirer, retenir et int+�grer les immigrants. Les r+�sultats sugg+�rent que les autorit+�s municipales interrog+�es n'oeuvrent pas activement afin d'attirer les immigrants, mais elles participent au financement des services d'aide +� leur implantation. R+�ussir +� attirer et +� retenir les immigrants est li+� au contexte +�conomique et social pr+�-existant, mais n'est pas n+�cessairement d+�termine par la taille de la communaut+�. Les r+�sultats des +�tudes sugg+�rent que pour r+�ussir, une politique d'immigration r+�gionale doit impliquer tous les niveaux de gouvernement afin de r+�pondre aux probl+�mes de reconnaissance des titres de comp+�tences et de financer de fa+�on ad+�quate les services ax+�s sur l'+�tablissement et les services linguistiques.

AB  - This paper connects the growing interest in immigrant settlement outside of gateway cities, and the noted shift in international student policies from 'red card to red carpet', by exploring what role the higher education sector plays in the attraction and retention of immigrants to second tier cities (STCs). Using the case of Kitchener-Waterloo in Ontario, the qualitative research offers four findings. Firstly, higher education institutions act as the very locus of change in STCs in terms of introducing greater ethnic and cultural diversity; secondly, they act as important attractors and retainers of talent in their own right and in terms of the linkages and connections they create in the local economy; thirdly, international students and immigrants perceive the university as providing a socio-spatial buffer against wider discriminatory behaviours; and lastly, the 'red card to red carpet' policy shift that is underway will only intensify the role higher educational institutions play in international migration. // ABSTRACT IN FRENCH: Ce papier fait la connexion entre l'augmentation des habitats des immigr+�s hors des grandes villes et le changement des polic+�s des +�tudiants +�trangers -� de la carte rouge vers le tapis rouge -+ en exploitant le r+�le de l'+�ducation sup+�rieure pour l'attraction et la r+�tention des immigr+�s dans les villes du secondaires (VS).

Troisi+�ment, les +�tudiants +�trangers et les immigr+�s per+�oivent l'universit+� comme un fournissant socio-spatiale contre les larges comportements discriminatoires.

AB  - Immigrant adaptation to American life varied tremendously from group to group. Depending on the contemporary socioeconomic climate of the larger society, immigrants encountered various levels of acceptance, and therefore, reacted to their new circumstances differently. In the process, distinct social and spatial representations of ethnic groups emerged. Through exposition of the processes of Chinese settlement and economic endeavors in Chicago during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, this dissertation attempts to unpack the driving forces contributing to a well nurtured Chinatown with sophisticated social and cultural facilities, and more importantly, an occupation-driven spatial dispersal of at least 50 percent of the Chinese in the city. Already driven out of manufacturing and mining industries in the West, Chinese came to Chicago as petty businessmen. Predominantly single men, they quickly developed laundry and later restaurant services as their major business endeavors. Economic imperatives attracted them to various neighborhoods where ethnic groups other than Chinese were predominant. Benefiting from mutual-aid rotating credit systems and clan connections that furnished the main source of labor and start-up capital, Chinese laundering services appear to have been well received in eastern and southern European immigrant neighborhoods and expanded into others, more varied neighborhoods as time progressed. Subsequently, more Chinese lived throughout the city than in Chinatown. However, Chicago's Chinatown was the homebase and cultural hearth for Chinese at large. It was in Chinatown that ethnic needs were generously catered to and ethnic pride cultivated. It was in Chinatown that the sick and retired were tended. Chinatown was a "place" where Chinese within and beyond its confines gathered and conducted social, cultural, and business exchanges. The moderate success of Chinese elsewhere and their regular weekend visits contributed tremendously to the economic base of Chinatown and helped to maintain its vitality. While maintaining a strong ethnic enclave, Chinese in Chicago followed the simple economic principle of supply and demand to communities with better business potential. Gambling and prostitution, considered "vices" by the American general public, were incorporated by many Chinese as part of the adaptive strategies in dealing with a severe sex ratio imbalance and personal life deprivation

AB  - Using a case study methodology, this paper intends to provide a preliminary profile of Laotian/Hmong gangs, members aged 12�_"30 yrs. Data for this study was obtained from (1) interviews with detectives in charge of Laotian/Hmong gang cases, (2) interviews with ex-Asian gang members, (3) police incident reports, (4) court documents, (5) criminal justice training materials, and (6) newspaper reports in both English and Lao. Their structure, assimilation, alliance, criminal activities, mobility, physical appearance, refugee camp syndrome, and naming system are discussed. Findings suggest that social disorganizational theory and strain theory are appropriate integrated approaches for examining the formation of Laotian/Hmong gangs.

AB  - My dissertation project explores the question of how activist networks operate in a highly repressive country when outside intervention is restrained. People have seen how effectively the Chinese Communist Party has cracked down on transnational religious activisms sponsored by Falun Gong, the exiled Tibetan government, and the Catholic Church. Nevertheless, Protestant advocacy groups from the United States and elsewhere enter China each year, despite the fact that the Party has stated that no Chinese church is allowed to receive any form of foreign support. I argue that understanding this variation in the success of transnational religious networks sheds light on the significance of an approach to transnational collaboration that is quite different from the "naming and shaming" strategy that dominates the literature on advocacy networks. I tested this strategic alliance argument with a mixed-methods research design, including face-to-face interviews, participant observations in four major cities, and a cross-provincial phone survey in randomly selected prefectures. This project makes notable corrections to previous understanding about protecting minority groups in authoritarian states. First, it addresses the neglect of religion and religious activists in the scholarship on transnational social movements and activism. Second, the strategic collaboration that is demonstrated by religious activists and advocates provides an alternative to the "naming and shaming" strategy of conventional transnational activism that more or less relies on powerful Western states and the United Nations. Third, the project identifies two commonly overlooked causal mechanisms between effective activism and its networks: the alliance strategy of foreign advocates and the leverage provided by government-sponsored social entities. The role of government-sponsored social organizations has been largely ignored in the existing literature. Members from legal entities often help fragile advocacy networks by providing information, legal protection, and connections, while brokering acquiescence from pragmatic local officials. In return, the advocacy networks provide funding, services and, most importantly, necessary legitimacy from globally recognized norms and standards. This unique benefit makes local leaders who ally with the advocacy networks seem more legitimate in the eyes of their own constituency

AB  - This paper directly compares the expectation and reality of care of 16 older Tibetans living in India, a developing country, with 14 living in the developed country of Switzerland (n = 30, 12 women, 18 men, average age 73). The first to offer refugee status to Tibetans, Switzerland and India are the two oldest communities of Tibetans and interviews were conducted in 2007-2008, nearly 50 years after they began. The changes to intergenerational relationships, filial piety in Asian society, context and socioeconomic group are examined. Most participants in India had limited resources and� needed financial support, with parents with many children, and children resident in developed countries receiving better financial support and collective care than those with one child or all of their children still living in India. Participants in Switzerland were entitled to old age benefits, so required emotional support and affirmation only, but dissatisfaction when grown up children adopted western values and the family�_Ts cultural continuity and identity could be lost, was evident. The authors call for old age benefit provision to Tibetans in developing countries, to ensure minimum levels of finance and independence, and in developed countries the promotion of mutual definitions of filial piety among different generations of refugees and immigrants would also help minimise potential problems within intergenerational relationships

AB  - The study examines the acculturation and assimilation of Salvadoran refugees in Los Angeles. It provides an historical background to the civil war in which are embedded their personal reasons for leaving El Salvador and coming to the United States. It is argued that many Salvadorans have a well-founded fear of persecution if deported and that all Salvadorans who are in the U.S. should be granted extended voluntary departure until they can return safely to their country. However, the U.S. government has declared Salvadorans to be "economic refugees," and therefore denies them entry or permission to stay in the U.S. Because they are viewed as "illegal aliens" by the Immigration and Naturalization service ("la Migra"), Salvadorans must be smuggled into the country by professionals ("coyotes"), a trip which is sometimes dangerous. Salvadorans are open to abuses by INS officials, and they live with the constant fear of arrest and deportation. They must also cope with unemployment, crowded living conditions, separation from family and friends, and loss of community. Because they are illegal, Salvadorans are precluded from assimilation into U.S. society. Impediments to acculturation include difficulties with the language, negative attitudes toward U.S., little contact with North Americans, discrimination, an orientation toward Home, and the threat of violence from Salvadoran death squads. It is argued that Salvadoran refugees live in a state of "extended liminality" as the result of their illegal status, and this creates a psychological "prison without bars". The economic consequences of this liminal state are poverty and instability. The psychological consequences are low self-esteem, and ambivalent feelings or conflicting emotions concerning inevitable culture change. Those Salvadorans who desire change are faced with impediments to acculturation (e.g., language barriers), while those who resist change find themselves swallowed up by it (e.g., children acculturating). Change is seen as undesirable by these Salvadorans because of ties to the past, their country and their people. They are oriented to returning to El Salvador, but have little hope of doing so soon. The price of fear for Salvadoran refugees is a social and cultural rootlessness. Salvadorans in the City of the Angels live "half-lives" not only in the physical reality of poverty and marginality, but also the phenomenological experience of extended liminality, being neither part of this society nor of the one they left behind

AB  - This dissertation argues that the split sovereignty of the United Provinces in the seventeenth century enabled the granting of sovereign rights to the Dutch East India Company under its founding charter that formed the legal basis of the Company's imperial realm. The Dutch East India Company devised a legal system in which it exercised its sovereignty in external law by engaging in formal diplomatic relations and concluding treaties with foreign polities. In internal (civil and criminal) law the Company exercised jurisdiction differentially over people according to the way they were categorized. The Dutch East India Company's empire was highly differentiated according to the variety of settlements from trading posts to fully-fledged settler colonies and the Company exercised its sovereign rights differently according to the type of settlement. The imperial capital of the Company empire was Batavia on the island of Java. Batavia was the seat of the High Government and the Court of Justice that was the appellate court for the whole empire. Batavia used its position as imperial capital to set up a network of exile to the major colonies. The Cape of Good Hope and other major Company settlements acted as penal colonies for Batavia, which transported part of its criminal population and also sent political and religious prisoners into exile. The Cape and Robben Island had a particular role in this network of exile as simultaneously the site most visited by Company ships and the most isolated from indigenous Asian networks of trade and shipping. It was therefore in a unique position to act as a penal colony for Batavia's criminals and for religious and political exiles from all over the Indies archipelago. This network of exile had particular consequences for the Company colony at the Cape of Good Hope. The Company officials were unwilling recipients of these prisoners from Batavia because they posed a security risk to the small colony. Increasingly over the eighteenth century, the exiles became a focal point for free burgher opposition against Company rule. The Company was not able to control the dynamics set in motion by this network of exile. Muslim political and religious exiles were important influences on the propagation of Islam at the Cape, while repatriated exiles took Cape Muslim practices back to the Indies

AB  - Acculturation is a worldwide phenomenon. One hundred and seventy-five million people now live outside of their country of origin (United Nations, 2002). But changes arising from intercultural contact are not confined to people who relocate across cultures, such as sojourners, immigrants, and refugees. Acculturation affects indigenous peoples who have been subject to involuntary colonization as well as established ethnocultural communities in multicultural societies (Berry & Sam, 1997). Intercultural contact and change are also important issues for majority groups in societies that are becoming increasingly culturally diverse. This chapter will consider issues confronted by acculturating people and the implications of these issues for counseling professionals. The sociocultural context of the counseling process will receive special attention, and along these lines, counselors are challenged to consider culture contact and change from a broad perspective and acknowledge the social and political influences on and outcomes of the counseling process.

AB  - This study with relatively small scope has limited aims from which limited conclusions can be drawn. The principal aim was to investigate the nature and degree of psychological impairment in Afghan refugees. Secondary aims were to comment on the role of culture (social support network) and explore the effects of age (maturity) and length of stay in refugee camps as these specific factors were believed to influence the relative success of individuals' adaptation. The independent variables in this study are traumatic stress of the war, the age of the subjects, and length of exile. Although this study did not utilize specific scales for measuring PTSD, it has been observed that subjects indicated symptoms matching the criteria of PTSD symptoms as defined in DSM-III. The pattern of emotional disorder among Afghan people as documented in this and other studies is remarkably similar to clinical descriptions of war neuroses as initially described by Kardiner and Spiegel in 1941. Somatization among Afghans as in other Oriental nations is a way of expression for emotional problems and is likely to be a major component of PTSD as reported in the Horowitz model among Afghan subjects.

AB  - This is the first book to examine "migrant-soldiers' in the British army and places the phenomenon of Britain's multicultural army in relation to British culture, history and nationalism. It also explores the impact of war on UK society during the 21st Century. The modern British soldier is routinely portrayed as a hero, while military service is represented as a form of sacrifice that requires recognition from society as a whole. The migrant, in the other hand, remains a focus of resentment, more likely to be seen as a scrounger who drains public resources without giving anything in return. In 1998 the British Army began to recruit from Commonwealth countries, a strategy that simultaneously addressed a labour shortage and the new legal obligations to diversify its workforce. This led to the creation of a new category of migrant-soldiers who found themselves lauded as 'heroes' but stigmatised as 'immigrants' and 'foreigners'. This book explores the phenomenon of Britain's multi-national army, a topic that has passed virtually unnoticed in public debates about immigration, citizenship, multiculturalism, national identity and war. In doing so, it poses searching questions about the relationship between the armed services and the society they are charged to defend 'Military Migrants is a "must read" for people who care about the realities behind the rituals of our militaries. Vron Ware has done such innovative research. The men and women - from Fiji, Nepal, Jamaica, Belize, Ghana - whom the British military recruit to fight Britain's wars come alive on these pages. They have ideas and aspirations and savvy assessments of their own. This is a brilliant book.' - Cynthia Enloe, Research Professor of International Development and Women's Studies at Clark University, USA and author of Nimo's Wars, Emma's War: Making Feminist Sense of the Iraq War 'Is a multicultural British Army a symbol of progress? The figure of the black or Muslim soldier is invoked publicly as a symbol of inclusive Britishnness, and at the same time the diversity of culture and faith are used to enhance and update Britain's claim to global power. This stunning and beautifully written book is essential reading for anyone interested in the multicultural question today.' - Les Back, Goldsmiths, University of London, UK and author of The Art of Listening 'If we are what we defend, then Military Migrants takes us to the heart of how we are defended and what this means. It is both a careful, scrupulous book and a riveting journey through our own country; one filled with new vistas when sometimes all too familiar sounds and images are revealed in unexpected circumstances, as Vron Ware literally brings home to the reader how the country is taking new shapes while resisting change.' - Anthony Barnett, Founder of opendemocracy.net and author of Iron Britannia 'The treatment of Foreign & Commonwealth soldiers within the British Armed Forces is being hotly debated, so the publication of this important work will help generate vital debate!' - Dr Hugh Milroy, Chief Executive, Veterans Aid, UK

AB  - Our goal is to analyze the culture within the San Francisco law firm of Gladstein, Andersen and Leonard (circa 1945-1965). For this we utilize archival documents, FBI files, oral histories, and personal interviews. The law firm represented alleged subversives, including Harry Bridges the longtime president of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union. Thus, the law firm partners were stigmatized by the clients they represented and they all had lengthy FBI files. The partners all had working class backgrounds, one was an immigrant and two were Jewish. Clearly, religion and ethnicity were not litmus tests for participation in the firm, nor was educational pedigree. Gladstein and Leonard graduated from elite law schools while Andersen did his legal training at a night school. During the dark days of the Cold War various partners were threatened, shot and jailed for merely engaging in their legal practice. Ironically, as the FBI blacklisted alleged subversives, these attorneys had more clients to defend. Adapted from the source document. Reprinted by permission of Springer

AB  - In an ethnographic study conducted from August 1993-November 1995, I examined the effects of sociopolitical violence on Guatemalan women in Maya Tec+�n, Mexico. The fieldwork that I conducted addressed the complexities of gender role and ideology transformation, resulting from processes of ladinoization and modernization in a Q'eqci' Maya ethnolinguistic community that was forcibly displaced by sociopolitical violence into a United Nations refugee camp in Campeche, Mexico. In particular, I focus on changes and continuities in women's identities, subsistence activities, healing roles, social support networks, and forms of social organization and communication. In addition to traditional ethnographic methods, including participant observation, surveying, and interviewing, I also employed feminist objectives, principles, and methodologies. I utilized the testimonio method as an experimental feminist method because it allowed me to develop a less authoritative and more advocacy-oriented approach to the fieldwork and writing process. The ethnographic evidence that I present suggests that women respond to the negative effects of the refugee experience through complex strategies involving both an adherence to traditional culture and an embracing of more ladinoized and modernized cultural traditions. I argue that the ethnographic data indicates that women with strong natal kin networks and those who can most readily manipulate their gender identities and roles in response to the isolation, loss of social support, and traumatic stress associated with displacement and encampment, are coping most effectively with the refugee experience. I also argue that traumatic stress, weak social support networks, and isolation are expressed by Q'eqchi' women in an idiom of distress through the culture bound syndrome much' ke. Finally, my research indicates that factors such as an individual's personality, traumatic experiences, age, social support, natal kin networks, and pre-migration contact with Ladino culture contribute to the variability in Q'eqchi' women's responses to culture change. It is this variability that I address in the dissertation. I conclude with recommendations for more gender-sensitive refugee camp administration and a critique of the testimonio method

AB  - The criminalization of immigration has preceded in successive stages including establishment of the criminal alien program, designation of aggravated felonies for deportation, denial of due process rights, and expedited removal procedures. These procedures were in place before application in the "securitization of immigration." After 9/11, a result has been massive retroactive deportation of Mexican and Central American nationals that exceeds their rate of presence in the population. The Violent Gang Task Force, Operation Community Shield and Operation Return to Sender are probable sources of racial profiling producing this disparity. A precursor to the mass repatriation of Latinos is a costly stay in an expensive abusive detention system now expanded by undocumented migrants apprehended crossing the border. This record implies civil and human rights violation which should be addressed by policy change.

AB  - Changes to the asylum process and the expansion of the European Union in 2004 to include the new Accession countries in Eastern Europe means that pressure has been placed on public services due to rapidly changing populations. This paper highlights how, as part of a needs assessment for a community development project to improve access to health and social care services for new migrants, a local health profile of new migrants was produced for Walsall in the West Midlands. Data were compiled from Office for National Statistics estimates of international migration, National Insurance Number applications from overseas nationals, �_~Flag 4�_T GP registrations by new immigrants, United Kingdom Border Agency asylum bulletins, and Citizens Advice Bureau immigration queries. It was assessed that there has been a steady influx of between 800 and 1,400 new migrants per year into Walsall. The majority are young adults from Asia and Eastern Europe, and are living in the southern part of the borough. The authors conclude that this information needs to be updated regularly, shared with relevant partners and used to inform commissioning decisions

AB  - Army action against terrorism in Pakistan led to the largest human migration in this century. About 3.4 million people (internally displaced persons, IDPs) were displaced. The authors visited all major camps and some houses in Mardan area and interviewed IDPs and doctors at these camps and areas to identify medical needs and current state of provision of medical care. This disaster largely represented displacement of millions of people (IDPs) including women and children to a new weather and environment in overcrowded refugee camps and houses. Influx of large number of displaced people created excessive burden for already deprived local health services. The medical issues and requirements for these IDPs living in camps were totally different from a disaster like earthquake. Global response to this disaster was slow and less effective. The need for a WHO coordination center for creating quick and urgent response for such kind of disasters in future is emphasized in this article

AB  - This dissertation examines an element from Roman law and coercion in the period spanning 284 to 476 CE. Banishment served as a form of conflict resolution, even negotiation, between the party exiling and the one exiled. Additionally, exile serves as a diagnostic tool to assess the Christianization of traditional Roman governance strategies. The first chapter draws attention both to the official magistrates cognizant to wield this punishment and to those parties that used their informal influence to force others out of a given area. Banishment also served as a tool for establishing orthodoxy and became a signature device used to assert and establish correct religious practice. Chapter Two attends to those who suffered banishment. Bishops incurred exile because rulers regarded them as akin to lazy or incompetent bureaucrats. Among non-ecclesiastics, two general reasons for banishment exist: moral infraction and administrative malfeasance. Both offences thwarted the designs of a ruler, making the offender a rival of the state. In the third chapter, I assess the juristic details of banishment. Exile had malleable features that authorities could fine-tune to suit the circumstance. Distance, remoteness, and the retention of property, rank, or supporters all could be adjusted to make a sentence lighter or heavier. The fourth chapter addresses the experience of homelessness. A sentence of banishment ensured that its subject would have to work hard to remain in contact with his devotees and supporters. Churches introduced certain logistical novelties, such as communication networks and the institutional support for individuals undergoing exile. The penultimate chapter analyzes the conclusion of the banishment cycle. When a ruler negated a banishment sentence prematurely, that amnesty constituted a political gesture attesting to the greatness of the pardoner. In sum, banishment aimed at the rehabilitation and restoration of the person exiled. In the final chapter, I interpret literary depictions of banishment. Some authors believed that one should learn to ignore life's vicissitudes; others felt that suffering taught important truths. In addition, I chart Christian authors' substitution of biblical exempla for the classical store of exilic archetypes and their efforts to construe banishment as a form of martyrdom

AB  - This article presents the observations of the author at the immigration bureau in Berlin, Germany. The bureau stands as the stuff of bad dreams against the dawn, one of Berlin's numerous architectural deformities born from a collective dark soul of Allied fire bombings that not only razed a once dignified urban landscape but also destroyed the will for postwar aesthetics. The seven-story beige facade of the Ausl��nderbeh��rde rises from an expanse of sibling monstrosities wedged between a network of freeways booming with a stream of truck traffic. By 8:00 AM, at least two hundred people are squeezed into chamber S-Z. It has the feel of a junior high school detention room and is filled with rows of plastic seats bolted into metal bars. State employees march up and down the hall with jingling bands of keys and folders stacked to their necks. Some say German foreign policy is driven by the simple priority to prevent poor foreigners from swamping their prosperous country. Germany is paying a lot of attention to its right flank, the burdensome presence of Central and Eastern Europe. With the dangers of right-wing extremism and the legacy of the Holocaust that Germans still have not fully shaken off, the idea is to do whatever is necessary to keep would-be immigrants from leaving their homes and heading for Germany

AB  - This paper examines the technical value of analytic contact�_"a clinical concept that can bring balance to the current crisis in the field of psychoanalysis. Rather than perpetuate the ongoing debates over defining what is psychoanalysis by elements such as frequency, diagnosis, analyzability, use of the couch, and duration of treatment, the concept of analytic contact comes back to Freud's original emphasis: helping those mentally ill individuals find freedom from their psychological confinement. Using clinical material, this paper will illustrate the utility of returning to an object-relational clinical focus, rather than an emphasis on external criteria. The case material includes work with couples to show the broad clinical reach of psychoanalytic work if it is defined by analytic contact and the clinical situation rather than excessively rigid and dogmatic restrictions based on political, territorial, and theoretical arguments. Analytic contact brings the psychoanalytic approach back to its role as a powerful healing tool available to a wide range of patients seeking refuge from crippling mental problems. The procedure can be defined as psychoanalytic when analytic contact is said to have occurred in a consistent and meaningful manner over time, creating a mutative psychoanalytic process.

AB  - The evolutionary history of <em>Eupatorium</em> is interpreted on the basis of the cytogeographical data from polyploid complexes. In North America, agamospermous polyploid complexes have their centers of distribution in the southeastern United Stales. Polyploids have a greater geographical range and occur more abundantly than their corresponding diploids. The diploids, which are related to polyploids, arc confined either along the Coastal Plain, or in the Ouachita. Ozark and Appalachian Mountains, which are regarded as their refuges during the last Ice Age. Speciation in Asian cupatoria has been induced predominantly by geographical isolation at the diploid level in the islands along the continental are. The polyploids of Asian taxa are confined to the rather limited habitats created by recent human activities. Both North American and Japanese eupaloria appear to have diminished their distribution to the southern refuges at some stage during the last Ice Age and since have spread northwards as the climate has improved. During this period, the range extension has been accelerated by human activities, and the agamospermous polyploids have colonized preferentially into the newly available, drier and more open habitats than those which diploids inhabited previously. This range extension has permitted many secondary contacts between previously separated species and has given rise to the new polyploid hybrids. The moist inhabiting species have stayed strictly or largely on the diploid level throughout their widespread geographical range up to the present time

AB  - The retina in most mammals contains two types of macroglial cells--Muller cells, which span the entire thickness of the retina, and astrocytes, which are mainly confined to the nerve fibre layer. Whereas Muller cells are diffusely distributed in all vertebrate retinae, the presence and distribution of retinal astrocytes correlate with the presence and distribution of retinal blood vessels: retinae that are avascular contain no astrocytes; those that are diffusely vascularized contain diffusely distributed astrocytes; and those that are vascularized in a restricted region contain astrocytes only in the vascularized region. This striking correlation between vascularization and the presence of astrocytes led Stone and Dreher to postulate that retinal astrocytes are immigrants that enter the retina with its vasculature, although others have suggested that they derive from Muller cells. Here we provide strong evidence that astrocytes in the diffusely vascularized rat retina are immigrants from the optic nerve

AB  - Children of the State traces some of the ways in which the American society has worked to control the lives of its dependent and delinquent children and the abuses that have resulted from these efforts. Beginning in the nineteenth century, a heightened concern for children and a growing tendency to use law as an instrument of social policy led to new regulations such as child labor laws, compulsory school attendance, and institutions designed to improve the lives of children. Rather than rehabilitating children or preparing them for a better life, the new institutions frequently offered only repressive custodial care. This study describes the process by which laws, court decisions, and administrative regulations led to the growth of state control over problem children in the nineteenth century. In describing how legal developments promoted institutional abuse, the effects of indeterminate sentencing, failure to differentiate between status offenders and juveniles charged with criminal acts, due-process considerations, and efforts to remove children from adult facilities are examined. The initial chapter explores the origins of some of the principles that have determined the relationship of parent and child. This chapter also focuses on the colonial American family as a coercive institution charged with rearing diligent, dutiful children--both its own and others residing in the home, particularly apprentices--and on the early New England school, specifically the teacher-pupil relationship. Chapter 2 details the breadth of the problem of institutionalized child abuse. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries the rise of industry, public schools, and residential institutions was accompanied by an increase in the discretionary power of adults over children. In such settings institutional abuse was, in part, a product of society's sanction of rigorous corporal punishment, of a pervasive neglect of the problems of poor children, and of an emphasis on societal order at the expense of individual well-being. Chapter 3 is an account of the development of residential institutions for dependent and delinquent children in the early nineteenth century. In the emergence of the house of refuge movement and the parens patriae doctrine that legitimated it, a number of the central characteristics of our enduring system of juvenile law were formulated: indeterminate sentencing, reliance on behavioral categories, moral discipline, and probation. Alternatives to walled institutions, specifically the mid-ninteenth-century use of the placing-out and cottage systems, are explored in chapter 4. Chapter 5 examines the rising criticisms of institutional practices, court confrontations and the complications caused by the spreading state control over children in the late nineteenth century. Chapter 6 reviews the establishment of the juvenile court as an extension of the parens patriae concept and then details the resulting disillusionment with the court as problems of treatment, court organization, and structural facilities were exacerbated by staffing and financial deficits. The conclusion deals with the questions of who should be held accountable for this situation, why courts have continued to commit children to such institutions and why legislatures have continued to fund them, and why professional staffs have bought into the myth of rehabilitation. Finally, this study indicates the need for a continued commitment to reform while adjusting goals in the light of ever-changing realities

T1  - A South African perspective on mutual legal assistance and extradition in a globalized world

AB  - This contribution focuses on the modalities of mutual legal assistance and extradition from a South African perspective. The question is posed whether South Africa has succeeded to establish the required framework as a fully fledged member of the international community to make a positive contribution in the fields of mutual legal assistance and extradition subsequent to its international political isolation during the apartheid era. Although the international community derives substantial benefit from a borderless global world, it has as a result also to deal with the negative impact of globalization on international crime. Physical and/or electronic crimes are increasingly committed across borders and may be described as borderless, but law enforcement (combating, investigation and prosecution of crime) is still very much confined to the borders of a state. Criminal networks have taken advantage of the opportunities resulting from the dramatic changes in world politics, business, technology, communications and the explosion in international travel and effectively utilize these opportunities to avoid and hamper law enforcement investigations. As a sovereign state has control over its own territory it also implies that states should not interfere with each other's domestic affairs. The correct and acceptable procedure would be for a state (requesting state) to apply to another state (requested state) for co-operation in the form of mutual legal assistance regarding the gathering of evidence and/or extradition of the perpetrator. Co-operation between states are governed by public international law between the requesting and requested state and the domestic law of the requested state. The South African legislature has increasingly provided for extraterritorial jurisdiction of South African courts in respect of organized crime and terrorism. It does however appear that existing criminal justice responses are experiencing challenges to meet the demands of sophisticated international criminal conduct. Mutual legal assistance and extradition provisions may show that the world is becoming smaller for fugitives and criminals, but the processes are far from expeditious and seamless. An overview of the South African law pertaining to mutual legal assistance and extradition indicates that the South African legislative framework and policies as well as international treaties make sufficient provision to render international assistance in respect of mutual legal assistance and extradition. The role of the courts in upholding the rule of law and protecting the constitutionally enshrined bill of rights, is indicative of the important function that the judiciary fulfills in this regard. It is important that extradition is not only seen as the function of the executive as it also involves the judiciary. It appears that South Africa has displayed the necessary commitment to normalize its international position since 1994 and to fulfill its obligations in a globalized world by reaching across borders in an attempt to address international criminal conduct.

AB  - How have certain illegal immigration control policies come to be regarded as essential for national security in some liberal democratic states while in others these policies remain unacceptable? Forced return, mandatory detention, restricted access to courts and temporary protection have been adopted by a number of liberal states, all of which violate the regulative norms of the 1951 Refugee Convention. This paper argues that the constitutive and regulative norms of the international refugee regime are based on a ?humanitarian? construction of refugee and receiving state identity, and that the shift toward a securitised discourse has re-constructed the identity of refugees and refugee producing states. This discursive shift has been a crucial factor in permitting state elites to enact policies that violate these international norms.Drawing on the arrival of unauthorized boat arrivals in Canada and Australia over a twenty-year period, this paper will show that securitising actors within these societies sought to alter the dominant discourse on refugees and asylum seekers. In Australia, these securitising attempts proved successful, shifting the discourse from humanitarian to securitised, thus ultimately paving the way for government elites to enact policies previously deemed unthinkable for a generous, humanitarian state. In Canada, these securitising attempts failed, making the implementation of restrictive measures unbefitting to the perceived Canadian national identity. ..PAT.-Conference Proceeding [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]Copyright of Conference Papers -- International Studies Association is the property of International Studies Association and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

AB  - This book examines how western liberal states are progressively restricting access to refugees and asylum seekers, even though these states have signed international agreements obliging them to offer protection to those fleeing persecution and to advocate the spread of human rights and humanitarian principles. Watson examines how refugees and asylum seekers have come to be treated so poorly by these states through the use of policies such as visa requirements, mandatory detention and prevention/return policies. Providing extensive documentary analysis of debates on 'restrictive' refugee policies in Canada and Australia, the author addresses the relationship between security and migration, an issue of increased importance in the aftermath of 9/11 and the war on terror. He then examines hotly-contested policies such as detention and the forceful return of asylum seekers to demonstrate how attempts to securitise these issues have been resisted in the media and by political opposition. Given the importance of providing refuge for persecuted populations, not only to ensure the survival of targeted individuals, but also to maintain international peace and security, the erosion of protective measures is of great importance today. The book will be of interest to students and scholars of international security, international relations, migration and human rights. Summary reprinted by permission of Routledge

AB  - This paper explores the prevalence and methodological approaches of migrants entitlement and access to health care. It also demonstrates an alternative approach involving a conceptual and analytical framework that integrates these perspectives as levels of analysis within a holistic model. Consisting of three brief case studies demonstrating difficulties in adopting either policy oriented entitlement approaches or practice driven orientations examining migrants access to health care, The paper examines the policy and legal frameworks within which health care is delivered to immigrants. The case studies presented encompass the phenomenon of hidden immigrant children in Sweden, migrants crossing the Spanish border from North Africa, and asylum seekers in the UK. The case studies form a basis for presenting an integrated model encompassing a multi-level framework for examining the health care of migrant populations. Implications for the European Union immigrant health and social care are discussed

AB  - Throughout his career, Francesco Hayez (1791-1882) adopted northern Romantic source material and ideologies. Although he drew inspiration from various authors and poets, he was particularly influenced by Lord Byron. This is most evident in his use of nationalist and heroic themes. As a result, Hayez founded a trend in Italian painting that corresponds to northern European Romantic artistic developments. As early as 1826, a decade after the exhibition of his "romantic manifesto" Pietro Rossi . Prisoner of the Scaligeris , Hayez painted a series of works based on the Greek War of Independence, a cause frequently championed by Lord Byron. In these works, Hayez focused on the Greek refugee as an oppressed victim of Turkish despotic forces. His earliest example, Exiles of Parga , illustrates a political travesty that forced the inhabitants of a small Ionian island to flee their homeland in an attempt to retain their liberty. This is also the predominant theme in his boat paintings, completed between 1833 and 1839, which depicted Greek heroes in flight. Lastly, his now lost work entitled The Sortie of the Defenders of Missolonghi glorified the heroic sacrifice of the Greek people in their struggle for liberty, while simultaneously recalling the death of Lord Byron at that site two years previously. The majority of Hayez's Greek subjects illustrated ideas gleaned from Byron's democratic ideology, but one work, Hayez's Portrait of Carlo Prayer as the Character Alp (1832) addressed Byron's poetry directly by depicting one of his characters from The Siege of Corinth . In this work, Hayez created a modern and unorthodox hero type that stemmed from Byronic precedents. The complexity of the characterization, emphasized through the use of multiple genres, suggests that Hayez had a sophisticated and profound understanding of his Byronic models. Later in his life, during the 1840s and 1860s, Hayez made a series of paintings based on Byron's Venetian dramas The Two Foscari and Doge Marino Faliero, Doge of Venice . Although both subjects were previously described by historical authors, Hayez's interpretations resembled Byron's in their recognition of unjust tyranny and the paradoxical roles of the public and private the public and private man

Formal music was brought by German immigrants including refugees from Europe in 1848. It states that the German-American contribution to music in the state was not only confined to the concert tradition but was also apparent in ragtime in the 1890s. A few years from about 1908, the state boasted several composers such as May Aufderheide, Julia Niebergall and jazz composer, Charlie Davis

AB  - Research on the early settlement experience of refugees from Bosnia, Iraq and Afghanistan is absent, both in Australia and overseas. The current study, based on questionnaire results and the application of SPSS results, explores the impact that pre-migration and post-arrival experiences have on the initial post-arrival economic adjustment in Sydney, Australia of recently arrived refugees from these three countries. Guided by a summary of previous findings and surveyed results of key service providers in Sydney, two propositions based on pre-migration and post-migration background variables have been developed and tested with mixed results. As expected, there was a significant relationship between English language competency and the likelihood of being gainfully employed. However, there was, for example, no significant association between current employment status and the rime spent in detention camp or the extent of negative exit conditions experienced, and there were no significant differences in employment outcomes for those with or without qualifications. This study concludes with a number of recommendations, in particular, the need for early intervention with adequate English language tuition, employment skills training and career counseling which could greatly assist humanitarian entrants in finding employment and reducing welfare dependence.

AB  - ABSTRACT IN ENGLISH: This paper looks at Australia's refugee policy in light of incidents that took place in the summer of 2001, with the refugees aboard the Tampa. Analyzing the discourse that resulted from these incidents, I show how Australia believes it is a nation under threat that prides itself as generously welcoming as many refugees as it can and who, of late, is only trying to protect its borders from so-called refugees who really are 'queue jumpers.' I contrast this view with what emerges from the facts: that Australia's racialized past makes it very easy for it to believe that it is under siege from refugees, and that it has done all that is legally possible to disinvest itself from its international obligations. This has meant turning boats away at sea, excising certain territories from its jurisdiction, and interning the refugees who arrive in Australia. Through this analysis, I argue that the current policy is a re-emergence of the earlier White Australia policy. // ABSTRACT IN FRENCH: Cet article examine la politique australienne sur le droit d'asile et les r+�fugi+�s +� la lumi+�re d'incidents survenus +� l'+�t+� de 2001 avec les r+�fugi+�s du Tampa. J'analyse le discours qui a d+�coul+� de ces incidents et je montre comment l'Australie est convaincue qu'elle est une nation assi+�g+�e; qui, en m+�me temps, s'enorgueillit du fait qu'elle accueille g+�n+�reusement autant de r+�fugi+�s qu'elle le peut; et qui, r+�cemment, a d++ boucler ses fronti+�res contre les soi-disant r+�fugi+�s qui ne sont en fait que des resquilleurs. Je compare ce point de vue avec les faits suivants: que le pass+� racis+� de l'Australie fait que ce pays succombe facilement +� la notion qu'il est assi+�g+� par des r+�fugi+�s; et qu'il a fait tout ce qui +�tait l+�galement possible pour se d+�partir des ses obligations internationales. Cela s'est traduit par le renvoi de bateaux en haute mer, l'excision de certains territoires de sa juridiction et l'incarc+�ration des r+�fugi+�s qui d+�barquent en Australie. +_ travers cette analyse, je soutiens que la pr+�sente politique est en fait une r+�apparition de la politique de l'Australie pour les Blancs.

AB  - Long-term durability of ceramic composites requires the retention of weak interfaces to promote crack deflection and subsequent sliding at the fiber�_"matrix boundary. The present article addresses the efficacy of fugitive carbon coatings in achieving this goal in all-oxide systems. A solution precursor route with a low-temperature pyrolysis treatment has been devised and implemented for coating oxide fibers within a woven cloth. The coating is oxidized following completion of matrix processing to produce an interfacial gap. Upon comparing the mechanical properties of two continuous fiber ceramic composites�_"with and without a fugitive coating�_"the gap is shown to reduce the interfacial sliding resistance and significantly enhance the fracture resistance of the composite. It also enables an extension in the useful life of the composite when subjected to long-term (1000 h) exposure at high temperature (1200��C). The results also suggest that modifications in the coating thickness may provide additional enhancement in composite durability.

AB  - Separated children belong to different groups, for example, asylum seekers, victims of human trafficking, and minors illegally entering the EU. Barnardo�_Ts and the NSPCC have undertaken a preliminary scoping study to ascertain the incidence of separated children and child trafficking in Northern Ireland. This policy and practice briefing paper highlights the key findings of this study and associated issues. A multi-method approach was used including interviews with senior personnel across Health and Social Care Trusts, the Department for Health, Social Services and Public Safety (DHSSPS), and the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI). This was supported by discussions with voluntary and community sector organisations, and a review of UK policy and literature. The paper discusses: the characteristics of separated and trafficked children; the National Referral Mechanism; the number of separated and trafficked children in Northern Ireland; age assessment and dispute, and service provision for these children. The study suggests that the incidence of trafficked children in Northern Ireland is small, but that this is a hidden problem. Some recommendations are provided; this includes more training and support for professionals likely to come into contact with separated and trafficked children

According to her, the efficacy of the settlement programs have been effective, and the issues facing new arrivals have been explored. However, many asylum seekers, specially children, have not benefited the program given by Australian government. With the situation, she urges the government under Prime Minister John Howard to re-consider its approach to the detention of asylum seekers and the working of their claims for refugee status. Meanwhile, overview of the articles published within the issue is presented

It examines the ways in which such treatment is embodied in an ever-more punitive regulatory system, often implemented by powerful and profitable corporations, at the state's behest. The hallmarks of a free society (universal rights not to be detained arbitrarily; access to justice; to fair trial; freedom from double punishment; freedom of movement) and those of a humane one (access to subsistence, shelter and health care) have all been called into question. In the service of relentless 'common-sense' racism, the law has been deployed against migrants and asylum seekers. However, through the sustained efforts of migrants and their solidarity groups, human rights lawyers and impartial judges, it has also been used to resist executive abuses of power, exclusion and injustice.

Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in the voluntary sector are being challenged by this new context and have to take a clear stand on human rights and build solidarity with the marginalised.

AB  - The discretionary power to detain asylum seekers on arrival in the UK has been described by one human rights organisation as �_~extraordinary and largely unrestrained�_T (Amnesty International 1996). Although decisions made by immigration officers can lead to long periods in prison or in prison-like conditions, these actions are considered to be administrative and are therefore not subject to the legal constraints that apply to criminal justice agencies. This article traces the many sources of discretion in the use of Immigration Act detention, using an analytical framework developed by Schneider (1992). Discretion is found to originate from the vague and permissive nature of detention guidelines (rule-failure discretion), the priority given to operational considerations at ports (rule-binding discretion) and the failure to resolve conflicts between policy objectives (rule-compromise discretion).

AB  - This article deals with discretionary decisions made by British immigration officers about whether to detain asylum seekers. It takes as its point of departure the remarkable variety of views and practices reported by front line decision-makers interviewed at British ports (Weber and Gelsthorpe 2000; Weber and Landman 2002). The discussion begins by drawing historical parallels between the pre-Holocaust era and the present day hostility towards asylum seekers, which forms the wider context for official decision-making. It notes the failure of structural analyses to account for individual differences in rule-following and draws on theoretical perspectives developed by American social psychologists Kelman and Hamilton (1989) to explore the individual dynamics of conformity and dissent. In the concluding section, theoretical connections are made between the idea of discretionary detention as acrime of obedience,and contemporary discussion about state crime and governmentality. The underlying message of this article is as much a normative as an analytical one. While recognizing the practical limitations of individual conscience, the discussion ends, as it begins, by celebrating the emancipatory potential of dissent in the face of populist policies that sanction harm against targeted groups.

AB  - The article focuses on measures of border control that expand the border of Australia outward to preempt the coming of asylum-seekers and other illegalized travelers. In Australia, the mandatory detention of asylum-seekers coming without authorization by sea has been engaged with openly deterrent intentions and is richly penetrated with nationalistic symbolism. The coercive powers have also been spread in the militarization of borders. Moreover, high-profile military interdictions have offered a chance for critics to point out the punitive nature of Australian border controls parallel with domestic law-and-order agendas

AB  - This book analyzes the political and material conditions driving contemporary border control policies and discusses the processes that mediate popular and official understandings of border-related fatalities. Controlling border crossing has become an urgent concern under conditions of globalization, leading Western governments to introduce increasingly coercive control measures. Far from eradicating spontaneous border crossing, this defensive geography has fuelled illicit people-smuggling markets, and forced asylum seekers and illegalized travellers into increasingly hazardous journeys. Drawing on data from official sources, media reports and lists of deaths collated by non-governmental organizations in Europe, Australia and North America, this book draws direct parallels between the border control policies adopted across the Global North, and a mounting death toll of illegalized border crossers. It analyses the political and material conditions driving contemporary border control policies and discusses the processes that mediate popular and official understandings of border-related fatalities. In seeking to account for, rather than merely count, border-related deaths the book is intended to shift the debate about contemporary border controls towards the acceptance of a more mobility-tolerant future 'Migration and borders are deeply contested and political issues. Pickering and Weber are two of the most passionate and well informed academic voices in the debate. Drawing from a remarkable range of sources and brilliantly written, their 'border autopsy' is a must-read for any policy maker, student and academic with interest in migration. In fact, it should be read by anyone. The extraordinary human tragedies unfolding at the Western borders, which are masterfully documented and analysed in this book, should not be left to the especially interested.' - Katja Franko Aas, Professor of Criminology, University of Oslo, Norway 'The authors are two of the foremost researchers in the criminology of migration control - a specialist area that they have done much to create and set the agenda for. This book promises to become a standard work on this topic which will provide new and important insights.' - Ben Bowling, Professor of Criminology & Criminal Justice and Director of Criminological Studies in the School of Law, King's College, London, UK 'So much of our work here at the Institute is about collecting information on deaths - racist murders, deaths in police custody, in prisons, deaths at the border, deaths in detention centres, asylum seekers who give up hope, hang themselves, jump off balconies. So this book makes me think why do we do it? ! It's as though, those of us who have been in the business of counting and accounting have without our knowing it provided a counter-balance to the processes of neutralisation, dehumanisation and distanciation that this book describes.' -Liz Fekete, Institute of Race Relations London, UK 'Deaths at the migratory fault lines where rich and poor nations intersect are an almost taken-for-granted reality of our increasingly unequal times. Powerful nations 'illegalize' desperate migrants and subject them to ever more arduous journeys to prevent entry, but they prefer to keep the consequences of these actions out of public view. This thoughtful book, written in the style of an inquest, lays bare the violence that underlies contemporary border control and provides groundwork for a much-needed reconceptualization of national responsibilities.' - Doris Marie Provine, Professor of Justice Studies, Arizona State University, USA

AB  - Watching Manfred Kirchheimer's ''Art Is ... the Permanent Revolution'' you might be reminded at first of airless instructional art programs on public television: three printmakers -- Paul Marcus, a woodcutter; Sigmund Abeles, a painter and etcher; and Ann Chernow, a painter and lithographer -- quietly discuss the role of artists as sociopolitical commentators while each prepares a piece. Mr. Marcus's concerns military torture; Mr. Abeles's presents suicide bombers; Ms. Chernow renders a cemetery tableau about oil and war. Each also explains the chosen technique as the film (and their work) progresses. Then the film delves deeper, as we hear their observations (and an unseen narrator's) about their printmaking forebears. We behold, awe-struck, the harrowing ''Disasters of War'' by Goya; the dissonant post-World War I Expressionism of Otto Dix; the mourning women depicted by Kathe Kollwitz, who lost a son and a grandson in wars. And we learn of sacrifices: Rembrandt's poverty, Goya's exile, Daumier's imprisonment.

AB  - Background: Published literature on surgical care in refugees tends to focus on the acute ('emergent') phase of crisis situations. Here we posit that there is a substantial burden of non-acute morbidity amenable to surgical intervention among refugees in the 'chronic' phase of crisis situations. We describe surgery for non-acute conditions undertaken at Mae La Refugee Camp, Thailand over a two year period. Methods: Surgery was performed by a general surgeon in a dedicated room of Mae La Refugee Camp over May 2005 to April 2007 with minimal instruments and staff. We obtained the equivalent costs for these procedures if they were done at the local Thai District General Hospital. We also acquired the list (and costs) of acute surgical referrals to the District General Hospital over September 2006 to December 2007. Results: 855 operations were performed on 847 patients in Mae La Refugee Camp (60.1% sterilizations, 13.3% 'general surgery', 5.6% 'gynaecological surgery', 17.4% 'mass excisions', 3.5% 'other'). These procedures were worth 2,207,500 THB (75,683.33 USD) at costs quoted by the District General Hospital. Total cost encountered for these operations (including staff costs, consumables, anaesthesia and capital costs such as construction) equaled 1,280,000 THB (42,666 USD). Pertaining to acute surgical referrals to District General hospital: we estimate that 356,411.96 THB (11,880.40 USD) worth of operations over 14 months were potentially preventable if these cases had been operated at an earlier, non-acute state in Mae La Refugee Camp. Conclusions: A considerable burden of non-acute surgical morbidity exists in 'chronic' refugee situations. An inhouse general surgical service is found to be cost-effective in relieving some of this burden and should be considered by policy makers as a viable intervention.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyse the use of compulsory detention in the context of a new national tuberculosis (TB) control programme launched in 1997 METHODS: A retrospective review was made of the use of compulsory detention in the management of infectious TB before and after the initiation of a new TB control programme, using data from the central TB registry in the Ministry of Health and the charts of each patient RESULTS: Between 1994 and 2001, 13 recalcitrant patients out of 3056 (0.43%) cases of pulmonary TB were brought to trial. Eleven patients were detained. All were either hospitalized under a court order and, when failing to comply with the order, hospitalized in prison, or referred directly to a prison hospital. Twelve of 13 (92%) patients were new immigrants. After the new programme was launched, proportionately fewer patients were brought to trial [6/943 (0.64%) in 1994-1996 compared with 7/2113 (0.33%) in 1997-2001] CONCLUSION: The reduction in the number of individuals detained could be viewed as an improvement in TB control due to the new TB control programme. It remains to be shown whether these individuals, most of whom had drug-resistant strains of TB, posed a sufficient threat to public health to justify detention

AB  - Sacrificial victimage is a virtual constant in human culture. Sacrificial acts may assume deceptive guises as societies evolve, but little change takes place in the fundamental dynamics of the process: a real or perceived sociocultural crisis resulting in a community's plight being attributed to a scapegoat whose actual guilt or innocence is irrelevant. The chosen victim suffers real or symbolic violence at the community's hands with the aim of expelling whatever evil(s) he or she might embody. The eight plays by Tirso de Molina explored in this study all utilize sacrificial victimage as the foundation of their dramatic structure. The first group of four dramas--La mujer que manda en casa, La republica al reves, La venganza de Tamar and La vida y muerte de Herodes--demonstrate scapegoating in a very explicit manner. The four works feature royal protagonists whose failure to control their carnal and political passions results in rampant chaos throughout their realms. Order only triumphs over this chaos through the sacrifice of victims who come to symbolize those disruptive passions. The second quartet of plays--La prospera fortuna de don Alvaro de Luna y adversa de Ruy Lopez Davalos, La adversa fortuna de don Alvaro de Luna, Privar contra su gusto and Cautela contra cautela--all portray the challenges faced at court by royal favorites. These comedias incorporate the theme of sacrificial victimage less overtly than did the first four, focusing on vanity, ambition, ingratitude and the intrigues they breed. Only one sacrificial victim in these plays actually suffers death, but in all four works execution, exile and/or imprisonment threaten the characters who come to symbolize destructive political self-interest. This study, however, encounters more than the mere ubiquity of sacrificial victimage in the eight plays by Tirso. Far more significant is the moral ambiguity with which the playwright imbues that pattern. Tirso manipulates the dynamics of scapegoating in such a way that his texts seem to question political values and institutions, religious orthodoxy and even the practice of sacrificial victimage itself

AB  - Describes the psychiatric assessment and trauma testimonies of 12 Bosnian adolescents (12�_"19 yrs), who survived ethnic cleansing in U.S. Assessments consisted of systematic, trauma-focused, clinical interviews that included standard assessment scales of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Results indicate that Ss had experienced multiple traumatic events: (1) massive psychic traumas associated with ethnic cleansing; (2) chronic stress associated with living in the refugee camp; (3) chronic stress associated with emigration and resettlement; (4) enduring stress associated with loss of family and friends; and (5) the ongoing psychological proximity to the genocide. PTSD was diagnosed in 25% of the Ss and 17% suffered from depressive disorders. It was concluded that the low rate of PTSD may be attributed to normal prior development, time-limited adversity and lack of physical and sexual traumas.

AB  - Preventive mental health interventions that aim to stop, lessen, or delay possible negative individual mental health and behavioural sequelae through improving family and community protective resources in resettled refugee families are needed. This paper relates to the development of preventive psychosocial interventions in the complex real-life contexts where migrants and refugees live. It describes 8 characteristics that preventive mental health interventions should address to meet the needs of refugee families: feasibility; acceptability; culturally tailored; multilevel; time focused; prosaicness; effectiveness; and adaptability. To address these 8 characteristics in the environment of refugee resettlement requires modifying the process of developmental research through incorporating innovative mental health services research strategies, including: resilience framework; community collaboration; mixed methods with focused ethnography; and the comprehensive dynamic trial. A preventive intervention development cycle for refugee families is proposed based on a programme of research on refugees and migrants using these services research strategies

AB  - In the United States, secondary migration refers to moves out of state, while relocation refers to moves within state. This study examined the effects of secondary migration and relocation of African refugees resettled in the US. Participants included 73 recently resettled refugee families from Burundi and Liberia who were followed for one year. Through interviews, 13 instances of secondary migration and 9 instances of relocation were identified. The study asked how moving impacted family risk and protective factors. How might policies, researchers, and practitioners better manage refugees moving again? Results revealed that families undertook secondary migration principally for employment, affordable housing, family reunification, and to feel more at home. Families relocated primarily for affordable housing. Parents reported that secondary migration and relocation enhanced family stability. However, young people reported disruption to both schooling and attachments with peers and community. Secondary migration and relocation were family efforts to enhance family resources and to mitigate shortcomings in resettlement conditions. The authors concluded that practitioners could devise ways to better engage and support families who considered moving

AB  - (from the chapter) This chapter addresses the following questions based on an ethnographic study of 73 refugee families from Liberia and Burundi: (1) How has the family resilience of African refugee families been shaped by their living experiences in prior settings (prewar in their home country; internment in the refugee camp)? (2) What are the new, continued, or modified forms of family resilience in African refugee families in U.S. refugee resettlement? (3) How can policy, program, and research initiatives be developed that fit better with the social ecological construct of family resilience among African refugees? Family resilience is more than a static property, checklist of protective factors, fixed positive outcome, or lack of negative outcomes. Family resilience is a dynamic properly which is shaped by social, economic,cultural, and historical contexts. For African refugee families in U.S. refugee resettlement, family resilience has been shaped by the refugee families' prior living places, including pre-war in their home country and internment in refugee camps. These former living places tended to foster family resilience, which revolved around large kinship networks, family subsistence economies,family rituals and physical proximity, and long standing cultural practice.

AB  - Human mediated introductions of non-indigenous crayfish species (NICS) are responsible for their rapid colonisation of European freshwaters. The introduction of North American crayfish is furthermore linked to the spread of crayfish plague and the decline of indigenous crayfish species (ICS). As the management of ICS and NICS have become necessary, a detailed knowledge on their distribution and ecological requirements is needed. We studied the current range of native noble crayfish Astacus astacus and stone crayfish Austropotamobius torrentium, as well as alien signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus in Carinthia (Austria) and evaluated environmental and physical habitat features in streams with and without crayfish. Meanwhile, the loss of many ICS populations was recorded and alien P. leniusculus was found to be widespread in this region. Most of the habitat features of streams having crayfish differed significantly from sites lacking crayfish for at least one investigated native or alien species. Furthermore, multivariate and regression analyses showed specific differences in the habitat use of the investigated crayfish. Our results showed that the presence of alien P. leniusculus was associated with larger and smoother sloped lowland rivers, while the occurrence of the two native species was confined to smaller streams either at higher altitudes and with distinct physical habitat conditions ( A. torrentium) or with moderate water temperatures ( A. astacus). This study helps to identify potential refuge areas for the endangered native species and to predict the further spread of the most common non-native crayfish species in European streams.

AB  - Notes that brain injury, stressor severity, depression, premorbid vulnerabilities, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are often intertwined with trauma populations. This interaction is further complicated when the neuropsychologist evaluates refugees from other countries. In addition, the observed psychiatric symptoms reported in refugees and victims of mass violence may in fact not be the primary features of PTSD and depression but psychiatric symptoms secondary to the effects of traumatic brain injury. This paper reviews the occurrence of starvation, torture, beatings, imprisonment, and other head injury experiences in refugee and prisoner of war populations to alert treators to the presence of chronic and persistent neuropsychiatric morbidity, with implications for psychosocial adjustment. The authors note that the concept of fixed neural loss may also interact with environmental and emotional stresses, and a model of neuropsychological abnormalities triggered by traumatic events influenced by subsequent stress is also considered. It is concluded that neuropsychologists working with refugees play an important role in assessing the possibility of traumatic brain injury with tools that are relatively culture-fair.

AB  - This article examines three examples of critical science literacy; that is, writing using technical and scientific information to help achieve radical visions of social justice. The three examples include street medics; that is, medical workers who organize to support demonstrators in protests against corporate globalization, militarization, detention of immigrants, and corporate politics; writings by the sick as they link corporate interest with health care; and human research subjects who have organized to challenge traditional approaches to bioethics. The article explores the differences in the writings of these exemplars but also underscores how in each case, scientific literacy means unwriting and rewriting taken-for-granted assumptions about nature and science. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]Cet article analyse trois exemples d'alphabǸtisation scientifique critique, c'est-ǭ-dire de discours utilisant des informations techniques et scientifiques dans le but de contribuer ǭ une certaine vision radicale de la justice sociale.

AB  - An Afghan tribal leader convicted in an international narcotics trafficking conspiracy was sentenced to life in prison on Thursday by a judge in New York who rejected pleas for leniency based on the man's cooperation with the American authorities. The tribal leader, Haji Bashir Noorzai, whose case drew wide attention because of his prominent role in the drug trade and his ties to Mullah Mohammad Omar, the fugitive leader of the Taliban, was found guilty last fall of taking part in a conspiracy that sent millions of dollars' worth of heroin around the world, including into the United States.

AB  - Preserving allelic diversity is important because it provides the capacity for adaptation and thus enables long-term population viability. Allele retention is difficult to predict in animals with overlapping generations, so we used a new computer model to simulate retention of rare alleles in small populations of 3 species with contrasting life-history traits: North Island Brown Kiwi (Apteryx mantelli; monogamous, long-lived), North Island Robins (Petroica longipes; monogamous, short-lived), and red deer (Cervus elaphus; polygynous, moderate lifespan). We simulated closed populations under various demographic scenarios and assessed the amounts of artificial immigration needed to achieve a goal of retaining 90% of selectively neutral rare alleles (frequency in the source population = 0.05) after 10 generations. The number of immigrants per generation required to meet the genetic goal ranged from 11 to 30, and there were key similarities and differences among species. None of the species met the genetic goal without immigration, and red deer lost the most allelic diversity due to reproductive skew among polygynous males. However, red deer required only a moderate rate of immigration relative to the other species to meet the genetic goal because nonterritorial breeders had a high turnover. Conversely, North Island Brown Kiwi needed the most immigration because the long lifespan of locally produced territorial breeders prevented a large proportion of immigrants from recruiting. In all species, the amount of immigration needed generally decreased with an increase in carrying capacity, survival, or reproductive output and increased as individual variation in reproductive success increased, indicating the importance of accurately quantifying these parameters to predict the effects of management. Overall, retaining rare alleles in a small, isolated population requires substantial investment of management effort. Use of simulations to explore strategies optimized for the populations in question will help maximize the value of this effort.. 2013 Society for Conservation Biology

AB  - This article focuses on the origins of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. While drafting the Secretariat Outline, the Division of Human Rights had before it a number of proposals regarding protection from arbitrary arrest, for example, the texts of the Inter-American Juridical Committee, the American Law Institute, and the text proposed by Cuba. Latin American countries had considerable influence in drafting this article because they had previously discussed several drafts that were presented to the Division of Human Rights. The Division of Human Rights also reviewed thirty-two national constitutions containing relevant provisions. Chile presented the Inter-American Juridical Committee text, which stated: "Every person accused of crime shall have the right not to be arrested except upon warrant duly issued in accordance with the law, unless the person is arrested flagrante delicto. He shall have the right to prompt and to proper treatment during the time he is in custody. The key provision in the article is the word "arbitrary." The meaning of the word was debated on a number of occasions particularly as to whether "arbitrary" would qualify particular clauses within the synthesized text. In the final text, the word "arbitrary" obviously applies to "arrest, detention or exile" and imports much of the substance in the overly detailed synthesized text

AB  - This dissertation analyzes the roots of ethnic conflicts, and the emergence of a culture of violence, in central Long Beach, mainly occupied by Cambodians, African-Americans, and Hispanics Conflict and violence have dominated this space since early 1980s, but became visible to the outside world only when it burst into flames during the 1992 Los Angeles riots While urban riots have a long history in the United States, the 1992 riots differed significantly from earlier ones. For though they were sparked by Black-White tensions as have been historically the case, the ultimate targets of Black hostilities in 1992 were not Whites. They were Koreans in Los Angeles, and Cambodians in Long Beach. This suggested that in ethnically diverse low-income neighborhoods, the well-being of the people depend more on harmonious relations across minority groups, than on those between the dominant society and minority groups. As demonstrated in this dissertation however, relations between the minority groups in central Long Beach are far from harmonious. Moreover, tensions and conflicts here are not confined to hostilities between Blacks and Cambodians. There are deep fissures between Hispanics and Cambodians, and between Hispanics and Blacks. In addition, hostilities within groups, and between the minorities and the dominant society also contribute to the continuous tension that pervades this space. This dissertation, based on ethnographic research, first analyzes the historical events and processes that led to the emergence of this culture by surveying the vicissitudes of immigration on Long Beach in three distinct periods of American history. It stretches from colonial to post colonial America and includes the conquest of Mexico; rural-urban migrations of Blacks and Mexicans; and, the arrival of post-1965 immigrants, and specifically Cambodian refugees. to the US Second, it looks through several lenses including urban youth gangs, refugee policies in practice, stereotypes that are rooted in historical events, and other structural forces, to explore how violent and oppressive behaviors develop, and are learned, transmitted, and sustained. Third, the dissertation documents the impact of such behaviors on individuals, families, and communities of the area. Finally, it investigates ways and means for reducing conflicts and increasing coalitions

AB  - The article dwells on how asylum seekers entering the U.S. are being subjected to unnecessary detention in harsh conditions of confinement. The unjust detention of foreign nationals has drawn considerable public attention, especially in the wake of the September 11 attacks, yet the plight of asylum seekers in a post-September 11 world has been neglected. Between September 11,2001, and December 2003, more than 15,300 asylum seekers were detained at U.S. airports and borders. From the port of entry, asylum seekers are transported to jail, often in handcuffs, and usually without any clear understanding of why they are being detained

Still, this is a social phenomenon that requires serious consideration since in many instances such policies and practices violate international standards for the protection of refugees. This work takes a critical look at the detention of persons fleeing persecution by situating it an expanding culture of control stoked by the criminology of the other. The article offers evidence of a steady increase in the reliance on detention of asylum seekers in the US, UK, France, Germany, and Italy.

AB  - Moral panic theory continues to be applied to a range of phenomena, allowing sociologists to refine our understanding of negative societal reaction aimed at people who are easy to identify and easy to dislike. Whereas the prevailing notion of moral panic rests on its noisy features, there are constructions that occur under the public radar. In such instances, government officials quietly institute policies and practices that adversely affect a targeted group. Moral panic over so-called bogus asylum seekers in the UK represents a noisy construction whereby claims making is loud and public. In the USA, however, that construction is remarkably quiet and does not resonate openly; still, much like their British counterparts, American officials have resorted to the use of confinement. This work explores the differences between the UK and the USA in the realm of moral panic over asylum seekers while remaining attentive to their shared consequences, the unjust detention of those fleeing persecution. Implications to social control and human rights in a post-11 September world are discussed throughout. Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd

AB  - Issues surrounding deportation invite timely analysis that not only describes but also deciphers the late modern conditions of a post-9/11 world. Detaining and removing migrants and asylum seekers has been part and parcel of the converging models of crime and immigration control for some time. However, the expanding war on terror has provided government officials renewed rationales for its reliance on administrative forms of processing that bypass fundamental checks and balances, thereby producing errors that are difficult to correct. Whereas removal sets out to serve administrative objectives, such banishment also offers symbolic and psychic relief for those worried over the "influx of strangers." Those developments ought to be interpreted within a coherent framework that addresses moral panic theory as it extends to the risk society literature. Taking critical aim at detention and deportation, the paper illuminates the nexus of social control spanning crime, terror, and migration. The discussion addresses conceptual implications to policies designed to regulate human mobility at the international level. ..PAT.-Unpublished Manuscript [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]Copyright of Conference Papers -- Law & Society is the property of Law & Society Association and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

AB  - Further exploring moral panic, Cohen points out that claims-making can range from loud to quiet. That phenomenon is particularly evident within the merging of crime and immigration control (or crimmigration). This project focuses on Australia, where claims-making on asylum seekers contains both loud panic as well as quiet manoeuvring by the state, including such tactics as stonewalling, privatization and offshore detention. In pursuit of a nuanced interpretation of crimmigration, the analysis sorts out key legal and human rights alongside a recent High Court ruling on the processing of asylum seekers.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Issues associated with the employment of overseas trained nurses (OTNs) in regional and rural practice settings have received little professional attention in Australia. The global nursing workforce crisis has dominated discussion about the migration of nurses. This review explored the contemporary understandings of the employment of OTNs in Australian regional and rural practice settings METHODS: An integrative literature review was undertaken to incorporate a range of literature types related to OTN employment. A search of electronic databases and relevant web pages was undertaken for the publication period 1995-2008. Integrative literature reviews incorporate assessment of empirical research as well as theoretical and opinion-based literature to present a broad synthesis of the topic of interest. Following identification of relevant literature, thematic analysis was undertaken to reveal patterns and relationships among concepts facilitating synthesis of findings across the range of literature RESULTS: There is an abundance of literature exploring the international migration of nurses that demonstrates an imbalance of migration from poorer countries to more affluent countries. This review identified a number of economic and ethical issues, together with risks for potential exploitation of migrant nurses. There was minimal literature specific to the experiences of OTNs working in regional and rural areas. However, there has been some exploration of issues associated with medical recruitment to rural areas CONCLUSIONS: The employment of OTNs is accompanied by complex and varied issues which require resourceful and proactive responses by healthcare employers. Further research is needed to understand the challenges OTNs have in working in rural settings, particularly in Australia. Increased understanding in clinical settings of factors that influence nurses to migrate, as well as the range of barriers they face in working and living in host countries, may assist in the retention of these nurses

AB  - Based on an ethnograpic study of women offenders in drug treatment programs in New York and Oregon, this dissertation documents the structure and particularly American features of what Foucault (1977) called "the carceral network" and the disciplinary careers it produces. Mapping a social geography of everyday economic practices to describe how the carceral network extends beyond the boundaries of individual institutions, the dissertation identifies a gendered politics of food scarcity, food consumption, and food provision as the primary and shared feature of life "on the inside" and life "on the outside" for women offenders who do not consume drugs. This study examines the disciplinary careers of anthropology, corrections, cleaning work, and motherhood. Introducing the concept and methodology of "participant-incarceration," the study challenges current debates about conducting anthropology at home and establishes a research theory and methodology tailored to the study of jails, prisons, and treatment programs. This study found that the women's childhood socialization constructed gender in various relationships to contamination. Gendered contamination was established through sexual abuse, the performance of gender-stereotyped cleaning work, and the expectation that girls remain untouched by socially contaminating influences. These findings are used to construct a theory of "domestication" which analyzes the role of contamination in the construction of girls' and women's identities and disciplinary careers. The lifelong performance of various kinds of cleaning work eventually rendered individual women invisible. Although a site of cleaning the self, drug treatment constituted one of the only sites within the carceral network in which women became visible to themselves and to each other and constructed identities that overcame contaminated gender. Class provided a narrative terrain upon which many women constructed working-class identities that overcame contaminated gender and contested race. Linking ideologies about contamination, national cleaning policies, and the everyday cleaning practices which undergird everyday life in the US, the concept "contaminationalism" is defined and developed. Contaminationalism unifies the carceral network as the sum of ideologies, institutions, and practices which, through intersections of class, race, and gender, provide the basis for the production and enforcement of contamination, disciplinary cleaning careers, and everyday life as domestic exile

AB  - "For six months, C+�te d'Ivoire residents endured horrific human rights abuses following the refusal of incumbent President Laurent Gbagbo to relinquish power when the country's electoral commission and international observers declared his opponent, Alassane Ouattara, the winner of the November 28, 2010, run-off election. Months after the April 11 arrest of Gbagbo by Ouattara's armed forces, the prospect of one-sided justice threatens to prolong the country's divisions and impede the reestablishment of the rule of law. In the election's aftermath, Gbagbo's elite security forces unleashed a systematic campaign of violence against real and perceived Ouattara supporters, including through the violent suppression of demonstrations, the abduction and killing of neighborhood political leaders, and the rape of women and girls. As the Gbagbo government-controlled media incited hate against pro-Ouattara groups, Gbagbo's militias stopped them at checkpoints or attacked them in their neighborhoods, beating them to death, shooting them, or burning them alive. Three months after Gbagbo refused to cede power, pro-Ouattara forces--largely the former rebel army of his prime minister, Guillaume Soro--launched an offensive to remove Gbagbo from power. In sweeping the country, these forces often inflicted a collective punishment against pro-Gbagbo ethnic groups through widespread executions, torture, and the burning of villages. By the fighting's end in mid-May 2011, at least 3,000 people had been killed and more than 150 women raped, often in targeted acts perpetrated along political, ethnic, and religious lines. Based on six field missions to C+�te d'Ivoire between December 2010 and July 2011 and over 500 interviews with victims and witnesses to the violence, this report documents crimes that reach the level of war crimes and likely crimes against humanity. The report further identifies 13 military and political leaders implicated in grave crimes either directly or through command responsibility, based on the accumulated evidence. It also details the failure, thus far, of the Ouattara government to ensure that perpetrators from both sides of the conflict are brought to justice for abuses they perpetrated."--P. [4] of cover

AB  - The article presents information on several socio-political developments from across the world. The young Nigerians who set fire to tires and did battle with police in the slums of Lagos were convinced Moshood Abiola's death just prior to his expected release from prison was no accident. Democracy activists like Wole Soyinka felt the same way. Abiola, who had collapsed during a meeting with a U.S. delegation, was described as having suffered an apparent heart attack--but one of his daughters said he didn't have a heart condition, and no autopsy could dispel suspicions that Nigeria's generals sought to eliminate the threat Abiola posed to their power. Rape is being systematically used by Burma's military as part of a policy of ethnic cleansing, according to interviews with rights workers and exiled pro-democracy officials. Bolstering those contentions are seven recent reports, including one by EarthRights International, a legal rights group, accusing Burma's military of "the savage domination of women outside the scope of acceptable wartime conduct."

AB  - This survey of refugees aims to provide information about the skills, needs and experience of refugees living in Wales in order to inform policy and practice in relation to refugee integration and issues of community cohesion. Prior to 2001, relatively low numbers of asylum seekers and refugees settled in Wales, but this increased when Wales became a dispersal area. A total of 123 refugees participated in interviews for the survey. Refugees were contacted through key agencies and organisations that come into contact with refugees as a starting point from which to snowball the sample. The questionnaire consisted of a total of 74 closed and open-ended questions intended to capture information on the demographic characteristics of respondents, their circumstances and experiences of living in Wales, housing, support, skills, qualifications, employment, and health and well-being. There were also a number of questions around issues of safety and security including experiences of negative public attitudes, racism and discrimination and feelings about the neighbourhood or area in which respondents live. The survey identifies a number of potential barriers to inclusion in the areas of housing, education and training, employment and racism and discrimination. Implications for policy are discussed

AB  - This report details the Welsh Assembly Government six year integrated strategy for tackling all forms of violence against women and domestic abuse. The integrated strategy and implementation plan will address all forms of violence against women in Wales that extend beyond domestic abuse to tackle issues such as honour based violence, female genital mutilation and forced marriage. The Strategy includes a number of initiatives and additional funding of �o1 million is being made available to deliver these, taking the total budget to �o4.7 million for 2010. Key priorities include: expanding the services offered by the Wales Domestic Abuse helpline to also support victims of sexual violence; a new project to tackle prostitution and trafficking in North Wales; increasing funding so that all One-Stop Shops in Wales receive support; developing a national training strategy to ensure that professionals in all sectors recognise and know how to deal with violence against women and the potential impact on children; continuing to fund on going publicity campaigns focused on challenging attitudes; consulting on the inclusion of issues relating to violence against women in the Personal and Social Education Framework; a stronger focus on forced marriage, honour based violence and female genital mutilation issues including training, expanding existing education programmes, and publicity; providing financial training for key staff working in refuges and independent domestic abuse advisors to enable them to offer well informed financial advice to victims; working with NUS Cymru to develop a multi-media campaign on personal safety for students on campus settings; working with British Transport Police to improve the protection available to women on rail transport and railway stations

AB  - The Welsh Government�_Ts vision of refugee inclusion in Wales was set out in the Refugee Inclusion Strategy published in 2008. The overall aim of the Strategy was to support and enable refugees to rebuild their lives in Wales and to be able to make a full contribution to Welsh society. To make this a reality, refugee inclusion must be about both participation and partnership. This Action Plan should be seen in conjunction with the Strategy and supports it by setting out how to achieve its vision and aims. It sets out the actions the Welsh Government and its partner organisations will take over the coming years to achieve the objectives outlined in the Refugee Inclusion Strategy, and also provides a framework for monitoring and evaluating achievements against objectives. The Action Plan comprises 3 priorities, each with a listed series of actions . The 3 priorities are: supporting the most vulnerable separated children and families; access to services; and building community and empowering asylum seekers and refugees to live active and fulfilling lives

AB  - Recent decades have witnessed unprecedented growth and scale of internal, voluntary, temporary, economic-driven rural-to-urban migration in China. Nationwide, about 15% of all rural families have at least one family member who migrated to urban areas. Although research on how these migrants fare in terms of socioeconomic achievements, cultural integration, and health and healthcare outcomes is burgeoning, little work has been done to explore how the children of these rural-to-urban migrants, who are left behind in the sending rural community, fare in terms of key developmental outcomes. Presumably, parental absence is harmful due to lessened family control, support, guidance, and parent-child bonding. On the other hand, if the child is being taken good care of by responsible custodians such as grandparents or relatives, perhaps the injurious effects of parental absence will be mitigated. This research attempts to contribute to the literature by examining social contexts of child development among migrant and non-migrant families in rural China. Migrant families are defined as having at least one parent who migrated to urban areas. Using cross-sectional data collected in rural areas of the Hunan province, this study examines whether children in rural areas of migrant versus non-migrant families differ in three important developmental outcomes: satisfaction with life and study, positive health behavior, and school engagement. Moreover, we explore how family socioeconomic status, family structure, family social capital, peer relationship, teacher support at school, and intra-personal psychological factors are linked to child development and whether these associations vary according to the child's family migrant status.

AB  - ABSTRACT IN GERMAN: Die Zuwanderung von Asylbewerbern ist ein rechtspolitisch oft kontrovers diskutiertes Thema mit Wirkungen auf die gesamte Zuwanderungsdebatte und die Integrationsprozesse. In den 90er Jahren hatten Asylbewerber einen Anteil von ca. 20% an der Gesamtzuwanderung nach Deutschland. Im Jahre 2001 lebten fast 1,1 Millionen Fl++chtlinge in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland, von denen wiederum 467.000 (42%) Asylbewerber, Asylberechtigte oder deren Familienangeh+�rige waren. Die demographische L++cke, die durch den Geburtenr++ckgang hervorgerufen wird und die Finanzierbarkeit der Sozial- und Rentensysteme belastet, kann jedoch auch durch Zuwanderung allein nicht geschlossen werden. Zuwanderung kann h+�chstens Bev+�lkerungsr++ckgang und Alterung zeitlich verz+�gern. Deshalb m++ssen zugleich familienpolitische Ma+Ynahmen die strukturellen Benachteiligungen von Familien beseitigen. Hohe finanzielle Aufwendungen und soziale Leistungen sind f++r den Unterhalt der Asylbewerber notwendig, zumal Asylbewerber ein oft langwieriges Verfahren durchlaufen. Aus dem jeweiligen Rechtsstatus (Asylbewerber, Asylberechtigte oder Familienangeh+�rige von Asylberechtigten) resultieren erhebliche rechtliche (Aufenthaltsstatus) und finanzielle Konsequenzen (soziale Leistungen). Weitere finanzielle Ausgaben entstehen Bund und L+�ndern u.a. durch die Aufgaben, die das Bendesamt f++r die Anerkennung ausl+�ndischer Fl++chtlinge und die Verwaltungsgerichte zu leisten haben. Asylwanderung ist als eine Form der Fl++chtlingswanderung eine unfreiwillige bzw. erzwungene Wanderung. Die politischen, +�konomischen wie auch sozialen, kulturellen und +�kologischen Fluchtursachen sind i.d.R. miteinander verwoben und verst+�rken sich wechselseitig. Wanderungs- bzw. fluchtausl+�sende Motivationsstrukturen entstehen bei den potentiellen Migranten jedoch erst durch das Bewusstwerden ungleicher Lebensbedingungen auf der Individualebene. Voraussetzung daf++r ist wiederum das Wissen ++ber ein bestehendes Entwicklungsgef+�lle. Damit sind Flucht und Migration sensible Reaktionen handelnder Individuen auf politische, soziokulturelle wie +�konomische Ungleichheiten zwischen den Regionen. Die rechtlichen Grundlagen der Asylgew+�hrung (Schutzfunktion) bilden im Zusammenhang mit dem Asylbewerberleistungsgesetz (staatlich garantierter Sozialhilfe) wichtige Rahmenbedingungen der Asylwanderung nach Deutschland. Mit der Aufnahme des Satzes "Politisch Verfolgte genie+Yen Asylrecht" in das Grundgesetz (Artikel 16 GG von 1949 bzw. 16a GG von 1993) gew+�hrt die Bundesrepublik allen politisch verfolgten Ausl+�ndern ein subjektives Recht auf Asyl. Asyl kann nur bei staatlicher oder quasistaatlicher Verfolgung gew+�hrt werden. Die Regelungen ++ber "sichere Drittstaaten" und "sichere Herkunftsstaaten" haben seit 1993 zu einem deutlichen R++ckgang von Asylantragstellern beigetragen. Ungeachtet dessen wird ein betr+�chtlicher Teil der nicht anerkannten Asylbewerber mit R++cksicht auf die politische Situation im Herkunftsland nicht abgeschoben bzw. geduldet (Abschiebeschutz, Abschiebungshindernisse, Bleiberecht, Duldung, Aussetzung der Abschiebung). Von 1990 bis 2002 hat das Bundesamt f++r die Anerkennung ausl+�ndischer Fl++chtlinge ++ber rund 2,5 Mio. Erstantr+�ge entschieden. Die Anerkennungsquote lag ++ber alle Jahre unter 10%. Dabei bleiben jedoch die Entscheidungen auf Grund verwaltungsgerichtlicher Urteile unber++cksichtigt, wodurch sich die Anerkennungsquote deutlich erh+�ht. Auch ist die Anerkennungsquote von Asylbewerbern aus L+�ndern mit gravierenden Menschenrechtsverletzungen und politischer Verfolgung wesentlich h+�her. Hauptherkunftsl+�nder waren in 2002 Irak, T++rkei, BR Jugoslawien, Russische F+�deration, Afghanistan, Iran, Vietnam, Indien, Syrien und Algerien. Trotz des deutlichen R++ckgangs an Asylbewerbern hat Deutschland im langj+�hrigen Vergleich die meisten Asylbewerber innerhalb der EU aufgenommen. Dar++ber hinaus hat Deutschland mit insgesamt rund 400.000 B++rgerkriegsfl++chtlingen au+Yerdem den gr+�+Yten Anteil von Fl++chtlingen aus den ehemaligen Jugoslawien zu verzeichnen. Erst im Jahre 2000 wurde Deutschland als aufnahmest+�rkstes Land von Gro+Ybritannien abgel+�st. // ABSTRACT IN ENGLISH: Immigration by asylum-seekers is a topic which is frequently the subject of controversial discussion from a legal policy point of view which has an impact on the whole immigration debate and on the integration processes. In the nineties, asylum-seekers accounted for a share of roughly 20% of overall immigration to Germany. In 2001, almost 1.1 million refugees lived in the Federal Republic of Germany, of whom in turn 467,000 (42%) were asylum-seekers, persons entitled to asylum or their family members. The demographic gap caused by fertility decline, which imposes a burden on the financeability of the social and pension systems, however, can not be closed by immigration alone. Immigration can at best delay the population decline and ageing for a time. This is why family policy measures must simultaneously remedy the structural disadvantages faced by families. Considerable financial expenditure and social benefits are needed to support asylum-seekers, especially since asylum-seekers frequently undergo a prolonged procedure. The respective legal status (asylum-seekers, persons entitled to asylum or family members of persons entitled to asylum) results in significant legal (residence status) and financial consequences (social benefits). Further financial expenditure is incurred by the Federation and the L+�nder, inter alia by means of the tasks which have to be carried out by the Federal Office for the Recognition of Foreign Refugees and the administrative courts. Asylum-related migration as a form of refugee migration is involuntary or forced migration. The political, economic and social, cultural and ecological causes of flight are as a rule intertwined and amplify one another. Motivational structures which result in migration or flight are however caused among potential migrants only when they become aware of unequal living conditions at individual level. This is conditional in turn on knowledge of an existing development gap. Hence, flight and migration are sensitive reactions by acting individuals to political, sociocultural and economic inequalities between the regions. The legal basis of granting asylum (protective function), in connection with the Act on Benefits for Asylum-Seekers (social benefits guaranteed by the state), forms an important context for asylum-related migration to Germany. By including the sentence 'Persons persecuted on political grounds enjoy the right of asylum' in the Basic Law (Article 16 of the Basic Law of 1949 and 16a of the Basic Law of 1993), the Federal Republic is granting a subjective right to asylum to all politically-persecuted foreigners. Asylum may only be granted in the case of state or quasi-state persecution. The provisions on 'safe third states' and 'safe states of origin' have since 1993 contributed to a considerable drop in the number of asylum applicants. Regardless of this, a considerable number of asylum-seekers who are not recognised are not deported as a result of the political situation in their countries of origin, or deportation is temporarily suspended (protection against deportation, obstacles to deportation, right to remain, (temporary) suspension of deportation). The Federal Office for the Recognition of Foreign Refugees decided on roughly 2.5 million initial applications from 1990 to 2002. The recognition rate was lower than 10% in all those years. However, this does not include the decisions taken on the basis of administrative court judgments, which make the recognition rate much higher. The recognition rate os asylum-seekers from countries with human rights violations and political persecution is also much higher. The main countries of origin in 2002 were Iraq, Turkey, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the Russian Federation, Afghanistan, Iran, Viet Nam, India, Syria and Algeria. In spite of the considerable fall in the number of asylum-seekers, Germany has taken on the most asylum-seekers within the EU in a comparison spanning many years. Over and above this, with a total of roughly 400,000 civil war refugees, Germany also records the largest proportion of refugees from the former Yugoslavia. Only in 2000 was Germany replaced by the United Kingdom as the country taking most asylum-seekers. // ABSTRACT IN FRENCH: L'immigration de demandeurs d'asile est un th+�me souvent discut+� de mani+�re controverse au niveau politique juridique avec des r+�percussions sur le d+�bat de l'immigration dans sa globalit+� et sur les processus d'int+�gration. Dans les ann+�es 90 la part des demandeurs d'asile +� l'immigration totale en Allemagne +�tait de 20%. Dans l'an 2001 presque 1,1 millions de r+�fugi+�s vivaient dans la R+�publique f+�d+�rale d'Allemagne, dont 467.000 (42%) de demandeurs d'asile, de b+�n+�ficiaires du droit d'asile ou de membres de leur famille. La lacune d+�mographique due au recul de la f+�condit+�, qui p+�se sur le financement des syst+�mes sociaux et de retraite ne peut pourtant pas +�tre combl+�e par la seule immigration non plus. L'immigration permet tout au plus de retarder la d+�croissance et le vieillissement de la population. C'est la raison pour laquelle il faut en m+�me temps des mesures politiques familiales pour +�liminer les d+�savantages structurels pour les familles. Des d+�penses financi+�res et prestations sociales +�lev+�es sont n+�cessaires pour l'entretien des demandeurs d'asile, d'autant plus qu'il n'est pas rare que les demandeurs d'asile subissent une proc+�dure de longue dur+�e. Du statut juridique (demandeur d'asile, b+�n+�ficiaire du droit d'asile ou membre de la famille d'un b+�n+�ficiaire du droit d'asile) r+�sultent des consid+�rables cons+�quences juridiques (statut de s+�jour) et financi+�res (prestations sociales). D'autres d+�penses financi+�res pour la F+�d+�ration et les L+�nder sont entre autres entra+�n+�es par les missions de Office f+�d+�ral pour la reconnaissance des r+�fugi+�s +�trangers et les t+�ches des tribunaux administratifs. La migration d'asile est en tant que forme de migration de r+�fugi+�s une migration non volontaire ou forc+�e. Les causes politiques, +�conomiques ainsi que sociales, culturelles et +�cologiques de la fuite sont en r+�gle g+�n+�rale li+�es l'une avec l'autre et se renforcent mutuellement. Des structures de motivation d+�clenchant la migration ou fuite ne se produisent pourtant aupr+�s des migrants potentiels que par la prise de conscience des conditions de vie in+�gales au niveau individuel. La condition en est +� nouveau la conscience de l'existence d'un foss+� de d+�veloppement. La fuite et la migration sont en cons+�quence des r+�actions sensibles d'individus agissants sur des in+�galit+�s politiques, socioculturelles et +�conomiques entre r+�gions. Les bases juridiques de l'octroi d'asile (fonction de protection) constituent en liaison avec la Loi sur les prestations aux demandeurs d'asile (aide sociale garantie par l'Etat allem+�nd) des conditions cadres importantes pour la migration d'asile vers l'Allemagne. Par l'insertion dans la Loi fondamentale d'une phrase suivant laquelle les de 1949 ou 16a GG de 1993) la R+�publique f+�d+�rale d'Allemagne octroie +� touts les +�trangers pers+�cut+�es pour des raisons politiques un droit subjectif +� l'asile. L'asile ne peut +�tre octroy+� qu'en cas de pers+�cution par l'+�tat ou quasiment par l'+�tat. Les r+�glementations des Etats tiers s++rs et des +�tats d'origine s++rs ont depuis 1993 contribu+� +� une nette diminution du nombre des demandeurs d'asile. Une partie consid+�rable des demandeurs d'asile non reconnus n'est n+�anmoins pas renvoy+� ou le refoulement est suspendu eu +�gard +� la situation politique dans le pays d'origine (protection contre le refoulement, obstacles au renvoi, droit de r+�sidence, suspension du refoulement, suspension de l'ex+�cution de toute mesure d'+�loignement). Entre 1990 et 2002 l'Office f+�d+�ral pour la reconnaissance des r+�fugi+�s +�trangers a d+�cid+� d'+� peu pr+�s 2,5 millions de demandes initiales. Le taux de reconnaissance n'atteignait pendant toutes ces ann+�es pas les 10%. En raison de jugements des tribunaux administratifs ces d+�cisions n'ont pourtant pas +�t+� tenues en compte de sorte que le taux de reconnaissance a clairement augment+�. Le taux de reconnaissance de pays de violation des droits de l'homme et de pers+�cution politique. Les principaux pays d'origine +�taient en 2002 l'Irak, la Turquie, la R+�publique f+�d+�rale de Yougoslavie, la F+�d+�ration russe, l'Afghanistan, L'Iran, le Vietnam, l'Inde, la Syrie et l'Alg+�rie. Malgr+� la diminution claire du nombre des demandeurs d'asile, dans une comparaison des longues ann+�es c'est l'Allemagne qui a accueilli la plupart des demandeurs d'asile au sein de l'U.E. Avec environ 400.000 r+�fugi+�s de guerre civile la part des r+�fugi+�s en provenance d'Ex-Yougoslavie est en Allemagne par ailleurs la plus +�lev+�e. Ce n'+�tait que dans l'an 2000 que l'Allemagne a +�t+� remplac+�e par la Grande-Bretagne en tant que pays accueillant la plupart des r+�fugi+�s.

AB  - The article describes the living conditions of Palestinian refugees in Iraq after the fall of the former regime in April 2003. The fall of former President Saddam Hussein's regime left Palestinians particularly vulnerable, given their uncertain legal status in the country. Many Palestinian families were evicted from their homes by resentful landlords. They face harassment, threats of deportation, media scapegoating, arbitrary detention, torture and murder

AB  - The study presents data on psychiatric disorders in a group of exiled survivors of torture presenting to an outpatient department for psychiatry. A Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-III-Revised (DSM-III-R)-based psychiatric interview, including the General Assessment of Functioning scale (GAF), an open list of symptoms and the Vienna diagnostic criteria in regard to depression were used to evaluate a broad range of possible sequels. The most frequent present diagnosis in 44 patients seen over a period of 3 yrs was posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (n�_'=�_'40), but criteria for a present diagnosis of other disorders were fulfilled in 34 patients, even years after torture, mainly major depression or dysthymia (n�_'=�_'26). Criteria for functional psychosis were fulfilled in 4 patients. Many patients reported symptoms not assessed by DSM-III-R criteria, including feelings of shame and guilt, and ruminations on existential fears. The impairments indicated by the GAF correlated best with the presence of the endogenomorphic-depressive axial syndrome, but not with duration of imprisonment, age or other factors. Research on sequels to extreme trauma should not be restricted to a simple diagnosis of PTSD, but should continue to look for a broader conceptualization, including neglected categories like the axial syndrome.

AB  - This paper describes the economy of a refugee camp. Key distortions to the economy of Kyangwali Refugee Settlement in Uganda are noted and the findings are used to construct a generic model of a refugee camp economy. Camp economies are influenced by host country policies, such as restrictions on refugees' movement and work, as well as by the physical and economic isolation of the site. Moreover, market outcomes interact with the nature of humanitarian assistance and the special demographic composition of the refugees to determine the prices and quantities that characterize the market. An awareness of the dynamics of the refugee camp economy has important implications for practitioners and scholars alike.

AB  - A descriptive study of education provided to limited English proficient (LEP) bilingual students in urban school districts in Kansas was carried out to examine certain aspects of educational practices for LEP students in Wichita Public Schools, Kansas City, Kansas Public Schools and Topeka Public Schools. The objectives of this study are: (1) to determine identification and placement procedures; (2) to catalogue program designs and implementations; (3) to identify grade promotion, retention and performance criteria, including English entry/exit criteria; (4) to examine staff development needs of school personnel; (5) to identify policies toward LEP students at all level in Kansas: Local educational agency, state educational agency, and institute of higher education; (6) to determine ESL/bilingual services available to LEP students in special education programs, after the referral; (7) to analyze the academic achievement of LEP students; and (8) to determine the level of parental involvement among language minority parents. The findings of this study are: (1) each of three school districts has a home language survey for identifying eligible LEP students for placement purposes; (2) there is no bilingual program in the three school district--a pulled-out ESL is the primary alternative instructional program for LEP students; (3) the primary assessment instruments are ITBS and CTBS for academic performance and IPT and LAS for English proficiency and literacy skills--there is no alternative assessment; (4) instructional personnel, with a few exceptions, did not have adequate training in English as a second language and/or bilingual education from their respective teachers training programs where they received a decree in education: (5) two of the districts in this study have written documents for serving LEP student and the State Board of Education has two main programs with guidelines on serving LEP students with funding available to school districts across the State--migrant education program and bilingual education program; (6) the ESL or bilingual education needs of LEP students in special education program are not met; (7) academic performance, based on standardized tests, are poor: and (8) parental involvement is limited to parent-teacher conference

AB  - The Writ of Habeas Corpus literally means �_ohave the body present.�__ For much of its history, habeas corpus cum causa (have the body with cause) was simply used as a legal mechanism to bring an individual before a judicial tribunal to adjudicate a legal matter. Over time, though, it became a tool that was used to inquire into the legitimate -- or �_oconstitutional�__ -- detention of an individual. What is missing from the legal and historical literature, though, is an examination of the status of the very individual that is the purported subject of the �_oGreat Writ.�__ If we understand Habeas Corpus as a marker of sorts for the political-legal status of an anonymous individual, Habeas pays dividends for studies of how individuals �_" individuals disassociated in principle, but often not in practice, from racial, gender, class or territorial attributes �_" have been perceived before the law. This paper will examine and test this understanding of Habeas Corpus within the milieu of ante-bellum chattel slavery and the use of Habeas as a challenge to the Fugitive Slave Act. The political-legal status of the slave and his access to, and adjudication under, the Writ is ambivalent at best and confirms that race challenges the historical (and current) understanding of Habeas Corpus as the �_oGreat Writ.�__ For example, Shepardized cases during this period reveal that Habeas was employed as a mechanism for freeing fugitive slaves AND as a real legal and Constitutional mechanism for returning slaves to their rightful owners. The �_oreality�__ of Habeas�_Ts lineage as a fundamentally �_ouniversal�__ mechanism for ensuring legal equality is therefore questioned. The real payoff in this paper, though, is a more accurate understanding of Habeas�_Ts link to American notions of individual equality before the law. The inequality of the slave before the law confirms that the �_oindividual�__, when not linked to privileged racial or even territorial (state vs. national citizenship, for example) ascriptions, is unable to achieve full equality before the law. Instead, we have to understand that the purported benefits of the �_oGreat Writ�__ �_" the �_onatural right�__ to have a real legal recourse to illegal or unconstitutional confinement �_" are not naturally realized.

AB  - During World War II the United States government sent 120,000 Japanese Americans from their homes on the West Coast of the United States into several concentration camps in the interior. This dissertation examines the libraries these "internment camps," from the temporary detention centers to the English and Japanese language community libraries in the War Relocation Authority's relocation centers. In order to explain the historical development, this study reviews the experience of Issei (immigrant generation) and Nisei (second generation) Japanese Americans with public libraries in the United States before 1941. The study then focuses on libraries in the Tanforan Assembly Center and other temporary detention centers, where libraries emerged as grassroots cultural agencies; founded largely by Nisei women working with librarians on the outside. The dissertation follows the path of library development in the civilian-administered WRA camps, with an emphasis on the English-language libraries at the Manzanar and Topaz relocation centers as case studies. Another feature of the dissertation is a chapter on the Japanese-language libraries at Minidoka, Poston, Rohwer, and Topaz. It also looks at questions of censorship, and the role of libraries as agents of cultural maintenance, resistance, or control

AB  - This dissertation concerns political belief and its implications for applied folklife. A central thesis is that we can use our methodology to understand ideology, the belief systems people maintain to explain their conceptions of justice and their social and political positions relative to others. Such knowledge can be applied in numerous ways for the betterment of the human condition, as articulated by communities and individuals themselves. The first chapter critiques the current state of American folkloristics by reviewing European folklife studies and folkloristic analyses of political expressive culture. It also proposes a model for studying political folklife, following the study of belief developed by Yoder, Hufford, and others. The lavishly illustrated second chapter includes five case studies: (a) the multiple meanings of the yellow ribbon during the Gulf War, including antiwar sentiments among Quakers in New Jersey and college basketball player Marco Lokar, (b) creativity within the Central America peace movement of the 1980s, emphasizing refugee testimony and creative protest, (c) paper prison art of Chinese immigrants from the Golden Venture ship, who made elaborate artwork from folded paper and toilet papier-mache, and (d) makeshift housing of homeless people and refugees. Chapter three concerns social justice, reviewing folk justice, critical legal studies, and ethics and realism in folklife studies and human rights. It includes a critique of the postmodern approach to ethnography, and contrasts this with the prophetic tradition in the social sciences, including Mooney, Hyde, Cabral, hooks, West, Freire, and liberation theology. The final chapter develops a model for applied folklife based on a paradigm of listening. After reviewing E. P. Thompson's concept of moral economy, the perspective of Botkin, and the public folklore/applied folklore split, it suggests ways folklorists could work in law, economic development, public policy, peace studies, grassroots organizing, and social work. It reconfigures cultural work, casting folklife as a helping profession and calling for a responsiveness to human and societal needs

AB  - Our purpose in this chapter is to alert the reader to the special mental health problems experienced by refugee children. In times of peace and social stability it is difficult to imagine that children can become not only the inadvertent but also even the intended victims of political and military struggle. Unfortunately, today we see the imprisonment and torture of children; the forced conscription of children into military units as combatants, laborers, and sexual victims; the abuse of children as a way to punish and torture their parents and other family members; the targeting of child victims on the bases of their parents�_T ethnicity, religion, education, or occupation; the focusing on children as bearers of political ideologies that are invidious to their elders; the raising of children in refugee camps, with insecurity, poor adult role models, inadequate education, and lack of job opportunities.

AB  - The objective of this research was to determine whether early post-migration demographic and psychosocial factors associated with cultural marginality would predict hostility 10-yrs after flight and relocation. In this longitudinal study, participants, who had spent 1-yr in a refugee camp, were studied at 1.5, 3.5, and 9 yrs post-relocation in the United States (i.e., Times 1, 2, and 3). Earlier data were compared with hostility at 9-yrs. The 102 Hmong participants in this study, originally from Laos, comprised the first group of Hmong refugees, aged 15-72 yrs old (M=31.0, SD=13.1), to be relocated from Thailand to Minnesota in 1976. Hmong research assistants collected these data using a questionnaire format at 1.5, 3.5, and 9 yrs postrelocation. Hostility was measured using the Hostility subscale of the 90-item Symptom Checklist (SCL-90). Female gender, animistic belief, absence of a leadership role, and high scores on the SCI-Hostility predicted higher SCL-Hostility scores. Increased hostility was associated with greater financial, marital, and mental-emotional problems. The study suggests that demographic factors associated with marginality and loss of control predict hostility in refugee immigrants. Losses and stressors from a decade earlier in Asia did not predict hostility. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - (from the chapter) Discusses refugees who were psychiatric patients at a university department of psychiatry and emphasizes the types and correlates of victimization. (chapter) 286 sequential refugee patients were categorized based on whether they had experienced deliberate face-to-face harm or threat of harm while incarcerated, impersonal harm or threat of harm while in combat or fleeing, or no harm or threat of harm. For each of the 3 categories, case examples of 4 patients, demographics, clinical characteristics, and treatment are given. Average age showed a difference among the 3 groups, with victims of deliberate violence being the oldest, victims of impersonal violence being intermediate, and other refugees being the youngest. Mood disorders were the most frequent diagnosis in all 3 groups. Findings indicate that histories and physical examinations regarding previous trauma are neglected by those serving refugee populations and that refugee victims differ with regard to their previous victimization.

AB  - This article presents an approach to community development when working with refugee groups within a resettlement context. The approach parallels an elicitive research initiative within the cities of Brisbane and Logan, Australia in response to Sudanese accusations of neo-colonial methods of �_~service delivery�_T and from two challenges posited from an analysis of the literature. The dimensions of privileging emic perspectives (the insider perspectives of Sudanese refugees in contrast to etic or outsider professional perspectives), using a dialogical method (the creation of a safe space to make sense of the new settlement context), taking an elicitive stance (whereby the community development worker orients themselves towards facilitation and discovery) and focusing on the resources of culture, community and power are outlined

AB  - Trauma discourse plays a central role in social work practice with refugees in Australia, intersecting with, and gaining power from, managerial discourses that specify individually focused approaches to practice. The outcome is a double bind for refugee populations, who quickly learn that identifying themselves as vulnerable is a pathway to resources, yet then find themselves caught in processes that have precarious effects for agency. The paper argues that trauma work, however necessary at some points, is overemphasised and over-legitimised, and that this individualistic, medicalised trauma model can only address a small part of the healing journey for refugees. Revisiting some of the traditional disciplinary bases of social work and human services may facilitate organisations and practitioners to engage more proactively and reflexively with people who arrive as refugees across a broader range of tasks associated with re-establishing themselves in a new country. A focus on the multiple sites of family, community, culture, society and economy, through the multiple lenses of anthropology, sociology, political science and philosophy, may produce a messier practice, but provides people and practitioners with more resources for the long haul

AB  - This collection brings together leading scholars to explore the 'doing' and 'making' of identities. Drawing on the highly innovative ESRC Identities and Social Action Programme, the chapters take core social actions -- such as performing, excluding, mixing, bonding -- and demonstrate how social practices and identities unfold together. How do identities and social action articulate together? This book explores the 'doing' and the 'making' of identity. It describes how identities emerge from the flow of action and organise social conduct. In social research identity is often treated as a static accomplished fact -- already owned, finalised and shaped. Drawing on five years of sustained research within the highly innovative ESRC Identities and Social Action Programme, Theorizing Identities and Social Action develops a very different standpoint. The chapter authors take core social actions -- such as performing, excluding, mixing, bonding, relating, 'passing', travelling, campaigning and disputing -- and demonstrate how social practices and identities unfold together. A wide range of theories of the identity/action relation are accessibly mobilised in ways which will be illuminating for students and experienced researchers alike. These include Judith Butler's notion of performativity, social identity theory in social psychology, relational psychoanalysis, Bourdieu's notion of 'habitus' and conversation analysis 'Theorizing Identities and Social Action is a landmark text for social scientists across a large transdisciplinary domain, from psychosocial studies to social theory. It explores the workings of identity in social life through an outstanding collection of empirical studies drawing on a range of theoretical positions and methodological approaches. Covering so many key topics, it confirms the UK Economic and Social Research Council Programme on Identities and Social Action as an intervention of the utmost importance in social science research.' - Professor Stephen Frosh, Birkbeck College, University of London, UK 'This book is the culmination of a unique and ground-breaking project. Diverse contributions from leading identity scholars across the social sciences provide stimulating and powerful analyses of issues at the heart of modern life. This important and timely book provides a comprehensive survey of current research and defines the agenda for the future. It is compelling reading - informative and provocative in the very best ways.' Professor Alex Haslam, University of Exeter, UK

AB  - A foreign diplomat based in Almaty says that if you compare Kazakhstan's human-rights and political record and that of some of its neighbours, Kazakhstan comes out way ahead. The Turkmenistani opposition movements that emerged after independence were quickly crushed, and now opposition leaders operate from abroad. But even in more liberal Kirgizstan, the main opposition leader, Felix Kulov, is in prison, and the two main leaders of the Democratic Choice of Kazakhstan (DCK), an opposition umbrella group, were jailed last year. Emil Aliev, a senior member of Felix Kulov's Ar-Namys party, explains that in January 2003 the party had to vacate its offices for the third time because the landlord had come under pressure to terminate the lease. In Kazakhstan, for example, Akezhan Kazhegeldin, who was prime minister in 1994-97, set up the Republican People's Party of Kazakhstan in 1998, and in 1999 was forced into exile, from where he continues to head his party

Although the Rohingyas have lived in Arakan for hundreds of years, the military junta that rules Myanmar claims they are immigrants. According to those who have fled the country, soldiers have set fire to their houses, raped women and forced men to work as unpaid labourers on military building. Back in April Myanmar signed an agreement with Bangladesh, promising to take the refugees back. It has since told Bangladesh that it has set up reception centres in Arakan for the refugees

AB  - This dissertation analyzes six contemporary narratives to interrogate the representation of home. The narratives are Toni Morrison's Beloved , Marita Golden's Migrations of the Heart , Jamaica Kincaid's A Small Place , Callie Khouri and Ridley Scott's film Thelma and Louise , Bharati Mukherjee's Jasmine , and Marilynne Robinson's Housekeeping . Configured variously as domestic space, colonization, slavery, cultures, or nations, home is represented in these works as a place of confinement, isolation, or abuse for the female characters. Transgressing the boundaries of home, the characters opt for reinvention and movement. Home, however, exerts an enormous pull through such forces as nostalgia, memory, absorption, assimilation, and recuperation. Contradictions and conflict offer literary resistance. Each narrative also creates new forms of blended genres and discourses. Beloved is the study's cornerstone because of Toni Morrison's imagining of the internal lives of both enslaved and freed black people in the United States, her depiction of the role of home, and her rewriting the white canon. Home reveals the historical and cultural containment of women of color, their resistance to those harsh restraints, and their struggle to rewrite home, in spite of the legacies of that containment. Both Marita Golden's Migrations of the Heart and Jamaica Kincaid's A Small Place address the legacy of slavery and colonialism, cultural violence, and postcolonial homes. Khouri and Scott's film Thelma and Louise incites conversations about survivors of abuse and women who act on their rage to hold men accountable for their actions. An ironic, postmodern tale, Bharati Mukherjee's controversial novel Jasmine depicts an illegal immigrant's flight from home after home, eluding containment. The character Jasmine represents the savvy immigrant who uses her skills and intelligence to gain agency. Marilynne Robinson's Housekeeping spirals backward and downward through one family's history, searching for reasons why family members could be so disconnected from one another and why women could be so dispensable in cultural, literary, or historical stories. The dissertation ends with a Coda which discusses the use of literature and transgressive narratives in the writing classroom

AB  - The dissertation presents an intellectual history and multiple biography of four anarchists-turned-interventionists who later joined the fascist movement. Leandro Arpinati began his political career as one of the few anarcho-individualists who favored Italy's intervention the First World War. He was among the founders of the Bolognese fascio di combattimento, and, later, Mussolini's Undersecretary to the Ministry of the Interior from 1929 to 1933, where he was known as the "Second Duce of Fascism." In May 1933 he was forced from the government for opposing the establishment of the regime. Arpinati's anarcho-individualism shaped his tripartite ideology of Individual-State-Nation, his defense of the individual, and his preference for authoritarian over totalitarian solutions. He was also influenced by a group of socialists and revolutionary syndicalists including: Massimo Rocca, an extreme anarcho-individualist who goaded Mussolini into openly declaring an interventionist stance; Maria Rygier, a leader among the Bolognese anarchists who successfully articulated the revolutionary ideas of the left in terms acceptable to the right; and, Torquato Nanni, a prominent socialist lawyer and journalist who hoped to fuse the left wing of Fascism to the right wing of Bolshevism. Like Arpinati, all were close friends of the young Mussolini in Romagna and were among the first to express openly their disillusionment with fascism in power. By 1934, all four had been arrested for "anti-fascist activities" and forced into external or internal exile (confino). Despite Arpinati and Nanni's participation in the Resistance a decade later, they were assassinated by communist partisans on the day of Liberation in April 1945. An analysis of the motives behind their assassinations leads to conclusions about the use of history for sustaining the Myth of the Resistance as a governing paradigm in the postwar period. An examination of the transition from the fascist state to the postwar Italian Republic suggests a model by which political parties have been appended to major personalities in the postwar Italian Republic according to the degree to which they were associated with fascism. Similarly, a resolution of the current political impasse in Italy is likely to involve appending new political alliances to major personalities to the degree to which they were involved in the political corruption since the Second World War

AB  - The political history of southern New England is similar in many respects to the underlying forces of its most prominent physical characteristic, the sea. Just as movement of the tides is controlled by outside forces, so, too, the long-term political issues or agenda in the region. And like the tide, the direction of the political agenda is subtly but constantly changing. Southern New England has had three political agendas, or tides, each controlled by its own set of opposing interests. The first agenda consisted of ethnocultural and economic issues (e.g., prohibition, immigration policy), with discussion dominated by two contending interests, one mainly Protestant and the other Catholic. The political parties provided a necessary and important forum for each side to air its views. Realizing the voting potential of the recent Catholic immigrants, Democrats sought them out; Republicans ignored the newcomers for the most part and sheltered those who favored the status quo, mostly Protestants. The New Deal ushered in a second political tide that centered on the role of government. The opposing interests that gave form to the agenda were the same: Catholics, generally the "have-not's," supported government economic activism; Protestants, generally the "have's," advocated restrained government intervention. The role of the parties remained that of providing an outlet. By the mid-1960's and through the 1970's the second agenda gradually lost its saliency. Catholics had become"have's," and on economic matters there are few disagreements between them and the Protestants, who are now accepting of an enlarged role for government. The third tide is composed of social and cultural concerns (e.g., abortion, the death penalty, sexual conduct). Blue-collar workers cling to traditional morality when it comes to these concerns while college-educated workers eschew that morality for individual decision--which translates into the two groups' being at odds. The ranks of the college-educated are being enlarged by an ongoing professionalization of the electorate. In recent decades the industrial order that consisted principally of the so-called "immigrant industries" has significantly declined, and new industries are taking their place and employing workers whose theoretical knowledge is essential to produce a product or provide a service. In addition to the blue-collar and professional collectivities, a much smaller interest group is present: a tiny satellite of those who call themselves Republicans but who are divided over issue-agenda content and the party's course. Orthodox Republicans have elevated such traditional party dogmas as free enterprise and balanced budgets to articles of faith, adherence to which is more important than winning elections. Pragmatic Republicans, mostly "old-money" Yankees, concentrate instead on winning elections. The political consequences of the new social and cultural tide are enormous. From an electoral standpoint, blue-collar workers, long allied with the Democratic party, are being joined there by the professionals, who add to overall Democratic strength. This, together with the diminishment of the Republican party, has resulted in a one-and-a-half party system. Such an arrangement is not automatically advantageous for the Democratic party because its members are increasingly vulnerable to fractures originating in today's social and cultural issues. In institutional terms, the parties have become considerably weakened, especially during the past decade. The debilitation is so severe that in many instances they no longer are able to provide a forum for the contending interests. More and more, social and cultural issues are debated not from political platforms but on legislative and judicial stages. The enfeeblement of the parties as intercessors is a serious development because by themselves the legislative and judicial stages are flawed in the management of interest-group conflict

AB  - BACKGROUND: Inmates are a high-risk population for tuberculosis (TB) control efforts, including treatment for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). Completion of therapy after release has been poor. The goal of this study was to evaluate therapy completion and active disease over 5 years in a cohort of inmates METHODS: The sample was from a completed randomized trial in 1998-1999 of education or incentive versus usual care to improve therapy completion after release from the San Francisco County Jail. Records from the jail, the County Tuberculosis Clinic, and the California TB Registry were used to measure therapy completion and development of active TB. Analyses were conducted in 2005 RESULTS: Of a total 527 inmates, 31.6% (n=176) completed therapy, of whom 59.7% (n=105) completed it in jail. Compared with the U.S.-born, foreign-born inmates residing in the United States for < or =5 years were less likely to complete the therapy (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=0.49, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.28-0.85), and those with more education were more likely to complete the therapy (AOR=1.06, 95% CI=1.01-1.12). Three subjects developed active TB in the 5 years of follow-up, resulting in an annual rate of 108 per 100,000. Compared with California rates, subjects were 59 times as likely to develop active TB (standardized morbidity ratio of 59.2, 95% CI=11.2-145.1). None had completed therapy, none were new immigrants, and two were known to be HIV-positive at diagnosis CONCLUSIONS: Completion of therapy for LTBI is a challenge, but the active TB seen in this jail cohort emphasizes the importance of continued efforts to address TB risk in this population

AB  - Last June marked the 14th anniversary of the closing of the world's first, and only, HIV camp at Guantanamo Bay. This article revisits the infamous legacy of the Guantanamo Bay camp and the plight of the HIV-infected Haitian political refugees during the early 1990's. Part I summarises the development of the United States' immigration policy and the government's history for excluding immigrants for health related reasons. Part II details the factual and historical background leading to the mass exodus of the Haitians and the sequence of tragic events which resulted in their confinement at Guantanamo Bay. Part III focuses on the seminal case of Haitian Centers Council, Inc. v. Sale (II) (Haitian Centers Council, Inc. v. Sale, 823 F. Supp. 1028, 1049 (E.D.N.Y. 1993)) which was responsible for bringing about the closure of the HIV camp and granting parole to all HIV-infected refugees to enter the United States. The anticipated revolutionary reform of the HIV-exclusion policy emanating from this legal triumph never materialized. The United States government successfully sought to have the case vacated from the Court's books. Consequently, the landmark precedent does not technically exist today. What does remain is the notorious HIV-exclusion policy which was distorted by the United States government to justify their detainment. Although the epic legal and emotional struggles of the Haitians are forgotten by many, the legacy of Guantanamo Bay continues to haunt the lives of those who were prisoners of the HIV camp.

AB  - The Migrant Children pilot project sought to develop ways of conducting children-centred research on migration, identity and place in children�_Ts worlds. The aims of the project were to design and use methods that might enable the children to express themselves in their own terms. Three Irish primary schools in Cork participated in this project. Picture-drawing and group discussion exercises were carried out with 46 children from the first and second classes (aged 6-8), 15 of which were migrant children. A photography exercise was carried out with 71 children from the fifth and sixth classes (aged 10-12), 7 of which were migrant children. Drawing on the use of children-centred visual research methods, this article compares the use of artwork and photography as visual methods and outlines the theoretical frameworks within which the data produced can be made meaningful. The ways in which the social worlds of migrant children both converged with, and diverged from, those of children who were born in Ireland are also explored. The methods allowed children to express themselves and communicate in ways that are not always wholly written or verbal. Quite complex and dynamic pictures of everyday life, extended families and peer interactions emerged from this project

AB  - In this paper we explore the ways in which the methodological and analytical complexities that are encountered when researching with children have stimulated particular approaches that are useful to consider in the context of research with both adults and children who are refugees or seeking asylum. We draw upon ideas related to performativity to argue that the methods and activities we employ in research encounters in-the-field play a key role in facilitating research participants' efforts to express their subjectivities and identities. Drawing on fieldwork with children in an accommodation centre for asylum-seeking families in Ireland, we argue that using child-centred research methods can be understood as specific moments within which materials become available for research participants (children) to develop and enhance their social and cultural identities in many different ways. The use of multiple and participatory methods that children engaged with, adapted or ignored (as they chose), enabled and resulted in children representing themselves as individuals in families seeking asylum, rather than as asylum-seeker children. This paper supports work that suggests that ways of approaching participatory research with children may be useful when researching other populations, but it goes beyond this point to assert that research encounters may provide participants with exceptional resources for explaining their lives.

AB  - In Ireland, asylum seekers are placed into a system of dispersed direct provision reception centres across the country. This paper argues that the frequently contradictory and ambiguous positions created for children living within the Irish asylum system reflect the uncertainties and ambiguities surrounding them as immigrants (as part/not part of host societies), children (as child/not adult), and asylum seekers (as separated-out populations in dispersal centres). Based on research in a specific asylum dispersal centre, this paper will explore the ways in which the spatialities of the children's lives reflect and constitute these contradictions and ambiguities in a host of different ways.

AB  - Background: Early skin-to-skin contact (SSC) after birth is recommended as part of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) baby friendly health initiative to promote optimum breastfeeding. This paper reports rates of breastfeeding initiation and duration in a low resource environment, where early SSC is not practised, and explores views of pregnant women and midwives surrounding breastfeeding and swaddling. Methods: Data from records from a single hospital on the Thai-Myanmar border where refugee women gave birth during a one-year period (2010) were used to determine breastfeeding initiation rates and the time of the first breastfeed, and duration of breastfeeding of the previous alive child in multigravidae. Focus group discussions (FGD) were conducted to obtain information from pregnant women attending antenatal care about their intended or previous duration of breastfeeding and views on breastfeeding. Interviews with local midwives explored reasons for high rates of breastfeeding in this setting and the practice of newborn swaddling. Results: Of 1404 live births in 2010 in Maela refugee camp there were 982 evaluable mother-newborn pairs, including 80 infants born before 37 weeks gestation. Initiation of breastfeeding within the first hour after birth and exclusive breastfeeding at discharge in term mother-newborn pairs was 91.2% (823/902) and 99.3% (896/902); and before 37 weeks gestation, 48.8% (39/80) and 98.8% (79/80). Reported duration of previous breastfeeding was 19 (range 2 to 72) months. During FGD all primigravidae (n = 17) intended to breastfeed and all multigravidae (n = 33) had previously breastfed; expected or previous duration of feeding was for more than one year or longer. The major theme identified during FGD was breastfeeding is "good". Women stated their intention to breastfeed with certainty. This certainty was echoed during the interviews with midwifery staff. SSC requires a delay in early swaddling that in Karen people, with animistic beliefs, could risk loss of the spirit of the newborn or attract malevolent spirits. Conclusions: In a population with a strong culture of breastfeeding and robust breastfeeding practices, high rates of initiation and duration of breastfeeding were found despite a lack of early skin-to-skin contact. Local preferences, traditions and practices that protect, support and maintain high rates of breastfeeding should be promoted.

AB  - Renovation and Revolution is the first half of a book length series of linked essays exploring the history of houses in Virginia from 1607 to the present. Readers travel through the American Indian town of Paspahegh, models of waddle and daub houses excavated at James Town, Appalachian cabins, freed slave refugee camps, manor houses shipped from England, low-income garden apartments, a sprawling commune, abandoned college dorms modeled after world's fair designs, and much more. This tour ultimately guides readers to a better understanding of what it means to be at home in America, a land founded on movement and innovation, yet constantly searching for its roots. This half covers pre-history through the Civil War with a few side stories foraying into the 21st century

AB  - Citing breakthroughs in neuroscience, personal accounts of occupational adaptation in extreme circumstances, and everyday occupational narratives, Whiteford explores how occupation connects us with others and gives a sense of continuity, whilst also being shaped by the historic, cultural and political context. Illustrating her narrative with stories of the daily routines of an Albanian refugee camp inhabitant, a patchwork group for grandmothers parenting their grandchildren in poverty, and the musical longevity of the Rolling Stones, Whiteford concludes that occupational engagement across the lifespan is being challenged and reinvented in ways that support the emergence of community engagement and more sustainable ways of living.

AB  - Based on observational fieldwork, this article investigates the relationships between male wayfarers (travelling homeless men) and religious and therapeutic communities. It examines some of the ways in which these outsider organisations represent forms of support and care that often deviate from traditional night-shelters and mainstream day-centres. The article first defines the characteristics of wayfaring, such as endurance, mobility, rurality and work. The author then considers how religious communities enable wayfarers looking for temporary accommodation experience feelings of acceptance and expressions of hospitality. Next drawing on ethnographic research undertaken at Pilsdon Manor, a Christian community in rural West Dorset that offers a refuge to people in crisis, and which has been materially and spiritually sustained by 50 years of close engagement with wayfarers is discussed. In ending, the paper suggests topics that might be used in future research on the culture of wayfaring, and the alternative homeless providers that service them

AB  - In September 1773, the educational work of the largest and most powerful teaching body then in existence was brought to an abrupt end. The order Pope Clement xii for the total and universal suppression of the Society of Jesus resulted in the summary closure of 728 Jesuit establishments responsible for the education of some 250,000 students. The prohibition on the existence of Jesuit schools and colleges, engendered intense political pressure on the papacy for a variety of reasons, was to endure for more than forty years, until 1814, with massive repercussions for education worldwide. The effects of the suppression on education have been the subject of numerous national studies, with one important exception - the fate of the educational work of the English Province of the Society of Jesus. With members in England, Wales, Maryland and Pennsylvania, as well as in educational outposts in continental Europe, the English Jesuits were to prove a unique body. Unlike their counterparts in every other country, the Russian Empire excepted, they were to retain their corporate identity throughout the suppression period, as a result of quirks both of history and of geography. The English Jesuit college founded in exile at Saint-Omer in the Spanish Netherlands in 1593, because of the penal laws against Catholics in England and Wales, moved to Bruges in the Austrian Netherlands in 1762 when the Paris Parliament dissolved the Society of Jesus in France. At the time of the universal suppression in 1773, the prince-bishop of Liege, Fran��ois-Charles de Velbruck, invited the English ex-Jesuits to consolidate all their educational activity in the principality of Liege, where they had operated a house of studies since 1614. The suppressed English Jesuit developed and furthered their educational activity, first at the newly formed AcadǸmie anglaise at Liege, from 1773 until 1794, and thereafter in England at Stony hurst, in Lancashire, developing their curriculum in important new ways, beyond the confines of the Ratio Studiorum. Despite a series of major calamities, they were able to use their educational successes as a springboard for the further development of Jesuit education, not only in England and Wales but also in the early United States of America, at Georgetown, where they created a secondary-level academy that led on to the foundation of the present-day university. The aim of this paper is to indicate how the suppressed English Jesuits succeeded in their educational work, against all the odds. From research undertaken in surviving, hitherto largely unexplored, archival sources in Britain, continental Europe and the United States, the paper aims to throw new light on this significant but neglected period of educational history.

AB  - NGOs attempting to grapple with the thankless task of helping the Rwandan refugee camps have come in for some rough treatment from two directions over their HIV/AIDS efforts. At the policy level, an AMREF paper presented to the Vancouver conference charges bluntly that "There is no policy regarding HIV/STDs in refugee camps among international organizations specializing in refugee crises; thus there is absence of STD drugs and protocols, no privacy in open (tent) clinics, no means of protection (no condoms), and no information regarding STDs/HIV." AMREF bases its comments upon its experience among 700,000 Rwandan refugees in camps in West and North-West Tanzania, an area where (AMREF remarks pointedly) there was previously a low prevalence of HIV by Tanzanian standards, at 2-5%. At the operational level, CARE International, in a conference paper, reported rough treatment at the hands of the Rwandans themselves. It has been working under contract from AIDSCAP among the 400,000 Rwandans who fled to the Ngara district of Tanzania. Not surprisingly, it found that women and girls in the camps faced a higher risk than men. But more surprisingly at first sight, it found that after its HIV educational efforts "negative attitudes about condom use increased from 22% to 78%," which was possibly explained by "political ideology." "Young Hutu men in the camps boasted of their efforts to impregnate as many women and girls as possible to help replenish the population." full text

AB  - Recent calls for psychiatric services to focus upon psychosocial recovery for people with severe mental illness has led to a renewed interest in recovery communities. Hence, Community Connections (Washington DC) set up a Women�_Ts Empowerment Center as an intentional recovery community. The aim of this paper is to qualitatively chronicle the development of this centre to assess emerging challenges. Focus groups and participant observation were conducted regularly over a 16-month period. Analysis suggested three emerging challenges (i) concern regarding unmet practical and physical needs (ii) the struggle to establish internal rules and corrective mechanisms (iii) frustration regarding differential participation

AB  - Little is known about Least Tern (Sterna antillarum) chicks from the time they leave the nest until fledging because they are highly mobile and cryptically colored. We evaluated the efficacy of using radiotelemetry to monitor Interior Least Tern (S. a. athalassos) chicks at Salt Plains National Wildlife Refuge, Oklahoma. In 1999, we attached radio transmitters to 26 Least Tern chicks and tracked them for 2-17 days. No adults abandoned their chicks after transmitters were attached. Transmitters did not appear to alter growth rates of transmittered chicks (P = 0.36) or prevent feather growth, although dermal irritation was observed on one chick. However, without frequent reattachment, transmitters generally did not remain on chicks < 1 week old for more than 2 days because of feather growth and transmitter removal, presumably by adult terns. Although the presence of transmitters did not adversely affect Least Tern chicks, future assessments should investigate nonintrusive methods to improve retention of transmitters on young chicks and reduce the number of times that chicks need to be handled.

AB  - Linda Bartolomei, Eileen Pittaway and Emma Elizabeth Pittaway examine the loss and ongoing denial of citizenship experienced by refugee women as one of the intersecting forms of oppression and discrimination they encounter that determines their identity. The case study used is that of Kakuma camp in the north of Kenya as part of a three-year project focusing on refugee women at risk. They focus on notions of citizenship and identity of refugee women, charting the range of oppressions experienced by refugee women in the Kakuma camp, and explore the manner in which these oppressions intersect to compound the risks of sexual- and gender-based violence

AB  - Asylum seekers in Europe face increasingly restrictive policy regimes across the continent. In Denmark, they are held at designated asylum centres while their cases are processed and are subject to limitations on their movement, education and employment, as well as to a degree of surveillance from both the state and the Danish Red Cross, which operates the majority of the asylum centres. While these structures are in some ways reminiscent of Foucault's panopticon, I want to suggest a counterpoint to the panopticon, which I call the 'myopticon' to indicate the near-sightedness of the central surveying eye. The myopticon is a near-sighted system of surveillance practices, knowledges and sanctions, deployed as though it were panoptic. I want to suggest that the uncertainty that has soaked through the Danish asylum system and profoundly affected the asylum seekers in it is not a byproduct of bureaucratic processing, but intrinsic to the operation of the myopticon. By drawing out points of distinction with Foucault's panopticon, I sketch the outlines of a new technology of power that has powerful consequences for the daily lives of asylum seekers in Denmark.

AB  - This book ranges from refugee camps in Palestine to halting sites of the Irish Travellers and elsewhere in search of a new politics practiced through performance. Written through the intersection of performance and philosophy, the book refutes neoliberalism's depoliticizing and strategic uses of humanitarianism, human rights, and development. Performance in the Blockades of Neoliberalism: Thinking the Political Anew brings to readers a fresh and rejuvenating sense of what the political might be if we re-think it outside of our common understandings of the concept and how we practice it. This politics thought anew concerns what it is to live, to really exist. The central assumption of this book is that we must not overlook the ways in which neoliberalism, specifically, shrinks our imaginations of what life might be. This book describes, for the first time, performances of and for refugees in Palestine, as well as other Palestinian performance. It also describes, for the first time, the situation of the Irish Travellersfroma performative perspective,whose nomadism has become a crime. In the descriptions of other types of performances, including Theatre for Development's and Doctors Without Borders' interactive traveling exhibition -the Refugee Camp in the Heart of the City -readers will find a sustained analysis of the divide across which humanitarianism and development are practiced and what might oppose that divide. Along with the final, brief study of Bodies: the Exhibit, all these situations are ones where blockades of the human, either physically or imaginatively, are intended. In all of these studies, however, there are glimpses of new spaces and new politics which counter the power of the blockades. These are glimpses of agreater imagination of what it is to live, and of political capacities which can be resurrected regardless of the extent to which they've been unacknowledged. Guided byvisionary contemporary philosophy, with a focus on Alain Badiou, Performance in the Blockades of Neoliberalism brings new, challenging and affirmative vocabularies and theoretical tools to those interested in theatre and performance, and all those interested in the political possibilities of today 'Generous in its international reach, daring in its theoretical inclusiveness, precise in its politically nuanced analysis, Maurya Wickstrom's work is that unusual thing: a book that recognises and illuminates what performance has to do with the disaffected and the disempowered.' - Alan Read, Professor of Theatre, King's College London

AB  - The Russian authorities perceived the expansion of the Orthodox Church in the western territories of the Russian Empire as a chance for rapid Russification and the obliteration of the religious-cultural distinctness of Polish lands. Religious policy was thus subjected to the creation of the territorial integrity of the state. Its determinant was the protective attitude towards the dominating Church, the discrimination of religious minorities, particularly the Catholic Church, and the intervention of the civilian authorities, far-reaching and determined by political objectives, into the resolution of religious questions. By following such principles, the Russian administration in the Kingdom of Poland initiated in 1864 undertakings aimed at the final liquidation of the last Uniate diocese in the Russian Empire. In 1875 these efforts resulted in the cassation of the Greek-Catholic Church and the incorporation of about 260 000 Uniates into the Orthodox Church. The protest expressed in various ways by part of the clergy and the faithful against Russian religious-cultural domination met with reprisal on the part of the state authorities. Repression applied towards the so-called resisting Uniates (fines, harassment, detentions, deportation to inner Russia) initiated an almost fifty years-long religious persecution. Attempts at a liberalisation of the religious policy, made at the turn of the 1870s by the Warsaw general governors (P. Kotzebue and P. Al'bedinskiy) failed, since the policy of religious repression in the Podlasie region was supported by the central state authorities and the upper hierarchy of the Orthodox Church. The choice of a reactionary course, followed by religious discrimination, accelerated the national and religious self-awareness of the Uniates, who under the pressure of the Orthodox Church declared their bonds with Polishness and Catholicism. Their stand was confirmed by, i.a. the organisation in the autumn of 1881 of a missionary expedition to Uniates deported to the innermost recesses of Russia. The missionaries, who wished to include the exiles into the Orthodox Church, encountered determined resistance. The central authorities' assessment of this attitude of the exiles destroyed all chances for returning home. Reprinted by permission of Semper Publishers, Warsaw, Poland

AB  - The physiologist Lina Stern (1878-1968), from Baltic origin, and the neuroscientist Constantin von Monakow (1853-1930), from Russian origin, are the protagonists of this article. Lina Stern studied medicine and initiated research work at the Physiology Institute in Geneva. Her research career was quite unique and led, unusually soon, to a professorship. Monakow was professor and head at the Brain-Anatomy Institute of the University of Zurich. Late in his career, he was among the first to work on the problem of the Blood-Brain-Barrier. In 1915, he hypothesised that the brain needs to be protected by the plexus choroideus and the "Glia-Schirm". Monakow observed severe degeneration of the plexus at autopsy, suggesting that the barrier had lost its protection. The publication was not well received, probably because the microphotographs were of doubtful quality and difficult to interpret. At the Institute of Physiology in Geneva, Lina Stern used a physiological approach of testing substances in terms of barrier penetration. Her team discovered some substances which had the capacity to be transported through membranes of the brain. She coined the term "Blood-Brain-Barrier" (BBB) and soon obtained a high international profile. In 1925, she accepted an offer to continue her research in Moscow. Her career continued most successfully as the only female Academician. However, late in the Stalin era, she suffered in prison and was exiled to Kasakstan. She died in 1968.

AB  - The article focuses on issues related to state cooperation for crime-repression in the U.S. There are now four distinct and powerful forces cooperating for facilitating the adoption of four well-considered crime-repression Acts. The four forces are the Federal Department of Justice, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, the Interstate Commission on Crime, and the Council of State Governments, and its powerful affiliated organization, the American Legislators' Association. The four Acts on which these forces are focusing are--an Act to allow one State's officer, on entering another State, there to pursue and arrest a fugitive accused, an Act to authorize the waiver of formal interstate rendition proceedings in the State where the arrest has been made, an Act to allow Courts in one State to detain and send a witness into another State where he is required in a criminal prosecution, and an Act to authorize the supervision by the authorities of one State, of a person on parole, who has come from the State where he was convicted

AB  - The legal aspects surrounding the use of deadly force in the United States are changing in a significant way. Police may use deadly force only to protect themselves or other innocent persons from serious bodily injury or death. Appropriate force may be used to arrest a malefactor or a fugitive from jail or prison. The documented, excessive percentage of deaths to blacks and hispanics from "police intervention" is a festering sore in American society. Numerous groups are aroused by the situation and will force some sort of controls nationwide on the use of deadly force by police. The changing climate surrounding civilian use of deadly force is dramatic and worrisome. At present, retreat carried to the extreme is the prudent legal course for the civilian victim of attack to take. Deadly force may be prudently used only when faced with immediate, fatal attack. Ethical considerations do not, in this instance, mesh with the law as it seems to be diverging from the traditional common law concepts of self-defense and sanctuary in the home. The defence of dependents is an ethical imperative that may run counter to man-made laws. Ethical considerations must be given precedence especially since the history of the United States Supreme Court decisions clearly demonstrate that law and morality are not necessarily related

AB  - "Despite significant legal reforms in recent years, the chances of a migrant domestic worker (MDW) having all her human rights respected and protected in Jordan are slim, if non-existent. Domestic Plight records systemic and systematic abuses, in some cases amounting to forced labor, experienced by some of the 70,000 Indonesian, Sri Lankan, and Filipina MDWs in Jordan. Abuses included beatings, forced confinement around the clock, passport confiscation, and forcing MDWs to work more than 16 hours a day, seven days a week, without full pay. MDWs who escaped or tried to complain about abuse found little shelter and agencies forcibly returned them to abusive employers. Jordanian officials provided little help, including prosecutors, who rarely applied Jordan's anti-trafficking law to MDWs. The report traces abuse to a recruitment system in which employers and recruitment agencies disempower workers through deceit, debt, and blocking information about rights and means of redress; and a work environment that isolates the worker and engenders dependency on employers and recruitment agencies under laws that penalize escape. Jordanian law contains provisions, such as allowing confinement and imposing fines for residency violations, which contribute to abuse. The Convention Concerning Decent Work for Domestic Workers, which the International Labour Organization adopted in June 2011 with Jordan's support, could change that. Human Rights Watch calls on Jordan to promptly ratify and implement the convention by changing laws and practices that restrict MDWs freedom of movement, such as clauses sanctioning their confinement in the house, and blocking them from returning home unless they pay fines. Labor inspectors should investigate and fine employers who violate Jordan's labor code and prosecutors should more forcefully pursue cases of forced labor for exploitation."--P. [4] of cover

AB  - This article concerns the possibilities for developing a public folklore practice concerned with social transformation. Using basketry as an extended metaphor for the complexity of the artistic process and the ways folklorists and artists can collaborate and interact, the article is divided into two sections. In the first, several examples are offered from the author's fieldwork with immigrants, prisoners, and internal migrants, discussing the social functions that basket weaving serves in various communities. The second section outlines the different types of social change that the arts can bring about through collaborative efforts, from individuals and small communities to society at large

AB  - Liebknecht, Wilhelm (v��l�_�h� lm l�"p�_�k�Tn� kht), 1826�_"1900, German socialist leader and journalist. His participation in the revolution in Germany in 1848�_"49 forced him into exile, and he lived in England until 1862. While there he became associated with Karl Marx. Although greatly influenced by Marx, he disagreed with him on many fundamental principles of socialism. Upon his return to Germany, Liebknecht initially joined the socialist group founded by Ferdinand Lassalle. Shortly afterward he broke with the Lassalleans because of doctrinal differences, and in 1869 with his disciple August Bebel, he formed the Social Democratic Labor party. For several years the two groups conflicted, but in 1875 they merged as the Socialist Labor party. As a member of the North German Reichstag, Liebknecht, a confirmed pacifist, voted against extending war credits for the Franco-Prussian War (1870�_"71). He incurred the enmity of Otto von Bismarck, was convicted of treason, and with Bebel spent two years in prison (1872�_"74). Elected to the Reichstag in 1874, he was a member at his death. He wrote many books on historical and social topics and edited several socialist newspapers.

AB  - In mid-nineteenth and early-twentieth century visual and textual investigations of immigration in New York City, architecture was repeatedly invoked to structure, narrate, or otherwise inform the discourse of immigration. The space of immigration as well as the representation of that space was instrumental in creating a manner of looking at both the immigrant and at the nation. Responding to the swelling population and the changing ethnic make-up of the nation, the popular press sought ways of picturing nation, authority, and institutional control. The press frequently relied on architecture to articulate these issues. The architecture of Castle Garden and Ellis Island, together with the portrayal of that architecture, played important roles in holding cultural memory and framing cultural observations. Architecture acted as a site, a place holder, of cultural values and hierarchies. The first half of this dissertation examines the representation of immigration processing and architecture at Castle Garden, the immigration depot in operation from 1855 to 1890, located in the southwest corner of Manhattan. The second portion of the study concerns immigration at Ellis Island, which operated from 1892 until 1924. Chapter One explores the repeated invocation in the popular press of an event from Castle Garden's earlier incarnation as an upper-class theater: the Swedish soprano Jenny Lind's American debut in 1850. The second chapter considers a painting by Charles Ulrich of an immigrant woman nursing her baby at Castle Garden and situates the painting within contemporary discourses on motherhood and eugenics. Turning to Ellis Island, Chapter Three investigates the changes between the first immigration station of Romanesque design, built between 1890 and 1892, and its French Renaissance-style replacement, built between 1897 and 1900. The final chapter considers Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney's exhibition Immigrants in America , of 1915-1916. Portions of the exhibition, a collaboration between Whitney and the Americanization movement, were originally shown at the Whitney Studio and were later exhibited at and donated to Ellis Island

AB  - The central question asked in this study is "how well do refugee youth integrate into Canadian society?" The study examines the experiences of 91 refugee youth who arrived in Alberta between 1992 and 1997, focusing on their subjective experiences of integration, their educational performance, and their occupational aspirations. To provide context for this study, research literatures on integration, immigration, race and ethnic relations, the sociology of education, and citizenship, broadly defined, are discussed. Taken together, they provide a fuller understanding of the complex process of integration of refugee youth into Canadian society. This study presents a number of unique and sometimes unexpected findings. First, in terms of their subjective assessments of integration, refugee youth appear to be more integrated than the relevant literature suggests. For example, three-quarters of refugee youth state that they feel like "real" Canadians. Even so, just over 70% of refugee youth indicate that keeping their heritage culture is important to them, suggesting that their integration is best understood within a multiculturalism framework. Second, the majority of refugee youth are relatively successful in the Canadian education system. Despite the fact that 40% of refugee youth were placed in grades too low for their age when they arrived in Canada, most were able to "catch up" within a short time. Furthermore, over half of refugee youth were on-track for post-secondary education, should they choose to go. Third, the occupational aspirations of refugee youth are comparable to those of Canadian-born youth, suggesting that, in this sense, integration has also occurred. A number of the factors (e.g., family socioeconomic status) typically found to influence educational success and occupational aspirations among Canadian-born youth appear to be of less importance for refugee youth. Furthermore, the traumatic experiences of being a refugee (e.g., having spent time in a refugee camp) do not have as large an effect as we might expect. However, the study does show that Yugoslavian refugee youth generally perform better in the education system than do youth from other countries

AB  - Examines the education experiences of refugee youth in Canada. Used data obtained from a random sample of 91 refugee youths (aged 15-21 yrs), plus data from 123 of their parents. The purpose of this study is to identify the factors influencing their educational success. The study finds that the majority of refugee youth are doing well in the education system, with about 50% expecting to complete high school and to continue to post-secondary education. The remaining 30% are experiencing some difficulty finishing high school and about 20% do not expect to finish their secondary education. Ethnicity, refugee camp experience, appropriate grade placement on arrival, parents' health, urban residence, and number of months in Canada are correlated with academic performance.

Over the ten years, a research team at the University of Hull has undertaken four separate but linked projects investigating the working and living conditions of migrant workers in the UK. Those studies drew on the experiences of a broad range of service providers all of whom had regular interaction with vulnerable workers or their advocates, together with the testimonies of several hundred migrant workers who had themselves experienced or witnessed employment exploitation in gangmaster UK. The article discusses: labour market deregulation; worker exploitation in the temporary labour sector; undocumented migrant workers; and limited enforcement of labour standards. The author concluded that the findings are an indictment of British government indifference to the exploitation of the migrant workforce

AB  - Due to the tragic events in the countries of the Great Lakes region during the 1990s, more than one million refugees have sought a safe haven in Tanzania. Increasing numbers among these, estimated to be in the tens of thousands, resist going to one of the refugee camps and head for Dar es Salaam instead, even if it means foregoing any material assistance from humanitarian agencies and legal residence status from the national authorities in the country of asylum. Living scattered across the Tanzanian metropolis, these forced migrants show their resilience under adverse circumstances by coping with a new language, economic challenges and unfamiliar social environment. In this process, they rely heavily on their personal social networks, members of which provide them with financial and material assistance as well as emotional support in the form of friendship, advice and companionship. This process of rebuilding their shattered social worlds is analyzed in terms of the gender, nationality and age group of the refugees. The central thesis is that there is no essential refugee experience, and that the coping strategies of refugees are embedded in the social, cultural, economic, political and historical background of the social groups, be they gender, nationality or age groups, that the individual refugees are member of. The principle methodological tool applied to the analysis of the data collected during fieldwork sessions in 2000, 2001 and 2002, is social network analysis. Its findings are contextualized qualitatively by the accounts, life histories and interviews with informants of Congolese, Burundese, Rwandese and Tanzanian origin. Social network analysis is proposed as the tool to situate individual persons' agency and interactions at the micro-level within the structures and infrastructures (including events at the regional, national and international level) constituting the macro-framework

AB  - Discusses what happens to families (FMs) in refugee camps to discern common behaviors that reflect how FMs in crisis cope. An overview of the literature on FMs is offered in the context of the premigration period and the camp experience. The social organization and structural elements of the FM are analyzed, focusing on the external conditions that affect them. The FM is viewed as experiencing a major power shift from internal to external control over future life decisions. Disruptions that occur to FM may intensify due to continued and/or heightened loss of autonomy and control in the camp. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - My dissertation examines the tropes of travel and mobility in selected nineteenth-century African American women's narratives, exploring the ways in which travel constitutes a signifier of black female subjectivity. It considers how the representation of travel offers ways for us to rethink dominant notions both of black female identity and of travel itself. It further posits that African-American women writers deploy travel not only to counter the historical and social forces that seek to categorize them as "natives" moored in time and place, but also to formulate a mobile identity that crosses racial, cultural, and national boundaries. In considering the spaces of articulations in which black women can tell a free, mobile, mobilizing story, I examine how Harriet Jacobs, Nancy Prince, Frances Harper, and Anna Julia Cooper move out of the confining literary structures that do not adequately map the complex discontinuities of lives. For these African-American women writers, travel is a multivalent topos that speaks to their negotiation of both textual and extra-textual spaces. My study begins with an overview of the way forms of travel produced by Western, white, male traditions have allocated black women to restrictive spaces. I then examine travel narratives of African-American women, exploring how they rechart travel and identity in relation to the poles of home/away, roots/routes, self/other, black/white, and native/traveler. Chapter Two explores Jacobs's configuration of travel in relation to the genesis and composition of Incidents , the legal apparatus of the Fugitive Slave Law, and the white-authored travel writings describing the scenes of southern slavery. Chapter Three examines how Prince's Life and Travels retropes the slave's liminal passage in the domestic and international journeys of the free black woman. I analyze how Prince's activist travels to Jamaica and Europe function as figurations of a "laboring mobility" that allow her to participate in a "black Atlantic" network of resistance. Chapter Four examines how the turn-of-the-century writings of Cooper and Harper appropriate and revise white female "conduct books of travel" as a means to reconceptualize black female mobility and manners in ways that counter the racist, socio-political discourse of Jim Crow segregation laws

While provide a game-theoretic perspective on strategic interactions between Macedonia and NATO. We use narrative accounts of the crisis to eliminate many configurations of payoffs. Among those remaining, the theory of moves isolates one game that can satisfy the necessary conditions for credible threats: the prisoners' dilemma. Credible threats of border closings in a prisoners' dilemma alter donor incentives and lead to international sharing of asylum burdens in repeated play.

AB  - The phenomenon of migrant workers finding domestic and care work in the homes and institutions of countries wealthier than their own uncovers much about social change in the twenty-first century.�The transnational movement of mainly women into care and domestic work, as well as nurses, pharmacists and doctors into health care saves social expenditure costs while intensifying the lack of care resources in the countries of origin of those migrant workers. This article considers the relationship between migration and care on three levels: the personal relations of migration and domestic and care work; state policies, regulations and discourses; and the transnational and global movement of labour. The article first looks at the key themes, focusing on exploitation and agency, the complexity of care relations within global care chains, and the diversity of the migrant care workforce. It then looks at several methodological and theoretical frameworks of migration and care today and considers cross-national and historical comparative methods. The third section of the article explores the research and policy challenges in this area

AB  - The popular imagination of marriage migration has been influenced by stories of marriage of convenience, of forced marriage, trafficking and of so-called mail-order brides. This book presents a uniquely global view of an expanding field that challenges these and other stereotypes of cross-border marriage. Research on cross-border marriage migration is an expanding field, but to date has been studied from close regional or community specific perspectives. Research has tended to focus on either marriage within settled, migrant communities or on marriages between citizens and migrants with different cultural and ethnic heritage. By drawing on a broad range of literature relating to cross-border marriage migration, this book aims to bridge the conceptual gap between these two streams of research and to place studies of cross-border marriage in a global context. Throughout, the book emphasises the role of policy in shaping and 'gendering' marriage migration and highlights how migrants use their personal agency to negotiate social and gender roles through marriage across borders. Key themes in the book are role of individual agency in negotiating marriage and migration and the experience of symbolic and actual violence faced by marriage migrants

Now the hundreds of Kurds who left Ali Rash and other mountain villages are living in sweltering refugee camp tents. They are at the center of questions about whether Iraq is willing or able to defend its borders with Iran -- which has repeatedly breached the frontier in recent months.

AB  - This paper argues that immigration detention results in immigration detainees being treated as anomalies within the liberal, democratic state - not only within detention centres but also post&#8208 ;release. Given that most released detainees remain destitute and without entitlement or resolution of their immigration cases, many report feelings of being continuously 'detained' even after release. This paper addresses a gap in the literature on the ongoing experience of released detainees. The authors draw on qualitative interview data from former detainees as a first step towards a better understanding of the issues. We discuss wider questions of why the detention regime fails to prepare detainees for release as well as how this omission can undermine their capacity to lead productive and socially meaningful lives. This paper argues that the lack of concern for the well-being of former immigration detainees has considerable and far&#8208 ;reaching implications for the former detainees and their communities. Finally, we link the situation of former detainees and their liminal states of exception, to discourses of slavery and civil death. Copyright -� 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This thesis seeks to explore the benefits and the challenges of providing higher education in protracted refugee situations through the use of a case study on the refugee camps on the Thai-Burma border. The study relies on data obtained through qualitative research, including a review of secondary sources, as well as in-depth interviews conducted during field research on the Thai-Burma border. Findings indicate that the community-based organization emphasis on higher education in the form of post-ten programs has the positive effect of providing refugees with greater knowledge and essential skills that are very much needed within the refugee communities. However, it also has built-in liabilities, as basic education has become neglected. This thesis concludes that an unbalanced emphasis on either basic education or higher education education will have negative outcomes for refugee populations due to the lack of integration of educational program delivery

AB  - This dissertation examines the local construction of law on the street regarding immigrants. Local agencies play a key role in immigration enforcement and in providing services to immigrants. They are increasingly the face of the state to immigrants, a face that varies across localities and regions and ranges from friendly to hostile. In the context of climate change, immigration to the United States is likely to increase and place greater pressure on public services in many areas. While much attention has been focused on punitive responses to immigration, this dissertation's basic thesis is that many local government agencies have adopted surprisingly welcoming policies toward immigrants. The dissertation develops this thesis in three phases. First, it develops the concept of welcomeness of public agencies toward immigrants. Welcoming policies are policies and practices that are designed to improve interactions between local administrative agencies and immigrants, encourage immigrants to settle in the community and protect undocumented immigrants from being victimized or harassed. Second, the dissertation develops a framework for measuring the degree of welcomeness of particular agencies. Third, it examines how widely local agencies are welcoming (or unwelcoming) to immigrants and what are the conditions that shape the degree of welcomeness. Drawing on nationwide surveys of local police departments and public libraries and interviews with department leaders and frontline employees, the dissertation shows that many agencies have consciously and deliberately developed policies and practices that are intended to develop positive relationships between the agency and immigrants, encourage immigrants' use of the agency and help immigrants integrate into the community. While libraries, as a service agency, might be expected to emphasize equality of service, police departments' mission is regulatory and they might be expected to adopt a more punitive (and thus less welcoming) orientation. The evidence that welcoming policies are widespread in both settings suggests that welcomeness is not confined to the service context. The dissertation shows that in both settings professionals are pulled between political pressures that are often hostile to immigrants and professional norms favoring equal service to all in the community. How much a local agency is welcoming or unwelcoming depends on the balance between these opposing forces. Professional norms help organizations resist political pressures. The dissertation suggests that welcoming policies and practices are likely to gain increased significance as climate change contributes to increasing immigration

AB  - This chapter presents a theoretical framework for practitioners consulting in parts of the international arena where the effects of war have created layers of trauma for children and their families. Understanding the variables of war trauma is essential to the assessment and deployment of mental health services that support personal safety and emotional survival. This perspective provides a direction for intervention and treatment that responds to the multiple stresses and traumatic experiences of children in war zones. As discussed in more detail below, the interplay among pre-war factors -- a child's psychosocial/developmental stage in particular, but also a family's functioning and a community's networks -- must be determined. These factors interact with the crisis of war, the world response, and the child's perceptions and feelings, resulting in the outcomes of either trauma or healthy adaptation. This chapter discusses the case of a displaced family from Bosnia-Herzegovina, living in a collective community (refugee camp) in Croatia during the war in the former Yugoslavia after the Serbian invasion of their community. The case illustrates the special tasks for mental health professionals when symptoms of PTSD, aggressive behavior, loss of parental control, and chronic mourning are manifested by victims of war. A strengths-based, culturally competent, total-community approach supports a range of interventions in such a situation. The chapter describes the use of short-term family and grief work, and of the concepts of trauma, adaptation, resilience, and coping to understand each child's response. Finally, selected dilemmas for the consultant, including the use of self in an international context, are presented. [Text, pp. 448-449]

AB  - Women dwelling on Ohio farms during the Great Depression had access to three distinct landscapes: the crisis landscape produced by the disintegrating national economy, the physical landscape encompassing the farmhouse, farmstead, fields and community, and the spiritual landscape comprised of individual mental and emotional qualities. The crisis landscape was characterized by lack of money, isolation and inferior transportation, education and healthcare facilities. The physical landscape of the family farm, without electricity and indoor plumbing, was a place of few conveniences and unrelenting labor. Women's spiritual landscape of personal values and purpose was shaped by their individual attributes and strengths. In this subsistence economy, women's contributions were crucial to the family's survival, and traditional gender roles eroded as they participated in all sectors of the farm enterprise. They maintained a lifestyle of frugality, saving and doing without, and substituting their labor for necessary goods and services. In addition to the care of chickens and gardens, farm women, with the help of children, processed most of the family's food. Besides producing foodstuffs and other goods essential to the family's survival, they established cottage industries that generated cash for goods they could not produce at home. Women sometimes took off-farm jobs such as housecleaning, peddling farm produce, wallpapering and providing care for others outside the family. They assumed authority over their earned income and used the cash derived from their various enterprises mainly for family needs. Women modified farm spaces as they conducted necessary daily activities, organizing and reorganizing spaces to fit their needs. Their skills, attitudes and values determined their success during the hard times. Though shared activities, such as threshing and butchering, brought people together, farm families dwelt in relative isolation. Women, in particular, were confined to the farm by the unrelenting labor required to care for the farm family. While social activities were limited because of inadequate clothing and lack of transportation, the farm remained a place of refuge, providing meaningful work and family cohesion. Farm women strengthened the family structure with their willingness to accept hardship and hard labor, and their desire to maintain family independence

AB  - ABSTRACT IN ENGLISH: In 2002, Stephen Frears directed Dirty Pretty Things - one of the few mainstream fictional films to highlight the effects of exile, the complexities of refugee status, and the trials of migrant labour in the 'Western' world. Thus far, the minimal number of 'refugee' films produced is mirrored by the minimal discussion about those films (or their absence). This essay examines Frears's film with a critical lens that incorporates both theoretical evaluations and aesthetic choices. For instance: how do media representations of refugees and migrants relegate the signification of refugee-ism to visceral, silent, repetitiv,e and subordinated signifiers? Additionally, this essay narrows its interest upon Senay, the female lead of Dirty Pretty Things, to open up a dialogue about fragmented body: missing hands/hyperbolized eyes. Drawing on knowledge of the theoretical implications of those choices, this paper addresses refugees and illegal migrants in film with the hope of initiating conversation about an otherwise relatively silent and untouched cinematic subgenre. // ABSTRACT IN FRENCH: En 2002, Stephen Frears r+�alisa Dirty Pretty Things - un des rares films de fiction grand public +� mettre en exergue les contrecoups de l'exil, les complexit+�s li+�es au statut de r+�fugi+� et les tribulations du travailleur immigr+� dans le monde " occidental ". Jusqu'ici, le nombre infime de films r+�alis+�s sur le th+�me des " r+�fugi+�s " est refl+�t+� par le peu de d+�bats sur ces films (ou sur leur absence). Cet essai examine le film de Frears avec un oeil critique qui int+�gre aussi bien des +�valuations th+�oriques que des consid+�rations esth+�tiques. Par exemple: comment les repr+�sentations des r+�fugi+�s et des immigrants dans les m+�dias rel+�guent-elles le sens du statut de r+�fugi+� +� des signifiants visc+�raux, muets, r+�p+�titifs et subordonn+�s? De plus, cet essai porte un int+�r+�t particulier +� Senay, l'actrice principale de Dirty Pretty Things, dans le but de lancer un d+�bat sur la fragmentation du corps : les mains absentes/l'hyperbolique des yeux. S'appuyant sur la connaissance des significations th+�oriques de ces choix, cet article traite du th+�me des r+�fugi+�s et des migrants ill+�gaux dans les films, dans l'espoir de d+�clencher un d+�bat sur un sous-genre cin+�matographique relativement confin+� au silence et tr+�s peu abord+�.

AB  - Because of the practices of modern governments, the individual must be a citizen of a state or otherwise be reduced to a liminal status, deprived of human rights. Often, national governments in Europe deal with those who are to be excluded from citizenship in an ad hoc and covert manner, frequently incarcerating people for months before deporting them at the same time as trying to keep the issue out of the public eye. However, theatrical performance can reveal what has been kept invisible by national governments and raise uncomfortable questions about prevailing nationalist ideologies. In this article, I will focus on the Neue Slowenische Kunst (NSK) and the Janez Janza projects that have exposed the role of citizenship practices which jeopardize the migrant and the stateless. In a subversive performative gesture, the NSK has formed its own state, created diplomatic embassies and issued their own passports. In an equally subversive act, three Slovenian-based artists legally changed their names to Janez Janza and turned their national identity cards into works of art, calling attention to the control that nation-states maintain over personal identities. These artists ironize nationalist ideologies and orientalist tendencies by using a tactic of over-identification and in doing so they expose some of the inadequacies in policies concerning citizenship.

AB  - This article presents information regarding international migration in Southern Africa. The migration of workers in response to political and economic pressures is no new thing in Southern Africa. The origins of the modem system of migrant labor go back to the mineral discoveries in the latter half of the nineteenth century. The closed compounds in Kimberley built to prevent illicit diamond buying, and the compounds erected on the Witwatersrand to house indentured Chinese brought in to mine gold, set the pattern for the decades that followed. Both the Native Recruiting Corporation and the Witwatersrand Native Labor Association were established by the Transvaal Chamber of Mines before the First World War. Recruiting was never confined to the borders of South Africa, before the turn of the century some 60 percent of the men working on the Witwatersrand gold mines came from Mozambique. And in the same decade Lesotho had thirty thousand men working on the South African mines and railways. Large numbers have also come from there for many years to work on the farms, particularly in the Orange Free State

AB  - Contemporary research on migration, particularly those studies drawing upon theories of transnationalism, demonstrates the ways in which social relations are stretched across spaces, allowing individuals to disrupt boundaries and create identities of belonging to more than one place. This research focuses on the disruption of state boundaries through migration and identity construction. In this paper we utilize elements of transnational theory and stories of First Nations migrants to explore the ways that First Nations urbanization also disrupts boundaries. Colonial perspectives and practices that confined First Nations cultural practices and identities within the physical boundaries of reserves and defined all other spaces as settler spaces created a framework for the construction of the contemporary Canadian nation-state. We present the results of eighteen in-depth interviews conducted with urban First Nations migrants. The interviews focused on understanding how migration to cities shapes relationships to the land (an important element of indigenous identity), the challenges cities present to maintaining connections to the land, and the strategies First Nations migrants use to preserve those connections. By resisting the assignment of First Nations cultures and identities to reserves, First Nations migration to cities challenges the identity of the modern state by disrupting its internal borders and boundaries.

AB  - This article provides an overview of the role faith-based organizations (FBOs) play in the politics of asylum in Australia. I suggest that an ethics of hospitality provides a useful way for theorizing the activities of Australian FBOs and their relationship with the Australian government. FBOs have used concepts and practices consistent with faith-based hospitality to challenge public discourses, provide services to asylum seekers that ameliorate the harsh effects of government immigration policies and eventually contribute to changes in those policies. Further, the faith-based hospitality that underpins the work of FBOs in the asylum sector has played a significant role in the substantial shifts in Australian government asylum policy in recent times, in particular the decision to expand the government's community detention programme. These changes provide unique opportunities for FBOs, yet come with significant risks and challenges regarding their ongoing engagement in asylum politics and the small but significant progress that has been made towards a more humane and compassionate asylum policy in Australia.

AB  - Contrary to stereotypes of proto-Athapaskan culture as simplistic and archaic, evidence points to a sophisticated web of late prehistoric Asian-Athapaskan interactions. A holistic assessment of Athapaskan migrations in the context of the transpacific Dene-Yeneseian phylum (the largest, fastest pedestrian language spread on earth) sees Athapaskan-Asian connections (in language, technology, DNA, social organization, etc.) as reflecting profound large-scale cultural-historical processes whose implications have yet to be grasped. Current understanding is that Athapaskans slowly migrated south in response to volcanic eruptions in southwest Yukon Territory after circa 200 and 800 CE. Yet problems remain, notably the archaeological invisibility of migrants on their long trek southward, and their possession of Asiatic strong complex bows which were not introduced to Northern Athapaskan territory until after these two eruptions. Linguistics, archaeology, biology, and data from ethnographic archery collections suggest Athapaskans carried sinew-backed bows to California and the Southwest. Both Apacheans and Northern Athapaskans uniquely possessed both 'Arctic'- and 'Plains'- style sinew-backed bows. Migration with retention (not diffusion through existing populations) is the best explanation. The Athapaskan expansion was faster than generally supposed, quite similar to the contemporaneous Punuk/Thule Neo-Eskimo expansion in the far north. Such a model helps to explain archaeological invisibility in the intervening space, as the impact made by the migrants was small.

AB  - Contrary to stereotypes of proto-Athapaskan culture as simplistic and archaic, evidence points to a sophisticated web of late prehistoric Asian-Athapaskan interactions. A holistic assessment of Athapaskan migrations in the context of the transpacific Dene-Yeneseian phylum (the largest, fastest pedestrian language spread on earth) sees Athapaskan-Asian connections (in language, technology, DNA, social organization, etc.) as reflecting profound large-scale cultural-historical processes whose implications have yet to be grasped. Current understanding is that Athapaskans slowly migrated south in response to volcanic eruptions in southwest Yukon Territory after circa 200 and 800 CE. Yet problems remain, notably the archaeological invisibility of migrants on their long trek southward, and their possession of Asiatic strong complex bows which were not introduced to Northern Athapaskan territory until after these two eruptions. Linguistics, archaeology, biology, and data from ethnographic archery collections suggest Athapaskans carried sinew-backed bows to California and the Southwest. Both Apacheans and Northern Athapaskans uniquely possessed both �_~Arctic�_T- and �_~Plains�_T- style sinew-backed bows. Migration with retention (not diffusion through existing populations) is the best explanation. The Athapaskan expansion was faster than generally supposed, quite similar to the contemporaneous Punuk/Thule Neo-Eskimo expansion in the far north. Such a model helps to explain archaeological invisibility in the intervening space, as the impact made by the migrants was small.

AB  - Saharawi refugees from Western Sahara have been leading a social revolution from the desert refugee camps in Algeria, where they have been living since the partial annexation of Western Sahara by Morocco in 1975. The households of these refugees have changed enormously over three decades of exile and revolution. This study, which draws on two years of ethnographic fieldwork with Saharawi refugees (2007-2009), analyses households across the pre-exile and revolutionary periods to highlight the changed and changing nature of 'domaining', or the production of public and private domains, in the revolutionary period. The article explores the role of households in different articulations of 'domaining' and in producing persons with different kinds of social dispositions, those suited, more or less, to the revolution, or its once self-proclaimed foe, the 'tribe' (qabila)

AB  - Ghanaian women seeking paid work have long migrated from the north to Accra, in the south. Many work as poorly compensated porters and experience many difficulties, yet, by their own accounts, some adjust well to their new circumstances, despite their unfavorable situation. The aim of this study is to take a salutogenic perspective to illuminate the resources that help them cope. The retention is to develop practical guidelines for promoting health among all female porters in Accra. The framework of the study was the salutogenic model, with a focus on the role that resources play in helping people cope with stress. A phenomenological method that included interviews and observations was used. The results of the study indicate that religiosity is an important resource for good adjustment, but that additional resources, acquired after migration, were key: achieving financial stability and developing and cultivating socially supportive relationships. The ability to take a positive perspective and engage in active, adaptive coping protects against stress.

AB  - This report sets out the findings of a review of literature on research and statistics on equality in Wales, defined by various Acts of Parliament as: race; gender; disability; age; sexual orientation; and religion. The review was commissioned by the Equality and Human Rights Commission in December 2007 and covers literature which related specifically to Wales only. It included academic, government and third sector research published between 2000 and October 2008 and focused mainly on all-Wales rather than local studies. Findings revealed that Wales is increasingly diverse. Approximately 2% of the population is from an ethnic minority group, amongst whom 29% is of mixed origin. There are very roughly 10,000 refugees and 2,500 asylum seekers in Wales, 55,000 non-UK born workers, and between 1,400 and 2,000 Gypsy Travellers. Women marginally outnumber men overall. By 2026, 29% of the population is expected to be over 60 years old. Disability and limiting long-term ill health affect approximately 27% of the adult population and 5% of the child population. One in five of the population has no religious faith. Amongst believers, Christians are by far the largest group, followed by Muslims. There are no data on sexual orientation. Almost 30% of the population have some knowledge of the Welsh language

AB  - Chinese authorities said Tuesday that they had taken 718 people into custody in connection with last month's ethnic riots in the western region of Xinjiang, but an official with an ethnic Uighur exile group said the true number was far higher. The new report, released by the state-run Xinhua news agency, left it unclear whether the 718 detainees represented the total of suspects captured since the July 5 unrest, or were in addition to previous arrests and detentions. The government had previously said that more than 1,500 people had been detained after the riots.

AB  - BACKGROUND: QuantiFERONTB Gold (QFT) is a promising blood test for tuberculosis infection but with few data so far from immigrant screening. The aim of this study was to compare results of QFT and tuberculin skin test (TST) among newly arrived asylum seekers in Norway and to assess the role of QFT in routine diagnostic screening for latent tuberculosis infection METHODS: The 1000 asylum seekers (age > or = 18 years) enrolled in the study were voluntarily recruited from 2813 consecutive asylum seekers arriving at the national reception centre from September 2005 to June 2006. Participation included a QFT test and a questionnaire in addition to the mandatory TST and chest X-ray RESULTS: Among 912 asylum seekers with valid test results, 29% (264) had a positive QFT test whereas 50% (460) tested positive with TST (indurations > or = 6 mm), indicating a high proportion of latent infection within this group. Among the TST positive participants 50% were QFT negative, whereas 7% of the TST negative participants were QFT positive. There was a significant association between increase in size of TST result and the likelihood of being QFT positive. Agreement between the tests was 71-79% depending on the chosen TST cut-off and it was higher for non-vaccinated individuals CONCLUSION: By using QFT in routine screening, further follow-up could be avoided in 43% of the asylum seekers who would have been referred if based only on a positive TST (> or = 6 mm). The proportion of individuals referred will be the same whether QFT replaces TST or is used as a supplement to confirm a positive TST, but the number tested will vary greatly. All three screening approaches would identify the same proportion (88-89%) of asylum seekers with a positive QFT and/or a TST > or = 15 mm, but different groups will be missed

AB  - South Korean freelance photojournalist Seok Jae-hyun, was released from Wei Fang prison in China today after serving fourteen months of a two-year sentence for his conviction on charges of "trafficking in persons." His wife, Kang Hye-won and friend and fellow photojournalist Nayan Sthankiya were waiting for him at the airport in Qingdao, China, as police delivered Seok to the tarmac next to his departing flight back to Inch'on, South Korea. The Chinese were very particular about not allowing the media to see Seok on Chinese soil. When the police moved him onto the tarmac and everyone started taking pictures, they promptly put him back into the car until the area was cleared. Chinese police arrested Seok, along with around eighty North Korean refugees, on January 18, 2003, in the port city of Yantai, opposite the Korean peninsula. Seok didn't know he was going to be released until 10 in the morning when Kang came to the prison with his plane ticket and clothes for the return trip. She saw him briefly and then wasn't allowed to see him again until he stepped on the plane

AB  - BACKGROUND: HIV-infected refugees resettled in the United States face many challenges. Longitudinal data regarding HIV-specific outcomes in this population are limited METHODS: We reviewed charts of 51 HIV-infected sub-Saharan African refugees matched to 102 nonrefugees. Outcomes analyzed included CD4 counts, viral loads (VLs), antiretroviral treatment (ART) use, appointment adherence, opportunistic infections, and resistance mutations RESULTS: The ART initiation was similar. Appointment adherence was similar in year 1, but refugees were significantly less adherent beyond year 3. Refugees and nonrefugees spent similar amounts of time in care suppressed (83% vs 80%, P = .93). Refugees had higher odds of viremia following undetectable VL (OR 2.3, P < .05) DISCUSSION: Initially, sub-Saharan African HIV-infected refugees have comparable appointment adherence, ART use, and VL suppression to nonrefugees. Overtime refugees were less adherent to appointments and more likely to have postsuppression viremia. The support services provided to refugees early in care may be important for retention in care and treatment success

AB  - While there is a severe shortage of accessible housing in London, which limits the potential of disabled people to move into suitable accommodation, this situation is compounded by the limited information held by social housing landlords. This article describes how the London Accessible Housing Register (LAHR) aims to capture and disseminate information about the accessibility of social housing, with a view to enabling choice based lettings for disabled people. The scheme was initiated with the launch of a document to introduce a framework for the LAHR, including a set of LAHR categories that are used to indicate the accessibility of homes. All London boroughs that have housing stock are encouraged to assess their housing in line with the LAHR, the benefits of which are to: provide more inclusive services and equal opportunities; free up staff time to support disabled applicants; make accessible properties available to those that need them; and ensure that adapted homes are re-let to people that need that particular adaption. This document was produced taking into account lessons learned from pilot authorities, and includes information on how to assess a small number of properties and use this information to assign LAHR categories

AB  - The following excerpts were taken from the 'life history' of Um Jabr Wishah, one of seven 'life histories' collected as part of an oral history project, as yet unpublished, of seven women living in various parts of the Gaza Strip who were old enough to have clear memories of the pre-1948 period. The women were selected on the basis of some previous knowledge of them and their stated willingness to take part in the project. The 'histories,' collected over the last six months of 2001, range from 25,000 to 40,000 words and cover the narrators' everyday life and experiences through the successive wars and disruptions as well as their thoughts about the future. Each woman was interviewed a number of times, with the tape of each interview transcribed and translated before the following interview. The memories were set down exactly as they were told; the only 'editing' consists of integrating details or elaborations supplied during subsequent interviews at the appropriate chronological place. The life histories were collected by Barbara Bill, an Australian who worked with the Women's Empowerment Project of the Gaza Community Mental Health Program starting from 1996, and Ghada Ageel, a refugee from a Gaza camp now working on her Ph.D. in Middle Eastern politics at the University of Exeter in England. Um Jabr, who was in her early 70s at the time of the interviews, has been living in the al-Bureij refugee camp since 1950. Future issues of JPS will carry excerpts from Um Jabr's story regarding the 1948 war and about organizing prison visits in the 1980s and 1990s

AB  - These excerpts are from the 36,000-word 'life history' of Um Jabr Wishah, who lives in the al-Bureij refugee camp in the Gaza Strip; excerpts dealing with life in her village before 1948 appeared in JPS 138 (winter 2006). A future issue of JPS will carry Um Jabr's account of organizing prison visits in the 1980s and 1990s. Um Jabr describes what befell her family and fellow villagers during the 1948 war. Her account covers mainly the period between the conquest of her village, Bayt 'Affa, during the Israeli army's July offensive, and her family's settlement in al-Bureij refugee camp outside Gaza City in 1950. Bayt 'Affa, located between al-Majdal and Faluja, was within the area allotted by the UN partition plan to the Arabs but lay close to territory allotted to the Jews, notably the narrow corridor linking the coastal area to the north and the Negev area in the south (where some twenty-five mostly military Jewish settlements had been established, including twelve in one night about a year before the UN partition resolution). The Israeli July offensive and subsequent offensives against the Egyptian forces resulted in the conquest and annexation to Israel of the majority of the Gaza district's rich agricultural lands, including forty-five villages. Um Jabr's odyssey, compelled by the changing course of the fighting (typical of the experiences of tens of thousands of Palestinian refugees at the time) took her to one village after another. Um Jabr does not give dates, but from the evolution of the fighting it is clear that within the space of some three months, her family moved from Bayt 'Affa to Karatiyya to Faluja to Barbara to Hiribya. It was probably during the latter part of October, when Israel launched its all-all assault code-named Operation Yoav, that the family fled to the besieged Gaza City, which became part of the Egyptian-administered Gaza Strip after the armistices of 1949. Um Jabr's 'life history' is one of seven collected as part of an oral history project, as yet unpublished, of seven women living in various parts of the Gaza Strip who were old enough to have clear memories of the pre-1948 period. Each woman was interviewed a number of times, with the interviews being conducted in the second half of 2001; Um Jabr was in her early 70s at the time.

The current excerpts focus on Um Jabr's intense involvement in the prisoner issue that began when two of her sons were in Israeli jails. In particular, her activism took the form of organizing other women to visit prisoners from Arab countries who had no one to visit them on the twice monthly visits allowed. Um Jabr's 36,000-word 'life story' was one of seven collected as part of an oral history project, as yet unpublished, carried out by Barbara Bill, an Australian who since 1996 has worked with the Women's Empowerment Project of the Gaza Community Mental Health Program, and Ghada Ageel, a refugee from al-Bureij camp now earning her Ph.D. at the University of Exeter in England. The women who participated in the project were interviewed a number of times during the first half of 2001; after the tapes were transcribed, the memories were set down exactly as they were told, the only 'editing' being the integration of material from the various interviews into one 'life story.'

T1  - Witnesses to war: the war stories of women Vietnam veterans [dissertation]

KW  - eppi-reviewer
AB  - From 1962 to 1973 approximately 11,000 military women and an unknown number of civilian American women served in Vietnam during the war. Despite an ongoing fascination with the war, there has been little interest in the war stories of women veterans. Academic research in this area is shamefully lacking. This study was designed to focus attention on the war stories of women Vietnam veterans. It is motivated by the striking lack of resources or attention paid to the development of treatment models which can be helpful to women veterans who suffer with PTSD as a result of their involvement in the war. This study was designed to explore the potential of storytelling as a way to help women who were in Vietnam heal from trauma. A narrative research methodology was used to record the war stories of five women Vietnam veterans. The stories which are included in this dissertation are those of three military nurses, one Red Cross worker, and one other civilian woman who worked in an "in country" refugee camp. The stories, including the author's own, are told in each woman veteran's authentic voice. The women veterans' war stories serve as the centerpiece of this dissertation. Of equal interest to the researcher was the interactive process of story making and the relationship between the storyteller and the witness which resulted in a resonating gestalt. Storytelling is healing when told in an empathic environment. Healing is relational. Narrative research methodology is mutually empowering for both the researcher and subject. Each of the women spoke of her repeated attempts to tell her story which went unheard, ignored or distorted. The principle factor which contributes to the efficacy of the model explored in this research is the quality of the witnessing. [Author Abstract]

AB  - Witowt or Witold (v��t�_���ft,�_"��lt), Lithuanian Vytautas, 1350�_"1430, grand duke of Lithuania (1401�_"30). In 1382, Witowt, as well as his father, was imprisoned by Ladislaus Jagiello (see Ladislaus II, king of Poland), his cousin, in a dispute over territorial claims and the title of grand duke. Although his father died in prison, Witowt escaped to take refuge with the order of Teutonic Knights. The cousins were reconciled in 1384, and Witowt received from Jagiello, whom he recognized as grand duke of Lithuania, Russian territory as an appanage. After Jagiello became (1386) king of Poland, Witowt plotted to separate Lithuania from its union with Poland and to assume the title of grand duke. With the help of the Teutonic Knights and Vasily I, prince of Moscow, he secured recognition as master of Lithuania (1392); in 1401 Ladislaus granted Witowt the grand ducal title while remaining his suzerain as king of Poland. Witowt sought to reduce the Tatars of the Golden Horde to vassalage but was defeated by them in 1399. In 1410, at the battle of Tannenberg, Witowt and Ladislaus defeated the Teutonic Knights, who had been threatening Polish-Lithuanian independence.

AB  - The teaching legacy of Howard Zonana in forensic psychiatry has been in educating psychiatric fellows and law students to collaborate in advocacy on behalf of individuals whose problems exist at the intersection of the law and mental health. The author describes more than three decades of collaborative teaching with Dr. Zonana in Yale Law School legal clinics serving mental hospital patients, prisoners, children, and immigrants. In those clinics, law students and forensic psychiatry fellows have worked collaboratively in representing clinic clients and advocating for their legal and medical rights. The article reports three examples of this interdisciplinary collaboration: a project conducted at a state hospital shortly after the Supreme Court's decision in O'Connor v. Donaldson; a class action on behalf of individuals with developmental disabilities inappropriately subjected to long-term confinement in a state hospital; and an asylum case on behalf of a severely traumatized African woman fleeing persecution in her home country. The author concludes that Dr. Zonana's legacy reflects not only his contributions to medical and legal education, but also his profound commitment to effective and humane medical practice and to justice

AB  - A community of 50,000 people, Yakima has been hit hard with drugs. It has become a key heroin and cocaine trafficking center for the northwestern United States. Yakima's police chief states that the public safety system has collapsed and that the county's murder rate is the highest in Washington State. Felonies have soared by 82 percent over the last 5 years, and city narcotics arrests have more than doubled. The Drug Enforcement Agency estimates that $100 million worth of cocaine is funneled through the Yakima Valley each year. The cocaine originates in Colombia or Mexico, is brought across the U.S. border into California, and then transported to Yakima via the interstate highway system. A police patrol officer indicates that Yakima affords Hispanic drug distributors an ideal location; it is easy for them to mix in anonymously with the region's large population of migrant farm workers. An estimated strength of 100 police officers in Yakima is inadequate to deal with the number of drug dealers which is estimated at 500 to 1,000. Drug offenders have overloaded the court system and caused increased risk to prison inmates and staff. Yakima's leaders are at least trying to distract the community's youth from easy drug money available on the street by emphasizing sports involvement

AB  - The article focuses on legislative efforts to restore immigrants' rights. Although immigration is a national issue, not many members of the American public understand the intricacies of U.S. immigration law and policy and relatively few voters consider it a priority. However Immigration became a prominent political issue as both parties vied for the support of Hispanic and Asian voters. Only four years ago, the 104th Congress enacted massive reforms and overhauled virtually every aspect of the nation's immigration law. Many due process protections including judicial review were eliminated from the deportation process, and new grounds of deportation were established that retroactively subject long-term legal immigrants to mandatory detention and automatic deportation for offenses committed long ago. Several measures were enacted in the 105th Congress to lessen the punitive effects of the 1996 laws. Significant public benefits were restored for selected groups of immigrants and refugees, including food stamps, Medicaid, and Social Security

AB  - Resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to available antimalarial drugs is now thought to be spreading progressively throughout sub-Sahara Africa. In this study we measured the susceptibility of P. falciparum to chloroquine and pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine in vivo in Rwandan patients living in Kibumba refugee camp in Goma, Zaire. Of the 39 cases treated with chloroquine, only 8 (20.5%) showed sensitive or RI (delayed) response and 31 (79.5%) demonstrated resistance at RI (30.8%), RII (33.3%( and RIII (15.4%) levels. Of the 38 individuals receiving pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine, 13 (34.2%) showed sensitive or RI (delayed) responses, and 25 (65.%) showed resistance at RI (26.3%), RII (36.8%) and RIII (2.6%) levels. Both chloroquine and pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine reduced parasite counts by at least 75% in the majority of the patients within 2 d of treatment. A greater proportion of children with malnutrition showed a higher mean geometric parasite density and slower parasite clearance in vivo than those without malnutrition. Moreover, the frequency and degree of resistance were more pronounced in children with malnutrition. Moreover, the frequency and degree of resistance were more pronounced in children with malnutrition. The results suggest the existence of resistance to chloroquine and pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine. However, the drugs are still effective in significantly reducing parasitaemia and they can still be used as drugs of first and second choice in the region, even in the face of some degree of resistance

All except one presented with signs and symptoms suggestive of meningeal irritation; all but one responded to intravenous quinine and chloramphenicol or ampicillin. Two had recrudescence of malaria and responded to treatment with pyrimethamine-sulphadoxine (Fansidar). There were no sequelae seen. Meningococcal meningitis is uncommon but frequently fatal if it occurs in patients with falciparum malaria. Early diagnosis and treatment are urgent to decrease morbidity and mortality

AB  - Comments on the article by D. A. Roblyer (see record 2005-06699-003). Both the war in Iraq and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are conflicts in which the United States and the Israelis are using their superior air power to avoid the large number of casualties in the close confines of cities, towns, and refugee camps. In this article, some of the particular problems that arise in these types of apparently one-sided engagements are analyzed. There is often no moral restraint preventing the militants from using tactics that result in a good many casualties on people who fit the definition of civilians. Although the structure of militant conflicts make it difficult to avoid collateral casualties, there are also psychological processes that only exacerbate this problem. As conflict escalates, people are less likely to differentiate between people because their cognitive resources become depleted. In addition to distinguishing between militants and civilians, when conflict escalates, the military's lives are at greater risk and, therefore, they cannot devote the same amount of attention to the issue of civilian casualties. The decision environment in which the military acts is risky and uncertain. The author recognizes that these factors create obstacles to moral decision making.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about the health status of prisoners in Switzerland. The aim of this study was to provide a detailed description of the health problems presented by detainees in Switzerland's largest remand prison METHODS: In this retrospective cross-sectional study we reviewed the health records of all detainees leaving Switzerland's largest remand prison in 2007. The health problems were coded using the International Classification for Primary Care (ICPC-2). Analyses were descriptive, stratified by gender RESULTS: A total of 2195 health records were reviewed. Mean age was 29.5 years (SD 9.5); 95% were male; 87.8% were migrants. Mean length of stay was 80 days (SD 160). Illicit drug use (40.2%) and mental health problems (32.6%) were frequent, but most of these detainees (57.6%) had more generic primary care problems, such as skin (27.0%), infectious diseases (23.5%), musculoskeletal (19.2%), injury related (18.3%), digestive (15.0%) or respiratory problems (14.0%). Furthermore, 7.9% reported exposure to violence during arrest by the police CONCLUSION: Morbidity is high in this young, predominantly male population of detainees, in particular in relation to substance abuse. Other health problems more commonly seen in general practice are also frequent. These findings support the further development of coordinated primary care and mental health services within detention centers

AB  - The treatment of political offenders in Florence during the centuries under investigation usually took the form of exile, destruction or confiscation of property, fines, torture, capital punishment by hanging or beheading, exposure and mutilation. Political factions, incited to violence, perpetrated crimes peculiar to mob action and acted an an extra-legal instrument of punishment. Imprisonment, although primarily used as a means of detention, was used occasionally as a punishment per se. Finally, it is a well-established fact that general amnesty and individual pardons for political offenders were practices common to Renaissance Florence.

AB  - The key thesis in Hubbard's paper 'Accommodating Otherness: anti-asylum centre protest and the maintenance of white privilege' is that racial dimensions of opposition to asylum seekers centres are part of cultural NIMBYism. This connection of complex issues with an invalid concept obscures our understanding of the role of 'otherness' in facility siting discussions. The deconstruction of the contested NIMBY concept is illustrated by a brief review of wind power, which was mentioned as a field in which 'otherness' had not been incorporated.

AB  - In March 2009, the Home Office launched a cross-government consultation in England on how to end violence against women and girls. The Women�_Ts National Commission (WNC) was asked to organise focus groups to gather the views of women and girls on what would make them feel and be safer, and on proposals to prevent violence against them. The focus groups were designed around the key themes of the consultation: prevention, provision and protection. A total of 24 focus groups were organised and 300 women and girls consulted from range of ethnic and socioeconomic groups, differing sexuality and including immigrants, refugees, asylum seekers, offenders, those working in the sex industry, survivors of sexual abuse and night-time shift and retail workers. Detailed recommendations are grouped under the three themes of the consultation. Although there was some evidence of good practice, the voices of the focus groups illustrate that many statutory services are responding to violence against women and girls inadequately. Although legislation, strategies, policies and action plans have been developed to address different forms of violence against women, the groups�_T experiences suggest that these are not effectively coordinated, implemented or monitored consistently across the country. Woman particularly valued specialist independent women�_Ts services where they existed

AB  - This practicum explores the utility of the mostly barren and desert-like roof space of our residential buildings. The concept is to reclaim an otherwise uninhabited roof top and transform it into a pleasant and enjoyable recreational space, an "Oasis in the Sky". The concepts is manifested through the location of activity zones and the design of associated structures in the confined roof environment. The project illustrates that "Oasis in the Sky" as an achievable concept. The design is complemented by a brief description of construction and site maintenance techniques. A time when urbanization has reduced on-ground recreational space to a minimum, the roofs of our buildings could be better utilized to provide a solution to this problem. Although the developed roof space could never replace natural green space on the ground, it would form a refuge of its own amidst the chaos of our urban centres, becoming an "Oasis in the Sky."

AB  - This study tests assumptions implicit in many of the policy developments around hate crime and reporting that concern the social context and some of the psychological processes behind decision making on victim reporting. In the small scale study five focus groups were conducted across five traditionally victimised groups (black and minority ethnic people; LBGT people; refugee and asylum seekers; and people with a disability). Results suggest that official concern over reporting all hate crimes for service planning requirements is not shared by the overwhelming majority of respondents and would not be feasible to deliver. Increasing the reporting of hate crime to the police and non police agencies would require identifying ways to change the attitudes, behaviour and decision making of victims, their family, friends and acquaintances

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To understand the epidemiology of tuberculosis (TB) inside the prison system of Hong Kong METHOD: Prospective territory-wide TB surveillance was conducted among prisoners in 24 correctional institutions RESULTS: From 1999 to 2005, 622 prevalent TB cases diagnosed before or within 3 months of incarceration and 214 incident cases diagnosed after 3 months were reported by prison staff to a paper-based central prison TB registry. Both crude prevalence and incidence were falling (chi(2) for trend, both P < 0.001), despite a higher sex- and age-adjusted prison TB incidence as compared to the general population (indirectly standardised rate [ISR] 280.6 vs. 108.0/100000, P < 0.001). Illegal immigrants (odds ratio [OR] 3.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.8-7.4) and drug addicts (OR 2.04, 95%CI 1.13-3.7) were two major risk groups. The TB incident risk disappeared after their exclusion (ISR 117.1 vs. 108.0/100000, P = 0.52). No significant difference in the multidrug-resistant rate was found when comparing the group with the general population (3.5% vs. 1.0%, OR 3.6, 95%CI 0.5-28.4). No extensively drug-resistant (XDR) cases were identified CONCLUSION: TB remains a significant disease in local prisons. Further strengthening of TB control programmes in prisons, especially targeting the higher risk groups, is recommended

They are distant relatives from the same town whose eyes still tear up when they talk about their dead spouses. But within months of the earthquake, which was the deadliest natural disaster to befall China in more than three decades, Jiang Zhongfu, 60, began courting Zhu Xiaoqiong, 42. Last month, he moved into Ms. Zhu's prefabricated housing cube in a refugee camp in these scarred hills.

AB  - BEIJING -- An ethnic Uighur journalist working for state radio has been sentenced to life in prison on charges that he spread subversive information around the time of deadly rioting in the western region of Xinjiang last year, a Uighur exile group said Friday. The journalist, Memetjan Abdulla, was quietly sentenced by a court in April in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, said Dilxat Raxit, a spokesman for the World Uyghur Congress, a group critical of Chinese policy in Xinjiang, where Uighurs are the largest ethnic group. Mr. Raxit said he and his colleagues, who are based in Germany, had only recently learned of the sentencing from people in Xinjiang.

AB  - This dissertation examines how polities are being transformed by, and are responding to, increased global migration focusing on the immigration control policies of advanced industrialized democracies. It argues that increased global migration has reaffirmed and entrenched the exclusionary prerogatives of immigration control, meaning the sovereign right of states to "keep out the other." This has led to a tightening of citizenship and a narrowing of the boundaries of political and societal inclusion. I provide evidence of this using a mixed methods multi-level analysis that focuses on the nexus between emergent human rights norms, global migratory trends, and state policies directed towards irregular (i.e., undocumented/illegal) migrants. In weaving together this nexus, this dissertation bridges central debates about globalization and human rights in international relations with new research on immigration control in comparative politics. At the international level, in an analysis of 160 countries from 1990 to 2008, I find that human rights treaties that require states to extend fundamental rights to noncitizens are among the most poorly ratified treaties. But more than that, as immigration into a country increases even liberal democracies become less likely to ratify, as doing so may encourage more immigration. I then move to a comparative analysis of immigration control across Western democracies, focusing on deportation and immigration detention. This dissertation is among the first to analyze contemporary trends in these critical indicators of immigration control across countries and over time. I find that economic and migration factors only partially explain trends in deportation and detention. Rather, it is the legislative representation of the far right that significantly increases the restrictiveness of immigration control. In examining how the far right "matters," I find that the political opportunities created by electoral rules explain the impact of the far right more so than public demand for more restrictive policies. Moreover, while there is no clear evidence that more immigration control means less immigration, there is some evidence to suggest that it does result in less asylum inflows. Lastly, I examine the microfoundations of immigration control using in-depth interviews with immigration enforcement officials and irregular migrants. I introduce a theory of selective immigration control that views immigration enforcement as a suboptimal outcome that is constrained by institutional and individual-level factors that make certain categories of migrants more or less deportable. As a result, those who are "easiest" to remove become disproportionately the targets of immigration enforcement; these are often the most vulnerable migrants

AB  - The return of several million Afghans, in the years following the complete Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in February 1989, will be one of the largest refugee repatriations in history. Refugees are a unique category of international migrants, protected and assisted by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Afghan refugees, like those in other Third World regions, are caught in a complex and rapidly changing political and military environment. Over five million Afghans live in exile; three million reside in refugee camps in Pakistan near the Afghanistan border where they have formed a "refugee warrior community" fighting to retake control of their country. This paper focuses on four repatriation variables: the number of returning refugees and displaced persons, military and public stability, infrastructural conditions, and agricultural productivity. The discussion is based on incomplete and sometimes confusing data, a common problem in extremely poor and unstable regions. Nonetheless, the use of these variables within a spatial framework underscores the influence of provincial and local conditions on repatriation, whether it takes place in Afghanistan, Mozambique or El Salvador. Most refugees will return to Afghanistan's southern and eastern provinces; this region along the Pakistan/Afghanistan border, in comparison to northern, western and central provinces, has suffered the greatest infrastructural damage, the highest percentage of land abandonment and the most intense fighting. Numerous minefields in this region will pose a grave danger to those attempting to return in the next few years. Before large numbers of refugees begin to return, repatriation planners will need to prioritize provinces and direct resources toward areas where outside relief assistance can be of greatest benefit to refugees and residents. Subsequently, reconstruction efforts will need to focus on rebuilding villages and irrigation systems, replanting crops, and reestablishing marketing networks.

It is to be noted that the WPA is a place of secret military testing, joint defence projects, sheep stations, a controversial detention centre, more than 4000 rocket launches and nine devastating atomic-bomb trials. In 1972, the WPA was reduced to half of its size. The average summer temperature of this no-go zone is 35.5 degree centigrade. In 2000, the area became a focus for national xenophobia as up to 1500 illegal immigrants and asylum seekers were held behind razor wire at the detention centre. Recently, the area has been suggested as the dumping ground of the nation for nuclear waste

The sensitivity of palmar pallor in detecting anaemia was 21%. In addition, 43% (95% CI: 36-50) and 53% (95% CI: 46-61) of adolescents in Kenya and Nepal, respectively, had iron deficiency. In both surveys, anaemia occurred more commonly among adolescents with iron deficiency. Vitamin A deficiency was found in 15% (95% CI: 10-20) of adolescents in Kenya and 30% (95% CI: 24-37) of adolescents in Nepal. Night blindness was not more common in adolescents with vitamin A deficiency than in those without vitamin A deficiency. In Kenya, one of the seven adolescents with Bitot's spots had vitamin A deficiency CONCLUSIONS: Anaemia, iron deficiency and vitamin A deficiency are common among adolescents in refugee populations. Such adolescents need to increase intakes of these nutrients; however, the lack of routine access makes programmes targeting adolescents difficult. Adolescent refugees should be considered for assessment along with other at-risk groups in displaced populations

AB  - Temporary Protected Status (TPS) is a temporary immigration program designed to assist foreign nations during short-term crises. Following two devastating earthquakes in El Salvador in 2001, the United States designated that country for TPS and provided undocumented Salvadoran immigrants in the U.S. with employment authorization and protection from deportation. Since 2001, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has repeatedly extended that grant and the accompanying benefits. El Salvador's current designation expires on September 9, 2010, unless DHS chooses to renew it. This thesis explores the political, economic and moral repercussions of extending Salvadoran Temporary Protected Status and proposes improvements to the TPS program. The United States and El Salvador have a long-standing relationship based on political and economic interdependence. An examination of Salvadoran-U.S. relations and the economic statistics regarding remittances from immigrants in the United States to El Salvador favors the renewal of the TPS designation. Terminating the grant would jeopardize regional cooperation and political stability, negatively impact trade between the U.S. and El Salvador, and spark the collapse of the Salvadoran national economy. Salvadoran TPS beneficiaries have resided in the United States for a minimum of nine years. Extending the Temporary Protected Status grant is morally justifiable given these immigrants' solid and lengthy ties to the U.S. However, there is concern that the TPS program has been applied to El Salvador as a long-term immigration solution, rather than a response to temporary country conditions. DHS data also reveals that Temporary Protected Status designations have been issued arbitrarily. Numerous deserving countries like Haiti and Guatemala did not receive TPS in the 2000s. The subjective implementation of the program is contrary to legislative intent and humanitarian objectives. TPS regulations are flawed and require modifications to ensure that the program is applied equitably using impartial criteria. A temporary immigration status should not be issued for long-term country conditions, and Salvadoran Temporary Protected Status beneficiaries merit a permanent immigration solution. Accordingly, TPS provisions ought to be amended to restore credibility and objectivity to the regulations, and registrants from El Salvador should be allowed to become lawful permanent residents

AB  - This study utilizes Kunz's kinetic model of refugee displacement to interpret the placelessness experienced by Liberian former child soldiers in the Buduburam refugee camp in Ghana. From August to December 2007, a clinical psychologist and a geographer interviewed ten Liberian former child soldiers to determine spatial and social barriers to successful resettlement and the prospects for overcoming these obstacles. Based on the interviews, five areas of intervention were suggested: (1) geographic desegregation and relocation, (2) education and employment, (3) psychological counseling, (4) societal acceptance and reintegration, and (5) security and protection.

AB  - Little research has explored the demographic and social network factors influencing the use of professional and informal support among older adults, particularly within distinct race and ethnic groups. This study� uses a national probability sample of older African Americans, non-hispanic whites, and black Caribbeans (i.e., both immigrants and U.S.-born black people�who trace their ethnic heritage to a Caribbean country).�This study addressed three research questions. First, what combination of professional services and informal supports do older adults use when faced with a serious personal problem? Second, how are race and ethnicity associated with help seeking for a personal problem? Third, what demographic, socioeconomic, and social support factors are associated with help seeking for a stressful personal problem? This study builds on previous work to examine racial and ethnic differences in informal and professional help seeking for a stressful personal problem. It used data from the National Survey of American Life: Coping with Stress in the 21st Century (NSAL), a national multistage probability design survey. Most respondents use informal support alone or in combination with professional services. Black Caribbeans are more likely than African Americans to rely on informal support only, whereas African Americans are more likely than whites to not receive any help. However, these findings are accounted for by differences in social support and experiences of discrimination

AB  - Background: Since 1975 the U.S. has resettled 2.6 million refugees who had to flee from their home countries. Many refugee resettlement organizations have developed different models of innovation to promote a smooth transition between previous foreign refugee camps to U.S. communities so that refugees swiftly become economically and socially self-sufficient. Providing refugees with health benefits and resources has been foremost priority upon arrival as they try to overcome health care barriers. Yet there is a lack of literature examining the impact of these health services and how they are perceived by the program recipients. Purpose: This scholarly project aimed to evaluate the feasibility and perceptions of health services provided by a large refugee resettlement agency in the Midwest region of the U.S. Methods: The qualitative pilot study used four focus groups to interview a convenience sample of 39 individuals who were clients of a large refugee resettlement agency in the Midwest U.S. The transcribed interviews from each focus group were analyzed by deriving dominant themes to understand the feasibility and perceptions of the health services provided by the resettlement agency and other organizations. Their attitudes and beliefs about preventive health care services and their impression of U.S. health care were also explored to identify education needs and future program development. Results: Results of the study revealed that their impression of U.S. health care was full of waiting and calling for appointments, emergency room delays, a lack of clear communication and difficulty navigating the insurance system. Their perceptions of health screenings were that they were familiar with these tests, but would like a copy of the results. They were confused with TB test results and valued vaccine information sheets. Their overall attitude toward U.S. health care among the four focus groups varied. Their beliefs about preventive care focused on cleanliness and they were unlikely to access preventive health services due to cost. Conclusion: Findings suggest additional efforts are necessary to further address health needs of the resettled refugee population. This project adds new information to make lasting health care improvements enabling refugees to thrive within their new communities

T1  - Workers, migrants, aliens or citizens? State constructions and discourses of identity among post-war European labour migrants in Britain
JF  - Political Geography
A1  - McDowell Linda
KW  - eppi-reviewer
AB  - In this paper, I address a series of questions about migrant identities, assessing the continuities and contradictions between state discourses and those of migrants themselves. I address these questions through the lens of a largely neglected group of migrants, who were recruited by the British State in the immediately post-war period in response to post-war labour shortages. Whereas the recruitment of considerable numbers of labour migrants from the Caribbean to the United Kingdom from the late 1940s onwards is a well-documented part of the response to post-war labour shortages, earlier schemes to recruit people from refugee camps in Germany are less known. In this paper, I focus on women from Latvia, one of the Baltic states, who provide a particularly interesting insight into questions of identity as they both challenge common distinctions and assumptions in theories of migration�_"they came as independent single women for example. They are also a hybrid category in the sense they were both refugees and economic migrants with no previous attachments to the UK, unlike the other main groups of economic migrants at the time and earlier�_"Irish and Caribbean people�_"and the somewhat later migration from the Indian sub-continent. In this paper I show how these women challenged assumptions built into state policies at the time about assimilation and mothering future Britons through a strong and continuing commitment to the recreation of an imagined Latvian community in exile and the refusal of British identity

AB  - Conceived by nurses in the hospital of a Palestinian refugee camp in Beirut, and inspired by Norwegian People's Aid, the international aid agency of the Australian trade unions was designed to give a genuine material base to solidarity with national liberation struggles. Bridging the difficult division in Australian labour politics between the Catholic right and the social democratic and pro-Moscow lefts, Australian People for Health, Education and Development Abroad (now Union Aid Abroad APHEDA) was able to channel funds from unions and the Australian government to agriculture, health, and vocational training projects in many countries in the South. Unlike most counterpart organisations in Europe and the USA, its earlier partners were rarely trade unions. Only recently has APHEDA directly supported trade union training in Cambodia, East Timor, and Indonesia, under pressure from Australian unions, who see workers' rights in neighbouring countries as crucial to their own fate. Yet unions in advanced capitalist countries don't spontaneously understand the humanitarian and development needs of countries, such as Papua New Guinea, where waged workers are a small minority of the population. Unionisation is only one part of the solution. The April 2000 Durban congress of the ICFTU called for trade unions to 'organise the unorganised', such as informal-sector workers, and to build alliances with NGOs and civil society around shared values. As a trade union NGO, APHEDA is located in the middle of a challenging intersection. Mandated to educate Australian workers on globalisation issues, APHEDA finds itself often more partisan than other international development NGOs in Australia, sometimes more circumspect. With attacks on union rights and the increasing share of the Australian aid budget delivered through private companies, APHEDA faces decisions about its independence, alliances, direction, and sustainability

AB  - More than 200,000 displaced Karen from Burma have been �_~warehoused�_T in displaced persons�_T camps on the Thai-Burma border for more than 20 years. Recently, the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees (UNHCR) has embarked on the durable solution of resettlement to third countries for these people. This paper reports findings from qualitative research on the experiences and perceptions of resettled Christian Karen in Australia. This study comprised 2 focus groups with recently arrived Christian Karen, and 10 interviews with Karen community leaders in Australia. The focus groups participants displayed a strong and overt sense of identity, both as individual Karen and as part of the Christian Karen community, locally and transnationally, indicating that Christian Karen identity remains intact during displacement and strongly influences the resettlement experience for this group. Education, faith, community, and nationalism in the context of Karen culture emerged as strong and interrelated themes

AB  - NICE Public Health Guidance 28 �_~Promoting the quality of life of looked after children and young people�_T was published in October 2010. The guidance was produced by a collaboration between NICE and SCIE in recognition that the health and well-being of looked after children and young people is a broad-ranging topic with implications beyond the usual scope of public health guidance. The guidance emphasises the experience of the looked after child in terms of care relationships. The importance of attachment, nurture, positive identity, and stability runs through the considerations and recommendations. The majority of the specific recommendations are focused on how the system can provide the right context and environment for these caring relationships to develop and be sustained. The theme of high-quality, stable and emotionally sensitive care follows the life cycle of the child through the care system, with specific recommendations about services for babies and young children, for social care placements, education and access to specialist health services, and for support through transition and preparing for adulthood. The guidance also emphasises the diversity of looked after children, reminding commissioners and providers that services need to meet a range of special needs and circumstances, such as those of unaccompanied asylum-seeking young people and those in secure or custodial accommodation

AB  - The purpose of this dissertation was to investigate the metaphorical use of "rock" in the Mosaic traditions. The investigation raised the theological question of the use of impersonal models for God in contemporary theology. The brief introduction stated that the methodology was exegetical along historical-critical and rhetorical lines and that the limitations of the study were confined to three primary passages: Exodus 17:1-7; 33:12-23 and Deuteronomy 32:1-43. In chapter two the story of Yahweh providing water from the rock for his people in the wilderness (Exodus 17:1-7 with its parallel Numbers 20:1-13) was examined. The theological import of "rock" centered around the theme of "rock" as source of life. The story of Moses being hidden in the rock but seeing the backside of Yahweh (Exodus 33:12-23) was investigated in chapter three. "Rock" as a place of revelation was suggested and explored. The Song of Moses (Deuteronomy 32:1-43) provided varied and metaphorical employment of the term "rock," which was discussed in chapter four. The flexibility and depth of the writer's theological vision called attention to the significance of "Rock." The exegesis suggested five themes associated with the theological or metaphorical use of "rock" in the Old Testament. "Rock" as source of life, place of revelation, refuge, enduring strength and incomparable Lord were discussed in the fifth chapter. Paul's use of "Rock" as a metaphor for Christ on the basis of the earlier Mosaic traditions was noted for its theological example of the blending of traditions about "Rock" (1 Corinthians 10:4). The question was raised as to whether contemporary theology could appropriate such an impersonal metaphor as "Rock" for God. In light of the biblical revelation and the traditional personal models, the suggestion was made that such an appropriation could serve the community of faith in its understanding of God

AB  - The expanding cultural mosaic of ethnics in the United States demands a specific missiological strategy for their evangelization. Lowland Laotian refugees are one part of the American Mosaic and their strategy begins with an examination of the culture, religions, minorities, and geography of Laos. The strategy develops through the first known study and evaluation of Christian missions in the Southeast Asian country of Laos. Roman Catholic missionaries provided initial penetration of that country and were followed by Presbyterian, Overseas Missionary Fellowship, and Christian Missionary Alliance missionaries. Modern evangelistic efforts included World Vision and Southern Baptist missionaries. The strategy then specifies Southern Baptist involvement with refugees. One section provides a sociological definition of a refugee which includes a study of racial prejudice. A theological perspective examines the biblical concern for refugee persons and a ministry perspective explains the conditions and organization of Southeast Asian refugee camps. The history of the Southern Baptist Immigration and Refugee Service provides the first known summary of events surrounding Southern Baptist involvement in the Cuban and Southeast Asian refugee crises between the years 1960 and 1980. The 1985 survey of all 103 known Southern Baptist Laotian congregations divulges that 82 were lowland Lao congregations with 28 lowland Lao pastors. The survey of lowland Lao population centers results in a recommended congregation to population ratio of 1:300. That rate, applied to state population figures, discloses a recommendation for 348 new lowland Laotian congregations in the United States. The surveys also reveal that the predominant mother-child sponsorship role limits the growth and development of new and existing lowland Lao congregations. The resulting strategy recommends a three-pronged approach for evangelizing lowland Laotian refugees in the United States. A biblical definition of sponsorship promotes new congregations; a Laotian church growth guide encourages the autonomy of existing congregations; and the Laotian leadership training section provides methodology for enlisting and training lowland Laotian leadership. The evangelization of ethnic America requires the strategic planning and implementation of culturally contextualized ministries and congregations. This study presents a feasible strategy which can be adapted to evangelizing ethnic/language-culture persons in the United States

AB  - The genius of Jose Marti and Alejo Carpentier of creating characters that reflect basic human experiences can be better understood by studying the works of the famous psychiatrist Karen Horney and psychologist Abraham Maslow. Karen Horney in her work with patients provides a profile of behavior which facilitates the understanding of the realistic and complex characters created in these novels. Abraham Maslow's theory of self-actualization further enhances our understanding of the characters in these novels and their inner struggles. The psychological problems associated with exile and its effect on characterization has not been sufficiently examined. It is contended that authors can separate themselves from their works, and they do so by avoiding intensely personal topics. Nevertheless; characters in their writings do indeed reflect the authors psychological experience of exile. This dissertation studies two writers from different periods of Cuban history. Jose Marti (1853-1895) wrote many of his works away from his homeland. From 1871 to 1895 he only visited his country on two occasions. He spent many years in exile in Spain, Mexico and Guatemala but by far the greatest amount of exiled time was spent in the United States. From 1880 until 1895 before his final return to Cuba (and death on the battlefield) he lived mostly in New York City. Alejo Carpentier (1904-1980) elected self-imposed exile in 1928 after spending forty days in jail. He lived in Paris from 1928 until 1936 and spent much of his life away from his homeland. Two novels are analyzed in this study: Amistad funesta by Jose Marti and Los pasos perdidos by Alejo Carpentier. Conditions associated with exile such as isolation, identity crisis, nostalgia, needs for belonging, are analyzed and applied to characters from the above mentioned novels. Abraham Maslow's theory of self-actualization and Karen Horney's psychological studies are used to explain characterization in these novels

AB  - United Nations peacekeeping operatons have departed signficantly from their traditionally circumscribed role of establishing cessation of violence usually with the consent of warring parties. Indeed, more recent responsibilities have focused on establishing peace and stability within as well as without, including overseeing elections, creating social and economic institutions, and ensuring basic human rights protections to citizens within a state's borders. This paper examines seven such UN peacekeeping missions: the Transition Assistance Group in Namibia (UNTAG); the Observer Mission in El Salvador (ONUSAL); the Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ); the Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC); the Preventive Force in Macedonia (UNPREDEP); the Interim Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK); and the Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET). This analysis responds to the following questions regarding UN peacekeeping: (1) to what extent can or should the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations(DPKO) be expected to assume responsibility for the creation of the internally as well as externally peaceful state, and for how long? and (2) does the DPKO have sufficient authority to insist on certain human rights protections, even if the Security Council resoultion providing for the particular mission does not include reference to those protections, e.g. Security Council Reolution 1244 providing for UNMIK? The seven missions were selected for their uniqueness and degree of success relative to other missions. UNTAG was established in 1989, following more than a decade of planning, to facilitate Namibia's transition to independence through UN-supervised elections, as well as to ensure cessation of hostilities, confinement of troops and with South Africans from Namibia, repeal of discriminatory laws, release of political prisoners, and permission for refugees to return safely. ONUSAL was established in 1991 to verify implementation of all agreements seeking the end of a decade-long civil war, including reform of armed forces, judicial and electoral systems, and land tenure provisions. UNOMOZ was established in 1992 to monitor and support a ceasefire, force demobilization and national elections, as well as to launch a humanitarian assistance program for those displaced by the war, and to develop a demining program. This inclusion of demilitarization elemnets within the humanitarian component was unique to ONUMOZ. UNTAC was establshed in 1992 to ensure implementation of the agreeement concluded the year before, which called for the sovereignty and indpendence of Cambodia, and accordingly delegated to the UN authority to safeguard the agreements and their implementation, including human rights protections, free and fair general elections, military arrangements, civil adminsitration, maintenance of law and order, and refugee return. UNTAC was a watershed in UN peacekeeping, surpassing all prior missions in scope, cost, and complexity. UNPREDEP was the first UN operation to engage in preventive troop deployment and preventive diplomacy. UNMIK assumed a very troubled and even contradictory role under Security Council Resolution 1244, which provided for Kosovo's self-determination , but only within the sovereign state of Serbia. Finally, UNTAET was established to assume complete responsiblity for the administration of East Timor during its transition to independence from Indonesia. This mandate included the creation of policy and defense forces, a judiciary, major infrastructure repair, and the monitoring of an election. While not a central part of the study, peace enforcement missions both during the Cold War (Congo) and since (Somalia, Bosnia, Rwanda) are noted briefly to underscore the tension between expectation and capability, a tension that becomes even more salient when peace enforcement is by its very definition enacted without the consent of the parties in conflict... ..PAT.-Unpublished Manuscript [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]Copyright of Conference Papers -- International Studies Association is the property of International Studies Association and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

AB  - This paper seeks to elucidate the socio-cultural and economic benefits of higher education in refugee contexts. NGO and UNHCR initiatives in Dadaab and Kakuma camps are used as a reference point for discussing the challenges, best practices, and potential of higher and adult learning in contexts of protracted exile. This small-scale, qualitative study seeks to understand what opportunities for higher education exist for those living in Kenyan refugee camps, and do existing opportunities yield 'social benefits' beyond those accrued by the refugees themselves? Drawing upon interviews with practitioners, observation in schools and learning centres, and data from refugee-service providers, our findings are primarily descriptive in nature and explore the myriad ways in which opportunities for higher learning can strengthen refugee communities in countries of asylum. We contend that although Kenya's encampment policies limit the potential economic and social benefits of refugee education on a national level, opportunities for refugees to pursue higher education are still immensely valuable in that they bolster refugee service provision in the camps and provide refugees with the skills and knowledge needed to increase the effectiveness of durable solutions at both an individual and societal level, be they repatriation, local integration, or third-country resettlement.

AB  - Residential mobility patterns are an important indicator of the future socioeconomic standing of rural-urban migrants in the urban society. In Chinese cities there are significant barriers for migrants to settle permanently. Given this context and housing choices available to migrants, what types of housing career do they follow once in the city? Drawing from survey data from three large cities, this paper studies migrant intra-urban residential mobility through three lenses-temporal patterns, spatial trajectories and tenure shifts. The majority of migrants are renters and remain so despite a lengthy residence in the cities. They experience a high level of mobility over time, but the trajectories of their moves are spatially confined and involve few tenure shifts.

AB  - Nature is replete with examples of embedded microvascular systems that enable efficient fluid flow and distribution for autonomic healing, cooling, and energy harvesting. The ability to incorporate microvascular networks in functional materials systems is therefore both scientifically and technologically important. In this PhD thesis, the direct-write assembly of planar and 3D biomimetic microvascular networks within polymer and hydrogel matrices is demonstrated. In addition, the influence of network design of fluid transport efficiency is characterized. Planar microvascular networks composed of periodic lattices of uniformal microchannels and hierarchical, branching architectures are constructed by direct-write assembly of a fugitive organic ink. Several advancements are required to facilitate their patterning, including pressure valving, dual ink printing, and dynamic pressure variation to allow tunable control of ink deposition. The hydraulic conductance is measured using a high pressure flow meter as a function of network design. For a constant vascular volume and areal coverage, 2- and 4-generation branched architectures that obey Murray's Law exhibited the highest hydraulic conductivity. These experimental observations are in good agreement with predictions made by analytic models. 3D microvascular networks are fabricated by omnidirectional printing a fugitive organic ink into a photopolymerizable hydrogel matrix that is capped with fluid filler of nearly identical composition. Using this approach, 3D networks of arbitrary design can be patterned. After ink deposition is complete, the matrix and fluid filler are chemically cross-linked via UV irradiation, and the ink is removed by liquefication. Aqueous solutions composed of a triblock copolymer of polyethylene oxide (PEO)-polypropylene oxide (PPO)-PEO constitute the materials system of choice due to their thermal- and concentration-dependent phase behavior. Specifically, the fugitive ink consists of a 23 w/w% PEO-PPO-PEO (Pluronic F127) solution, while matrix (25 w/w%) and fluid filler (20 w/w%) are composed of an acrylate-modified form of the Pluronic F127 that can be subsequently photopolymerized. The ink and matrix concentrations exceed the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of 22 w/w% and thus reside in a physical gel state. At their respective concentrations, they possess an elastic plateau modulus G' > 104 Pa needed for ink filament formation, shape retention, and support during the printing process. By contrast, the fluid filler is formulated below the CMC to facilitate its flow into void spaces created as the nozzle translates through the matrix during printing. After printing is completed, photopolymerization is carried out to yield a chemically cross-linked matrix from which the fugitive ink is removed leaving behind the desired 3D microvascular network. Due to the potential application of 3D microvasularized hydrogels in tissue engineering, dye diffusion through the cured Pluronic F127-diacrylate matrix is investigated via fluorescent microscopy. Image analysis is used to extract diffusion profiles of the dye as a function of time. Extraction of the 1-D Gaussian fitting parameters is used to determine the spatial peak variance ؟ 2 and plotted as a function of time to determine the dye diffusivity

AB  - Background: Surgery is increasingly recognized as a means to reduce the morbidity and mortality of disabling impairments in resource-limited environments. We sought to estimate the burden of surgically correctable disabling impairments and the cost-effectiveness of their treatment among children in a large refugee camp. Methods: This is a chart review of all patients aged 0-18 years from Dadaab Refugee Camp (Kenya) treated at a facility primarily responsible for providing pediatric surgical care in the region. Total disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted were calculated using life expectancy tables and established or estimated disability weights. A sensitivity analysis was performed using various life expectancy tables. Delayed averted DALYs caused by delay in care were also estimated. Inpatient costs were collected to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis. Results: Between 2005 and 2011 a total of 640 procedures were performed on 341 patients. The median age at surgery was 4.6 years, and 33 % of the children treated were female. Only 13.5 % of surgeries estimated as required for common congenital surgical conditions were actually performed. The total number of DALYs averted ranged from 4,136 to 9,529 (6.4-14.8 per patient), depending on the calculation method used. Cost-effectiveness analysis resulted in values of $40-$88 per DALY. Conclusions: The burden of pediatric surgical disabling impairments in refugee camps is substantial. Surgical intervention to address this burden is both feasible and cost-effective. Such intervention can significantly decrease the burden of disability among children affected by armed conflicts.

AB  - Reviews the books, Religion and coping in mental health care by Joseph Pieper and Marinus van Uden (2005) and Culture, religion and spirituality in coping: The example of cancer patients in Sweden by Fereshteh Ahmadi (2006). These two European volumes provide noteworthy research evidence bearing on the role that culture plays in the relationship of religion and coping. Until recently, research on this relationship had been largely confined to one country only, the United States, and to the well-known religious-coping framework proposed by Kenneth Pargament. Pieper and van Uden's book is a collection of eight previously published papers, most of them from the Archiv f��r Religionspsychologie but all here in English; two of them are coauthored by another Dutch researcher, Hans Alma. In Culture, Religion and Spirituality in Coping, Fereshteh Ahmadi likewise orients her research in terms of Pargament's work, specifically the RCOPE measure of religious coping. Ahmadi, a political refugee from Iran who is now on the faculty of Uppsala University, Sweden, explores in this book the role that religion or spirituality may play as a resource for coping with crisis in the lives of persons who identify themselves as nontheistic or nonreligious. Ahmadi points out that Sweden is one of the most secularized countries in Europe as well as one of the most fully developed welfare states. Ahmadi concludes that, in the Swedish context, people tend to turn to spiritually oriented coping methods rather than religious ones. She found this to be especially true for the women.

AB  - Background: There is a lack of evidence to inform policy development on the reasons why health professionals migrate. Few studies have sought to empirically determine factors influencing the intention to migrate and none have explored the relationship between factors. This paper reports on the first international attempt to investigate the migration intentions of pharmacy students and identify migration factors and their relationships. Methods: Responses were gathered from 791 final-year pharmacy students from nine countries: Australia, Bangladesh, Croatia, Egypt, Portugal, Nepal, Singapore, Slovenia and Zimbabwe. Data were analysed by means of Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and two-step cluster analysis to determine the relationships between factors influencing migration and the characteristics of subpopulations most likely and least likely to migrate. Results: Results showed a significant difference in attitudes towards the professional and sociopolitical environment of the home country and perceptions of opportunities abroad between those who have no intention of migrating and those who intend to migrate on a long-term basis. Attitudes of students planning short-term migration were not significantly different from those of students who did not intend to migrate. These attitudes, together with gender, knowledge of other migrant pharmacists and past experiences abroad, are associated with an increased propensity for migration. Conclusion: Given the influence of the country context and environment on migration intentions, research and policy should frame the issue of migration in the context of the wider human resource agenda, thus viewing migration as one form of attrition and a symptom of other root causes. Remuneration is not an independent stand-alone factor influencing migration intentions and cannot be decoupled from professional development factors. Comprehensive human resource policy development that takes into account the issues of both remuneration and professional development are necessary to encourage retention.

AB  - In one mid-Atlantic county, implementation of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 -� 287(g), has created dystopic conditions among both legal and illegal Salvadoran immigrants. This policy allows the county law enforcement agency, after federal training, to enforce immigration law by inquiring about citizenship status and making immigrant custodial arrests. Many immigrants mistakenly believe 287(g) allows law enforcement to profile immigrants and to detain or deport them at will. Drawing on acculturation, social disorganization, and migration push-pull theories, the purpose of this phenomenological study was to understand lived experiences of participants in relation to 287(g) enforcement. Snowball sampling was used to recruit three men and four women to participate in semi-structured interviews regarding their daily lives and their understanding of the 287 (g) policy. Themes were identified using manual and computer-assisted techniques. Findings showed participants came to the county looking for property ownership, business opportunities, education, and healthcare; their lives, have been characterized by fear, however, since 287(g) enforcement began. Regardless of legal status, immigrants have feared reporting crimes and attending cultural celebrations, believing they may be detained or deported. Individuals with illegal family members report problems with property ownership, maintaining employment, providing schooling for their children, and receiving medical care. Recommendations include informing county political leaders who can educate the Salvadoran community about the scope of 287(g) policy. Implications for social change are that this education could restore trust between law enforcement and Salvadoran families

AB  - In China, injection drug use is a major transmission route for HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Timely HIV and HCV testing among drug users is vital to earlier diagnosis, linkage to care, and retention. This study aimed to examine HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing delays at methadone clinics in Guangdong Province, China, and identify individual-level and clinic-level factors associated with delayed testing. Data from 13,270 individuals at 45 methadone clinics in Guangdong were abstracted from a national web-based surveillance database. A two-level binomial logit model was used to examine the association between individual- and clinic-level factors and delayed HIV and HCV testing, defined as receiving a test seven or more days after initial entry into the methadone system. Among 10,046 patients tested for HIV, 1882 (18.7%) had delayed testing; among 10,404 patients tested for HCV, 1542 (14.8%) had delayed testing. Among delayed testers, the median time to HCV testing was significantly longer than the median time to HIV testing (73 vs. 54 days, p<0.05). In the multivariate analysis, the likelihood of delayed HIV testing was higher among individuals with high school or greater education (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02�_"1.72) and individuals enrolled at clinics with more patients (aOR 1.41, 95% CI 1.05�_"1.91, for each increase in 100). The likelihood of delayed HCV testing was higher among women (aOR 1.51, 95% CI 1.11�_"2.06) and employed individuals (aOR 1.21, 95% CI 1.02�_"1.43). Delayed testing for HIV and HCV is common among patients at methadone clinics in Guangdong, with many patients experiencing delays of two or more months. Structural interventions are needed to expedite testing once individuals enter the methadone maintenance program.

AB  - Turning Hostility into Friendship: Immigrants, Natives and the Government in Wanzai County of Jiangxi in the Qing and the Republic Introduction Men are the liveliest factor in social history, and human migration have maken a notable impact on the development of Chinese history, so immigrants have become one of the important point in Chinese social history studies. In the late Ming and early Qing immigrants (peng min -+-+) from Fujian, Guangdong and South Jiangxi-+-+-+-+ had a great influence upon Wanzai county in Southwest Jiangxi-+-+-+-+-+. During the period from the Qing to the Republican Era many complicated and delicate relations between migrants and natives, between migrants and the government, between natives and the government, the inside of migrants, natives and the government are not in the static structure of-+state-society-+, but are fully embodied through conflicting event. This dissertation, taking the story of Wanzai as a case, aim to study the interactions of migrants, natives and the government, as well as their impact on social change. I should point out that the conflicts between migrants and natives was not the only contradictions in local power pattern, in fact it was created by internal factors as the ecology, economic structure and social conflicts of that area. Main questions are, for example, which resource migrants and natives fought for in different stages and in this process which resource they used, how the government control the conflicts, how the officials carry out the policies, how the local government and society respond to the central government-+s policy, and that each part how to -+talk-+ each other, etc. Chapter One-+Immigrants and Local Upheavals Part -+ migrants and their their economic activities Part -+ unrests of migrants-+-+-+-+and its influence In the late Ming and early Qing the movements of immigrants were with local upheavals, going through the unsuccessive process, harmed the interests of the local society and the government. Thus immigrants were drived out by Qing government and natives. It was important that the immigrants-+unrests became natives-+collective mmory, which was used by natives in the conflicts. After mid KangXi -+-+-+-+Pieod the local government must recruit immigrants to develop the economy. This time the immigrants are very different from their sources to treatments, and they stood in the forefront in the local development in the Qing dynasty. Chapter Two-+National Identification and immigrants-+ Registration Part -+ the policy of immigrants-+peng min-+and its implementation Part -+ the li jia system-+-+-+-+-+-+and natives-+ prevention Part -+ immigrants-+ Registration The Wen Shanggui incident-+-+-+-+-+-+-+happened in 1723 impelled YongZheng-+-+-+-+to formulate the policy of immigrants. At the same time, the migrants gradually improved relations with the government, thus the government admitted and legitimatize the migrants-+rights, and till the late YongZheng pieod the state and immigrants identified each other. But the local government-+countermeasure-+local policy -+-+-+-+ which appeared by the pressure of natives led up to the category of keji-+guest household -+-+-+. Although keji was legal household register, it became a means of drawing social boundaries, identifying rights and demonstrating status in local society. So those natives who had registered in the lijia would try very hard to exclude newcomers from the registion and to confine them in the keji. Under natives-+exclusion immigrants-+registration strategy included the following ways: substituting the old households-+dingbu-+-+-+, attaching to the original tujia-+futu keji-+-+-+-+-+, registing in other place-+-+-+-+-+-+and pretending to be native households-+maoji-+-+-+. Chapter Three-+Ethnic Conflicts and Identification Part -+ competing for examination quotas Part -+ prosperity of Wanzai academies-+-+-+-+ Part -+ records of natives-+tuzhu zhi-+-+-+-+and the ethnic group of natives Part -+ Dongzhou Academy-+-+-+-+-+-+and the ethnic group of immigrants In mid Qing the conflict of interests between natives and immigrants became more and more intensified. The state policy of merge examination quotas-+-+-+-+-+-+in 1763 sharpened the contradictions, causing both natives and immigrants to compete for examination quotas as long as 45 years. Because of natives-+capital appeals-+-+-+-+and refusing exam, the central government carried out -+one county, two system-+ again in 1808. Wanzai academies were prosperous because natives and immigrants contended for educational resources. The publication of tuzhu zhi symbolized the formation of the ethnic group of natives. Thus immigrants were forced to integrate and the immigrants-+ethnic identification centering on dongzhou household-+dongzhou ji-+-+-+-+came into being. In the process of ethnic conflicts dongzhou Academy became the center of local power besides county town. Chapter Four-+Government-+s Effort and Merging in Unity Part -+ improvement of migrants-+natives relations from late Qing to early Republic Part -+ migrants-+natives relations in the Land Revolution-+-+-+-+-+-+period Part -+ state-making and the new lineage schools Part -+ the cae of dongzhou-+s property When encountering taiping jun-+-+-+-+-+migrants and natives cooperated closely and the strained relations became much better. In the land revolution period migrants-+natives contradictions was subordinate to class struggle, and the Chinese Communist Party took measures to iron out differences between migrants and natives in the Red Terror-+-+-+-+. the government-+s effort included the following ways: allowing migrants to live in county town, marrying each other freely, recompiling records of Wanzai county, and constructing the-+xian government-+guide-+middle school. In the process the gentries of migrants resist to amalgamate dongzhou middle school with longhe-+-+-+-+middle school which natives ran, and charged the local government with dealing illegally with dongzhou-+s property. At last the local government, migrants and natives came to terms. The identification of Wanzai people-+-+-+-+-+, marking that migrants and natives had approximately merged in unity, came into being in late Republic. After the establishment of the People-+s Republic of China the Party and government made every effort to iron out differences between migrants and natives. Conclusion In this part with the title of-+could hostility turn into friendship-+-+and-+How hostility turn into friendship-+-+I summarizes the evolution of migrants-+natives relations during the period from the early Qing to late Republic and the skill or trickery which officials and local gentries used in the game. From the story of Wanzai county, we can see that both the impetus of migrants and natives and government efforts were important, and neither was negligible. The dissertation ends with a problem that remains to be studies, that is, what is the relations between Wanzai people and how the government handle the relations in modern times

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the time course and characteristics of an insecticide-associated incident and highlight potential risks from similar outbreaks that may occur in other areas to enhance the preparedness of emergency physicians and other healthcare providers to deal with the sequelae of these events STUDY DESIGN: Outbreak investigation METHODS: From 5 to 8 August 2008, an outbreak investigation was carried out among the affected primary school located in the refugee camp area of Lixian district, Sichuan, China. Affected pupils, parents, teachers and doctors working in the local medical stations were visited. Clinical checking, clinical treatment, epidemiological investigation and environmental investigation were undertaken RESULTS: In total, 138 individuals were diagnosed with acute conjunctivitis, characterized by inflammation of the conjunctiva and intense ocular symptoms such as redness, itching and mucus discharge. According to the results, all risk factors (i.e. drinking water, indoor air and the materials used in camp classrooms) were excluded except insecticide exposure. The characteristics of symptoms, distribution of cases and records of irregular insecticide spraying support the assumption that the conjunctivitis outbreak was associated with synthetic pyrethroid alphacypermethrin exposure CONCLUSION: The results suggest that non-standard operating procedures in pest control could lead to disease incidents. Medical rescue teams should receive training and education in preventive techniques. Copyright 2010 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved

AB  - Foreign-born adolescents' psychological well-being is compared with that of their native-born peers using the California Health Interview Survey's Adolescent Questionnaire 2003 (n=4010 of whom 453 were foreign born, mean ages 14.40 and 14.57 years respectively). The authors examine the role that family and school can play in influencing the outcome of adolescent well-being. The results demonstrate that the additional risk factors stemming from the stresses of migration, resettlement, and assimilation do not necessarily lessen foreign-born adolescents' sense of psychological well-being. Foreign-born adolescents' unique family environment, life experiences, and/or cultural norms appear to have a protective effect on them and support their development. The authors suggest that in order to maintain this sense of well-being in the long-term and facilitate smooth transition into adulthood and American society, social services and interventions should focus on strengthening immigrant families, building strong ties between families and schools, and developing cultural programs geared to the various immigrant groups

AB  - The present dissertation examines the identity formation and the roles of translation, embodiment and migrancy in women's writings in Japan and North America--more specifically in English Canada, Quebec--in the 1980s and 1990s. Chapter One examines the works of the Japanese writers Tsushima Yuko and Tawada Yoko. Tsushima and Tawada's writings on migrancy translate Japanese folklore and Ainu (aboriginal people living in northern Japan, Hokkaid+�) legends into a contemporary context. In the process, they give new meanings to oral traditions and classical literature, transcending the limits of time and space and questioning the meaning of the "third space" where they live and which they describe in their migrant texts. By so doing, they reveal the construction of their identities as women and as migrants. Chapter Two examines the role of ethnicity in the formation of hyphenated identities in the works of Nikkei authors in North America and of Zainichi authors in Japan. Hiromi Goto, a Nikkei (Japanese Canadian) author in Canada and Yi Yang-ji, a Zainichi (resident Korean in Japan) author describe the formation of ethnic identity through a specific culinary culture and through the memory of the body and the senses. Though the process of identity formation is detached from the original homeland of the protagonists, ethnic culture plays a central role. In the work of these writers, ethnicity becomes a vehicle for transforming the host culture, in contrast to culinary culture and embodied memories whose impact remains confined and personal. Chapter Three traces the impact of the feminist movement and of bilingualism on the work of contemporary migrant women writers in Qu+�bec. The early works of Ying Chen, a Chinese migrant in Qu+�bec, avail themselves of feminist discourses to critique women's position in China. Her "otherness" as a migrant also serves as a platform for articulating a strong critique of Qu+�bec culture. R+�gine Robin, who is Jewish and learned French in France, came to Qu+�bec in 1977. She is a sociologist and a(n) (im)migrant writer. Throughout her literary and critical works, she suggests an idea of "Hors-lieu," which characterizes the status of (im)migrants in Qu+�bec and which situates them neither inside nor outside of Qu+�bec culture. These characteristics of migrant Qu+�b+�cois women writers' works address the need to question a certain isolationism or self-sufficiency in contemporary Qu+�b+�cois culture. Furthermore, in their recent works, these writers no longer address the question of migrant identity and minority politics, but rather write as Qu+�b+�cois who take an active part in their adopted culture. Thus, Ying and Robin seem to question the value of ethnic identification, suggesting new and productive directions for Qu+�b+�cois culture. The participation of women and minorities in culture has historically been neglected. Since the advent of second wave feminisms and of civil and minority rights movements--particularly since the 1980s and 1990s--women and minorities have been both visible and vocal, claiming for themselves a speaking position at the very centre of mainstream culture. My analysis posits that the work of these migrant and minority women writers allows readers to question their own identities in a postmodern and multicultural society

AB  - Ethnography of a pre-World War II Japanese fishing community of Terminal Island near Los Angeles. The community existed in physical isolation from the mainland and social isolation from the majority culture. Retention of traditional Japanese values were reinforced by interlocking social organizations. The bond of prefecture (state) of origin in Japan was further strengthened by involvement in a common occupation of commercial fishing. Although not sharply demarcated, the social structure of the Island reflected the two main groups, those who had businesses on land and those engaged in fishing. Accommodation to the majority culture were in the outward forms, but the traditional values were stressed. While interned at the Manzanar (California) Relocation Center during World War II, the bulk of these Islanders lived in three adjoining blocks, maintaining a high degree of group cohesion. Degree of prejudice of off-island Japanese communities toward the Terminal Islanders still existent within the internment camp. Postwar relocation to an area near the island where the community had existed by a number of former Islanders provided a degree of security. Shared experiences, back to the country of origin, through formation of the fishing community, its dissolution, sojourn in an internment camp, and forced relocation to a non-existent physical community provided bases for formation of a non-spatial community in order to keep intact the group identity which had existed for so long. Formation of a social community, based on the commonality of many factors, has created a group which exists as a community, without physical boundaries. The community leadership has passed from the immigrant generation to their children, but it is problematic that the following generation will support the continuation of this group

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine factors contributing to welfare participation and self-sufficiency of the Hmong. Specifically, this study was to determine factors which influence Hmong welfare participants to remain on or to leave the welfare system. The literature review indicated that, despite their long history, oppression, and much hardship (K. Y. Yang, 1992; Quincy, 1988), the Hmong have always maintained a way of life that is characterized as being self-supported (Barney, 1957; Cooper, Tapp, Lee & Schwoer-Kohl, 1991; D. Yang, 1993), resourceful, proud. independent (Lewis & Lewis, 1984; Whitaker, Barth, Berman, Heimann, MacDonald, Martindale & Shinn, 1972), and adaptable (D. Yang. 1993; Ranard, 1988). They have, however, experienced many changes in the last four decades, especially during the Secret War in Laos, which was from the early 1960s to 1975, and its impacts (Chagnon & Rumpf, 1983; D. Yang 1993; K. Yang, 1991: Tapp. 1989; Wagner, 1995). Many Hmong began to receive aid and support during the Secret War (Tapp, 1986; Wagner, 1995; Whitaker, et at., 1972) and during their subsequent stay in the refugee camps in Thailand (Chongvatan, 1988: Ranard, 1988). Some literature suggested that the experience of receiving aid and support, during the Secret War and its subsequent stay in the refugee camps, preconditioned the Hmong to have high rates of, and long term, welfare participation (K. Yang 1994; Pulaski. 1994b). This study identified ten factors selected from the review of literature to be examined. These ten factors were Gender, Age, Marrying at young age, Family size, Living in a ghetto, Years of education, Vocational skills, Employment history, English proficiency, and Length of time in the U.S. Overall, the findings indicated that factors other than those of this study need to be examined. The recommendations from this study included: (1) A comparative study of characteristic differences between members of the Hmong community in Fresno with several other Hmong self-sufficient communities in the nation might explain the high rate of welfare participation of the Hmong in Fresno. Such a study should include economic factors as well. (2) Further recognition that the Hmong are group-oriented people, from preliterate society and that their welfare participation and self-sufficiency are complex issues, therefore social service programs designed to assist the Hmong should be group oriented: multi-approach programs should be developed to meet the diversified needs of each individual Hmong welfare participant as well as the needs of the whole family

AB  - Data from 4,208 migrants aged 18-30 years old in Beijing and Nanjing, China, were analyzed to examine the correlates of willingness to participate (WTP) in HIV/STD prevention intervention activities among Chinese rural-to-urban migrants. Overall, 83.3% of the respondents would be willing to participate. Increased WTP was associated with employment in the industrial sector (OR = 1.59, 95% CI: 1.11-2.29), migrating to cities to learn more about the outside world (OR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.08-1.59), prior experience with health maintenance (OR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.11-1.66), higher level of HIV/AIDS awareness (OR= 1.16,95% CI: 1.02-1.31), and perceived severity of risk behaviors (OR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.04-1.68). Decreased WTP was associated with increased involvement in health risk behaviors (OR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.35-0.73), increased perceptions of peer risk involvement (OR = 0.81,95% CI: 0.68-0.98), perceived intrinsic rewards for risk behaviors (OR = 0.81,95% CI: 0.68-0.96) and perceptions of HIV-related stigma (OR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.53-0.89). The high level of WTP suggests that HIV/STD prevention activities are acceptable among rural- to-urban migrants. Their awareness of HIV/AIDS should be increased and HIV-related stigma should be reduced to increase the level of WTP. Recruitment and retention of individuals with high-risk behavior in prevention activities will be critical and challenging.

AB  - The dissertation distinguishes itself by a global and long-term perspective on a local past. Based on an exhaustive study of imperial records, local gazetteers, archeological studies, travel literature, and works by scholars of America, Europe, Southeast Asia, Japan, China, and Tibet that utilize diverse sources including English, Tibetan, French, Japanese, and Arabic, it explores the process over two thousand years by which Yunnan was transformed from a non-Chinese culture into part of China. The dissertation is inter-disciplinary, as it incorporates ethnography, commercial history, military history, frontier history, and Chinese colonialism. It firstly demonstrates the significance of Yunnan in the Eurasian communications by conceptualizing the Southwest Silk Road. Secondly, it illustrates how power struggles in eastern Eurasia shaped the fate of Yunnan. Then it examines the transformation of Yunnan in terms of demography, administration, new local identity, and economic-reorientation. The institutionalization of the native chieftain system ( tusi zhidu ) symbolize the success of Chinese administration; indigenization of Chinese immigrants and sinicization of the indigenous peoples resulted in the formation of the Yunnanese (Yunnan ren ), a provincial identity in late imperial China; silver mining, the collapse of the cowry money system, and the copper procurement in the Ming-Qing period show the economic re-orientation. Finally, ethnic identification shows how imperial legacy shaped modern state-building. The above issues tie directly to present inter-disciplinary concerns over the formation and nature of Chineseness, ancient Eurasian communications, Chinese colonialism, frontiers in a comparative context, world-system debates, late imperial China, and ethnic relations and politics in twentieth century China. This dissertation may serve to demonstrate the feasibility of world history as an alternative to regional and national studies. Firstly, it shows that a large analytic framework is feasible for a doctoral research. Secondly, it argues that a world history approach is necessary to reveal the dynamics of local past that usually is confined within the categories of national boundaries

AB  - When the Vietnam War ended in 1975, pro-US Laotians (including Lao, Mien, Khmu) were displaced and became refugees in their own native country. Thousands fled to refugee camps in nearby Thailand and were eventually relocated to several Western countries, including the US. A listing of 1,195 Laotian cancer cases were extracted from the California Cancer Registry for diagnosis years 1988-2006. Cancer cases with birthplace coded as "Laos" were included. Proportionate incidence ratios (PIRs) and associated 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for 17 selected cancer sites. The total population of California (all race/ethnic groups combined) was used as the reference. Proportional occurrence of cancers varied by genders and by cancer sites. Laotians in California experienced statistically significantly elevated risks for cancer of the nasopharynx (PIR = 14.8; 95% CI = 10.5-20.1), liver (PIR = 12.6; 95% CI = 10.8-14.6), stomach (PIR = 3.1; 95% CI = 2.4-4.0), cervix (PIR = 1.9; 95% CI = 1.5-2.3), pancreas (PIR = 2.1; 95% CI = 1.5-2.8), oral cavity (PIR = 1.8; 95% CI = 1.4-2.3), lung and bronchus (PIR = 1.4; 95% CI = 1.2-1.7). As found for other Asian subgroups, Laotians, too, have statistically significantly reduced risks for colorectal (PIR = 0.8; 95% CI = 0.6-0.9), colon (PIR = 0.7; 95% CI 0.5-0.9), breast (PIR 0.7; 95% CI = 0.5-0.8), and prostate (PIR = 0.1; 95% CI = 0.0-0.2) cancers. The increased risk found for mostly non-Western types of cancers have implications for culturally responsive cancer control and intervention activities targeting the Laotian population

AB  - The article discusses the significance and contribution of professionals and scientists on the development of the society and also emphasizes on the treatment rendered to them by the public as well as the government. The article points out that the mass of men live lives of quiet desperation. The privilege of the professional and scientific few, among whom health workers may be counted, is the intellectual challenge of their work in terms of the creative opportunities it affords and the moral rewards of their role in terms of service to fellow human beings. Scientist incurs the displeasure of his government, for utterly trivial reasons like for voicing his objection to official policies. They not only risk imprisonment, death, and physical torture, but also access to the world of science, and communication with peers. The article cites example of the report presented by the American Public Health Association's task force on Chile. The Chilean prisoners of conscience and exiles are unusual because many of them are public health workers. Science and the health professions transcend national boundaries and demand international exchange and communications

AB  - DHARAMSALA, India -- His daring escape from Tibet seemed out of a movie. Then only 14, Ogyen Trinley Dorje was one of Tibetan Buddhism's most revered incarnate lamas, and his journey through the icy passes of the Himalayas was viewed as a major embarrassment for China. The youth arrived in India in early 2000 to a euphoric greeting from Tibetan exiles. India, though, was less certain about what to do with him. Intelligence agencies, suspicious of his loyalties and skeptical of his miraculous escape, interrogated him and tightly restricted his travel. He remains mostly confined to the mountainside monastery of a Tibetan sect different from his own. And that spurred an idea: He wanted his own monastery. Eventually, his aides struck a deal to buy land.

Mr. Harris-Moore, who inspired Facebook tribute pages and supportive T-shirts (''Momma Tried,'' one said) for his remarkable ability to elude law enforcement over the years, smiled occasionally in court but said little beyond ''Yes, sir'' to Judge Richard A. Jones of United States District Court, and ''guilty'' seven times.

AB  - After the change of governments in Vietnam and Cambodia and amidst turmoil in the mid 1970s, many Southeast Asians, fearing reprisals, emigrated from these countries. Among them were children, many of whom were separated from their families prior to, or during, their escape. Many of them have been resettled in the Western countries from the refugee camps, and now are adolescents or are entering into young adulthood. With memories of the war and the stress of separation from family and adaptation to different cultures, psychosocial problems are common in this population. Occupational therapy can help these clients by providing opportunities to: (1) practice appropriate human occupations and establish more satisfying relationships; (2) facilitate release and sublimation of emotional drives; (3) enhance smooth transition and adaptation to the new environment; and (4) assist in the adoption of appropriate occupational roles. General principles are proposed for developing occupational therapy services that are appropriate and culturally relevant to the needs of this client group. Occupational therapists can play an important role in assisting the clients in resettlement, pursuing better duality of life and being a contributing member of the society.

AB  - Given the increasing urbanization of the world's population, how people thrive and survive in high density urban environments is a topic of profound interest to nation states and governments. Books have focused on 'poverty and place' and 'geography of opportunity,' questioning the influence of neighborhood environs on the future social mobility of those who inhabit those neighborhoods. This anthology describes and analyzes the living conditions of marginalized persons in cities and neighborhoods across the globe and the consequential impact on their future social mobility. Chapters focus on key issues that include immigration, educational underachievement, urban renewal, public health, immigration, homelessness, environmental issues, race, segregation, and the marginality of urban youth and economically disadvantaged groups

AB  - With global economic restructuring, one of the most striking migration flows within Asia has been that of women migrating to work as paid domestic workers in the region's higher growth economies. Drawing on in-depth interviews, we focus on the negotiation of mobility and work practices between employers in Singapore and their 'foreign maids' within home-space. We investigate the way employers define domestic work practices through 'ground rules' which fix and confine the body to specific time-spaces and postures, rendering the migrant domestic worker a non-mobile subject. We also explore the strategies of the domestic worker in circumventing rules in a bid to regain mobility. Using 'homespace' as the site of analysis, the paper illustrates the everyday production of (im)mobilities in a city-state where 'migration' and 'migrants' occupy a paradoxical place in its bid for global-city status.

AB  - In July 1969, the Supreme Soviet passed major legislation to codify and update criminal codes and criminal procedures: the Fundamentals of Corrective Labor Legislation, the Statute on Remand in Custody, and the Law on Introducing Addenda and Amendments to the Fundamentals of Criminal Legislation. A brief history of criminal justice legislation prior to 1969 focuses on relationships between the central government and the 15 sovereign Union Republics in matters of law. An examination of the Fundamentals of Corrective Labor Legislation covers the penalties of imprisonment, exile, restricted residence, and corrective labor without imprisonment. Specific areas addressed include suspended sentences, criteria for selecting the place of imprisonment, political and educational rehabilitation programs, the legal status of convicted persons, public and prosecutorial controls over corrective labor institutions, inmate classification, prison rules, programs for juvenile offenders, prison conditions, and supervision of ex-offenders. The book then analyzes the Statute on Remand in Custody which defines the requirements and procedures for remanding suspects, accused persons, and defendants in detention facilities. Amendments to the Fundamentals of Corrective Labor Legislation are discussed, with attention to provisions targeted to recidivists and revised rules governing conditional release from a correctional program before the term has expired

AB  - The purpose of this study was to understand the experiential nature and meaning of leisure in the daily lives of Korean Americans, to investigate the process of development of their racial and ethnic identity; and to explore the roles of leisure playing in the creation of racial and ethnic identity. The in-depth interviews with 21 Korean immigrants showed that although all of them knew the English term "leisure," most of the 1 st generation participants used the Korean term "yeo-gah" instead. In general, the understanding of the term "yeo-gah" or "leisure" among the participants was quite similar to the notions of "leisure," as defined in Western literature. The distinctive patterns of leisure behavior among Korean Americans included gender separation in leisure settings and relative lack of family-oriented leisure engagements among Korean men. Korean Americans developed three different types of racialized ethnic identities: (a) diasporic ethnic identity---developed beyond the confines of a nation state and intermixed with assigned racial identity; (b) ethnic American identity---developed in reference to the American society and combined with assigned racial identity; and (c) situational ethnic and racial identity---ethnic identity developed in reference to the American society and intertwined with the affirmative racial identity. The type of ethnic/racial identity interviewees developed was dependent on their generational track, the length of exposure to the American society, and the English language proficiency. The higher the generational track, the longer the length of exposure to the American society, and the higher the English proficiency, the more Korean American interviewees appeared to embrace the situational ethnic and racial identity. The participants in this study constructed their ethic identities through the recognition of and practices of their unique ethnic culture, and through the experience of racial discrimination. In constructing the affirmative racial identity, the awareness of unequal racialized system, the experience of racial discrimination, and the feelings of comfort with the similar racial group played important roles. Leisure engagements played significant roles in the formation of racial and ethnic identity, in that leisure sites were the places where people freely displayed their unique culture and where they experienced discrimination

AB  - As a child growing up in Cambodia, Ronnie Yimsut played among the ruins of the Angkor Wat temples, surrounded by a close-knit community. As the Khmer Rouge gained power and began its genocidal reign of terror, his life became a nightmare. In this stunning memoir, Yimsut describes how, in the wake of death and destruction, he decides to live. Escaping the turmoil of Cambodia, he makes a perilous journey through the jungle into Thailand, only to be sent to a notorious Thai prison. Fortunately, he is able to reach a refugee camp and ultimately migrate to the United States, where he attended the University of Oregon and became an influential leader in the community of Cambodian immigrants. Facing the Khmer Rouge shows Ronnie Yimsut's personal quest to rehabilitate himself, make a new life in America, and then return to Cambodia to help rebuild the land of his birth.

AB  - The physical fabric of San Francisco's Chinatown was influenced by the demographic structure of Chinese American immigration and the discrimination. The immigrants were predominantly single males in search of employment and wealth. A series of Anti-Chinese Exclusion Acts beginning in 1882, which remained in force until World War II, froze the Chinese American population in the mode of newly arrived immigrants for more than 70 years, and the patterns of daily life and the social organizations, that had been created to serve newly arrived males, continued to dominate the Chinese American community. The dialect, district, and surname associations, which had been founded in the nineteenth century, became an interlocking network of institutions that came to dominate Chinatown life. Discriminatory rental policies kept them confined to a small area at the western edge of the central business district. The Chinese were barred from owning property by the State of California and had to slowly adapt the existing urban fabric to better serve their needs. The resulting landscape adapted standard American buildings to better serve the requirements of a hybrid immigrant culture. Crowded residential hotels occupied every space not already taken by the associations, temples, shops, small factories, brothels, gambling houses, and theaters. The 1906 Earthquake and Fire provided the Chinese with an opportunity to more closely shape Chinatown to their needs. New decorative treatments graced the buildings occupied by associations, and some commercial buildings attempted a Sinocized appearance. The rebuilding focused on reinforcing the established social hierarchy of associations, and towards capturing more of the tourist trade. Christian churches and missions were constructed around the edges to serve and convert the community. After World War II families began moving to residential areas turning Chinatown into a home for new immigrants and the elderly. Unlike revivalist design, new buildings inspired by the Modern Movement began to visually fragment the physical fabric. The expansion of the Financial District and rising property values threaten the continued existence of the community

AB  - The CDC Pediatric Nutrition Surveillance System (PedNSS) monitors the general health and nutritional characteristics of low-income U.S. children who participate in multiple public health programs. This system is intended to characterize trends and patterns in key indicators of nutritional status so that the information can be used for program planning and targeting. The indicators monitored by PedNSS are birth weight, childhood growth status, anemia, and breast-feeding patterns. From 1980 through 1991, the trends for low birth weight, low height-for-age (shortness), low weight-for-height (thinness), and high weight-for-height (overweight) were stable for all children monitored by the PedNSS, with the exception of Asian children, who were predominantly of Southeast Asian refugee background. In the early 1980s, the prevalence of low birth weight and shortness was higher among Asian children than among children of other racial or ethnic groups who were monitored by the PedNSS. However, these prevalences declined steadily from 1980 through 1991. By 1991, the prevalences of low birth weight and shortness for Asian children were similar to those observed for children of other races/ethnic groups. Overall, low-income U.S. children had a slightly lower height-for-age than expected, indicating that some of these children were at a health and nutritional disadvantage. The prevalence of overweight varied among different racial/ethnic groups; Hispanic and Native American children had the highest prevalences of overweight. The 20%-30% prevalence of anemia among low-income children monitored by the PedNSS was higher than among the general population, reflecting in part the preferential enrollment and retention of anemic children by public health nutrition programs and also indicating that many children had inadequate iron nutrition. From 1980 through 1991, the prevalence of anemia declined > 5% for most of the age- and race/ethnicity-specific groups monitored by PedNSS. That decline represents an improvement in iron nutritional status. PedNSS is a useful system for the monitoring and characterization of the nutrition status of low-income children at both state and national levels

AB  - Since there are about 42 million people worldwide who have been forcibly displaced from their homelands, resettlement countries have begun to recognise the need for more services aimed at assisting children and families facing secondary stressors and psychological distress caused by war-related trauma. Despite this awareness, there is a lack of current literature exploring the experiences and practices of front-line service providers. In this qualitative case study, 12 staff of a psychosocial early intervention programme for refugee children shared their observations of children's experiences during early years of adjustment in a resettlement country. The study focused on perceptions of hope �_" experiences that engendered or hindered hope in the children, and ways in which staff viewed their own work in nurturing hope. Interviews uncovered three main themes: �_ohope is like a seed�__; �_oinvisible seeds �_" some challenges that hinder hope�__; and �_ovisible seeds �_" some experiences engender hope�__. Findings highlight the range of challenges encountered by refugee children and families in post-migration contexts, the importance of hopeful orientations for service providers working with children with known histories of trauma, and how hope is nurtured in the context of caring relationships

AB  - BACKGROUND: There seems to be a large magnitude of parasitic worm loads caused by nocturnally periodic Wuchereria bancrofti and geohelminths, in cross-border Myanmar migrant workers in Thailand. We are therefore considering an effective Mass Drug Administration (MDA) with Diethylcarbamazine (DEC) and Albendazole (ABZ). Due to short periods of their residency and current situation of W. bancrofti antigenemics and concomitant geohelminths, treatment effects on the containment of the infections need to be analyzed OBJECTIVES: Analyze short-term effects on reduction of W. bancrofti antigen (WbAg) and geohelminths' egg (GhE) loads. The efficacy of a single-dose combined treatment with 300 mg DEC (for filariasis) and 400 mg ABZ (for helminthiasis) was evaluated and compared with a single-dose treatment arm with 300 mg DEC alone MATERIAL AND METHOD: A randomized clinical trial of two treatment choices in 28 Myanmar male workers (DEC/ABZ or group I = 15, DEC or group II = 13) was conducted in Phang Nga province, Southern Thailand. Because of the withdrawal of three subjects of the DEC group, all the 10 DEC subjects were follow-up monitored at post treatment 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks. Their mean age was 26.4 years; worm loads (mean +/- SD x 10(3)) of W. bancrofti, Ascaris and Trichuris was 103.9 +/- 44.1 antigen units (AU)/ml, 47.3 +/- 38.7 eggs per gram (EPG) and 16.6 +/- 22.2 EPG respectively. The data on the 15 DEC/ABZ subjects showed a mean age of 25.7 years; corresponding worm loads = 96.1 +/- 54.6 AU/ml, 397.0 +/- 117.3 EPG and 54.5 +/- 42.8 EPG respectively. The Antigen Reduction Rates (ARR) and Egg Reduction Rates (ERR) were presented RESULTS: At the 12-week post treatment, WbAg loads (mean +/- SD x 10(3) AU/ml) were 61.5 +/- 58.4 for group I and 76.8 +/- 40.7 for group II. A significant WbAg reduction was noted for both groups at weeks 8 and 12 (p < 0.05). Also, the significant reduction of GhE loads was more pronounced for both groups after week 2 (p < 0.05). When comparing efficacy of the treatment choices by the treatment retention time, it was more likely to show both groups had similar adulticidal effects on either WbAg, denoted as the ARR (F = 0. 064, p = 0.806) or GhE, denoted as the ERR (F = 0.196, p = 0.669) CONCLUSION: The single-dose 300 mg DEC plus 400 mg ABZ, or 300 mg DEC alone, can be effectively used for treating infections with W. bancrofti and concomitant geohelminths commonly observed in the area. But treatment rounds are required to clear the infections. The reduction of the parasitic worm loads in the legal Myanmar migrants provide values in monitoring and evaluating an effective MDA program with the DEC/ABZ at the provincial level

AB  - This research study describes and explains the relocation process of 33 elderly Vietnamese who left Vietnam, resettled and now live in Hawai'i. The threefold purpose of this research was to: (1) explore how elderly Vietnamese experience the relocation process, (2) discover how elderly Vietnamese handle their changing lives in terms of accommodation strategies, and (3) examine the implications of how elderly Vietnamese interpret their changing images of self during relocation. This qualitative investigation utilized participant observation and extended in-depth interviews as its main research tools. The analytical framework is theoretically embedded in the symbolic interactionist approach, and parallels the above mentioned threefold purpose by focusing on interactions, the process of handling change, and self-concepts. Close readings of major symbolic interaction theorists such as Mead, Blumer, Denzin, and Goffman contributed the key concepts of total institution and the self. Goffman's total institution provided an important theoretical tool in discussing the re-education camps used by the North Vietnamese in Vietnam, and symbolic interactionist notions of the self revealed a major theme throughout the relocation process as the elderly Vietnamese experienced construction, de-construction, and reconstruction of the self. An intriguing subject of study, this sense of self mirrors the dramatic changes experienced by elderly Vietnamese respondents as they interface and move through four different cultural symbol systems: the South Vietnamese cultural symbol system of the 1960s, the North Vietnamese socialist cultural system of the late 1970s and 1980s, the first-asylum refugee camps in the late 1980s, and finally the fourth cultural symbol system, Hawai'i in the 1990s. Four general issues emerged from the stories of the elderly Vietnamese reflecting their changing identities: the effects of social change on the presentation of self, the individuals' problems in accommodating new conditions, the relationship of class and status to resources, and the challenge of formulating relevant critical policies. Their stories give us insights into the resiliency of the self under changing conditions and the human capacity to accommodate by finding new meanings consistent with one's own sense of self, even as new conditions alter interactions

AB  - The human capital model of migration treats migration as an investment decision in which an individual is likely to move if he perceives that the present value of a future stream of earnings at a destination exceeds the present value of expected earnings at the origin by an amount at least equal to the cost of moving. This implies that the earnings of migrants increase faster than those of nonmigrants and the primary objective of this study is to test this hypothesis in a longitudinal framework. The hypothesis is examined on the basis of data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1979-1991. The target population is young males in the civilian labor force of the United States. This study is also confined to the individuals who can be presumed to make autonomous migration decisions. Rates of earnings growth are measured by the first difference of the natural logarithm of real annual earnings. The relationship between migration and earnings growth is examined in the context of a set of contemporaneous personal, occupational, and locational characteristics which are incorporated as control variables. The random effects model is used to estimate coefficients for the relationship between migration and the growth of earnings. Inter-county and inter-state migration are shown to have positive effects on the growth of earnings, at least for the first instance of migration in an individual's history. Coefficients that measure the effects of repeated instances of migration are not statistically significant. Educational attainment and job-related experience are observed to have positive effects on earnings growth for both migrants and nonmigrants. However, these effects are greater for migrants. The effects of migration on the growth of earnings apparently diminish with a migrant's age. The rate of post-migration earnings growth for migrants who are classified as professional, managerial, and technical workers, is also shown to be faster than that of their nonmigrant counterparts

AB  - The fate of the Church of England during its suppression by the godly party in Parliament from 1642 to 1660 has been largely ignored by historians. Loyal supporters of the Church of England and the Book of Common Prayer continued to exist throughout the eclipse of the episcopal government of the Church of England and the Book of Common Prayer after 1645 until the restoration of the monarchy and the traditional Church of England in 1660. These Anglicans did not subscribe to the attitudes and ideals of the godly, more commonly known as Puritans. Recent historiography on the Civil Wars and the interregional has tended to emphasize the role of the godly and the radical sects, ignoring the conforming majority of the English people. There was a distinctly Anglican community that survived in the face of godly demands for further reformation. These Anglicans, or Prayer Book Protestants, comprised approximately 80% of the population of England during the English Civil War and were responsible for the re-institution of Anglicanism at the Restoration. Anglicans continued to attend clandestine services according to the Book Common Prayer and to participate in Anglican rites of baptism, marriage, and burial in and from the church--all prohibited by parliamentary ordinance. Anglicans maintained their traditional festivities at Christmas, Easter, Pentecost, and Saints' days, as well as secular festivities centered around civic holidays. Private devotional literature and published secular literature that reflected their beliefs enabled Anglicans to preserve their faith, their rituals, and their traditional practices under the parliamentarian and Cromwellian regimes. Anglicans quietly supported priests who were ejected from their parishes, with the more affluent often employing them as chaplains to thew estates and tutors to their children. Despite sequestration, imprisonment, fines, and exile, the Anglican community survived with their rituals and devotion to the Book of Common Prayer intact after almost two decades of suppression

The efficacy of utilizing correctional facilities to reach offenders who self-report domestic violence behaviors is evaluated. The 52-week curriculum was designed to address the unique environment of a correctional setting and the characteristics of the participants, using established psycho-educational and cognitive-behavioral methods. A repeated measurement design was used to evaluate the participants' cognitive changes, including acceptance of personal responsibility for abusive behaviors. Using a modified Abusive Behavior Inventory along with Criminal Thinking Scales, participants were tested at intake and again at 18 sessions. Their responses were statistically significant to p < .01.

AB  - The article focuses on the situation in the Mugunga refugee camp near Goma, Zaire. This sort of nonsense runs deep in the camps. Convinced by their own propaganda, the Hutu refugees, many of them murderers, show no remorse. They claim more Hutus died than Tutsis. The government-in-exile, eager to rule Rwanda some day, does not want to be circumvented. But after nearly 11 months in the camps, many of the 2.2 million refugees appear willing to join any group that promises a safe return to their country. In Mugunga camp, once a favorite refuge of militants, their stolen Rwandan cars stand parked among the shelters

AB  - The primary purpose of this thesis is to demonstrate that refugee women who reside within refugee camps in the Third World are marginalized by a state centric international refugee regime at both the macro (systemic) and micro (Third World refugee camp) levels. This marginalization threatens their physical survival and forces refugee women into conditions where they are unable to maintain autonomous, independent, and culturally diverse existences. By examining the development of the international refugee regime at the systemic level and by looking at four refugee camp case studies, it is demonstrated that refugee women's concerns are subordinated to the interests of states and to the modernization imperative inherent in development initiatives. Though modern liberal Western feminism reveals the general circumstances in which refugee women live and makes attempts to redress them through international human rights law and development initiatives, it employs a monolithic framework to solve refugee women's problems and therefore continues to be part of their marginalization. Conversely, by building on postmodern notions of the right of sovereignty and the mechanism of discipline, it is demonstrated that postmodern feminism holds more potential as a perspective from which to identify and support the diverse ways in which refugee women survive. The conclusion of this thesis maintains that the uniform application of development initiatives and international human rights law can never meet all the diverse needs of refugee women especially in the context of a state centric international refugee regime. Instead, balancing and accommodating diversity and sameness is where the international refugee regime should be concentrating if it hopes to support meaningful, autonomous, and independent existences for refugee women

AB  - This dissertation is a historical analysis of politics of state building and health in Palestine and in Jordan. The study contributes to contextual studies of constructions of gender and health as a central aspect of modern nation-state building in the twentieth century. Processes of modern state building in the region of Bilad al Sham brought about significant transformations in definitions of health, development of health care systems, and medical practices. The study examines three aspects of these changes. First is a gender analysis of ways in which science and medicine contributed to colonialist processes of state building. Second is an exploration of particular effects of war, displacement and expulsion, and changing socioeconomic political conditions, on Palestinian women's health. Third, the study looks at the significance for Palestinian women healers, midwives, and others, of changes introduced in the health system by the British in Palestine and in Transjordan and by UNRWA in refugee camps in Jordan. A study of women and health requires a shift in dominant historiographical approaches. This dissertation develops an analytic framework that takes as its starting point questions raised by feminist epistemology. In the period addressed, the struggle for control of health systems is also a struggle for control of knowledge making. Aspects of this struggle disadvantage and invalidate knowledge bases of women healers. A central question of the study is: how do specific Palestinian refugee women construct meaning and authorize knowledge? This dissertation examines the particular relationship of Palestinian women to historical processes of war, citizenship in the modern nation-state, refugee status, relief efforts, and development processes. In addition to archival research, findings are based on oral histories with Palestinian women refugees in Jordan in order to understand how they interpret history and construct health. Findings show that Palestinian women represented in this study construct health as a socio-political phenomenon, rather than in purely biological terms, and that health is a metaphor for homecoming. Health concerns are central to Palestinian women's resistance: nationalist struggle is a historical reality informing their struggle for self definition, a struggle central to defining health. Oral histories represented in this study clarify the need to address Palestinian women's health in the context of gender, race, class politics dominating the region

AB  - In the last five centuries North America has witnessed the advent of history-making apocalyptic events like European and American expansionism into North and South America, the birth of an "Indian inspired" democracy in what is now the United States along with the genocide of the American Indian, whole species of plant and animal life driven to extinction by immigrant settlers to North America, and the invention of an industrial civilization. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries humans witnessed the history changing events of the birth of modern art, invention of the automobile and airplane, research inside the atom, the rise of paleo-anthropological theories on human origins--such as Darwin's theory of evolution--the invention of computers, research in outer space and more. All of these changes have, over time, contributed to a concomitant general perception that Western scientific paradigms and attitudes concerning human rationality and objectivity are more or less permanently cast in the socio-politico-cultural postures of the day. Normally Western ideology has taken precedence over those cultures and societies whose ideas are considered to be foreign to its own and has labelled them the "other". The North American Indian, through what was originally a sheer accident of history, has become one of those Others. The socialization and art-politics of Native American art has been present in different ways for centuries in North America, sometimes overtly and sometimes covertly. Native art politics and the attendant socialization are made manifest through employing the native perspective as the primary vehicle by which to understand what Native American people and artists think and say about their art and history. As a research method the native perspective takes us on a wide and far ranging journey, uncovering truths which are variously overlooked, forgotten, edited, disqualified on academic grounds, or otherwise ignored by professionals in other disciplines. It may be said that the native perspective is the raison d'etre of this thesis. The North American Indian has a real voice here, a voice unmodulated by Eurocentric interpretations and theories. It is a voice which has struggled valiantly, for centuries, to free itself from the isolationist confines and sentiments of an immigrant, so-called New World, such attitudes, arguably, having been born of a racist democracy and biased, parochialist history. Sources drawn upon here include American and Canadian Indian writers, historians, poets and political commentators; anthropologists and archaeologists; university administrators; Native artists; and my own personal experiences as an Indian artist and writer. There are many things which Native artists have in common, but there are equally as many things which they do not. There is no common or generic "Indian" to be found anywhere in North America, no center as such, although the many different First Nations do share that name in common gratis Christopher Columbus and his wayward band of adventurers. The issues and trends found in Native American art are many with each taking on its own unique objective and subjective shapes and forms depending upon the individual artist's or author's view point. In short, the paradigm Native American art is a sovereign idea in its own right

AB  - The article discusses the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) detention of refugee children and the situation of thses children who are seeking refugee protection in the U.S. Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, the INS has broad authority to detain newcomers who lack appropriate documentation to enter the U.S. In 1985, a class action lawsuit was filed against the INS, challenging the agency's arrest, processing, detention, and release of minors in its custody. In 1993, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the INS on several issues, but the parties to the lawsuit were able to negotiate a settlement on other key issues, including the detention, release, and treatment of minors in INS custody. This settlement is known as the Flores settlement agreement. The Flores agreement recognizes two fundamental principles. They are, minors should be treated with dignity, respect, and special concern for their particular vulnerability and children should be held in the least restrictive setting possible or, when appropriate released from detention to an individual or entity willing to ensure the child's safety and timely appearance in immigration court

AB  - Labor migration and commerce between Sudan and Libya have long been features of livelihoods in Darfur. This paper describes the importance of historical trade and migration links between Darfur and Libya, and provides a background to the political and economic situation in Libya which has influenced opportunities for Sudanese migrant workers. A case study of the situation of the Darfurian migrants in Kufra (an oasis and transnational trade hub in southern Libya) illustrates how the recent Darfur conflict has affected migration patterns from Darfur and remittance flows in the opposite direction. Official estimates of Darfurian migrant workers in Libya were unavailable but were estimated to be between 150,000 and 250,000. The closure of the national border between Sudan and Libya in May 2003, largely a result of insecurity in Darfur, stopped the traffic of migrant workers between northern Darfur and southern Libya (which prevented the onward travel to Sudan of several thousand migrants in Kufra), and curtailed the well-established trade routes, communications, and remittance flows. The current limited economic prospects for migrant workers in Libya, combined with the threat of detention, difficulties of return to Sudan, and loss of contact with and uncertainty about the fate of their families in Darfur, have created a sense of despair among many Darfurians. The paper concludes with a series of recommendations to improve the conditions of the Darfurian migrants in Libya, including an amnesty for illegal migrants, and also to ease the travel of migrants, promote communications between Libya and Darfur, and support the flow of remittances.

AB  - (from the chapter) Most people who receive treatment after surviving torture are refugees and asylum-seekers. This chapter focuses on their needs. However, much will also be applicable to other people who may have been tortured, such as following political imprisonments, and people working in the armed forces. Using a composite case example and referring to relevant literature, this chapter focuses on how you can work cognitively with the shame, alienation, and dehumanization that often follow torture. It also briefly addresses, first, whether you should focus on treating post-traumatic reactions while clients might also have a range of serious social, economic, legal, and/or physical difficulties, and second, how you can modify traditional reliving treatments for traumatic stress for clients with multiple traumas, often extending over months and years. This chapter will not focus on the debate about using Western models of mental illness to understand the difficulties faced by traumatized refugees (e.g., Summerfield, 2001). Rather, it will take as its starting point the convincing body of research pointing to the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in nonrefugees (National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health (NCCMH), 2005), as well as the small but promising number of studies and articles suggesting that CBT can be used successfully to treat traumatized refugees and asylum-seekers (e.g., d'Ardenne, Ruaro, Cestari, Wakhoury, & Priebe, 2007; Grey & Young, 2008; Paunovic & Ost, 2001; Schulz, Resick, Huber, & Griffin, 2006). Issues concerning the delivery of CBT for PTSD through an interpreter are not examined in this chapter (see d'Ardenne and Farmer, Chapter 18, this volume (see record 2009-13265-018)).

AB  - Objectives: To explore whether a period of intensive international recruitment by the English National Health Service (NHS) achieved its objectives of boosting workforce numbers and to set this against the wider costs, longer-term challenges and questions arising. Methods: A postal survey of all pre-2006 NHS providers, Strategic Health Authorities and Deans of Postgraduate Medical Education obtained information on 284 (45%) organizations (142 completed questionnaires). Eight subsequent case studies (74 interviews) covered medical consultant, general practitioner, nurse, midwife and allied health professional recruitment. Results: Most respondents had undertaken or facilitated international recruitment between 2001 and 2006 and believed that it had enabled them to address immediate staff shortages. Views on longer-term implications, such as recruit retention, were more equivocal. Most organizations had made only a limited value-for-money assessment, balancing direct expenditure on overseas recruitment against savings on temporary staff. Other short and long-term transaction and opportunity costs arose from pressures on existing staff, time spent on induction/pastoral support, and human resource management and workforce planning challenges. Though recognized, these extensive 'hidden costs' for NHS organizations were harder to assess as were the implications for source countries and migrant staff. Conclusions: The main achievement of the intensive international recruitment period from a UK viewpoint was that such a major undertaking was seen through without major disruption to NHS services. The wider costs and challenges meant, however, that large-scale international recruitment was not sustainable as a solution to workforce shortages. Should such approaches be attempted in future, a clearer upfront appraisal of all the potential costs and implications will be vital.

AB  - The essay explores the significance of questions of knowledge to the depiction of prisoners in three prominent katorga narratives from the second half of the nineteenth century: Dostoevskii's Notes from the House of the Dead, Kennan's Siberia and the Exile System, and Chekhov's Sakhalin Island. Comparing the different discourses of unknowability these authors employ, it argues that the relationship of the writers or narrators to the outcast status of the convicts takes their texts beyond the immediate context, to shape views of the penal system as expressing the increasing instability of identity, social hierarchies and moral life in Russia.

AB  - The current study focuses on three dimensions of treatment neighborhood environments that may influence treatment retention: neighborhood disadvantage, stability, and concentrated immigration. We examined treatment outcomes for a total of 9,319 individuals who were admitted for initial treatment in 56 outpatient clinics in Cook County, Illinois. Census-tract-level data were used to measure facility neighborhood environment. We found that neighborhood disadvantage was unrelated to individual treatment completion. Immigrant concentration was found to increase the likelihood of substance abuse treatment completion, although it was attenuated after controlling for patient problem severity and referral sources. Neighborhood stability was found to be positively related to treatment completion. These results suggest that knowledge of neighborhood context should be an important consideration when making placement decisions of new treatment facilities. Knowledge of neighborhood impact on treatment attrition should also be considered essential information to be used for client placement, treatment program design, and discharge protocols.

AB  - Based on ethnographic fieldwork in the San Francisco Bay area, this study traces the emergence of a Chinese immigrant working-class patriarchy that is enabled by the articulation of "traditional" Chinese femininity with new or reinvented gendered expectations in immigrant settings. I argue that the emergence and configuration of this patriarchy demonstrates the flexibility of patriarchal ruling. Its formation of new gendered expectations in immigrant settings by no means indicates that the "old" values from the homeland, such as chastity, self-sacrifice, and self-abnegation, have become obsolete upon migration, or that these gendered expectations are uniquely "ethnic Chinese." On the contrary, the "old" values are reinvented and invoked by the Chinese immigrant working-class patriarchy to build and sustain its power in U.S. society. Therefore, this patriarchy also implicates the structural patriarchy and the racial and class inequalities of the host society. Finally, I contend that various patriarchal hegemonies-East or West, American or Chinese, ethnic or mainstream, traditional or contemporary-should be interpreted in a way that illuminates not just their uniqueness but also their internal connections, mutual constitutions, and constant negotiations.

AB  - The immigrant student population is becoming the major minority student group in the United States, but few studies have examined whether immigrant high school students receive equal opportunities to learn mathematics. This study applies the opportunity to learn (OTL) framework to investigate immigrant high school students' opportunity to learn mathematics. This study measures immigrant high school students' OTL in terms of their odds of being assigned to the academic mathematics course track and to highly qualified mathematics teachers, as well as of their mathematics achievement. The data set for this study was extracted from the first two waves of Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002) and multiple imputation method was applied to calculate missing values for all variables. A series of multivariate models were developed for each of the three research questions. Findings show that immigrant high school sophomores receive unequal opportunities to learn mathematics after controlling for their race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES), family composition, grade retention history, school location, school type, and school SES. First generation immigrant sophomores have significantly lower mathematics test scores than their native peers. Sophomores with limited English proficiency (LEP) are significantly less likely to be placed into the college-bound mathematics course track and be assigned to highly qualified mathematics teachers. LEP status is also significantly and negatively associated with immigrant high school sophomores' mathematics test scores and this negative effect increases when LEP students are placed in an English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) program or the non-academic mathematics course track. For seniors, however, after controlling for 10 th grade mathematics test scores, neither LEP status nor ESL placement history is significantly associated with their mathematics achievement. Placement in an ESL program is significantly and negatively associated with immigrant high school sophomores' probability both of being placed in the college-bound mathematics course track and of being assigned to highly qualified mathematics teachers. Being placed in an ESL program is also significantly and negatively associated with immigrant high school sophomores' mathematics achievement. LEP high school sophomores who were ever placed in an ESL program score significantly lower than do their LEP peers who were never placed in an ESL program. For high school sophomores who are placed in the non-academic mathematics course track, being placed in an ESL program also make them score significantly lower compared with those who were never placed in an ESL program. After controlling for 10 th grade mathematics achievement, both negative interactive effects of ESL placement (with LEP and with nonacademic tracks) disappear for seniors

AB  - Abstract: China is undergoing dramatic changes through the rapid economic development that is associated with rapid urbanisation, which leads to nationwide migration. As many as 5,000,000 rural migrants have moved to Beijing. This research explores the challenge of appropriate housing to accommodate these migrants as the consequence of the dual urban and rural population registration system (hukou). The hukou system restrains the accessibility to various affordable housing mechanisms that are only available for urban hukou holders. Through analysing various existing alternative affordable housing policies, the authors have come to a view that the rented basement has been a compromise solution for migrants in Beijing. However, living in basement creates several social, economic and environmental issues, as noted through detailed surveys of the authors in the three specific cases in Beijing. It is the view of the authors that some of these problems were generated by the inappropriate management and in contradiction to policies made by the local government.

AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the usefulness of two IS6110 based typing methods, an amplityping assay and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, for fingerprinting respiratory isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis METHODS: For amplityping, a pair of primers which amplify the intervening sequence between the repetitive insertion sequence IS6110 was used to generate a banding pattern which was confirmed by hybridisation. This assay was compared with conventional chromosomal DNA RFLP typing in the evaluation of 110 epidemiologically diverse isolates RESULTS: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplityping generated a single pattern in Hong Kong Chinese strains, but two and four diverse patterns in Filipino and Vietnamese strains, respectively, and could be completed within four days. When compared with chromosomal DNA RFLP typing, which took three weeks to complete, four different RFLP patterns could be seen among the Chinese strains, while seven patterns were found in the Filipino and Vietnamese strains. No change in amplityping or RFLP patterns was found in 36 sequential isolates from the same patients after anti-tuberculosis treatment for up to 12 months, despite the emergence of resistance in three of these strains. No specific amplityping or RFLP pattern could be related to different patterns of drug susceptibility CONCLUSION: PCR amplityping could be used initially as a rapid typing method to distinguish strains originating from different localities. This could be important for investigation of outbreaks of tuberculosis--for example, in refugee camps

Beginning with a conceptual understanding of family health social work practice, Dr. Yuen distinguishes various approaches for defining and understanding health issues and urges readers to change their perspectives on health and family practice. Contributors address family health practice interventions as well as policy, programs, and emerging family themes, and they include case studies and examples. Regarding practice interventions, Skibinski and Connor focus on child sexual abuse examination and treatment processes, highlight the importance of diversion programs, and suggest helpful child sexual abuse litigation strategies. Pardeck introduces the use of bibliotherapy when working with children of divorced parents and offers practical steps to match appropriate books with specific problems. Dollar addresses adaptive strategies for assisting rural families living with HIV/AIDS and discusses high-risk groups, poverty, and the multiple impacts and stressors on, as well as family and community interventions for, this emerging and neglected population. Orgassa contributes on the topic of families with children with disabilities and utilizes a crisis intervention helping model that reflects family health care services. Burris centers on children's reactions to loss in terms of grief and coping, offers practical ways of helping, and discusses developmental issues involved in the process. Ramirez Barranti explores the personal characteristics of Mexican migrant and seasonal and life experiences of this group. Addressing policy and program concerns, Price highlights an increasingly visible family pattern of grandparents as parents and helps readers understand the concerns of custodial grandparents. She underlines psychosocial challenges, racial and ethnic considerations, problem behaviors of grandchildren, and relationship issues with adult children. Kennedy writes about lesbian and gay families and comments on legal inequities, such as custody laws, health insurance, tax laws, medical care, and estate planning. Taylor analyzes the child welfare and foster care policies affecting family health and well-being, pointing out service differentiation, policies of contradictory care, child welfare services, and the need for child health care services. Eggman portrays the health care needs of homeless women with children, discussing demographics, historical events, poverty and homelessness, and previous health care policies for homeless families. She revisits the issues of health and health care for homeless families and offers an interesting model of family health care for this population. Nicotera opens up the neighborhood as a resource for family health care practice, discusses understanding the neighborhood as a habitat and niche, and reviews literature from the adult's and child's worldviews. She suggests that the neighborhood is an appropriate resource for understanding assessment and intervention. Finally, Erlich examines family health and community practice and focuses on decent housing, safe streets, adequate transportation, day care, and recreation. His paradigm revolves around two programs: PREPARE (Problems, Reality, Establish, People, Assess, Risks, Evaluate) and IMAGINE (Idea, Muster, Assets, Goals, Implement, Neutralize, Evaluate).

AB  - Using Lin Ma Hang Village in Sha Tau Kok, Hong Kong's New Territories as a case study, this thesis gives an historical account of how indigenous villagers living in the border area adjusted to political and social changes following the lease of the New Territories by Britain until Hong Kong's return to China, and how they inherited the Hakka culture through different ways. Emphasis has been placed on the manifestations and material culture of Hakka people, studies into their internal consciousness has not attracted much attention. Lin Ma Hang is a specific case to look into the Hakim psychology in the context of a closed area. Adjacent to the boundary between Hong Kong and the Mainland China, this is an indigenous Hakka-speaking village. For many years during the Qing Dynasty, its villagers had to walk on a bridge that enabled them to reach their farmland located on the other side of the Shenzhen River. However, after the Qing Government's signed unequal treaty, Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory in 1898 which allowed Britain to lease the New Territories, the original village area of Lin Ma Hang was divided into two parts - the Chinese side and the British side, with the Shenzhen River serving as the boundary. Indigenous villagers from Lin Ma Hang, which came under the jurisdiction of Britain, continued to cross this bridge to the Chinese side, just like their forefathers. Such border-crossing practice was maintained even during the 1960s when the Mainland China suffered a famine which led to mass exoduses of people and political and social turmoil such as the Cultural Revolution. Since the 1980s, the entire village has been enclosed by iron fences by the British for security reasons, which posed a formidable obstacle to the villagers' daily lives and travelling to nearby markets, and a psychological imprisonment in the minds of villagers, and their gradual loss of control of their farmland. However, it appears that the spirit of endurance embedded in Hakka culture had enabled them to overcome all types of obstacles and reestablish their confidence to communicate with the outside world, continuing their fight for the opening up of the closed area. After the return to China, the Hong Kong Government finally decided in January 2008 to reduce the Frontier Closed Area (FCA) coverage from about 2,800 hectares to about 400 hectares and over half of the people residing inside the current FCA are no longer required to have a closed area permit to enter or leave the excised area. For over a century, Lin Ma Hang villagers, especially some Hakka women, can be considered as ambassadors promoting communication between Hong Kong and Shenzhen. They not only witnessed the changing relations between China and Britain, but they also moved between different identities as Chinese, Hakka and Hong Kong people. The history of Lin Ma Hang records the experience of a group of Chinese refugees with Hakka consciousness, mostly with the surname Yip, who lived under British and subsequently Japanese rule and became Hong Kong people after the Second World War. It also highlights the complex and multi-layered nature of Hakka identity. With the case study of the Lin Ma Hang Hakka village, this thesis attempts to explore the Hakka culture that has been ignored by Hong Kong people. It signifies how an indigenous village, which was divided up due to political reasons, survives through its unique ways

AB  - Achieving long-term resettlement success is a challenge for many refugees seeking to restart their lives after displacement and being uprooted from their lives. Refugees must deal with finding employment, integrating into a society immensely different from what they have known their whole lives, and starting over from scratch. Learning a new language enables refugees to progress towards integration and long-term resettlement success, however, resettled refugees face a multitude of barriers in the U.S. to accessing language classes and attaining English proficiency. This study seeks to bridge this problem by exploring the possibilities of implementing a standardized language training program in the refugee camps to better prepare refugees for resettlement. A case study of the refugees along the Thai-Burma border demonstrated the significance of learning English in the camps on eventual English proficiency as well as the need for increased partnerships to overcome the barriers of lack of motivation and lack of funding. The author explores the possibilities of implementing a language training program in the camps by determining need, interest, barriers, and perceptions through the use of interviews, surveys, and focus groups of camp refugees, resettled refugees, and key organizational representatives. The significance of these results offers the possibility of leveraging and unlocking resettlement as a durable solution for more of the world's refugees in protracted situations

AB  - The Spanish Female Communists reorganized themselves in 1945, during their French exile, in order to mobilize Spanish refugee women in their resistance against the Franco regime. The heroines discussed in the Mujeres Antifascistas Espanolas journal play an important part in these women's political culture. Accounts where reality and fiction intertwine depict virgin warriors and heroic mothers. Individual or collective heroic representations (The Thirteen Roses from Madrid) are part of the myth without, however, contradicting the traditional gender system. Instead they allow these heroines to enter Spanish history and the collective memory about the opponents to Franco's regime. // ABSTRACT IN FRENCH: Les femmes communistes espagnoles reconstitu+�rent leur organisation en 1945, dans l'exil fran+�ais, afin de mobiliser les r+�fugi+�es dans la r+�sistance antifranquiste. Les figures d'h+�ro+�nes +�voqu+�es dans la revue Mujeres Antifascistas Espa+�olas, tiennent une place importante dans la culture politique de ces femmes. Des r+�cits, o+� r+�alit+� et fiction se m+�lent, mettent en sc+�ne vierges guerri+�res et m+�res h+�ro+�ques. Si l'h+�ro+�sation individuelle ou collective (les treize roses de Madrid) confine parfois au mythe, sans remettre en cause le syst+�me traditionnel de genre, elle permet d'inscrire ces h+�ro+�nes dans l'histoire de l'Espagne et dans la m+�moire collective des opposants au r+�gime du g+�n+�ral Franco.

AB  - Some recent data are presented on the size and selected sociodemographic characteristics of the Afghan refugee population in Pakistan. Although the official figures show that there were 3.27 million registered Afghan refugees in Pakistan, it is estimated that the actual number may be as high as 3.6 million. There is an excess of females over males, mainly due to war-related activities and excessive casualties particularly among males. While infant and childhood mortality rates are declining and are lower than the levels prevalent in Pakistan, as well as in Afghanistan during the pre-war period, the fertility levels among Afghan refugees seem very high indeed

AB  - This essay, which analyzes what is happening in "Fortress Europe" as a result of (postcolonial) migration, deals with the geography and politics of migration in the South of Italy, in Puglia and on Italy's southernmost island, Lampedusa ("the Southern Gate to Fortress Europe," Andrijasevic 2006) where people arriving on "despair boats" are confined in temporary holding centers, places reminiscent of Nazi concentration camps. Taking account of the fact that the primary regions of origin of these undocumented migrants have been identified by NGO (ARCI and M��decins sans Fronti��res) as the Middle East, Maghreb, Horn of Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa, the essay examines Fanon's theory on the specular distortion, violence, and rejection arising from the racist encounters between colonizers and colonized, as expressed in The Wretched of the Earth, to see if and how his thought can be useful in reading contemporary violent relations between ex-colonizers and post-colonial peoples. Adopting Fanon's scheme--humanism, justice, cosmopolitanism, the constructivity of race--as guidelines for a discussion of contemporary migration, the essay questions the transplanting of hierarchization and apartheid practices into European nation-states faced with the perspective of a univers concentrationnaire. Then it tries to find ways to dismantle this perspective and offer an epistemologico-political alternative with the help of Fanon's view that "total liberation concerns every aspect of personality"--re-read through a displaced female Algerian intellectual, Assia Djebar, who writes of decolonization as a definite break with the legacy of violence and mourning that Fanon was nevertheless imbued with. The self-exiled Algerian writer goes as far as stripping down the Algerian national language as an act of decolonization, beyond postcoloniality, in order to redefine freedom. Issues also discussed are: citizenship and denizens (Arendt, Agamben), the right to citizenship as a human right, cohabitation versus militarization, droit de cit�� (Balibar, Derrida), right to write as �existence.

AB  - During the Second World War, an unprecedented number of families were torn apart. As the Nazi empire crumbled, millions roamed the continent in search of their loved ones. The Lost Children tells the story of these families, and of the struggle to determine their fate. We see how the reconstruction of families quickly became synonymous with the survival of European civilization itself. Even as Allied officials and humanitarian organizations proclaimed a new era of individualist and internationalist values, Tara Zahra demonstrates that they defined the "best interests" of children in nationalist terms. Sovereign nations and families were seen as the key to the psychological rehabilitation of traumatized individuals and the peace and stability of Europe. Based on original research in German, French, Czech, Polish, and American archives, The Lost Children is a heartbreaking and mesmerizing story. It brings together the histories of eastern and western Europe, and traces the efforts of everyone - from Jewish Holocaust survivors to German refugees, from Communist officials to American social workers - to rebuild the lives of displaced children. It reveals that many seemingly timeless ideals of the family were actually conceived in the concentration camps, orphanages, and refugee camps of the Second World War, and shows how the process of reconstruction shaped Cold War ideologies and ideas about childhood and national identity. This riveting tale of families destroyed by war reverberates in the lost children of today's wars and in the compelling issues of international adoption, human rights and humanitarianism, and refugee policies.

AB  - From the end of the 1920s until Stalin's death in 1953, many groups and individuals were strongly repressed in the Soviet Union, scientists included. This paper investigates the acts of repression against some of the leading scientists in catalysis �_" a field in which Soviet chemists played an important role. V. N. Ipat'ev went into exile, A. A. Balandin spend many years in prison camps, N. N. Semenov, the later Nobel laureate, was seriously humiliated, and S. Z. Roginskii and F. F. Volkenshtein were demoted, and replaced by people from the second rank. Despite these negative actions against the leaders of catalytic science and industry in the country, Soviet scientists made some major contribution to catalysis, especially by formulating theories of heterogeneous catalytic reactions. Important examples are the multiplet theory developed by Balandin, Semenov's chain theory, and the electronic theory of Roginskii and Volkenshtein. In order to understand this striking contradiction between the political repression and these scientific successes, the paper emphasises the economic importance of catalysis and the large scale funding of science by the Stalin regime.

T1  - CRYPTA REFUGII: L'obbedienza come esperienza di sicurezza in Dio in san Francesco d'Assisi. (Italian)

AB  - L'obbedienza sperimentata da Francesco d'Assisi e le indicazioni al riguardo presenti nei suoi scritti sono una delle realt�� spirituali pi�� frequentemente considerate da diversi autori. La presente rifl essione, con una particolare attenzione alle peculiarit�� semantico-fi lologiche, pu�� aiutare a scoprire la dinamica interna dell'atto di obbedienza. Risulta importante la lettura della descrizione dell'atteggiamento di Ges�� di fronte al Padre prima della passione, presente nella seconda, pi�� ampia, recensione della Lettera ai fedeli. Il modo di raccontare l'evento svela infatti la peculiarit�� del come Francesco vede il rapporto di Ges�� con il Padre. In questo contesto un particolare signifi cato acquista la relazione agiografi ca offerta da Tommaso da Celano riguardante l'esperienza del giovane Francesco in cerca della volont�� di Dio, realmente e simbolicamente legata alla crypta (grotta) nella quale si rifugiava. Questa pu�� prefi gurare la ricerca continua della volont�� del Padre, realizzata nell'obbedienza lungo tutta la sua vita. Egli infatti, riassumendo la sua esperienza spirituale nel testo mistico delle Lodi di Dio Altissimo, chiama Dio Rifugio e Sicurezza, Custode, Protettore e Difensore, e pure Quiete. Il che, vale a dire, che �� in Dio che Francesco trova il luogo di rifugio e la persona che gli garantisce e procura la sicurezza per fargli sperimentarne infi ne la quiete. Fondamentale per�� rimane la regola: la sicurezza in Dio trova chi, nell'atteggiamento obbediente e fi ducioso, nella volont�� di Dio pone la propria. Pu�� essere la metaforica crypta refugii a far intuire il mistero dell'obbedienza nella sua dinamica, nella quale l'uomo partecipa attivamente e nella quale scopre la sicurezza e la quiete. One of the things most frequently studied by various authors is the obedience lived by St. Francis and the instructions in this respect found in his writings. This refl ection, with the particular attention it gives to semantic and philological peculiarities, can help one discover the internal dynamic involved in the act of obedience. Thus, the reading of the episode of Jesus before Pilate prior to his passion as recounted in the second and longer version of the Later Admonition and Exhortation to the Brothers and Sisters of Penance proves to be important. The way the event is narrated reveals, in fact, the peculiarities of how Francis saw Jesus' relationship with the Father. In this context the hagiographic account given by Thomas of Celano regarding Francis' experience as a youth in search of God's will, really and symbolically tied to the crypt (cave) where he took refuge, acquires special meaning. This can prefi gure the continuous pursuit of the Father's will, lived in obedience throughout his lifetime. In fact, he returns to this spiritual experience in the mystical text of the Praises of God when he calls God Refuge and Security, Custodian, Protector and Defender, and Rest. It is worth stating that it is in God that Francis fi nds a place of refuge and the person who guarantees and provides for his security that makes him at last experience rest. Yet, the basic norm holds, namely, security in God is found by those who place their own wills into the will of God in obedience and faithfulness. The metaphor of the crypta refugii can offer an intuition into the mystery of obedience in its dynamic, in which a person takes an active part and in which security and rest are found.

AB  - Activated virus-specific CD8 T cells remain in the lung airways for several months after influenza virus infection. We show that maintenance of this cell population is dependent upon the route of infection and prolonged presentation of viral antigen in the draining lymph nodes (DLN) of the respiratory tract. The local effects on T cell migration have been examined. We show retention of virus-specific CD8 T cells in the mediastinal lymph node (MLN) and continuing recruitment of blood-borne migrants into the lung airways during antigen presentation. These data show that antigen that is retained after pulmonary influenza virus infection controls the migratory pattern and activation state of virus-specific CD8 T cells near the site of virus amplification

AB  - The article discusses the letters of Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, two Italian immigrants who were imprisoned from 1920 and had been executed in 1927 in Massachusetts. Sacco and Vanzetti were just two of many Italians who dreamt of migrating to the U.S. due to greater opportunities and the love for freedom and liberty. However, both of Sacco And Vanzetti embraced anarchism as a philosophical and political answer to the injustices against workers. Moreover, their letters reveal the seven years of tension between hope and despair and how they were convicted, because they were Italians

AB  - This article presents a new social functioning self-report instrument in the French language entitled the "Questionnaire de Fonctionnement Social" (QFS), which was initially developed in order to assess social functioning in patients involved in group psychotherapy programs conducted in a specialist mental health setting. The psychometric analysis globally supports the validity of the QFS and suggests that it performs similarly to other standardized measures of social functioning. Easy to complete and score, the QFS seems to be an appropriate instrument for use not only in research protocols but also in clinical psychiatric settings. Within the often costly exercise of routine measurement, this short questionnaire should help identify social dysfunctions otherwise not recognized, making informed clinical decisions and monitoring therapeutic responses. The QFS, while promising, needs further validation of its use in other settings (e.g., community mental health setting), with other patient groups (e.g., those suffering from other mental disorders or chronic medical illnesses) and, more generally, with other nonclinical populations (e.g., pensioners, prisoners, refugees).

AB  - The European model of migratory flows' management, traditionally based on the guest worker's image, has procrastinated the question of foreigners' inclusion into the framework of citizenship rights, namely the question of welfare's boundaries. The evolution of migrations, their transformation into a stable and composite presence, and above all the emergence of a second generation, have forced European countries to enrich the hamper of rights acknowledged to migrants and their families. Anyway has not led to the resolution of the historic paradox of the European experience: the attempt to keep together the economic logic on which the European model of entries regulation is based, with the solidarity logic that stresses the primacy of personhood on the States' prerogative to "choose" their citizens and to decide foreigners' treatment. An attempt that has always produced compromising solutions which show, at the same time, the nature of cultural and political artefact of national citizenship and the paradoxical outcomes resulting from the application of the logic of means-tested access to rights. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Il modello europeo di regolazione dei flussi migratori, tradizionalmente fondato sulla figura del lavoratore ospite, ha consentito di posporre nel tempo la questione dell'inclusione degli stranieri nel sistema dei diritti di cittadinanza, cio�� a dire la questione dei "confini" del welfare. L'evoluzione del fenomeno migratorio, la sua trasformazione in una presenza stabile ed eterogenea, a maggiore ragione la comparsa di una seconda generazione hanno costretto i paesi europei ad arricchire il paniere dei diritti offerti agli immigrati e alle loro famiglie, senza per�� risolvere in modo definitivo il paradosso storico della vicenda europea: il tentativo di tenere insieme la logica economicista alla base del modello europeo di regolazione degli ingressi con quella solidaristica che afferma il primato dei diritti della persona sulla stessa prerogativa degli Stati di "scegliersi" i propri cittadini e decidere il trattamento da riservare agli stranieri. Un tentativo che, oggi come ieri, esita in soluzioni compromissorie che rivelano, a un tempo, il carattere di artefatto politico e culturale del concetto di cittadinanza nazionale e gli esiti paradossali cui pu�� condurre l'applicazione di una logica di condizionalit�� nell'accesso ai diritti.

AB  - This article draws on Agamben's concept of homo sacer (bare-life) and his examination of the Muselm+�nner - the most de-humanised inhabitants of the Nazi concentration camp - to illuminate the ways that the policy and system of immigration detention in Australia signifies a continuation of the biopolitical paradigm that both created and supported the atrocity of Auschwitz. The article argues that the notion of race occupies a paradoxical position in the concept and body of the refugee in Australia today because while racism brings about and justifies the refugee's incarceration in the camp, the biopolitical processes of the camp create a subject within whom race becomes inevitably subsumed within and transcended by the ontology of bare-life. In this scheme, the question of human rights becomes ever more relevant but even less applicable. The article concludes with a critique of Agamben's key ideas as well as my application of them in light of Foucauldian and other interpretations of his work.

AB  - Geographic surveys of allozymes, microsatellites, nuclear DNA (nDNA) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have detected several genetic subdivisions among European anchovy populations. However, these studies have been limited in their power to detect some aspects of population structure by the use of a single or a few molecular markers, or by limited geographic sampling. We use a multi-marker approach, 47 nDNA and 15 mtDNA single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), to analyze 626 European anchovies from the whole range of the species to resolve shallow and deep levels of population structure.

These two groups encompass ten populations that differ from previously defined management stocks in the Alboran Sea, Iberian-Atlantic and Bay of Biscay regions. In addition, a new North Sea-English Channel stock is defined. SNPs indicate that some populations in the Bay of Biscay are genetically closer to North Western (NW) Mediterranean populations than to other populations in the NE Atlantic, likely due to colonizations of the Bay of Biscay and NW Mediterranean by migrants from a common ancestral population. Northern NE Atlantic populations were subsequently established by migrants from the Bay of Biscay. Populations along the Iberian-Atlantic coast appear to have been founded by secondary waves of migrants from a southern refuge

AB  - THE PUNITIVE APPROACH ORIGINATED WITH PRIMITIVE SOCIETIES, WHICH INFORMALLY PUNISHED TRIBAL MEMBERS WHO COMMITTED ACTS REGARDED AS WRONG. ELEMENTARY COURT STRUCTURES WERE ESTABLISHED IN FEUDAL SOCIETIES, AND WRONGS CAME TO BE VIEWED AS CRIMES AGAINST THE GROUPS AS WELL AS AGAINST THE VICTIM. DEBATES THAT AROSE IN THE 18TH CENTURY CONCERNING THE WISDOM AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PUNITIVE APPROACH GAVE RISE TO THREE SCHOOLS OF CRIMINOLOGY: THE CLASSICAL SCHOOL, WHICH, ON THE BASIS OF THE DOCTRINE OF PSYCHOLOGICAL HEDONISM, ADVOCATED THAT A MEASURED, FIXED AMOUNT OF PAIN BE APPLIED FOR EACH CRIMINAL ACT; THE NEOCLASSICAL SCHOOL, WHICH HELD THAT THE CLASSICAL DOCTRINE REQUIRED MODIFICATION IN DEALING WITH PERSONS NOT CAPABLE OF CALCULATING PLEASURES AND PAINS; AND THE POSITIVE SCHOOL, ACCORDING TO WHICH A LAWBREAKER WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS ACTS AND SHOULD NOT BE PUNISHED. THE ORIGINS OF THE TREATMENT APPROACH TO CORRECTIONS CAN BE FOUND IN THE POSITIVE SCHOOL. THE TREND IN CORRECTIONS HAS BEEN AWAY FROM THE PUNITIVE APPROACH AND TOWARD THE TREATMENT APPROACH. AT TIMES, BOTH APPROACHES ARE USED, OFTEN IN DIRECT CONFLICT. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE RURAL-TO-URBAN TRANSFORMATION OF AMERICAN SOCIETY IN TERMS OF CORRECTIONAL PRACTICES IS NOTED. TYPOLOGICAL AND SOCIOPSYCHOLOGICAL THEORIES OF CRIMINOLOGY ARE OUTLINED. VARIETIES OF PUNISHMENT (PHYSICAL TORTURE, SOCIAL HUMILIATION, FINANCIAL LOSS, EXILE, DEATH, IMPRISONMENT) AND OF TREATMENT (COUNSELING, EDUCATION, VOCATIONAL TRAINING, LABOR, EARLY RELEASE, PAROLE, AND PROBATION) ARE DISCUSSED. IT IS POINTED OUT THAT THE OBJECTIVES OF IMPRISONMENT REMAIN UNCLEAR. A CHAPTER TEST AND A LIST OF REFERENCES AND FILMS ARE INCLUDED

AB  - ABSTRACT IN FRENCH: L'article analyse le chemin parcouru par le rock en URSS puis en Russie, de l'+�tat d'une (sous)culture occidentalis+�e anglophone, ayant trouv+� refuge dans les discoth+�ques des ann+�es 1960-1970, jusqu'au canon du russkij rok actuel, devenu presque synonyme de po+�sie chant+�e, via sa l+�gitimation progressive dans les ann+�es 1980. Celle-ci a +�t+� amorc+�e +� la fin des ann+�es 1970 avec l'arriv+�e en force d'une nouvelle g+�n+�ration artistique au sein de l'underground rock (-� nouvelle vague -+ de Leningrad), en rupture avec les anciens standards du mim+�stisme anglophone. Elle a +�galement +�t+� rendue possible par l'affiliation du rock +� une tradition culturelle russe, +� la fois lettr+�e et populaire (po+�sie du d+�but du XXe si+�cle, chanson de bardes, figure du "nouveau folklore urbain"). Nombre d'acteurs et d'institutions h+�t+�rog+�nes (intelligentsia litt+�raire et artistique, institution de censure attentive aux textes des groupes rock, le Rock-club de Leningrad, activistes rock underground en qu+�te de reconnaissance, publics en qu+�te de sens), sans +�tre orchestr+�s par une seule logique, ont contribu+� +� la constitution du rock en un genre national (quasi) litt+�raire. C'est sous cette forme que, dans la d+�nonciation d+�mocratique du r+�gime sovi+�tique, le rock a endoss+� le r+�le d'avant-garde avant de devenir rapidement obsolescent, p+�tissant de cette identit+� n+�gative apr+�s la chute de l'URSS, sans pour autant se d+�faire de son identification litt+�raire. // ABSTRACT IN ENGLISH: The paper analyzes the evolution of Soviet/Russian rock music, from a West-inspired English-speaking `subculture' confined to dance clubs in the 1960's and 1970's to russkii rok, the canon it has become today - a quasi-synonym of sung poetry -, thanks to its progressive legitimization in the 1980's. This legitimization process started in the late 1970's, parallel to the empowerment of a new artistic generation (Leningrad's `New Wave') that broke away from the close imitation of Western rock stars. It was made possible by the affiliation of rock to a certain Russian cultural tradition (early twentieth-century poetry, bard songs, the `new urban folklore'). Numerous and diverse actors and institutions (literary and artistic intelligentsia, censorship focusing on rock bands' lyrics, Leningrad's Rock Club, underground rock activists in search of recognition, an audience in search of meaning...), contributed, without obeying the same logic, to turning rock into a national and almost literary genre. In this quality, between 1986 and 1988, russkii rok donned the role of an avant-garde democratic denunciator of the Soviet regime. Then, after the collapse of the USSR, it rapidly lost its negative identity without nonetheless losing its literary identification.

AB  - Many German prisons host ethnically separate communities of Russian German migrants, and the prison staff have certain problems to keep them under control. The goal of this article is to describe the societal developments that led to this problem and the actual situation in prison. Therefore the Russian prison communities are compared with the version that is implemented in Germany. Some preliminary findings of a recent qualitative study are presented to offer new findings because only little research exists on this topic.

AB  - The experience of being imprisoned from the perspective of young male immigrants in Germany is explored in this article. Based on a larger study involving qualitative interviews in German youth prisons, the article presents 3 case examples illustrating different developments during incarceration, all concerning male immigrants from the former Soviet Union aged between 18 and 20 years and�imprisoned for 1 to 3 years. It sets out each example, with quotations from the interviews, covering perceptions of the institutional setting, interrelations with other inmates and the authorities, and educational training. It focuses in particular on the development of agency to abandon delinquent behaviour during imprisonment. It�discusses requirements that are supportive in the individual process of developing agency, rethinking prior behaviour and maintaining modified ways of behaviour

AB  - Labor turnover theory is one of several competing explanations of wage determination in urban labor markets of less developed countries. The theory is particularly relevant to Africa, where the flow of migrants from the cities to the rural areas is substantial. One of the applications of labor turnover theory has been to study the welfare implications of various government policies to alleviate unemployment in African cities. Empirical tests of the theory have been reported for one country--Zambia. Those tests were confined to only one prediction of the theory. In this paper, we test several predictions of labor turnover theory using data from the National Urban Mobility, Employment, and Income Survey of Tanzania (NUMEIST). We review and integrate four previous contributions to labor turnover theory that are of special interest to development economists. Theoretical foundations are established for the behavior of workers in labor turnover theory. We also derive one new prediction from the theory. Using dichotomous probit models, we examine the determinants of the intention of a migrant to return to the rural areas and the inclination of an employer to select a migrant for a position in a skilled occupation. Using human capital earnings functions, we examine the patterns of lifetime earnings and the shapes of earnings profiles among migrants. We also test for nepotism toward a particular group of migrants. We find that higher earnings in the urban areas and less attractive opportunities in the rural areas weaken the intention of a migrant to remain in the urban areas. Our results indicate that migrants with less attractive opportunities in the rural areas are more likely to be in skilled occupations in the urban areas. There is some evidence that these migrants receive higher lifetime earnings in the urban areas. Their earnings also tend to be more responsive to tenure on the job. These findings are consistent with the labor turnover theory of wage determination. An employer could also use nepotism to attract migrants with less attractive opportunities in the rural areas. However, our results are clearly inconsistent with nepotism toward these migrants

AB  - The Indochinese refugee crisis of 1978-79 is modeled as a prisoners' dilemma, with Thailand choosing whether to permit first asylum and the United States choosing whether to allow resettlement. A threat power analysis from the theory of moves helps to explain: (1) the threats by Thailand and other countries in the region to deny first asylum, and (2) the decision by the United States to (eventually) accept over 750,000 refugees for resettlement. The threats by Thailand shocked and outraged the international community, but the threat power analysis suggests that they were instrumental in escaping the prisoners' dilemma

AB  - The 1994 Cuban refugee crisis is modeled as a prisoners' dilemma game for Cuba and the United States. A threat power version of the theory of moves yields a cooperative outcome in the game, sustained by mutual threats that deter defections by each player, which is consistent with moves made by the players. After the countries implemented deterrent threats, they agreed that Cuba would patrol its borders and the United States would admit 20,000 Cubans each year. We show that the analysis, suitably adapted, also illuminates strategic choices in the 1965 and 1980 Cuban refugee crises. Reprinted by permission Taylor & Francis Lt

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, he was taken into custody and tortured in prison. He was taken to Bhutan's border in 1992, beaten, and forced to sign a statement saying he was voluntarily leaving

AB  - The use of tear gas in controlling riots has been an accepted practice in many countries for the past four decades. In a recent event, a large quantity of tear-gas canisters were used during a situation of unrest in a Hong Kong Refugees' Detention Centre. We report 96 cases of acute burn injury as an unpredicted side effect of o-chlorobenzylidene malononitrile (CS) tear gas. There were 47 females and 49 males with an age ranging between < 1 to 51 years. These burns were categorized as minor burns, with the total body surface area (TBSA) ranging from 1 to 8 per cent with mean percentage of 3. Most of the patients sustained superficial or partial-skin thickness injuries. Only two patients were admitted to the Prince of Wales Hospital Burns Centre because of deeper burns; debridement and skin grafting was required in one of them. The mechanism of burn injury was due to the flame generated from the grenade explosion, direct contact between the hot canister and the victim's skin, and the effect of the chemical powder inside the canisters when it splashed onto the victim's body. We suggest that the noxious transient effects of tear gas are underestimated, furthermore varying cutaneous effects and deep burns may result from its uncontrolled use during riots. There is a continuing need to reassess the potential toxic effects of CS tear gas as a riot control agent and to debate whether its future use can be condoned under any circumstances

AB  - Since World War II, refugee movements have accelerated and are becoming increasingly feminized. When men engage in conflict, women often must make decisions regarding migration and settlement. They may decide to flee when their family's welfare is threatened. After harrowing journeys, women arrive in refugee camps, where they assume customary and new responsibilities in unfamiliar places. Anecdotes in the press reveal that refugee women are unsafe in refugee camps. They utilize such dangerous spaces as mined fields and polluted streams, when they gather fuel wood and water. Refugee women's cultural mores may keep them in their compounds, away from resources. These situations negatively affect refugee women's health status. Little scholarly work has been published that documents refugee women's uses of space or theorizes the meanings of space in the refugee camp, however. Is there a relationship between space, a refugee woman's gender roles, and her well being? Are there gendered spaces in refugee camps? My research begins to answer these questions about womanspace (spaces a woman uses). During the summer of 1999, I visited two Afghan Refugee Villages near Peshawar, Pakistan. I interviewed and observed thirty Afghan refugee women in their activities. I also interviewed refugee men and children, as well as camp administrators and doctors. The refugee compound, which is the locus of an Afghan refugee woman's life, is the focal point of my study. Contrary to conventional opinion, I found that the compound is not a site of constraint for most Afghan refugee women. Women generally are free to leave their compounds, but choose not to do so. Nor are the places where women work inordinately hazardous. I found that the compound ordered, safe, and comfortable, and facilitates a woman' work and sociality. I analyzed the refugee compound in terms of public/private space discourse, and interpreted the gendered space of the compound as privileged. Although high mud walls seem to be rigid boundaries, I found them to be permeable. I proffer a conceptual model, Space of Extension, that explains Afghan refugee womanspace as a space that is socially valuable and that supports women's gender roles

AB  - This article provides a descriptive snap shot of Jewish, young adult children of the immigrants from the former Soviet Union, now living in the New York Metropolitan area. By exploring their communities, friendship networks, patterns of language retention and acquisition and the ways in which they construct their Jewish identity, the article seeks to understand how this new second generation is being incorporated into American and American Jewish life. Jewish religious identity is a mixed picture. The hopes of some in the organized Jewish community that the new immigrants and their children would save many religious and communal institutions by participating at rates far higher than those of other American Jews generally have not occurred. Given the highly secular nature of the group, such hopes probably were misplaced. Yet the immigrants and their children certainly do not seem to be participating at rates lower than those of American Jews

AB  - In low-incidence countries, tuberculosis (TB) is now largely concentrated in high-risk groups such as migrants, homeless people, illicit drug users, alcoholics and prisoners. This has led to increased efforts to implement targeted active case finding for TB among specific populations. This review examines the evidence supporting active case finding in migrants and social risk groups, as well as the cost-effectiveness of interventions. While data from observational studies support active case finding in defined high-risk groups, further research to determine the effectiveness of specific tools and the cost-effectiveness of screening strategies is needed to inform evidence-based control methods in low-incidence countries. Inevitably, addressing TB in low-incidence countries will depend on effective disease control in high-burden countries

AB  - The aim of this study of 20 survivors of war prisons or concentration camps was to investigate the effects of torture and trauma. I used a standardised assessment of diagnostic criteria based on the DSM-IV. I tested whether torture and trauma had psychological effects independent of those secondary to other stressors involved in repressive military activity (for example, harassment and persecution by authorities, threat of arrest, detention, and torture, threats of death to self and family, loss of loved ones, and exposure to violence and being witness to torture and the killing of others). My patients had been subjected to systematic torture and trauma. This study of the effects of torture and trauma is relevant to the question of whether refugees who have been tortured, including those from the former Yugoslavia, require specialised care. It could also aid the development of effective treatments for survivors of other traumas such as rape, child abuse, kidnapping, and hostage taking. [Text, pp. 214-215]

Son versos entre los que se asoman la protesta y la nostalgia para dar testimonio de la injusticia cotidiana acontecida en el campo de concentraci+�n de Djelfa. El terror, el hambre y el fr+�o fueron las condenas aplicadas a los penados. La poes+�a de Max Aub, escrita en aquel campo, posibilit+� una muda y efectiva venganza, que dio esperanza a los refugiados. Este art+�culo analiza la transtextualidad presente en los textos y resalta la literaridad de esta obra de arte. // ABSTRACT IN ENGLISH: Max Aub's Djelfa Diary is a book that embodies the martyrdom of Spanish exiles who were repressed by the French in Algeria. They're verses that look between protest and nostalgia for a witness to the daily injustice that happened in the concentration camp of Djelfa. Terror, hunger and cold were applied to prisoners. Max Aub's poetry, written in that concentration camp, was a silent and effective possible retaliation which gave hope to the refugees. This article analyzes the performance of transtextuality and highlights the literariness of this work of art.

T1  - Exploring Barriers to Higher Education in Protracted Refugee Situations: The Case of Burmese Refugees in Thailand1

AB  - Millions of refugees today are trapped in protracted encampment where they are dependent on external support for basic necessities. Growing up in a refugee camp, many young people are eager to attain Higher Education but lack the opportunities and freedoms their non-refugee peers enjoy as they transition into adulthood and look for meaningful ways to support themselves. This article explores three main assumptions surrounding barriers to Higher Education in Protracted Refugee Situations both theoretically as well as in relation to the particular case of Burmese refugees in Thailand. Following a rights-based approach and adopting post-structural theories, this literature-based article demonstrates how dominant educational discourse emphasizes externalities and thereby neglects the practical realization of the individual's right to Higher Education, while powerful narratives of refugees as dependent victims have shaped reality in justifying mechanisms for international protection and incapacitating refugees. The article concludes that Higher Education could be both a means to refugee empowerment and a form of empowerment. We must not believe the many, who say that free persons only ought to be educated, but we should rather believe the philosophers, who say that the educated only are free (Epictetus, 55-135 AD).

AB  - (from the chapter) This chapter highlights the educational needs of refugees trapped in long-term encampment and presents viable solutions. It argues that while much has been achieved regarding the provision of basic education for refugee children, refugee youth, although showing the necessary commitment and having the time to attain higher education, are often left without the resources, opportunities, and freedom their non refugee peers enjoy as they transition into adulthood and look for meaningful ways to support themselves. Refugees' right to higher education has been largely ignored on the basis of such a provision, presenting insurmountable practical and political challenges. The chapter also shows how distance education has been employed in numerous non formal settings such as refugee camps, creating hope and self-esteem for young refugees. It will present case studies from Palestinian refugee camps, from Somalia, Chad, Kenya, and the Thai-Burmese border where higher educational needs of refugee youth have been addressed in different forms, from vocational training to academic secondary and tertiary education. It will be argued that modern technology can create virtual spaces to access higher education for neglected and marginalized groups such as refugees who are living in resource-poor and remote areas. Despite some obvious challenges, successful distance education programs could be impulsive for rethinking refugee higher education and could mark the beginning of an innovative discourse on a global system of accreditation through a formalized distance mode.

AB  - Catherine Greig pleaded not guilty on Thursday to charges that she assisted her companion, the crime boss James (Whitey) Bulger, during their 16 years on the run. Ms. Greig, who smiled and laughed with her lawyers before the short proceeding, pleaded not guilty to one count of conspiracy to harbor and conceal a fugitive, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Prosecutors said she used false identification, posed as Mr. Bulger's wife and tried to prevent his arrest. Mr. Bulger is charged with 19 murders and other crimes. Ms. Greig's lawyer, Kevin Reddington, told reporters outside the federal court in Boston that Ms. Greig would not cooperate with the authorities and that she was an ''excellent'' candidate for bail.

Silica beads were first silanized with 3-(trimethoxysilyl) propyl methacrylate that served as a heterobifunctional linker, which reacted with 2-acrylamidoglycolic acid in a second step by radical polymerization in aqueous solution. Baseline separation of basic peptides with good column efficiency was obtained on packed capillary columns by isocratic elution CEC with NaCl as the mobile phase modulator. The retention mechanism in the electrochromatographic process was studied by examining the effect of salt concentration on the migration behavior of the peptides. The chromatographic retention factor k�_�lc for charged sample components in the electrochromatographic process was estimated on the assumption that the overall migration rate of a charged migrant can be taken as the sum of the rate of chromatographic elution and the rate of electrophoretic migration. The estimated k�_�lc values from experimental results were plotted against the molal salt concentration on a double logarithmic scale. The linear correlation is in good agreement with the prediction by the theory on the basis of traditional ion-exchange chromatography. The comparison of CEC results, obtained with open tubular and packed capillary columns having the same retentive functions as the stationary phase, supports the notion that variation of the phase ratio in the column offers an additional means to modulate the electrochromatographic migration behavior.

AB  - This article examines the way in which women migrants use social networks in their migration from rural areas to urban employment in China. Through the use of in-depth interviews with women migrants, their families and fellow villagers, in both sending and receiving areas, the author demonstrates their heavy reliance on guanxi networks in their job search, and in the reduction of both risks and costs associated with migration. Employers also use these networks to select workers. The author argues, however, that there are drawbacks and added risks as guanxi networks channel rural women into low-paid gender specific jobs. Women migrants are more likely to be encased in a network based on kinship, unable to build new networks and thereby gain upward mobility. Yet they also risk losing their networks in their home village because of the difficulty in maintaining them during their sojourns in the city.

S'appuyant sur des entrevues approfondies avec des migrantes, leurs familles et leurs concitoyens, aussi bien dans les lieux de dǸpart que d'arrivǸe, l'auteur dǸmontre qu'elles dǸpendent largement des rǸseaux guanxi pour trouver de l'emploi et pour rǸduire les risques et les coǯts associǸs �� la migration.

AB  - Background:Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) has been scaled up by the Chinese government alongside persistent compulsory drug user detention, but the extent to which detention interferes with MMT is unknown. The study systematically reviews Chinese MMT retention rates, reasons for drop out, and behavioural changes. Method:Chinese and English databases of literature are searched for studies reporting retention rates, drug use and sexual behaviours among MMT participants in China between 2004 and 2013. The estimates are summarized through a systematic review and meta-analysis. Results:A total of 74 studies representing 43,263 individuals are included in this analysis. About a third of MMT participants drop out during the first three months of treatment (retention rate 69.0% (95% CI 57.7-78.4%)). Police arrest and detention in compulsory rehabilitation was the most common cause of drop out, accounting for 22.2% of all those not retained. Among retained participants, changing unsafe drug use behaviours was more effective than changing unsafe sexual behaviours. At 12 months following MMT initiation, 24.6% (15.7-33.5%) of MMT participants had a positive urine test, 9.3% (4.7-17.8%) injected drugs and only 1.1% (0.4-3.0%) sold sex for drugs. These correspond to 0.002 (<0.001-0.011), 0.045 (0.004-0.114) and 0.209 (0.076-0.580) times lower odds than baseline. However, MMT participants did not have substantial changes in condom use rates. Conclusion:MMT is effective in drug users in China but participant retention is poor, substantially related to compulsory detention. Reforming the compulsory drug user detention system may improve MMT retention and effectiveness.

AB  - Purpose - The chapter studies gender occupational segregation of rural-urban migrant workers in China based on 2006 survey data from five Chinese cities. Methodology - The multinomial logit (MNL) model is used to analyze migrant workers' occupational attainment by gender. The Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition method is employed to analyze factors affecting gender occupational segregation, which can be classified into observed factors and unobserved factors, including gender discrimination. Findings - The index of dissimilarity based on the data shows that gender occupational segregation for migrant workers exists. The result of Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition shows that the unobserved effects account for more than three-fourths of the total gender occupational segregation. Research limitations -- The "index problem" and the assumption of the same occupational preference between men and women of the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition need to be addressed further. Social implications - The existing gender equality policies and social protection confined to urban workers should be extended to migrant workers. Increasing training investment in migrant workers is also recommended.

AB  - The article outspreads discussion along two lines: social network and social integration. The social network of migrant workers in the city mainly can be divided into two parts by contacted object: the homo-network and the hetero-network. The homo-network is the relationship of migrant workers who have similar identity. It includes intrinsic network that is on basis of strain and geography, and the network with migrant workers come from other areas. The hetero-network is the relationship of migrant workers with urban citizens. The network of migrant workers influences their development and integration with the city evidently through special mechanism. The homo-network plays an important part in migration from village and survival in the city. And if migrant workers confine to this network for long, it is bad for their further development and integration with the city. And the hetero-network is good for further development and integration with the city. Based on the above, the article concentrates on the influence that social network plays in the integration with the city. Meanwhile, the article divides the migrant workers into two parts: the older ones and the younger ones. Compared with the older migrant workers, the younger migrant workers have characters of late-migrating, high education, different motivation to go to city, less or no farming experience, and so on. After studying the whole migrant workers, the author compared the younger migrant with the older migrant workers: in terms of social network, compared with the older migrant workers who keeping pace with the homo-network and developing less hetero-network, and the younger ones actively develop new network which is based on job, besides depending on their homo-network. In terms of social integration, the degree of social integration of the younger migrant workers is more than the older ones. The younger migrant workers pay more attention to social recognition on the identity, and less on systematic partition; the younger migrant workers incline to stay in the city for development or living more than the older ones evidently. Then the author concludes that social network of migrant workers plays an important role in their integration with the city, and the difference of social integration between the younger migrant workers and the older migrant workers can mainly attribute to their difference on social network. The originality of the article includes: Above all, the article studying social network together with social integration reflects that social network plays an important role in social integration of the migrant workers. Secondly, the article pitching the research object on the younger migrant workers, embodiments the differentiation in the group of migrant workers from the beginning of migration tide, and the different characters on the younger migrant workers

AB  - Zhou Enlai or Chou En-lai (both: j�_ � n-l��), 1898�_"1976, Chinese Communist leader. A member of a noted Mandarin family, he was educated in China at an American-supported school and a university in Japan. His involvement in radical movements led to several months imprisonment. After his release he studied (1920�_"22) in France. A founder of the Chinese Communist party, he established (1922) the Paris-based Chinese Communist Youth Group. After a few months in England, he studied in Germany. Zhou returned (1924) to China and joined Sun Yat-sen, who was then cooperating with the Communists. He served (1924�_"26) as deputy director of the political department at the Whampoa Military Academy, of which Chiang Kai-shek was commandant. After the Northern Expedition began, he worked as a labor organizer. In 1927 he directed a general strike in Shanghai, opening the city to Chiang's Nationalist forces. When Chiang broke with the Communists, executing many of his former allies, Zhou became a fugitive from the Kuomintang. Later, holding prominent military and political posts in the Communist party, he participated in the long march (1934�_"35) to NW China. During the partial Communist-Kuomintang rapprochement (1936�_"46) he was the chief Communist liaison officer. In 1949, with the establishment of the People's Republic of China at Beijing, Zhou became premier and foreign minister. He headed the Chinese Communist delegation to the Geneva Conference of 1954 and to the Bandung Conference (1955). In 1958 he relinquished the foreign ministry but retained the premiership. A practical-minded administrator, Zhou maintained his position through all of Communist China's ideological upheavals, including the Great Leap Forward (1958) and the Cultural Revolution (1966�_"76). Initially supportive of the latter, he was periodically attacked by Red Guards for attempting to shelter its victims. He was largely responsible for China's reestablishing contacts with the West in the early 1970s before becoming ill. He died Jan., 1976.

AB  - The Polish Bureau of Agitation and Propaganda of the Russian Communist Party [Bolsheviks] was founded in December of 1918. Like many other national sections of the RCP, establishing of the Bureau was connected with the new politics of Lenin's government towards the national and ethnic minorities, the so-called korenizatsiya; however, the activity of the Polish section at the beginning of 20. was determined by the Civil War and the Polish-Soviet War. Of course, the so-called Polbiuro supported the Red Army. Its tasks were mobilization of Polish communists and Poles in Russia, organization of the Polish troops of the Red Army and intelligence, and, later on, organization of temporary soviet authorities on the Polish territories. In opinion of the Polish communists in Russia, defeat of Poland opened the way to the Polish Soviet Republic, and, then, to the victory of the world revolution. The Battle of Warsaw thwarted those plans, and one of the most important tasks of Polbiuro after signing armistice in October 1920, was the care of Polish immigrants and refugees and prisoners of war in Russia. It was both a propaganda work among the Poles, as the provision of care and protection of means of transport for traveling to the country. This work, although fraught with `ideological ballast', was of great importance for the survival of the masses of Polish people living in harassed by famine, chaos and unrest post-revolutionary Russia

AB  - Abstract: Oxalis L. is the largest and most diverse genus in the family Oxalidaceae. Within southern Africa, Oxalis is represented by ca. 270 taxa, the majority occurring in the Cape Region. Although many of the species are widespread, ca. 25% are considered rare. The aim of this paper is to assess the degree of genetic differentiation between two rare and highly localized species (Oxalis hygrophila Dreyer and Oxalis oligophylla Salter) and the more widespread Oxalis tomentosa L.f. For comparative purposes, we also include Oxalis purpurea L., one of the most widely distributed species in South Africa. Chloroplast sequences of the trnH/psbA spacer revealed low genetic diversity for O. oligophylla and O. tomentosa compared to the widespread O. purpurea. High genetic diversity in O. purpurea might, in combination with other ecological and reproductive factors, account for the success of this species. In contrast, low variation might contribute to rarity in O. oligophylla and ultimately ground O. tomentosa to become rare. The latter two species were not monophyletic with a shared haplotype. Coalescent modelling revealed low levels of gene flow (<1 migrant per generation) between them and we argue that the genetic pattern is the result of the retention of ancestral polymorphism following a recent divergence.

AB  - A 41-year-old man was accused of raping the 13-year-old niece of the woman with whom he was living. The niece made the accusation, claiming that the crime occurred in her bed in the early morning while her aunt was away. She also stated she had never before engaged in sexual behavior. The man's defense centered on his allegation that he was a known sleepwalker and that he had no recollection of committing the rape. During the pretrial phase, however, the girl recanted her allegations, saying she had actually had intercourse with her boyfriend and made the allegations because she was afraid she had become pregnant. There were also medical complications in evidence collection. The emergency room physician failed to conduct a serology test of the seminal fluid. This test can reveal the identity of the individual from whom the seminal fluid came. This article summarizes the types of legal issues, both criminal and civil, that could arise in this case. Potential criminal proceedings could involve charges of neglect against the man and the aunt for not shielding the 13-year-old girl from premature sexual relations. Charges could also be brought against the girl for perjury, conspiracy, false imprisonment, and even burglary. Other potential criminal proceedings are statutory rape charges against the boyfriend and charges of aiding and abetting a fugitive against family members who sheltered the alleged rapist before his arrest. Eleven potential civil cases are also outlined, including the alleged defendant's claim against the emergency room physician for failing to collect evidence that would have cleared him of the charges. In fact, all criminal charges against the defendant were dropped and no other criminal charges or civil suits were brought in the case. The article shows, however, how complex a case can become if all the legal issues are pursued

AB  - Space of Detention is a powerful ethnographic account and spatial analysis of the "transnational gang crisis" between the United States and El Salvador. Elana Zilberg seeks to understand how this phenomenon became an issue of central concern for national and regional security, and how La Mara Salvatrucha, a gang founded by Salvadoran immigrants in Los Angeles, came to symbolize the "gang crime-terrorism continuum." She follows Salvadoran immigrants raised in Los Angeles, who identify as - or are alleged to be - gang members and who are deported back to El Salvador after their incarceration in the United States. Analyzing zero-tolerance gang-abatement strategies in both countries, Zilberg shows that these measures help to produce the very transnational violence and undocumented migration that they are intended to suppress. She argues that the contemporary fixation with Latino immigrant and Salvadoran street gangs, while in part a product of media hype, must also be understood in relation to the longer history of U.S. involvement in Central America, the processes of neoliberalism and globalization, and the intersection of immigration, criminal, and antiterrorist law. These forces combine to produce what Zilberg terms "neoliberal securityscapes." Summary reprinted by permission of Duke University Press

AB  - This Ph.D. dissertation examines the life and ideas of Carlos Fonseca Amador (1936-1976), the founder and central leader of the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) of Nicaragua. It argues that, by integrating the Marxism of Che Guevara with the national resistance traditions of Augusto C+�sar Sandino, Fonseca played the crucial role in the development of an authoritative collective leadership, without which the Nicaraguan revolution of 1979 would not have been successful. The work reconstructs the five worlds that shaped Carlos Fonseca's political ideas. The first was the coffee town of Matagalpa, where, in the 1950s, Carlos suffered the humiliation of being taunted for his illegitimacy and poverty, had his first run-ins with the Somoza government, and joined the Nicaraguan Communist Party. Second was the National University in Le+�n, where Fonseca and other students argued about Marxism and armed struggle, the relationship between culture and revolution, Somoza's ties to the United States, and the need for a new revolutionary organization. The third world was an illegal one of underground safehouses and prison cells. Files from Somoza's secret police are used to reconstruct the clandestine experiences of Fonseca and his comrades as they built the FSLN during the 1960s: interrogation and torture; life as a fugitive; the secret language of coded letters, disguises, and smuggled prison communiques. Exile in Havana was an experience Fonseca shared with like-minded contemporaries from around Latin America and the world. In Cuba Fonseca debated strategy with the rest of the FSLN leadership and researched the new historical narrative he was creating for his country, based on the nationalist hero Augusto C+�sar Sandino. The fifth and last world was that of the Nicaraguan mountains, where Fonseca fought and was killed. "La monta+�a" had three meanings in Sandinista discourse: a strategic military base; the political task of connecting with the peasantry and thereby reinserting themselves into the national struggle of Sandino; and finally the mystique of the guerrilla, the revolutionary ethics epitomized for the FSLN by Fonseca himself. The most important primary sources for this work are the unpublished writings of Carlos Fonseca, currently in the possession of the Nicaraguan Army and never before made available for scholarly examination

AB  - Today, Burma is a different place. After decades as a violent military dictatorship and pariah state -- a North Korea on the Irrawaddy -- it is finally seeming to embrace a new democratic political experiment. Over the last two years, the military junta has released its throttlehold on power, freeing hundreds of political prisoners, relaxing restrictions on the media, and finally allowing opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi to run for office. The author's house was once a center for the Opposition movement. One of his old colleagues, the founder of a political-prisoner support group for exiles, suggested that they all act as if it were a hideout again, just as they'd done some 20 years ago. Modern-day Burma is still very much under the spell of Bagan, both in terms of political culture and religious practice. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - When Lopez Lomong leads the United States team into the opening ceremony Friday night as the flagbearer, he knows he will be a symbol for so many issues hovering over Beijing's Games, but he hopes he can be something else above all: an inspiration. Lomong as a child was one of the Lost Boys of Sudan, kidnapped from his family at 6 years old by soldiers before escaping to a Kenyan refugee camp. Having made the United States Olympic team in track's 1,500 meters, Lomong was selected by American athletes to carry the flag for the team, a vote fraught with meaning. Lomong is a member of Team Darfur and wants people to know about the humanitarian crisis in the country of his birth.

AB  - This article focuses on the caring for detained asylum seekers, human rights and bioethics. Issues related to dual loyalty conflicts vary considerably. The most serious and obvious example relates to healthcare providers' direct involvement in torture, a practice that directly opposes medicine's primary aim to protect and promote health. However, in situations where doctors and nurses are also disempowered, some argue that there may be an obligation to minimize harm. A doctor may believe that his presence may actually lessen the level of harm inflicted on the victim during violent interrogation and so may feel an obligation to be present. The problem of professional ethical practice in corrupt political environments is also portrayed by Jane Steere and Terence Dowdall in their description of working as psychologists in South Africa during apartheid. The ethical complexities inherent in trying to treat mental illness under such a regime were exacerbated by the fact that the broader social system in which they had to work violated their profession's ethical principles, leaving them with the dilemma of providing either no treatment or treatment that they considered to be unethical

AB  - Australia's policy of mandatory indefinite detention of those seeking asylum and arriving without valid documents has led to terrible human rights abuses and cumulative deterioration in health for those incarcerated. We argue that there is an imperative to research and document the plight of those who have suffered at the hands of the Australian government and its agents. However, the normal tools available to those engaged in health research may further erode the rights and well being of this population, requiring a rethink of existing research ethics paradigms to approaches that foster advocacy research and drawing on the voices of those directly affected, including those bestowed with duty of care for this population.

AB  - Australia has one of the harshest regimes for the processing of asylum seekers, people who have applied for refugee status but are still awaiting an answer. It has received sharp rebuke for its policies from international human rights bodies but continues to exercise its resolve to protect its borders from those seeking protection. One means of doing so is the detention of asylum seekers who arrive in Australia by boat. Health care providers who care for asylum seekers in these conditions experience a conflict of �_odual loyalty,�__ whereby their role in preserving and maintaining the health of patients can run counter to their employment in detention facilities. Many psychiatrists who have worked in the detention setting engage in forms of political activism in order to change the process of seeking refuge.

AB  - The brutal beating of Russian journalist Oleg Kashin outside his apartment building Nov. 6 draws renewed attention to the dangers that reporters face in many countries �_" including death, violence, imprisonment, exile, and threats to their families. The Committee to Protect Journalists tracks journalists' deaths, imprisonments, and other forms of intimidation. Deaths are classified as work-related if they are killed in a hostile action tied to their journalism work �_" caught in crossfire or retribution for their work, for example �_" and do not include those media members who worked alongside the journalists, nor those cases in which the motive for the killing is unconfirmed. Below are some of the world's most dangerous countries in which to be a journalist, according to CPJ.

AB  - After having been defeated in the territory of Yugoslavia, the remnants of the Croat armed forces found themselves in the territory of Austria. A considerable number of members of these forces, many of whom were wanted by the new Yugoslav authorities under suspicion of having committed war crimes during the war, crossed into refugee camps in Italian territory. From there, most of them proceeded to South America or Western Europe, whereas several hundred Muslims, among whom high officers and prominent politicians, emigrated to Syria with the large aid from the Organization for Displaced Persons and the Roman-Catholic Church. Apart from them, Albanian emigrants from the Yugoslav territory, who had been members of Albanian armed units or German SS-units during the war, also arrived to Syria. A small number of Serbs, political +�migr+�s, was also in Syria. They had spent the war in the Middle East and didn't want to return to Yugoslavia after the war. A considerable number of Muslims took part in the war in Palestine in 1948. Many of them continued serving in Syrian or Lebanese armed forces after the war. The acceptance of Muslim refugees was motivated above all by military considerations and Islamic solidarity. However, due to the Yugoslav-Syrian rapprochement and the establishment of closer political, economic and military cooperation between the two countries, the situation of the Muslim +�migr+�s suddenly deteriorated. For that reason many radical emigrants left Syria and settled down in Turkey, Saudi Arabia or Iraq. The number of Albanian +�migr+�s in Syrian territory decreased for the same reasons. The Serbian emigration disappeared soon after the war

AB  - The event of exiling someone during the Ottoman period was used for the aim of both punishmen and settlement. However, during the Republican period the exiles were only used to punish the person. The method of exiles was mainly used after the person in question stayed at prison and finished the most of his prisonment period. Then the remaining years he was not kept at prison but sent to exile. This ratio was mainly one-fifth of the remaining period of prisonment. This was a kind of compalsary settlement in a special place where he could not create any problem. The second type of exile was used for the person living in places close to border and creating promlem for the security of that area. Such persons were forced to settle in an area far from the borderlands. In the early years of the Republican era the exiles sent to Nigde mainly belong to the second type exiles, a kind of exiles used for spies. This was due to the fact that Nigde was situated in the central part of Anatolia and was relatively secure place. The event of exiling was not a total punishment at all, only restricting some rights of the person in question. He was almost free to do all free person could be able to. He had some certain rights in his practical life. Reprinted by permission of Ahmet Yesevi University

AB  - In tropical regions of Africa, frequently subject to social and political upheavals, there is an ever-present threat of typhus epidemics, as shown by the recent typhus outbreak in Burundi in 1997. Epidemic typhus should be systematically suspected in certain epidemiological conditions: famine, war, high-density populations (refugee camps, prisons), the presence of body louse in the clothing, and in the presence of certain clinical findings: severe infectious syndrome (temperature above 38 C), severe pain and muscle weakness, with coughing and severe neurological signs. The rapid diagnosis and treatment of typhus are essential. The prognosis has improved, thanks to the specific antibiotics that are currently available, particularly doxycycline, prescribed as a single oral dose of 200 mg for adults or of 100 mg for children. However, the prognosis still depends to a large extent on the speed of diagnosis. Typhus epidemics could be effectively predicted and limited if the measures for control of the body louse recommended by the World Health Organization were applied in the areas with the most favorable epidemiological conditions

AB  - Immediately after Lithuania regained independence in 1991 there were increased attempts of the diasporas 'to come back home'. Expatriates, hyphenated Americans of Lithuanian background, ethnic tourists from America in search of their 'links', and other returnees were faced by the 'transitional' dilemmas of the post-communist Lithuanian realities. Returnees settled in Lithuania, but how much did they identify themselves with native Lithuanians, became "one of us". Were they and are they migrants of nostalgia rather than returnees? The aim of the article is to delineate the profile of the nostalgia-based- model of Lithuanian national identity, shared by Lithuanian transmigrants, in particular, those expatriate refuges and their offspring, who, at the end of World War II, fled the Communist regime and moved to the West. Most of these political ��migr��s developed a strong moral imperative 'to be of use to Lithuania' which crystallised into a missionary-like identity 'to come back to Lithuania when it will be free of Communism', a complex of identity strategies developed in the diaspora and transplanted in the home country. The problems of in-placement, the re-rooting and re-homing of the transnational, up-rooted and displaced Lithuanian migrants, are the focus of this chapter: the transnational model of Lithuanian identity, transplanted to foreign soil and brought back by the Lithuanian transmigrants. Key questions to be answered are: what is brought back to Lithuania by the returnees in terms of social capital and heritage; what are the shapes of identity among transmigrants in a transitional society; how identities that are brought back from the country of domicile are challenged? To answer these questions, first-hand accounts of the ongoing processes of social and cultural accommodation of individuals of Lithuanian background coming to Lithuania from the diasporas in Northern America, mainly the U.S. and Canada, are used. Categories of returnees, as well as dimensions of return, are pointed out. Potential and actual returnees have been observed and interviewed on the both sides of the Atlantic. During the period of 2002-2005, particular sites of their networking in Vilnius and Chicago, as well as other sites of the Lithuanian diaspora activities, have been explored. The returnees and their offspring were studied along their interest groups and networks showing their diversity in terms of generation, class, cultural background, occupation as well as their ethnic/national identity, as defined by informants themselves. The identity of the Lithuanian transmigrants encompasses strategies of retention of nation-ness in terms of culture, heritage and ethnicity defined in diaspora and transplanted again in the country of departure. The core of the diaspora's commitment to retaining nation-ness is expressed in the sense of duty and mission to retain 'the culture', once challenged by the Soviet regime, with the attendant aim to liberate the country from Communism. Governed by the formula of �_zhow to be a Lithuanian in the free world�_o, inscribed in the Lithuanian Charter of the 1949, as well as being strongly enculturated into the explicit ethno-nationalism of diaspora life, returnees have brought to post- communist Lithuania a nostalgia-backed missionary identity. Their standard of nation-ness included both the �_zobligation to return�_o to and �_zto be of use to�_o Lithuania. From one point of view, their professional skills, knowledge of civic participation, moral qualities, are all shared in different niches of society including Parliament and the Presidency. From another angle, it is clear that the diaspora idealists, by becoming �_zmissionaries�_o, were keen to implement their own Lithuanian culture-codifying standards in a country, �_zdevastated by communism�_o.�_� (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Jau treZ_iZ. _�imtmetZ� Lietuva yra transmigracijos epicentre, ne tik emigrantus siunZ_ianti, bet ir juos (nors ir nepalyginti ma_�esniu mastu) susigrZ._�inanti _�alis.

AB  - (from the book) This book offers a new method of therapeutic care for people in acute crisis situations such as natural disasters and war, as well as the long-term care of children and adults in areas of social adversity including slums, refugee camps and high-density urban areas. This book provides detailed case studies of work carried out in South Africa, China and Colombia and combines practical discussions of expressive sandwork projects with brief overviews of their sociohistoric background. Further topics covered include: (1) the social aspect of psychoanalysis; (2) the importance of play; and (3) pictographic writing and the psyche. Providing the reader with clear, practical instructions for carrying out their own sandwork project, this book will be essential reading not only for psychotherapists involved with sandplay therapy but also for those with an interest in cross-cultural psychotherapy, as well as all professionals working with those in situations of social adversity.

AB  - There has been a substantial growth of law school clinics and law firms doing pro bono work to aid individuals seeking asylum in the United States. At the same time, the federal government has been placing in detention more individuals who are here illegally. The number of immigration cases awaiting resolution has surpassed 200,000. The absence of a clear U.S. immigration policy contributes to this development. The conflicts in Iran and Afghanistan have resulted in an increase in the number of individuals seeking asylum. Psychiatric evaluations and psychological testing that provide organized life histories coupled with diagnostic evaluations of the effects of past trauma are relevant to the criteria needed for refugee status. Courts have found them useful, and attorneys and clinics are requesting them. Several forensic training programs have set up consultation agreements with these programs and are finding them to be excellent training experiences for fellows who can help not only with the formal evaluations but also in educating law students in relation to their interviewing techniques and boundary problems that arise in a professional relationship.

AB  - The refugee is a person who has been forced to leave his or her country of origin for any reason beyond his or her capacity to do anything about it, be it for hunger, poverty, the consequences of a natural disaster, devastation of villages or towns, chaotic conditions in the state, totalitarianism, war, oppression of minorities, or individual persecution. A key factor of exclusion is immigration controls. Immigration and asylum systems have been fashioned to discourage people to apply for asylum and gain the refugee status. The discouragement and exclusion of people has become normal with the support of administrative differentiation between asylum seekers on the one hand and illegal immigrants on the other. It has the additional effect of criminalisation, which is a widespread technique of dehumanisation and assumes various forms. Alongside the typical discourse of `fight against illegal migration', its crucial method is preventive detention. People are not detained on the grounds of a judicial verdict for their criminal acts, but to prevent their avoiding deportation from the country. The presentation of these strategies of oppression is followed by a discussion on the role of social work in preventive detention and deportation of foreigners. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Begunec ali begunka je oseba, ki je bila prisiljena zapustiti svojo dr_�avo iz katerega koli razloga, za katerega ni sama odgovorna, bodisi zaradi lakote, rev_�Z_ine, posledice naravne katastrofe, opusto_�enja vasi in mest ali kaotiZ_nih razmer v dr_�avi, totalitarizma, vojne, zatiranja manj_�in ali individualnega preganjanja. Eden bistvenih dejavnikov izkljuZ_evanja je imigracijska kontrola. Ves imigracijski oziroma azilski sistem deluje tako, da posku_�a odvraZ_ati ljudi, da bi zaprosili za azil in pridobili begunski status. OdvraZ_anje in izkljuZ_evanje ljudi je normalizirano in utemeljeno s pomoZ_jo administrativnega loZ_evanja na prosilce za azil na eni strani in nelegalne migrante na drugi. To loZ_evanje ima tudi uZ_inek kriminalizacije. Kriminalizacija je zelo raz_�irjena tehnika dehumanizacije in se pojavija v razliZ_nih oblikah. Poleg znaZ_inega diskurza boja proti nelegalnim migracijam je eden bistvenih ukrepov kriminaliziranja ljudi preventivno zapiranje, za katerega se najpogosteje uporabija izraz pridr_�anje. Ljudje niso zaprti zato, ker bi bill na podlagi kriminalnega dejanja obsojeni na prestajanje zaporne kazni, temveZ_ zato, da se ne bi izognili ukrepu odstranitve iz dr_�ave. Prikazu teh strategij zatiranja sledi vpra_�anje o vlogi socialnega dela zlasti pri preventivnem zapiranju in odstranjevanju tujcev iz dr_�ave.

AB  - The refugee is a person who has been forced to leave his or her country of origin for any reason beyond his or her capacity to do anything about it, be it for hunger, poverty, the consequences of a natural disaster, devastation of villages or towns, chaotic conditions in the state, totalitarianism, war, oppression of minorities, or individual persecution. A key factor of exclusion is immigration controls. Immigration and asylum systems have been fashioned to discourage people to apply for asylum and gain the refugee status. The discouragement and exclusion of people has become normal with the support of administrative differentiation between asylum seekers on the one hand and illegal immigrants on the other. It has the additional effect of criminalisation, which is a widespread technique of dehumanisation and assumes various forms. Alongside the typical discourse of 'fight against illegal migration', its crucial method is preventive detention. People are not detained on the grounds of a judicial verdict for their criminal acts, but to prevent their avoiding deportation from the country. The presentation of these strategies of oppression is followed by a discussion on the role of social work in preventive detention and deportation of foreigners.

AB  - The author draws attention to the social phenomenon of people without documents and rights, an area which often escapes reflection in social work due to the dominance of other sectors, particularly the repressive state apparatus, over social welfare. The normative-legal framework (based on international recommendations and conventions) and the two main institutions (the Asylum Centre and the Foreigners' Centre), as well as the temporary and segregated status of asylum seekers and immigrants without documents, are presented. Community social services are only rarely called for to look for new institutional solutions for non-citizens. This allows social services to largely sustain their internal contradiction that their accessibility is conditioned by the legal status of an individual (citizenship, residence permit, refugee status). The area of migration and asylums needs to be thoroughly reconsidered by social workers who should decide whether they will continue in the role of agents of immigration control and contribute to the deepening of inequality, or promote the principles of the codes of ethics in social work and its global education standards. Despite the prevailing exclusion of immigrants and asylumseekers, some governmental and non-governmental organisations and activist groups develop the transnational perspective and go beyond internal and external state (and welfare) borders. In describing three models of inclusive (non-selective) social response to non-citizens, the author understands the role of social work in terms of active citizenship as collective (self-)advocacy or social action. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Namen Z_lanka je opozoriti na dru_�beni fenomen ljudi brez papirjev in brez pravic, ki se neredko izmika razmisleku v socialnemu delu zaradi prevlade drugih sektorjev, predvsem represivnega dr_�avnega aparata nad socialnim skrbstvom. Normativni okvir, ki ga sestavljajo pravni standardi (ki temeljijo na mednarodnih priporoZ_ilih in konvencijah), in glavni instituciji obravnave (azilni dom in center za tujce) avtorica predstavi na kritiZ_en naZ_in. Problematizira zaZ_asno in segregirano bivanje iskalcev zatoZ_i_�Z_a in priseljencev brez papirjev in s tem povezano vlogo socialnega dela. Pri obravnavi centra za tujce in azilnega doma ugotovi, da se socialne slu_�be v skupnosti redko znajdejo v situaciji, ko bi jih k iskanju novih odgovorov in institucionaliziranih re_�itev prisilile _�ivljenjske situacije nedr_�avljanov. Tako lahko javne slu_�be veZ_inoma ohranjajo svoja notranja nasprotja, povezana s tem, da je njihova dostopnost pogojena z doloZ_enim statusom (dr_�avljanstvom, stalnim bivanjem, begunskim statusom). PodroZ_je migracij in azila zahteva temeljit razmislek socialnodelovne stroke, ali bo njena vloga sodelovanje pri nadzoru nad priseljevanjem in s tem poglabljanje neenakosti ali pa bo naZ_ela, ki jih razgla_�a v svojih etiZ_nih kodeksih in globalnih standardih izobra_�evanja, udejanjila tudi v praksi. Kljub prevladujoZ_emu sistemu izkljuZ_evanja priseljencev in iskalcev zatoZ_i_�Z_a pa je mogoZ_e najti vladne in nevladne organizacije in aktivistiZ_ne skupnosti, ki razvijajo transnacionalni vidik in presegajo notranje in zunanje meje dr_�ave (blaginje). Clanek opi_�e tri modele vkljuZ_ujoZ_ega (neselektivnega) dru_�benega odziva na nedr_�avljane. Pri razumevanju vloge socialnega dela se opre na koncept aktivnega dr_�avljanstva, ki ga lahko razumemo kot kolektivno (samo)zagovorni_�tvo ali socialno akcijo.

AB  - The aim of this article is to shed light on the situation of refugees (formally designated as asylum seekers) and undocumented migrant workers, who are among the most vulnerable inhabitants of Europe. Both groups face the threat of detention and deportation. The normative framework, which consists of legal standards and residential institutions, will be critically examined. Despite international standards for respecting the human rights of refugees and undocumented workers, policies of detention and deportation and the mass rejection of asylum claims leave little hope for the empowerment, autonomy and social inclusion of these persons. Instead of a straight-forward argument for closing down all detention centres and putting an end to forcible deportations, the article investigates small scale structural possibilities for inclusive - non- selective - responses to these non-citizens.

AB  - In 1883, the Russian police established the Foreign Agentura in Paris. The bureau's brief: to forewarn Tsardom of terrorist plans and, if possible, to defuse acts of terrorism against high personages by revolutionaries operating under European sanctuary. As the revolutionary emigration expanded, the Foreign Agentura reacted by spreading its tentacles across Europe and England. With the help of their European colleagues, the Tsar's agents tackled and drove back this terrorist force, proving themslves invaluable in the evolution of political policing. The bitter struggle between the Foreign Agentura and the revolutionary emigration emphasised Russia's central and indespensable place in the evolution of political policing in industrial societies. Indeed, the Russian struggle to devlop a united European and American front against terrorism, laid the groundwork for Interpol and, in doing so, confronted many of the same issues still plaguing the war against terrorism today

Twenty-two per cent of surveyed refugees gave a history of the disease and 10% were documented as having clinical conjunctivitis at the time of the survey. Fifty-six per cent of documented cases were in children less than 10 years of age. The attack rate among American camp personnel was 4%. Comprehensive microbiologic analysis revealed multiple potential pathogens in most cases, but the recovery of adenovirus 8 (AV8) in 81% of cases cultured within two weeks of onset implicated AV8 as the principal cause of the epidemic

AB  - This research explores Palestinian refugee women's political rights through a broader examination of the gender dynamics in one refugee camp in Lebanon. Using two focus groups and individual interviews with 20 women, the research highlights the patriarchal and colonial structures that dominate the women's lives, preventing them not only from engaging in political activities, but also hindering their opportunities for work and socialization outside their immediate familial spheres. The political disillusionment within the researched and broader Palestinian community, as a result of the encroaching project of Empire as defined by Hardt and Negri, has created a divided Palestinian cause, a failed youth, and a society attempting to hold on to its identity. However, along with that comes the oppression of a sub-section of that society - the women; the remaining possession that the men have. Women who previously engaged in armed resistance have not advanced politically, socially, or economically - and in fact the history of their struggles are being erased as surely as their land is. Nonetheless, pockets of resistance - a Multitude - of women, agents in their own fates, are fighting the current towards a more emancipatory future for themselves and future Palestinian men and women

AB  - Conducted a follow-up study on the effects of war on refugee families during the Yugoslavian war and examined disturbances of the whole family system and changes in the family structure and roles of particular family members. Human Ss: 40 Bosnian families (refugees in Zagreb camp). Ss were clinically examined and were provided with psychosocial help while living in the refugee camp. The roles of multiple traumatic experiences, difficulties of refugee life, and prolonged suffering were studied and the importance of the mourning process was addressed. Characteristics of typical coping strategies and family units in the camp were outlined. Four types of families were identified and discussed: (1) functional families; (2) families with temporary crises they overcome with time and help; (3) dysfunctional families adopting psychopathological states/symptoms in 1 or more family members; and (4) alienated and disintegrated families.

AB  - In Norway psychiatric studies of victims started in the 1950's. Controlled retrospective studies established the long-term psychiatric morbidity after extreme and long-lasting war related stress among refugees, concentration camp prisoners and war sailors. The findings from these pioneer studies and the questions they left unanswered, called for a prospective design in the next generation of studies. During the last decade longitudinal prospective studies have been carried out, as a rule combining research with interventive efforts. Using a wide concept of victimology, victims of accidental threats of life as well as victims of violence have been studied. The main areas of research interest have been the kind and severity of the acute, the subacute and the long-term psychosocial responses after the trauma, and the immediate victim responses during the traumatic impact. Psychic traumatization has been studied in subjects who have been exposed to stressors such as accidents, technological disasters, hostage incidents, bank robberies and torture. Specific military stress has been studied in soldiers on UN-peace-keeping mission in Lebanon. Some of the findings and a few methodological issues of particular relevance to psychiatric studies of victimized persons are reviewed. [Author Abstract]

AB  - This chapter concerns investigations by Norwegians on posttraumatic responses to (1) human violence against groups of the civilian population during World War II (resistance underground fighters, refugees, concentration camp survivors, and war sailors), (2) accidental humanly caused traumata (technological disasters), (3) personal events connected with extreme violence (terror, rape, bank robberies), and (4) military and paramilitary accidents (ship's crews under bombardment, avalanche disasters). It will focus on the similarities of the responses, but we also raise the question of whether there are not important differences regarding time of onset, course, and some symptoms that may have consequences for the diagnosis and treatment of posttraumatic stress reactions and PTSD.

AB  - The article in this issue examine different aspects of faith-based assistance to contemporary immigrants, particularly how those providing assistance to immigrants-both at the level of the hierarchy and the congregation-interpret their actions. The contributions take assistance to mean instances of directly providing help to immigrants, as well as the adoption of public positions that advance the overall welfare of immigrant groups. Overall, the studies in this issue expose instances in which religion moves beyond the confines of worship, spirituality, and ritual to underscore the public role of religious faith as it is captured in responses to immigration. Some contributions focus on the United States, others move the analytical gaze beyond U.S. borders, and still others take a comparative approach. Together, these articles add to a deeper understanding of faith-based assistance and religion across different national contexts. Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications, Inc

AB  - "The topic of "illegal" immigration has been a major aspect of public discourse in the United States and many other immigrant-receiving countries. From the beginning of its modern invocation in the early twentieth century, the often ill-defined epithet of human "illegality" has figured prominently in the media; in vigorous public debates at the national, state, and local levels; and in presidential campaigns. In this collection of essays, contributors from a variety of disciplines - anthropology, law, political science, religious studies, and sociology - examine how immigration law shapes immigrant illegality, how the concept of immigrant illegality is deployed and lived, and how its power is wielded and resisted. The authors conclude that the current concept of immigrant illegality is in need of sustained critique, as careful analysis will aid policy discussions and lead to more just solutions"--

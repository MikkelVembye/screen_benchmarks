AB  - Objectives: This study aimed to identify participant characteristics associated with volunteering among older adults. Methods: Based on data from the 2008 Aging Texas Well (ATW) Indicators Survey, we examined the degree to which demographic factors, health status, spiritual participation, and community involvement are associated with volunteering among adults aged 60 years or older (n =525). Results: Rates of volunteering varied by race/ethnicity: non-Hispanic Whites (56.4%), African Americans (51.1%), and Hispanics (43.2%). Bivariate analyses showed that non-Hispanic White older adults were more likely to participate in formal volunteering activities, while their African American and Hispanic counterparts tended to participate in informal volunteering activities. Logistic regression analyses revealed that volunteering was less observed among Hispanics (OR=0.48, 95% CI 0.29–0.78). Volunteering was more observed among those who reported providing informal care (OR=1.93, 95% CI 1.14–3.28), having very good or excellent mental health (OR=1.90 and 2.07, 95% CI 1.09–3.32 and 1.20–3.55, respectively), having weekly or daily spiritual participation (OR=2.15 and 2.35, 95% CI 1.28–3.63 and 1.29–4.28, respectively), perceiving community involvement very important (OR=2.37, 95% CI 1.55–3.62), and being very satisfied with the community interaction (OR=1.81, 95% CI 1.15–2.85). Conclusions: Given the positive associations of mental health, spirituality, and social engagement with volunteering among older adults, system-level efforts to increase the sense of community among older adults and recognize their roles as volunteers will be helpful in recruiting and retaining older volunteers.

AB  - Introduction: The most effective type of social participation against psychological distress in older adults is not well documented. The aim of this study was to examine whether different types of social participation are associated with changes in psychological distress level in older men and women in Japan. Methods: Two thousand seven hundred community-dwelling older adults (aged 65±74 years, 50% women) were randomly selected from the resident registry of three cities. Of these, participants who reported social participation and psychological distress level in the baseline survey in 2010 were followed up. Psychological distress was evaluated based on K6 scales at baseline and follow-up (in 2015). Social participation level was examined using question items from the National Health and Nutrition Survey in Japan. Exploratory factor analysis was used to derive the underlying factor structure. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to examine the association between social participation and changes in psychological distress level after adjusting for covariates stratified by both gender and age group or living arrangement. Results: Data from 825 community-dwelling older adults (45.3% women) were analyzed. Social participation was categorized into two types using factor analysis: community involvement (volunteer activities, community events, clubs for the elderly) and individual relationship (friendship, communication with family and friends, hobbies). During the 5-year follow-up, 29.5% of participants reported a deterioration in psychological distress. Higher community involvement was independently associated with lower risk of psychological distress for older women (β = 0.099, p = 0.047), whereas there were no associations with individual relationship for either gender. Furthermore, in older women living with others, higher community involvement was also associated with lower risk of psychological distress (β = 0.110, p = 0.048). Conclusion Community involvement provides older women with mental health benefits regardless of individual relationship level. Promoting community involvement may be an effective strategy for healthy mental aging. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - There is an urgent need to identify lifestyle activities that reduce functional decline and dementia associated with population aging. The goals of this article are to review critically the evidence on the benefits associated with formal volunteering among older adults, propose a theoretical model of how volunteering may reduce functional limitations and dementia risk, and offer recommendations for future research. Database searches identified 113 papers on volunteering benefits in older adults, of which 73 were included. Data from descriptive, cross-sectional, and prospective cohort studies, along with 1 randomized controlled trial, most consistently reveal that volunteering is associated with reduced symptoms of depression, better self-reported health, fewer functional limitations, and lower mortality. The extant evidence provides the basis for a model proposing that volunteering increases social, physical, and cognitive activity (to varying degrees depending on characteristics of the volunteer placement) which, through biological and psychological mechanisms, leads to improved functioning; we further propose that these volunteering-related functional improvements should be associated with reduced dementia risk. Recommendations for future research are that studies (a) include more objective measures of psychosocial, physical, and cognitive functioning; (b) integrate qualitative and quantitative methods in prospective study designs; (c) explore further individual differences in the benefits associated with volunteering; (d) include occupational analyses of volunteers’ specific jobs in order to identify their social, physical, and cognitive complexity; (e) investigate the independent versus interactive health benefits associated with volunteering relative to engagement in other forms of activity; and (f) examine the relationship between volunteering and dementia risk.

AB  - Background: This study evaluates the predictive effects of different aspects of volunteering (e.g. volunteering status, number of hours, number of years, and type of volunteering activity) on all-cause mortality. Methods: A seven-year follow-up dataset of a nationally representative sample of Israelis, 60 years and older was used. Results: As expected, volunteering was associated with a reduced mortality risk even after adjusting for age, gender, education, baseline mental health and physical health, activity level, and social engagement. Those who volunteered for 10 to 14 years had a reduced mortality risk relative to non-volunteers. In addition, those who volunteered privately, not as part of an official organization, also had a reduced mortality risk compared to non-volunteers. The number of hours of volunteering was not a significant predictor of all-cause mortality in the fully adjusted model. In additional sensitivity analyses limited to those who volunteered, none of the various aspects of volunteering was associated with a reduced mortality risk. Conclusions: Results suggest that not all aspects of volunteering have the same predictive value and that the protective effects of length of volunteering time and type of volunteering are particularly important. However, whether or not volunteering is the most consistent predictor of mortality and whether once a person volunteers the various aspects of volunteering are no longer associated with mortality risk.

AB  - My work explores the opportunities that ageing actively offers at the individual and collective levels, focusing my analysis on older adults (aged 65-74) engaged in voluntary activities in third-sector organizations. To outline the social role played by elder volunteers in Italy, I performed synthetic indexes and a cluster analysis (with SPAD software) on a stratified randomized sample, representative of the Italian active older adults aged 65-74 years (N=146) engaged in pro-social activities in third-sector organizations. The analyses show that in providing aid to others these active elders establish a strong support network for themselves. I have also found that Italian third-sector organizations are intergenerational in terms of co-existence of young, adult, and elderly volunteers, which contributes to the well-being of all the stakeholders involved. Coming together on a regular basis stimulates the activation of behavioral, material, interpersonal, and communicative resources. Volunteering in later life is associated with reinforcement of self-fulfillment and formation of one's social identity. Furthermore, thick networks of social relations at the micro and meso (i.e., community) levels facilitate older people's inclusion in voluntary work.

AB  - The responses of 373 preretirees and retirees (55–74 yrs old) to the Life Satisfaction Index—Form A were analyzed to determine the independent contributions of age, sex, retirement status, years of education, marital status, and volunteer status. Persons donating their time and services through volunteer activities were more satisfied with their lives than their nonvolunteering counterparts. Educational level was also positively related to life satisfaction. No other independent effects were observed. It is suggested that counselors investigate potential therapeutic effects of volunteer activities. (French abstract) (25 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - As social roles in later life are shaped by significant life events and changes occurring in the late-life transition, examining social engagement in midlife may provide a context for interpreting the ageing social identity. This is particularly important for women, who are heavily dependent on social relationships and are more influenced by social losses and change. Objective: To examine major social changes occurring in the decade prior to late-life, starting from approximately 45–55 years of age. Study design: The study accessed data from the longitudinal prospective Women’s Healthy Ageing Project (WHAP). Participants were 493 women who had completed at least one assessment in the first 12 years of the study. Results: Living with a partner was common and stable amongst participants, while the proportion with children still at home decreased markedly (79–44%). Full-time employment also decreased as participants approached the average retirement age (40–13%). Volunteer work was popular throughout the study, increasing slightly with age, and minding grandchildren was common at the end of the study period (80%). Conclusions: Taken together, these findings suggest a notable deficit in participants’ social lives as they transition into later life, but with some evidence of compensation by increasing other social activities.

AB  - Objective: This study examined the relationship between volunteer activity and hypertension, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, renal failure, and cognitive impairment. Method: Employing data from the Health and Retirement Study, we estimated regression models of hypertension status that include volunteer activity and psychosocial and health behavior risk factors for middle-aged and older persons. Results: Multivariate analyses showed volunteers had lower hypertension risk and lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure than nonvolunteers and that a threshold effect was present, whereby a modest amount of volunteer time commitment (but not a high amount) was associated with lower risk of hypertension. We did neither find support that psychosocial and health behaviors mediated this relationship nor find support for a moderating effect of volunteering for the relationships among health behaviors and hypertension. Discussion: The results of this study indicate that research is needed to determine what mediates the relationship between volunteering and hypertension.

AB  - Purpose of the Study: This study investigated whether volunteering was related to 5 risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and the metabolic syndrome (MetS) among middle-aged and older adults. Design and Methods: Data from the 2004 and 2006 waves of the Health and Retirement Study (N = 7,803) were examined. Logistic regression was used to describe the relationships among volunteering and central adiposity, hypertension, lipid dysregulation, elevated blood glucose levels, and high inflammation, along with 2 indexes of the MetS. Results: Among middle-aged adults, results showed that volunteers were less likely to have high central adiposity, lipid dysregulation, elevated blood glucose levels, and MetS compared with non-volunteers. For older adults, results showed volunteers were less likely to be hypertensive and more likely to have lipid dysregulation than their non-volunteer counterparts. Implications: These results supported findings from other studies that formal volunteering is beneficial for middle-aged adults, and to a lesser degree, older adults. Further research is required to determine what factors may mediate the volunteer– CVD risk relationships. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objectives: To describe the association between initiating volunteering and changes in physical disability in older adults, and whether intensity and gender modify this relationship. Methods: Employing propensity score weighted regression adjustment, we calculate changes in disability using a sample of U.S. adults (n = 7,135) in the Health and Retirement Study (1996-2012) not volunteering at baseline but later initiating volunteering (1-99 hr/year or 100+ hours per year) or remaining a nonvolunteer. Results: Relative to continuous nonvolunteers, low-intensity volunteering is related to 34% lower disability in the low- intensity group (average treatment effect [ATE] = -0.12) and 63% lower in the higher-intensity group (ATE = -0.23). For men, progression was lower only in the highest intensity group (ATE = +0.02), but women experienced similarly less progression of disability (38%-39%) at either level of new engagement (ATE = -0.17 and -0.18). Discussion: Initiating a new volunteer role in later life is related to decreased progression of disability, at low or high levels for women and only at higher levels for men. This study suggests that volunteer intervention programs may represent a major public health strategy to delay the progression of physical disability for older adults. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The year 2011 was declared the ‘European Year of Volunteering’ to recognise the contribution volunteers make to society. Such cross-national events reflect the high profile of volunteering and political imperatives to promote it. The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive review of current knowledge (articles published between 2005 and 2011) regarding the role of volunteering in improving older people's quality of life (QoL) and to identify areas requiring further research. Volunteering was defined as an activity that is freely chosen, does not involve remuneration and helps or benefits those beyond an individual's immediate family. Our search identified 22 studies and 5 review articles that addressed the benefits of volunteering on older people's quality of life. Most of the research had been conducted in the United States, Canada and Australia using data from longitudinal studies. The majority of the studies concluded that there is a positive association between older people's quality of life and engagement in volunteering. Due to the study designs and the heterogeneity of the research, causality is difficult to demonstrate and the knowledge the studies bring to the subject is variable. This review shows that volunteering may help to maintain and possibly improve some older adults’ quality of life. However, there are still major gaps in our understanding of who actually benefits, the social and cultural context of volunteering and its role in reducing health and social inequalities.

AB  - This paper will discuss the development of Japan's older adult volunteerism and how today's older adult volunteerism needs to change in the face of a super-aging society coupled with changing social and economic needs. How Japanese organizations and communities can promote and sustain senior volunteerism will be examined in terms of four aspects of institutional capacity: access, information, incentives, and facilitation. The paper suggests that senior volunteerism is necessary for Japan's aging society to provide meaning in later life, and sustain good health and well-being. However, to encourage volunteerism among aging baby-boomers, Japan needs to alter its traditional approaches, such as its top-down approach to organizing volunteerism and its focus on moral citizenship. With unique lives and experiences, the largely middle class baby-boomer generation will probably seek an experience of older adulthood different than that of their predecessors. Social work in Japan needs to expand its professional boundaries beyond poverty work to support the diverse needs of the aging population.

AB  - Objective: Although engagement in productive activities is associated with favourable outcomes with respect to the health and well-being of older individuals, the association between such activities and depression in older populations remains relatively unexplored. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association among five productive activities (paid work, formal volunteering, caregiving, informal helping and caring for grandchildren) with depression in older adults in 14 European countries. Methods: This cross-sectional study used the first two waves of data collected by the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe and analysed a total sample of 7238 relatively healthy community residents aged 60 years and older from14 European countries. The Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe excluded potential participants with a past history of depression, cognitive impairment and physical limitations. Depression was categorised using the EURO-D instrument, and associations with participating in productive activities were investigated. Results: Depression was less prevalent among those individuals who were employed or self-employed and those who participated in formal volunteering or informal helping, whereas caregiving was associated with a higher risk of depression. Caring for grandchildren was not associated positively or negatively with depression. Formal volunteering and caregiving remained associated with depression after adjustment for age, sex, marital status, education, economic status, country and presence of long-term illness. Conclusions: Availability of formal volunteering may be important in reducing depression risk, whereas caregiving is associated with a higher risk of depression in older European adults. Further research is required to clarify the direction of causation and evaluate interventions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study examined the longitudinal relationships between functional health in later years and three types of productive activities: volunteering, full-time, and part-time work. Using the data from five waves (2000–2008) of the Health and Retirement Study, we applied multivariate latent growth curve modeling to examine the longitudinal relationships among individuals 50 or over. Functional health was measured by limitations in activities of daily living. Individuals who volunteered, worked either full time or part time exhibited a slower decline in functional health than nonparticipants. Significant associations were also found between initial functional health and longitudinal changes in productive activity participation. This study provides additional support for the benefits of productive activities later in life; engagement in volunteering and employment are indeed associated with better functional health in middle and old age.

AB  - <bold>Objective: </bold>To examine the association between a changes in social activity and cognitive function in Koreans aged 45 years or older.<bold>Methods: </bold>Data were obtained from 6076 participants aged 45 years and older included in the Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging (2006-2012). Cognitive function was measured using the mini-mental state examination-Korean version (MMSE-K). Participation in social activities was classified as "consistent participation," "consistent non-participation," "participation to non-participation," and "non-participation to participation." Linear mixed models were used to investigate the relationship between type of social activity (religious organizations, friendship organizations, leisure/culture/sports clubs, family or school reunion, volunteering work, and political organizations), and cognitive function.<bold>Results: </bold>Individuals who reported "no participation to participation" (b = 0.778, p < 0.0001) and "consistent participation" (b = 0.968, p < 0.0001) were more likely to show reduced cognitive decline than those who reported "consistent non-participation" (p < 0.0001 for trend). The positive association between cognitive function and consistent participation in religious activities, friendship organizations, and family/school reunions was particularly strong (b = 0.325, p < 0.0001; b = 0.570, p < 0.0001; b = 0.234, p = 0.0004; respectively, versus consistent non-participation).<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Promotion of participation in religious organizations, friendship organizations, and family/school reunions (only for older persons) may help preserve cognitive function in individuals aged 45 years or older in Korea.

AB  - This study aims to examine factors related to volunteerism and explore the relationship between volunteerism and positive aging across three age groups. A total of 1,170 Hong Kong Chinese respondents aged between 15 years and 79 years were recruited for the study via a random household survey. Results found that age was negatively related to participation in voluntary work. Older adults aged 60 years to 75 years demonstrated the lowest volunteer participation rate compared with younger adults (aged 15 years to 39 years) and midlife adults (aged 40 years to 59 years). Paradoxically, older volunteers exhibited the highest frequency of volunteering, operationalized as spending 10 hours or more on volunteer work in the past month. Compared with younger and midlife adults, older adults were motivated to volunteer by societal concern and esteem enhancement. Participation in voluntary work was associated with three positive aging outcomes: good health, caring engagement with significant others, and productive engagement in the community. The findings suggest great potential in promoting volunteering in old age because older volunteers tend to contribute more hours than younger volunteers do, and volunteering is associated with positive aging.

AB  - Previous research has linked volunteering with a catalog of well-being indicators; however, it is unclear whether all volunteers derive the same benefit. The aim of this article is to examine the perceived benefits of volunteering among older people and to determine whether the benefits differ by volunteer characteristics. The study found that volunteers reported a wide range of benefits emerging from their volunteering, including increased socialization and self-worth. There was some evidence to suggest that benefits vary by volunteer characteristics with the older-old, the less educated, and the retired reporting the greatest benefit. In addition, different subgroups may benefit in different ways. Recognizing and responding to the potential benefits of volunteering to different groups is important in the recruitment and retention of volunteers.

AB  - Background: Haifa century after the inception of the term 'successful aging (SA),' a consensus definition has not emerged. The current study aims to provide a comprehensive snapshot of operational definitions of SA. Methods: A systematic review across MedLine, Psyclnfo, CINAHL, EMBASE, and ISI Web of Knowledge of quantitative operational definitions of SA was conducted. Results: Of the 105 operational definitions, across 84 included studies using unique models, 92.4% (97) included physiological constructs (e.g. physical functioning), 49.5% (52) engagement constructs (e.g. involvement in voluntary work), 48.6% (51) well-being constructs (e.g. life satisfaction), 25.7% (27) personal resources (e.g. resilience), and 5.7% (6) extrinsic factors (e.g. finances). Thirty-four definitions consisted of a single construct, 28 of two constructs, 27 of three constructs, 13 of four constructs, and two of five constructs. The operational definitions utilized in the included studies identify between <1% and >90% of study participants as successfully aging. Conclusions: The heterogeneity of these results strongly suggests the multidimensionality of SA and the difficulty in categorizing usual versus successful aging. Although the majority of operationalizations reveal a biomedical focus, studies increasingly use psychosocial and lay components. Lack of consistency in the definition of SA is a fundamental weakness of SA research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This article presents a study, which examined the work, retirement, and lifestyle choices of a sample of older Indiana residents. The findings indicate that health was not a critical factor in the older person's retirement decision, and that those who retired and engaged in volunteer or recreational activities were significantly more satisfied with their lives than those who continue to work. Those who retired and engaged in volunteer or recreational activities scored significantly higher on life satisfaction than those who had returned to work full or part-time. There are a multitude of life experiences and retirement patterns that may ultimately lead older persons to choose among the diverse ways of occupying themselves during theft later years. Some enjoy theft work as well as the income, status, privilege, and power that go with full-time employment and never intend to retire. Some retire intending to engage in recreational and leisure activities on a full-time basis only to find this lifestyle less satisfying than they imagined and ultimately return to work. The need to feel productive and actively involved in life is often a critical factor inducing some retirees to return to work.

AB  - Volunteers are reputedly healthier and happier than their non-volunteering counterparts. But is this a causal link or are healthier, happy individuals simply more likely to volunteer? Some papers have attempted to identify the causal relationship using an instrumental variable methodology; most relying on measures of religiosity as instruments for volunteering. No studies of such nature have been conducted in Canada. We rely on a novel instrument, a measure physical proximity to volunteer opportunities and use data from Canadian General Social Surveys to fill this gap. Employing a conditional mixed process (CMP) model, we find that volunteering is a robustly significant predictor of health, and positively affects life satisfaction for female and middle-aged individuals.

AB  - <span class="AbstractHeading">Abstract </span>Engagement in social and generative activities has benefits for the well-being of older adults; hence, methods for broadly engaging them in such activities are desired. Experience Corps Baltimore, a social model for health promotion for older adult volunteers in public schools, offers insight to such successful recruitment and retention. We report on data over a 4-year period in Baltimore City, Maryland, and describe a five-stage screening process implemented to recruit a diverse group of senior volunteers who would remain in the program for at least 1 year. The sample consisted of 443 older adults expressing an interest in and screened for volunteering. Comparisons were made with Chi-square and Fisher’s t-test between those who entered the program and those who did not and those who were retained in the program. Gender, race, age group, and prior volunteering were significant in ultimate volunteer service in the schools. Overall, 38% of 443 persons recruited entered the schools; 94% of participants were over 60 years (p = 0.05) with a mean age of 69 years; 90% were women (p = 0.03), and 93% African-American (p = 0.005); 57% had not volunteered in the past year (p = 0.004). Ninety-two percent were retained in the first year; 80% returned a second year. Among the latter, 83% had <12 years of education (p = 0.001). Participants remained in the program for a second year of volunteering regardless of baseline MMSE score, self-reported health, and motivation for volunteering. In conclusion, it is possible to recruit and retain a diverse pool of older adults to participate in a high-intensity volunteer program, including non-traditional volunteers. Of special note is the success in recruiting African-American women and those with lower education, who may particularly benefit from health promotion.

AB  - Administered a needs-assessment survey to 1,400 systematically selected elders (aged 65 yrs and older) in 4 counties in northwestern Vermont. Of these Ss, 12% were employed, 17% participated in a meal site program, and 10% participated in volunteer activities (e.g., the Retired Senior Volunteer Program) in their spare time. Results indicate that those Ss experiencing the greatest number of resource deficits, such as living alone, residing in a city, and being in poor health, benefited the most from participating in these formal activities. An unanticipated finding was that the strongest and most consistent predictor of disadvantaged Ss' life satisfaction was participation as a volunteer for the Retired Senior Volunteer Program.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the longitudinal relationship between volunteering engagement and trajectories of physical health. Using three-wave panel data from the Americans' Changing Lives survey, the author tested the association between volunteering engagement and physical health after controlling for health variables from previous waves. Volunteering engagement was measured through volunteer status and hours. Physical health was measured through self-rated health, functional dependency, and chronic conditions. Findings indicated that volunteering engagement was associated with improved self-rated health and decreased functional dependency but not with the number of chronic conditions. Volunteering is a social approach to health maintenance in the older population, and the findings of this study add to the literature suggesting that volunteering probably leads to positive outcomes, but the relationship is also related to resource, status, and network variables.

AB  - Used findings from a statewide telephone survey of 1,500 households with noninstitutionalized elderly persons to examine the theoretical and methodological difficulties of defining, coding, and analyzing data on older volunteers. Over half (52%) of the Ss did volunteer work for organizations. Income, education level, health, and age affected volunteerism. Problems in definition and methodology, however, confounded analyses. A conceptual model for classifying volunteer roles is proposed based on 3 dimensions: whether the voluntary service is formal or informal, whether the activity entails a regular or an occasional time commitment, and the nature of the service activity (person-to-community, person-to-object, or person-to-person).

AB  - In such an aging society as Japan, with decreasing number of children. Social activity of senior citizens is important for the well-being and the activation of whole societies. Promoting volunteer activities of senior citizens may serve as one useful plan; however, few researchers have examined the impact of volunteer work on the physical and mental health of senior citizens in Japan. In this study, a survey of previous studies that appeared after 1970 in North America, several findings were obtained: (1) Volunteering among senior citizens improves their mental well-being; (2) Few previous studies reported volunteering improves physical health such as protection for mortality and incidence of disability, compared to mental well-being; (3) Effects of volunteering might depend on gender, race, health status, socioeconomic conditions, and social networks of senior citizens--more impact can be expected on physical health of persons of advanced age; (4) Few previous studies focused on interactions of contents of volunteering programs; (5) Although several studies have reported that 40-100 volunteering hours per year were best quantitative level for health, this remains equivocal; (6) The conventional hypothesis that volunteering, through improvement in psychological, physical, and social factors, may improve ones health, needs assessment in terms of actual impact. Moreover, mechanisms of any influence remain to be clarified. From the point of practical use of volunteering as a health promotion program, it is necessary to explore better content and time engaged, as well as the numbers of groups to which senior citizens belong. Long-term longitudinal and intervention studies are desirable in this area in Japan, focusing on older candidates who are still healthy.

AB  - Context. Volunteer work can be a very significant form of social participation for seniors. It can also provide seniors with important physical and psychological health benefits. This explains why occupational therapists and other health care professionals, as well as community workers who are concerned with healthy aging, appeal to seniors to volunteer in health promotion and community support initiatives. However, the recruitment and ongoing involvement of seniors as volunteers is often challenging. Objective. A systematic review of the literature was undertaken to enlighten practitioners working in this domain. The objective was to identify factors that influence seniors' participation in volunteer work. Method. Six bibliographic databases were searched using key words. Results. A total of 27 relevant papers were retrieved and allowed an identification of a series of factors that could influence seniors' participation in volunteer work, namely personal factors, environmental factors, and occupational factors. Implications. This analysis leads to practical guidelines for facilitating the recruitment and maintenance of seniors' engagement in volunteer work.

AB  - Objectives: Using the example of older men volunteering on teams that restore historic ships, this article examines the effects of volunteering on the well-being of older adults. We consider particularly how volunteering impacts levels of social engagement and explore how the men's reminiscences as they bond with their fellows in highly skilled work helps integrate their life experiences. Methods: Data are based on 14 in-depth interviews with volunteers working on historic vessels in Norway. Self-rated health, functional dependency, and well-being measures were collected using semi-structured questionnaire. Results: Volunteering in a context of skilled, group-bonded, culturally prestigious activity adds considerably to social capital among elderly men in Norway. Respondents explain their involvement in terms of prior relationships and current social benefits. They spoke of the value of maintaining past personal connections to a particular ship, shipping company, or local community. These were reinforced by current social benefits, such as the experience of companionship, unity, and the feeling of making an important contribution to the society. The group dynamics and strong collective aspect of these voluntary associations maintains internal cohesion, and members only leave when forced by increasing age, poor health, or insufficient financial resources. Conclusions: This article illuminates a case study of gender-specific engagement of older adults in volunteer roles returning high benefits both to participants and society, and adds knowledge to public-health programs and policies in the volunteer- and cultural-heritage sector.

AB  - Objectives. Guided by interactional role theory and employing a resilience framework, this study aimed to investigate whether formal volunteering protects older adults with more role-identity absences in major life domains (partner, employment, and parental) from poorer psychological well-being. Methods. We used data from 373 participants, aged 65-74, in the 1995 National Survey of Midlife Development in the U.S. (MIDUS). Multivariate regression models estimated the effects of major role-identity absences, formal volunteering, and the interaction between major role-identity absences and volunteering on respondents' negative affect, positive affect, and purpose in life. Results. Participants with a greater number of major role-identity absences reported more negative affect, less positive affect, and less purpose in life. Being a formal volunteer was associated with more positive affect and moderated the negative effect of having more major role-identity absences on respondents' feelings of purpose in life. Discussion. Consistent with previous studies, findings indicate that having more role-identity absences constitutes a risk factor for poorer psychological well-being. Results further demonstrate that being a formal volunteer can protect older adults with a greater number of major role-identity absences from decreased levels of purpose in life. The findings suggest that associations between volunteering and psychological well-being might be contingent upon the volunteer's role-identity status and the dimension of psychological well-being examined.

AB  - We propose that voluntary work, characterized by social, physical and cognitive activity in later life is associated with fewer cognitive problems and lower dementia rates. We test these assumptions using 3-wave, self-reported, and registry data from the 2010, 2012, and 2014 Swedish National Prescribed Drug Register. We had three groups of seniors in our data: 1) no volunteering (N = 531), 2) discontinuous volunteering (N = 220), and 3) continuous volunteering (N = 250). We conducted a path analysis in Mplus to investigate the effect of voluntary work (discontinuously and continuously) on self-reported cognitive complaints and the likelihood of being prescribed an anti-dementia treatment after controlling for baseline and relevant background variables. Our results indicated that seniors, who continuously volunteered, reported a decrease in their cognitive complaints over time, whereas no such associations were found for the other groups. In addition, they were 2.44 (95%CI [1.86; 3.21]) and 2.46 (95%CI [1,89; 3.24]) times less likely to be prescribed an anti-dementia treatment in 2012 and 2014, respectively. Our results largely support the assumptions that voluntary work in later life is associated with lower self-reported cognitive complaints and a lower risk for dementia, relative to those who do not engage, or only engage episodically in voluntary work.

AB  - Objectives: The purpose of this study was to test whether paid work and formal volunteering reduce the rate of mental health decline in later life. Methods: Using four waves of Health and Retirement Study data collected from a sample of 7,830 individuals aged 55 to 66, I estimated growth curve models to assess the effects of productive activities on mental health trajectories. The analytical strategy took into account selection processes when examining the beneficial effects of activities. The analyses also formally attended to the sample attrition problem inherent in longitudinal studies. Results: The results indicated that activity participants generally had better mental health at the beginning of the study. Full-time employment and low-level volunteering had independent protective effects against decline in psychological well-being. Joint participants of both productive activities enjoyed a slower rate of mental health decline than single-activity participants. Discussion: The results are consistent with activity theory and further confirm the role accumulation perspective. The finding that full-time work combined with low-level volunteering is protective of mental health reveals the complementary effect of volunteering to formal employment. Methodological and theoretical implications are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

There is an overall positive correlation between volunteering and perceived health, life satisfaction, and self-life expectancy and a negative correlation to depression. However, in some countries the correlation is much stronger than in others. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Volunteer work is beneficial for not only recipients and organizations but also volunteers. Several studies have shown the positive effects on health, psychological well-being, and even on the longevity of those who take part in some kind of voluntary work. These benefits are even greater in older adults. Our research seeks to further analyse these benefits. We have studied the differences between a group of mature volunteers and another equivalent group who do not carry out any voluntary work. A total of 176 people older than 50 years of age (88 volunteers and 88 nonvolunteers) were interviewed. The results show significant differences in all the variables analysed. Meanwhile, the regression analysis indicates that self-esteem, self-efficacy, and social support are the variables with greater predictive weight in the level of participation. These three variables explain 41% of the variance.

AB  - If research shows that because of their volunteer work, older adults are more optimistic, physically active, socially engaged, and less likely to die within 10 years, what, if anything, does this mean for the public's health? And if it does mean something positive (and it does), what can be done to translate the research on the health benefits of volunteerism into real-world interventions, programs, and initiatives that can be implemented, evaluated, and replicated so that society achieves a greater number of healthier, happier older citizens engaged in meaningful activities with potentially lower health costs? In short, how can we increase the number of volunteers like Joyce, David, and Paul? This chapter attempts to provide one answer to this question by outlining one potentially useful yet, to date, virtually unexamined practical public health application of the research on the health benefits of volunteerism—the involvement of primary care physicians as volunteerism advocates. It also serves as a call to action for more integrated research that explicitly links volunteering with clinical medical practice—two fields that operate mostly in isolation from each other. Given the confluence of large and noted trends in the aging, civic engagement, and health care fields, the time has come for the important research on the health benefits of volunteerism (and altruism) to be part of the broader discussion of health care for older adults and for volunteering to be viewed as a real public health issue.

AB  - This study was designed to construct a model based on the concept of psychological well-being, in order to verify the relationship between Taiwanese elderly volunteering and their psychological well-being. Research data were collected via a questionnaire administered to the target population of this study, senior residents of Pingtung County aged 65 or more. The data were then tested and verified by confirmative factor analysis and structural equation modeling. The overall model showed higher levels of psychological well-being for the elderly who participated in volunteer work than those who did not, which again confirmed the positive relation between volunteer work and psychological well-being.

AB  - Objectives: To examine whether psychosocial factors that can be a target for interventions, such as volunteering, are associated with risk of cognitive impairment. Design: Health and Retirement Study (HRS) data from 1998 to 2012, a nationally representative longitudinal panel survey of older adults assessed every 2 years, were used. Setting: The HRS interviews participants aged 50 and older across the contiguous United States. Participants: Individuals aged 60 and older in 1998 (N = 13,262). Measurements: Personal interviews were conducted with respondents to assess presence of cognitive impairment, measured using a composite across cognitive measures. Results: Volunteering at the initial assessment and volunteering regularly over time independently decreased the risk of cognitive impairment over 14 years, and these findings were maintained independent of known risk factors for cognitive impairment. Greater risk of onset of cognitive impairment was associated with being older, being female, being nonwhite, having fewer years of education, and reporting more depressive symptoms. Conclusion: Consistent civic engagement in old age is associated with lower risk of cognitive impairment and provides impetus for interventions to protect against the onset of cognitive impairment. Given the increasing number of baby boomers entering old age, the findings support the public health benefits of volunteering and the potential role of geriatricians, who can promote volunteering by incorporating 'prescriptions to volunteer' into their patient care.

AB  - This study aims to further our understanding of formal volunteering as a protective mechanism for health in the context of housing relocation and to explore race, gender, and education as moderators. A quasi-experimental design evaluated the effects of volunteering on older adults’ health (self-report health, number of instrumental activities of daily living [IADLs], and depressive symptoms) among individuals who relocated but did not volunteer at Time 1 (N = 682) in the Health and Retirement Study (2008–2010). Propensity score weighting examined health differences at Time 2 between 166 volunteers (treated) and 516 nonvolunteers (controlled). Interaction terms tested moderation. Individuals who moved and engaged in volunteering reported higher levels of self-rated health and fewer IADL difficulties compared to the control group. Race moderated the relationship between volunteering and depressive symptoms, while gender moderated the relationship between volunteering and self-assessed health. Formal volunteering protects different dimensions of health after relocation. Volunteering was particularly beneficial for females and older Whites. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - We examine associations between a wide range of social factors and mortality in a nationally representative survey of older adults (N=2995). We find that social network size, participation in social organizations (religious services, volunteering, local meetings), marriage, and emotional closeness to confidants all have comparable associations with reduced mortality risk. Time spent with confidants, network density, availability of support, loneliness, and talking about health were not associated with all-cause mortality. Furthermore, we found that individuals who had more family in their network, and who were closer with their family were less likely to die. No such associations were observed for number or closeness to friends. Closeness to family also protected against death from cardiovascular disease, but not cancer. We link our findings to sociological theories concerning the differences between family and friendships, and call for increased attention to categories of relationships in the study of social factors and mortality.

AB  - Objectives Social engagement benefits emotional well‐being, but the mechanisms need to be better understood. Using volunteering as an example of social engagement, we first examined whether volunteering would be longitudinally beneficial to life satisfaction in older adulthood and the moderating role of changes in the social network size in such a relationship as a potential mechanism. Second, we investigated motivations to volunteer in order to promote more volunteering in older adulthood. Methods A sample of 1,591 older participants from the Personality and Total Health (PATH) through life study (PATH) was assessed (Age: Mean = 66.54 years, SD = 1.50 years, 48% female). PATH is a four‐wave longitudinal project with a 4‐year interval between each two waves. Data from PATH Waves 3 and 4 were used to examine the relationship between volunteering and life satisfaction changes and the moderating role of changes in the social network size. Data from PATH Waves 2, 3, and 4 were used to examine the motivations to short‐term and long‐term volunteer. Results and Conclusion We found that longer volunteering time was associated with a higher level of increase in life satisfaction during the 4‐year interval. Life satisfaction increased more in participants who lost more friends than in participants who lost fewer friends. Consistent with socioemotional selectivity theory, emotional goals were positively associated with more short‐term and long‐term volunteering behaviours. These findings provide scientific insight into the mechanisms and motives underlying the positive effects of volunteering on life satisfaction in old age.

AB  - Objective: Our aim was to examine whether engagement in productive activities, including volunteering, paid work, and childcare, protects older adults against the development of geriatric frailty. Methods: Data from the first (1988) and second (1991) waves of the MacArthur Study of Successful Aging, a prospective cohort study of high-functioning older adults aged 70–79 years (n = 1,072), was used to examine the hypothesis that engagement in productive activities is associated with lower levels of frailty 3 years later. Results: Engagement in productive activities at baseline was associated with a lower cumulative odds of frailty 3 years later in unadjusted models (odds ratio [OR] = 0.74, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.58–0.96) but not after adjusting for age, disability, and cognitive function (adjusted OR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.60–1.01). Examination of productive activity domains showed that volunteering (but neither paid work nor childcare) was associated with a lower cumulative odds of frailty after adjusting for age, disability, and cognitive function. This relationship diminished and was no longer statistically significant after adjusting for personal mastery and religious service attendance. Discussion: Though high-functioning older adults who participate in productive activities are less likely to become frail, after adjusting for age, disability, and cognitive function, only volunteering is associated with a lower cumulative odds of frailty.

AB  - Objectives: We examined the influence of prosocial orientations including altruism, volunteering, and informal helping on positive and negative well-being outcomes among retirement community dwelling elders. Method: We utilize data from 2 waves, 3 years apart, of a panel study of successful aging (N = 585). Psychosocial well-being outcomes measured include life satisfaction, positive affect, negative affect, and depressive symptomatology. Results: Ordinal logistic regression results indicate that altruistic attitudes, volunteering, and informal helping behaviors make unique contributions to the maintenance of life satisfaction, positive affect and other well being outcomes considered in this research. Predictors explain variance primarily in the positive indicators of psychological well-being, but are not significantly associated with the negative outcomes. Female gender and functional limitations are also associated with diminished psychological well-being. Discussion: Our findings underscore the value of altruistic attitudes as important additional predictors, along with prosocial behaviors in fostering life satisfaction and positive affect in old age.

AB  - Objectives : This study evaluated the successful aging model by assessing the impact of two forms of productive engagement-working and volunteering-as potential interventions in the process of disablement. Method : The Health and Retirement Study was used to (a) estimate two-stage selection equations of (i) currently working part time and full time and (ii) currently volunteering less than 100 hours and volunteering 100 hours or more per year (net of chronic health problems) and (b) assess whether, net of selection, working, and volunteering moderate the association between chronic conditions and subsequent functional limitations. Results : Chronic conditions were associated with elevated levels of subsequent functional limitations, whereas both working and volunteering were associated with lower levels of subsequent functional limitations. Moreover, workers and volunteers of less than 100 hours per year experienced a reduction in the association of chronic conditions on subsequent functional limitations. Discussion : This research highlights the role of productive engagement as a key element in successful aging. Not only do work and volunteering have direct associations with health outcomes themselves, but they also act as potential interventions in the process of disablement by attenuating the way in which chronic conditions are translated into subsequent functional limitations. This suggests that (a) future research should apply successful aging models to health processes as well as health outcomes and (b) policy makers should support social institutions that foster late-life productive engagement.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to explain the effect of participation in productive activities on life satisfaction and its implications for social evaluation of productive aging. This study uses data collected from 1,250 elderly women living in urban areas. The regression model was used to examine the influence of elderly women's participation in productive activities on their life satisfaction. Elderly women who participate in volunteer work, learning, and social group activities commonly recognized their activities as meaningful, feeling like worthwhile members of society, and evaluated such activities as very positive. In contrast, elderly women who participated in household chores and family care activities expressed a negative life satisfaction. The difference in life satisfaction regarding productive activities stems not only from the physical and environmental differences but also from the gap between the official social value underpinned by the recognition of surrounding people, their support, and the value of productive activities.

AB  - Purpose of the Study: The study investigates whether productive activities by older adults reduce bodily inflammation, as indicated by C-reactive protein (CRP), a biomeasure associated with the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Design and Methods: The study uses a representative survey of adults aged 57–85 from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (N = 1,790). Linear regression models were used to analyze the effects of multiple roles (employment, volunteering, attending meetings, and caregiving) and the frequency of activity within each role on log values of CRP concentration (mg/L) drawn from assayed blood samples. Results: Number of roles for productive activities was associated with lower levels of CRP net of chronic conditions, lifestyle factors, and socioeconomic resources. When specific types of activity were examined, volunteering manifested the strongest association with lower levels of inflammation, particularly in the 70+ group. There was no evidence that frequent engagement in volunteer activity was associated with heightened inflammation. Implications: Productive activities—and frequent volunteering in particular—may protect individuals from inflammation that is associated with increased risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease.

AB  - This descriptive study examined the relationship between volunteer activities, depressive symptoms, and feelings of usefulness among older adults using path analysis. Survey data was collected via interview from residents of a continuing care retirement community. Neither feelings of usefulness nor volunteering were directly associated with depressive symptoms. Volunteering was directly associated with feelings of usefulness and indirectly associated with depressive symptoms through total physical activity. Age, fear of falling, pain, physical activity, and physical resilience explained 31% of the variance in depressive symptoms. Engaging in volunteer work may be beneficial for increasing feelings of usefulness and indirectly improving depressive symptoms among older adults.

AB  - Does volunteer participation reduce depressive symptoms among older people? Does depression influence whether older people will volunteer? Might nonrandom attrition in a longitudinal study bias the relationship between volunteering and depression? This research addresses these questions with three-wave data from the Americans' Changing Lives study. Multigroup structural equation models for complete and incomplete data are used to estimate the joint causal relationship between volunteer work and depression. The results reveal a beneficial effect of formal volunteering on depression, but not for informal helping. Depression was shown to be associated with a subsequent increase in formal volunteering, suggesting voluntarism as a means of compensation. Functional health problems, not depression, emerged as the important barrier to volunteering. In addition, a sample selection effect--depressed persons and nonvolunteers were less likely to complete the panel study--was detected and accounted for in the analysis. The results are discussed in light of the legitimacy of formal social integration. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Pensioners currently compose nearly 20% of the British population; men and women can expect to spend an average of about 17 years and 19 years in retirement, respectively. The present study aimed to investigate the roles of preretirement occupation and self-rated health (SRH) on the attainment of life satisfaction in retired people. A total of 121 community-dwelling men and women (M age = 75.8 years, SD = 7.1) completed a survey to assess life satisfaction, self-rated health, retirement stress, retirement adjustment, and recollected aspects of preretirement occupation. Results revealed positive and significant correlations between scores on a life satisfaction measure and SRH, retirement stress, and retirement adjustment (all ps < .001). Path analysis indicated that aspects of previous employment that may predict an adverse influence on current life satisfaction and that engagement in voluntary work appears to have benefits for both life satisfaction and SRH. The authors conclude that many of the adverse effects of preretirement occupation can be helped or avoided through suitable retirement preparation and training.

AB  - Past research suggests that senior citizens often face challenges related to deteriorating physical and mental health, and the quality of their lives may suffer as a result. Past research also suggests that volunteering can improve the health and quality of life for seniors. In the present study, 451 volunteers enrolled in the Retired and Senior Volunteer Program (RSVP) completed surveys including questions regarding their volunteer experiences and how these experiences have affected their health and quality of life. The results suggest that volunteering through RSVP is associated with improvements in health and quality of life across a variety of dimensions. Furthermore, these improvements may be particularly greater for women, current volunteers, and older seniors. These findings may help guide interventions designed to enhance the health and well-being of senior citizens in a variety of settings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: The aim of this article is to describe the potential with respect to volunteer work among 55 to 70-year-old persons along with a two-dimensional typology (actual volunteer work and intention of volunteering or expanding actual volunteer work) and to identify the influencing factors. Material and methods: Based on the dataset from the transitions and old age potential (TOP) study, a total of 4421 men and women born between 1942 and 1958 were included. A multinomial regression model showed the predictors for group affiliation along with an engagement-related typology (internal, utilized and external volunteer potential as well as definite non-volunteers). Results: More than a half of the persons in the study sample could be classified as internal or external volunteer potential. Volunteers and potential volunteers revealed more similarities regarding resources and social factors than potential volunteers and definite non-volunteers. Potential volunteers were more active in other informal fields of activity (e.g. nursing or child care) than definite non-volunteers. Conclusion: With respect to volunteer work, definite non-volunteers showed various social disadvantages (in particular with respect to education and health) compared to (potential) volunteers. Other informal activities did not seem to be in major conflict with volunteer activities, e.g. nursing or child care, as long as they were carried out with moderate or low intensity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved) Hintergrund: Ziel des Beitrags ist, sowohl das tatsächliche als auch das potenzielle bürgerschaftliche Engagement von unter 55- bis 70-Jährigen anhand einer 2-dimensionalen Typologie (ausgeübtes Engagement sowie Absicht zu einer Aufnahme bzw. Ausweitung eines bestehenden Engagements) zu beschreiben und die Einflussfaktoren zu identifizieren. Daten und Methode: Aus dem Datensatz der Studie „Transitions and Old Age Potential' (TOP) wird ein Sample mit 4421 Männern und Frauen der Geburtskohorten 1942– 1958 verwendet. Aufbauend auf einer engagementbezogenen Typologie (internes, ausgeschöpftes und externes Potenzial sowie definitiv Nichtengagierte) zeigt ein multinomiales Regressionsmodell die Prädiktoren für die Gruppenzugehörigkeit. Ergebnisse: Mehr als die Hälfte des Samples lässt sich dem internen oder externen Potenzial zuordnen. Engagierte ohne Ausweitungsabsicht und potenziell Engagierte sind sich bezüglich ihrer Ressourcenausstattung und sozialen Faktoren ähnlicher als potenziell Engagierte und definitiv Nichtengagierte. Die Gruppe der potenziell Engagierten übt im Vergleich zu den definitiv Nichtengagierten häufiger andere informelle Tätigkeiten (z. B. Pflege oder Kinderbetreuung) aus. Schlussfolgerung: Definitiv nichtengagierte Personen weisen gegenüber (potenziell) Engagierten unterschiedliche soziale Nachteile auf (v. a. in Bezug auf Bildung und Gesundheit). Bürgerschaftliches Engagement scheint mit anderen informellen Tätigkeiten wie z. B. Pflege oder Kinderbetreuung nicht in starkem Konflikt zu stehen, sofern diese mit geringer oder mittlerer Intensität ausgeübt werden. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study examines the links between formal community participation (defined as volunteer work for an organization) in the United States and psychological well-being, focusing on retirement as a key status transition. It draws on data from 762 American retirees and not-yet-retired older workers in the midcourse years (in their 50s, 60s, and early 70s) to examines: (1) whether unpaid community participation of retirees compensates for the loss of connectedness associated with their paid career jobs, and (2) whether community participation predicts the well-being of various subgroups of retirees. We find little difference in the community participation of midcourse Americans by their retirement status. But community participation does predict the well-being of retirees, supporting a compensatory hypothesis. Dividing the sample of retirees into those who engage in post-retirement paid work and those who do not reveal a positive association between community participation and well-being of non-workers only. Community participation appears especially salutary for the well-being of some subgroups of retirees in the United States (men more than women, those with less income, and those in poor health).

Possible relationships were explored between the number, duration, timing, and episodes of various nonfamily roles throughout adulthood and subsequent health and multiple-role occupancy. Occupying multiple roles (OMRs) in 1956, participating in volunteer work on an intermittent basis, and belonging to a club or organization were positively related to various measures of health. OMRs in 1956 and doing volunteer work were also positively related to OMRs in 1986. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study tests the effects of volunteering on the well-being of older adults, including the effect of level of engagement, the moderating effects of demographic and social factors, and the effects of the nature of the volunteer experience. Self-rated health, functional dependency, and depression are regressed on the well-being measures from the previous waves, other control variables and volunteer status, volunteer hours, type and number of volunteer organizations, and the perceived benefit to others of the volunteer work. Older adults who volunteer and who engage in more hours of volunteering report higher levels of well-being. This positive effect was not moderated by social integration, race, or gender. There was no effect of the number of organizations for which the older adult volunteered, the type of organization, or the perceived benefit of the work to others. his work contributes to a knowledge base that points to the development of social programs and policies that maximize the engagement of older adults in volunteer roles. The findings suggest that targeting efforts may not be warranted, in that there are not differential benefits according to personal characteristics of the volunteer.

AB  - Introduction: Research on outcomes of volunteering in later life largely focuses on the health of volunteers. This is in contrast to studies of youth, where attention is directed toward the effects of volunteering on subsequent productive and citizen behaviors. In this study, we examined the effects of volunteering on subsequent social and civic activity of older adults. Method: This study was conducted with volunteers from Experience Corps® (EC), a national program that brings older adults into schools to work with students. Data were derived from a baseline survey of older adults who were new EC volunteers in fall of 2006 and 2007. Follow-up interviews were conducted with 338 volunteers in fall 2010 to capture work, education, and community activities undertaken subsequent to joining EC. Results: Subsequent to joining EC, 16% of volunteers reported that they started a new job, 53% started another volunteer position, 40% started a community activity, and 39% took a class/started educational program. When asked if and how EC participation played a role in their new involvements, 71% said it increased confidence, 76% said it increased realization of the importance of organized activities/daily structure, and more than 40% said they made social connections that led to new involvements. Most reported they were more likely to be involved in advocacy efforts for public education. Discussion: Volunteering among older adults is a means as well as an end—just as it is for young people. Programs can do more to attract and serve older adults by promoting volunteering as a pathway to other engagements, including work, social, and civic activities.

AB  - Although a number of authors have proposed that older volunteers should benefit in terms of better health and well-being, few researchers have examined the issue empirically to see whether this is true. The purpose of this article is to build on this literature by empirically examining the association between volunteering and mortality among older adults. Using data from a nationally representative sample, we use Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate the effects of volunteering on the rate of mortality among persons aged 65 and older. We find that volunteering has a protective effect on mortality among those who volunteered for one organization or for forty hours or less over the past year. We further find that the protective effects of volunteering are strongest for respondents who report low levels of informal social interaction and who do not live alone. We discuss the possibility that the curvilinear relationship we observe between volunteering and mortality is due to a combination of factors, including self-identity, role strain, and meaningfulness. Other research using more precise data is needed to determine whether these ideas are supportable. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Flexible work arrangements and retirement options provide one solution for the challenges of unemployment and underemployment, aging populations, and unsustainable public pension systems in welfare states around the world. We examine the relationships between well-being and job satisfaction on the one hand and employment status and retirement, on the other, using Gallup World Poll data for several European countries and the United States. We find that voluntary part-time workers are happier, experience less stress and anger, and have higher job satisfaction than other employees. Using statistical matching, we show that late-life workers under voluntary part-time or full-time arrangements have higher well-being than retirees. There is no well-being premium for involuntary late-life work and self-employment compared to retirement, however. Our findings inform ongoing debates about the optimal retirement age and the fiscal burdens of public pension systems.

AB  - Background: the health impacts of caregiving and volunteering are rarely studied concurrently, despite the potential for both synergies and conflicts. This population-based study examines the association of these activities on health and subsequent mortality. Method: a census-based record-linkage study of 244,429 people aged 65 and over, with cohort characteristics, caregiving and volunteering status, and presence of chronic health conditions derived from the Census returns. Mortality risk was assessed over the following 45 months with adjustment for baseline characteristics. Results: caregivers and volunteers were individually more mobile than those undertaking neither activity; caregivers who also volunteered were more mobile than those who did not volunteer, but no less likely to suffer from poor mental health. Both caregiving and volunteering were separately associated with reduced mortality risk (HR = 0.74: 95% confidence intervals (CIs) = 0.71, 0.77 and HR = 0.76: 0.73, 0.81, respectively); the lowest mortality was found amongst light caregivers who also volunteered (HR = 0.53: 95% CIs = 0.45, 0.62), compared to those engaged in neither. There was no evidence of a multiplicative effect of caregiving and volunteering at more intense levels of caregiving. Conclusion: there is a large overlap in caregiving and volunteering activities with complex associations with health status. There is some evidence that combining caregiving and volunteering activities, for those involved in less intense levels of caregiving, maybe associated with lower mortality risk than associated with either activity alone. Further research is needed to understand which aspects of caregiving and volunteering are best and for whom and in which circumstances. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - 1,972 older residents in California (aged 55–85+ yrs) were investigated prospectively for association of volunteering service to others and all-cause mortality. Potential confounding factors were studied: demographics, health status, physical functioning, health habits, social support, religious involvement, and emotional states. Possible interaction effects of volunteering with religious involvement and social support were also explored. Results showed that 31% (630) of respondents volunteered, about 50% (289) for more than one organization. High volunteers (≥2 organizations) had 63% lower mortality than nonvolunteers. Unexpectedly, volunteering was slightly more protective for those with high religious involvement and perceived social support. After multivariate adjustment, any level of volunteering reduced mortality by 60% among weekly attenders at religious services. Lower mortality rates for community service volunteers were only partly explained by health habits, physical functioning, religious attendance, and social support.

AB  - In the abstract, few ideas generate more widespread agreement than the notion that a high level of citizen volunteering will benefit society. Formal volunteer work and informal helping of diverse kinds are seen as signs of 'social capital' and socially healthy civic engagement, supported by both the political Left and the political Right (Putnam, 1993). Approximately half of adults of all ages in the United States engage in formal volunteer work each year (Hodgkinson & Weitzman, 1996). Several authors have presented data or argued that such volunteering may bring health or well-being benefits for youth, mature adults, or older persons. The purpose of this chapter is to offer a scientific perspective and to review available evidence on how volunteering affects health and longevity. We focus on formal volunteer work, performed through a school, hospital, library, or environmental, political, or other organization. Formal volunteer work stands in contrast to more casual or unorganized helping activities, often termed 'informal helping,' such as giving directions to a stranger or serving as a caregiver for a family member or a neighbor (Wilson, 2000). Volunteering must also be distinguished from paid work. Formal volunteering has been the topic of a great deal of social scientific study, although most previous research has examined predictors of volunteering rather than its consequences (Wilson, 2000). This chapter's primary focus is on physical health outcomes, although I will also cite evidence linking volunteering with improved mental health and subjective well-being. First, I describe mechanisms by which volunteering might affect physical health, as well as moderating factors that might strengthen or weaken these influences. Next, I review empirical evidence suggesting that volunteering may indeed provide physical and mental health benefits. I conclude by discussing some practical implications and needs for further research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objectives: As populations age, there will be a need for more volunteers in social welfare, and consequently a need to better understand potential effects of volunteering for older people. Whilst there is a body of international literature exploring health benefits of volunteering in later life, there are currently no longitudinal studies of Australian populations. Internationally, there is a lack of studies focusing on older women, who comprise the majority of the ageing population. The aim of this article was to explore the relationship between volunteering and psychosocial and health factors for a cohort of older Australian women over time. Method: Data for this study were from the oldest cohort of Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health, a 20-year longitudinal survey of Australian women aged 70-75 years in 1996. Volunteering status was the factor of interest and study factors included a broad range of demographic, health and social factors. A longitudinal model was developed for mediators of volunteering over time. Results: Of 7088 women in 2005, 24.5% reported actively volunteering, 15.5% were continuing, 7.5% were new, 15.3% were intermittent and 34.7% had never been volunteers. Volunteering was associated with increased quality of life and social support. Women were more likely to continue volunteering over time if they lived in a rural area, had higher socioeconomic indicators, and better levels of physical and mental health. Conclusions: This study contributes to the literature on the relationship between volunteering and health for older women. Understanding the potential health implications of volunteering is a critical issue in current policy debates.

AB  - Background: A growing evidence base demonstrates that interventions that focus on participation in physical and social activities can assist in preventing and treating both physical and mental health problems. In addition, there is some evidence that engaging in volunteering activities can provide beneficial social, physical, psychological, and cognitive outcomes for older people. This study will use a randomized controlled trial approach to investigate the potential for interventions involving volunteer activities to produce positive physical and psychological outcomes for older people, thereby contributing to the limited evidence relating to the potential for volunteering to provide multiple health effects. Methods/Design: This randomized controlled trial will involve 400 retired/non-employed individuals in good health aged 60+ years living in the metropolitan area in Perth, Western Australia. Participants will be recruited from the Perth metropolitan area using a variety of recruitment methods to achieve a diverse sample in terms of age, gender, and socioeconomic status. Consenting and eligible participants will be randomly assigned to an intervention (n = 200) or control group (n = 200). Those in the intervention group will be asked to engage in a minimum 60 min of volunteer activities per week for a period of 6 months, while those in the control group will be asked to maintain their existing lifestyle or take on new activities as they see fit. Physical and psychological outcomes will be assessed. Primary physical outcomes will include physical activity and sedentary time (measured using pedometers and Actigraph monitors) and physical health (measured using a battery of physical functioning tests, resting heart rate, blood pressure, BMI, and girth). Primary psychological outcomes will include psychological well-being, depression, self-esteem, and quality of life (measured using the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Survey, and the Global Quality of Life Scale, respectively). Secondary outcomes of interest will include attitudes to volunteering (measured via open-ended interviews) and personal growth, purpose in life, social support, and self-efficacy (measured using the Personal Growth and Purpose in Life subscales of Ryff's Psychological Well-Being Scale, the Social Provisions Scale, and the Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale, respectively). Participants will be re-assessed on these measures after 6 months. Discussion: The results of this randomized controlled trial will generate new knowledge relating to the physical and psychological health benefits of different levels and types of volunteering for older people. In addition, insight will be provided into the major factors influencing the recruitment and retention of older volunteers. Understanding the full potential for volunteering to affect physical and mental well-being will provide policy makers with the evidence they require to determine appropriate investment in the volunteering sector, especially in relation to encouraging volunteering among older people who constitute an important resource for the community.

AB  - Older Americans contribute to society's ability to age in several ways: through volunteer work, informal assistance to others, and paid work; through taking care of their own households and possessions; and through participating in activities that increase their health and well-being. Overall productive contributions are lower among older Americans than among their younger, particularly middle-aged counterparts. Some of this decrease is due to increased health problems among the aged, some to a cessation of age-related roles, and some to societal beliefs and norms about productive involvement or noninvolvement of the elderly. It is proposed that individual and societal aging could benefit from increased productive participation of the aged, but options that are flexible in quantity and format need to be available.

AB  - Objectives: The present study examines the association between formal volunteering and cognitive functioning over time. We also examine the moderating roles of race, sex, education, and time. Method: Using 11,100 participants aged 51 years and older and nine waves of data from the Health and Retirement Survey, we simultaneously modeled the longitudinal associations between engaging in formal volunteering and changes in cognitive functioning using multilevel models. Results: Formal volunteering was associated with higher levels of cognitive functioning over time, especially with aspects of cognitive functioning related to working memory and processing. This association was stronger for women than it was for men, and for those with below average levels of education. The positive association between formal volunteering and cognitive functioning weakened over time when cognitive functioning was conceptualized as memory, but strengthened over time when conceptualized as working memory and processing. Discussion: Volunteering is a productive activity that is beneficial not just to society, but to volunteers' levels of cognitive functioning in older age. For women and those with lower levels of education, formal volunteering appears particularly beneficial to working memory and processing. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Compared 102 volunteer workers over age 65 to retired elderly who did not engage in any type of work activity. Volunteers had a significantly higher degree of life satisfaction, stronger will to live, and fewer symptoms of depression, anxiety, and somatization. Since no differences were found on most demographic or background variables, participation in volunteer work appears to be the salient factor in explaining psychosocial differences between volunteers and nonvolunteers.

AB  - The author presents volunteering as a means of active ageing and as an original (not only residual) sector of society. She describes two complementary aspects of volunteering in an active ageing context: (1) volunteering of older people, and (2) volunteering for older people. Within both aspects, the positions of older people as the subjects and objects of voluntary work can change. The author defines the interconnectivity of both aspects as an "object-subject volunteering chain" based on a life course perspective, particularly referring to volunteering in the long-term care sector. Based on a secondary analysis of available research findings and sources, she summarises some distinctive characteristics of older people operating in the voluntary long-term care sector. A discussion of findings follows, and finally, some recommendations for how to establish age-friendly public support for volunteering are given.

AB  - The authors of this article examine the health benefits of volunteering while focusing on older adults. The authors examine physical health benefits, mental health benefits and social benefits. They found that volunteering amongst older adults was correlated to better health and longer survival rates. Some mental benefits included increased life satisfaction and life purpose, while the social benefits centered around gaining a social support network and experiencing more connectedness.

AB  - Objective: to examine the effect of late life engagement in continued work involvement or volunteer activities during retirement on mental well-being. Methods: two waves of data from the Singapore Longitudinal Ageing Studies were analyzed for 2,716 Singaporeans aged 55 or above at baseline and 1,754 at 2-year follow-up. Trained research nurses interviewed participants (non-volunteering retiree, volunteering retiree, and working seniors) on mental health status (geriatric depression scale, Mini Mental State Examination, positive mental wellbeing and life satisfaction). Results: about 88% of seniors were retired (78% non-volunteering, 10% volunteering) and 12% were still working in paid employment or business. At baseline and 2 year follow up, and regardless of physical health status, volunteering retirees and working seniors gave significantly better MMSE cognitive performance scores, fewer depressive symptoms, and better mental well-being and life satisfaction than non-volunteering retirees. Conclusion: the results of this study suggest that continued work involvement or volunteerism provides opportunities for social interaction and engagement and may be associated with enhanced mental well-being. Future research should clarify which specific aspects of volunteerism are related to long-term mental well-being. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to clarify the influence of volunteerism as part of a long-term care prevention program on social and physical health indicators and QOL, as compared with non-participation among elderly people. METHODS: The baseline survey was conducted in 2003 among elderly people (age, 70-84 years) living in a rural community in Miyagi Prefecture. We recruited elderly volunteer leaders for long-term care prevention from among the 1,503 elderly people participating in the baseline survey. Of these, 77 individuals were registered as volunteer leaders. One year later, we conducted a follow-up survey to clarify the influence of volunteerism. Finally, we analyzed data for 69 volunteer leaders and 1,207 non-leaders, focusing on influences of volunteerism on social and physical health and QOL using a logistic regression model. State of volunteer activity was treated as a dependent variable, and social and physical health indicators and QOL indices as independent variables. RESULTS: Non-participating individuals had significant declines in Intellectual Activity (OR: 4.51, 95% CI: 1.60-12.74), Social Role (OR: 2.85, 95%CI: 1.11-7.21), Self-efficacy for ADL (OR: 4.58, 95%CI: 1.11-18.88), Satisfaction with Economic State (OR: 2.83, 95%CI: 1.11-7.21), and Contact with Neighbors (OR: 3.62, 95%CI: 1.29-10.16), as compared with volunteers. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that volunteerism prevents lowering of higher-level functional capacity and social networking among community-dwelling elderly individuals.

AB  - This study examines concomitants of volunteering in the context of other lifestyle activities. Investigating formal volunteering in old-old age, the authors analyzed data of 148 volunteers versus 1,195 nonvolunteers in a national sample of the Israeli Jewish population aged 75-94. As hypothesized, being a volunteer related (whether as a cause or effect) to more positive functioning on psychosocial markers and prospectively resulted in reduced mortality risk even when other activity outlets (physical activity, everyday activities, having a hobby) were controlled. These findings suggest that the benefits of volunteering in late life are not reducible to those of other activities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The article discusses conservation volunteering through New Zealand's Positive Ageing Strategy. Serving as a model for other countries, the strategy encourages older people to share their knowledge, skills and experience to make New Zealand a better place for all. It cites examples of positive ageing like retired teacher Stan Butcher who joined volunteers of Forest & Bird, a non-government organisation that has advocated for nature conservation since 1923 and runs community restoration projects through its nationwide network of 50 branches.

AB  - The focus of this dissertation is on the concept of 'successful aging' within social contexts. Specifically, how the contexts of perceived social support, marital status, and spousal influence are related to successful aging outcomes. Paper 1 adopts Rowe and Kahn's (1997) model of successful aging as a framework for investigating predictors related to 25-year survival. The results show that having better physical functioning (e.g.., walking), low chronic illness, and higher ratings of perceived social support significantly predicted survival over 25 years. Depressive symptoms, church attendance, and participating in volunteer activities were unrelated to survival. Paper 2 investigates the relationship between perceived social support, sex, marital status and long-term survival, as well as the mediating effect of social support on marital status and sex in relation to 25-year survival. The results indicate that both sex and social support directly affected survival, and marital status indirectly influenced survival through social support. Therefore, the relationship between being married and survival appears to be due to the impact that marital status has on level of social support. The aims of Paper 3 were to describe the nature and number of latent classes that best fit cognitive trajectories for husbands and wives over seven years, as well as determine congruence of spousal membership on latent class trajectories. Results determined that the best fitting model for both husbands and wives consisted of four latent classes and nearly 50% of spouses had shared congruent latent classes. This highlights the importance of looking at spousal influences in relation to successful aging outcomes. As a whole, these papers contribute to the current discussion on successful aging and stress the importance of social contexts of successful and optimal aging.

AB  - This cross-sectional, comparative study was performed with the objective to evaluate the quality of life of elderly individuals who perform volunteer work, compared to those who do not. The WHO Quality of Life questionnaire was applies in a group of 166 elderly individuals who performed volunteer work and to another 33 who did not. Results show most are women, single and with high-level education. Compared to No statistically significant difference was found between the groups for the quality of life scores in the physical and environmental domains (p>0.05). In the psychological and social relations domains, and in the global evaluation, it was observed that volunteers had higher scores (p<0.05). In the linear regression model, performing volunteer work appeared as a determinant for better quality of life in the psychological domain and global evaluation. It is suggested that volunteer work is a mechanism to promote quality of life among the elderly, and can be encouraged by health professionals.

AB  - Volunteerism is a key form of community involvement that can provide both physical and mental health benefits for volunteers as well as positive outcomes for the community. However, volunteers become involved for different reasons and recent studies suggest that other-oriented volunteers may accrue greater health benefits than self-oriented volunteers. To investigate this possibility, we surveyed 4,085 Australian volunteers about their motivations using the Volunteer Functions Inventory, together with their well-being using measures of self-esteem, well-being, self-efficacy, social connectedness, and social trust. As predicted, these individual differences in well-being proved to be differentially associated with other-oriented and self-oriented motivations. Furthermore, other-oriented motives were positively correlated, and self-oriented motives were negatively correlated, with satisfaction and intentions to continue. We discuss implications of these patterns for organizations that work with volunteers.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The association of volunteering with well-being has been found in previous research, but mostly among older people. The aim of this study was to examine the association of volunteering with mental well-being among the British population across the life course. DESIGN: British Household Panel Survey, a population-based longitudinal study. SETTING: UK. PARTICIPANTS: 66 343 observations (person-years). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mental well-being was measured by using the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12 or GHQ); high values denote high mental disorder. Four groups of volunteering participation were created: frequent (once a week), infrequent (once a month/several times a year), rare (once or less a year) and never. Multilevel linear models were used to analyse variations in mental well-being over the life course by levels of volunteering. RESULTS: When not considering age, those who engaged in volunteering regularly appeared to experience higher levels of mental well-being than those who never volunteered. To explore the association of volunteering with the GHQ across the life course, interaction terms were fitted between age and volunteering. The interactions were significant, demonstrating that these associations vary by age. The association between volunteering and well-being did not emerge during early adulthood to mid-adulthood, instead becoming apparent above the age of 40 years and continuing up to old age. Moreover, in early adulthood, the absence of engagement in voluntary activity was not related to mental well-being, but GHQ scores for this group increased sharply with age, levelling off after the age of 40 and then increasing again above the age of 70 years. The study also indicates variation in GHQ scores (65%) within individuals across time, suggesting evidence of lifecourse effects. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that volunteering may be more meaningful for mental well-being at some points of time in the life course.

AB  - Older Australians are confronted by dramatic changes in their physical, social, financial, and psychological well-being. There are social costs to these changes related to their productivity and increased costs associated with caring for older Australians. Greater community engagement through voluntary work practice may minimize these costs, as well as positively influence volunteers' subjective quality of life (QOL). This study investigates the motivations for older Australians to engage in formal voluntary work. It seeks to identify whether the motivational factors to volunteer are associated with individuals' subjective QOL. The results indicate a positive relationship between older people's motivations to volunteer and their subjective QOL. This association is strengthened by respondents' community orientation, positive perception of voluntary work, positive personal attitudes toward volunteering, and their self-esteem. The role of policy makers in motivating larger participation by the older groups is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objectives: Experience Corps (EC) places older volunteers in public elementary schools in 20 cities across the country. The EC program in Baltimore is a health promotion intervention designed to improve the academic outcomes of children and increase older adult volunteer physical activity. We sought to determine if there were sustained increases in physical activity with participation in EC. Methods: Seventy-one African American women volunteers in the Baltimore EC were compared with 150 African American women in the Women's Health and Aging Studies (WHAS) I and II; all were aged 65-86 years with comparable Social Economic Status, frailty, and self-reported health status. Using a regression model, we evaluated physical activity adjusting for a propensity score and time of follow-up over 3 years. Results: EC volunteers reported a sustained increase in physical activity as compared with the comparison cohort. Baseline physical activity for individuals with a median propensity score was 420 kcal/wk for both groups. At 36 months, EC volunteers reported 670 kcal/week compared with 410 kcal/week in WHAS (p = .04). Discussion: These findings suggest that high-intensity senior service programs that are designed as health promotion interventions could lead to sustained improvements in physical activity in high-risk older adults, while simultaneously addressing important community needs.

AB  - Purpose: This study tested a theoretical model of volunteering benefits and examined the mechanism through which volunteering benefits older adults. Design and Methods: This is a 2-wave study of 253 older adult volunteers serving in 10 volunteer programs. Older volunteers completed the mailed surveys in 2005 and 2006. Structural equation modeling was used to define the latent variables and to test direct and indirect relationships among organizational support, socioemotional benefits, and self-reported health. Results: Organizational support (measured by choice of volunteer activity, training, and ongoing support) had significant direct associations with 2 latent factors of socioemotional benefits, that is, perceived contribution and personal benefits. Perceived contribution was significantly related to mental health. Additionally, older volunteers with lower socioeconomic status (SES) committed more hours and perceived more personal benefits than higher SES peers. Implications: These findings suggest that volunteer programs can provide various organizational supports to older volunteers, especially to low-SES volunteers, in order to promote the socioemotional and health benefits of volunteering to older adults. Psychological well-being of older adults can be improved through engagement in meaningful volunteer activities and contribution to others. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]

AB  - The present study investigated the relation among socio-demographic and health variables and participation in physical and occupational activities. The sample was formed by 155 aged individuals (60 and older) interviewed by the PENSA study in Juiz de Fora, MG. 72% of the sample was female with average age of 70.3 years (SD=8.2). Questionnaires based on self-report were used for data collection. Results indicated that men participated more frequently in physical activities than women, and women were more active in occupational activities, such as housework and work as volunteers. Higher frequency of participation in occupational activities was associated with higher education, higher income, and higher functional status. However, age was not a significant determinant of active lifestyle. This present study demonstrated a variability of active aging due to gender, socio-demographic and health variables, highlighting the implications of the lifestyle of elderly Brazilians in the process of healthy aging.

AB  - Does volunteer participation reduce depressive symptoms among older people? Does depression influence whether older people will volunteer? Might older people volunteer in an effort to compensate for depressive symptoms? This research addresses these questions with three waves of data from a national sample of older people. Multi-group structural-equation models for complete and incomplete data are used to estimate the joint causal relationship between volunteer work and depression analysis. The results reveal a beneficial effect of formal volunteering on depression, but not for informal helping. Physical health problems, not depression, emerged as the important barrier to volunteering. In addition, a sample selection effect was detected and accounted for in the analysis?depressed persons and non-volunteers were less likely to complete the panel study. Depression was shown to be associated with a subsequent increase in formal volunteering, suggesting voluntarism as a means of compensation. The results are discussed in light of the legitimacy of formal social integration.

AB  - Background and aims: A narrative review of quantitative population-based longitudinal studies was conducted to examine the association of formal voluntary work and personal well-being among older people doing the voluntary work and those being served. Methods: To be included, the study had to be published in a peer-reviewed journal, written in English and conducted in Western countries, participants were at least 60 years of age, the study employed a longitudinal or experimental design, the methodology and outcomes were explicitly described, and voluntary work quantified as visits or hours within a certain time frame. Results: Sixteen studies out of 2897 met the inclusion criteria for the review reporting on benefits of volunteering for those doing the voluntary work. Outcomes were collapsed into three categories of personal well-being: physical health, mental health, and psychosocial resources. All included studies came from the United States and showed that volunteering in old age predicted better self-rated health, functioning, physical activity and life satisfaction as well as decreased depression and mortality. However, it did not decrease the risk of chronic diseases or nursing home admission in old age. Only one study which met the inclusion criteria on the benefits of volunteering for older recipients was identified. Conclusions: Studies mainly used data from large datasets with only limited information about volunteering, which limits more detailed analyses. Randomized controlled trials are needed to study the effect of voluntary work on those being served, as well as to reveal the healthy participant effect among volunteers.

AB  - This paper aims to contribute to the literature on the relationship between productive and healthy ageing as two key theoretical concepts in contemporary ageing. Specifically, volunteering as a productive activity in later life has been associated with social and health benefits for older people. Evidence from the literature has generally focused on global outcomes, such as mortality and self-rated health, or on measures of psychological well-being. This study explored whether volunteering is protective of an important adverse health outcome in later life, that of fall-related hip fracture, utilising data from a case control study of 387 participants. The results showed that volunteer activity in older age remained significantly protective of hip fracture risk [OR: 0.61 (0.38-0.99)], independent of social and physical activity, social support and health status, supporting the hypothesis of a relationship between the concepts of productive and healthy ageing. Whilst further studies are clearly needed to establish causality, these results suggest that health benefits of volunteering in later life might be more extensive than previous studies have shown.

AB  - Within the context of Australia's rapidly ageing population, this paper argues that there is a need to consider the positive contributions made by older people through their volunteer and civic engagement activities. There is a strong civil society tradition in Australia, and a growing body of evidence that demonstrates that older Australians contribute both as volunteers and more informally to their families, their peers, and their communities. Older Australians are active volunteers across a range of organizations, and contribute more time than other age group. Yet there are few policies and very few programs in Australia that promote and support volunteering amongst older people, despite the associated health benefits. There are also significant barriers to volunteering that require attention if these benefits are to be made available to a broader and more diverse group of older Australians.

AB  - The current political-economic climate, which is generally supportive of both private and public sector down-sizing, increasingly demands that human service workers assess, engage, and creatively use consumer strengths and resources. In this article, the authors used a meta-analysis of 37 independent studies to determine whether volunteering affects beneficial change among older volunteers and the people they serve. The meta-analysis provided the means of inferring not only that elder volunteers' sense of well-being seemed to be significantly bolstered through volunteering, but also that such relatively healthy older people represent a significant adjunct resource for meeting some of the service needs of more vulnerable elders, as well as those of other similarly vulnerable groups such as disabled children. Averaging across studies, 85% of the 'clients' who received service from an older volunteer (e.g., peer-counseling of nursing home residents) scored better on dependent measures (e.g., diminished depression) than the average person in comparison conditions did. The policy implications of such beneficial effects among both older volunteers and the people they serve are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Studies of aging populations have usually focused on the role of physical activity in improving health status. However, better health does not guarantee greater life satisfaction and attainment of a higher quality of life. Global well-being indexes reveal that older Koreans have a higher life expectancy and health status, but less life satisfaction and more depression with the highest suicide rate worldwide. Most of them do not become involved in any physical, productive, or social leisure activity, all of which can provide a multitude of benefits for successful aging. Therefore, this study investigates a nationally representative sample of older Koreans to demonstrate the link between different types of activities (exercise, travel, continuing education, volunteer activities, senior centers, club activities, and television watching) and older adults' perceived quality of life, including depression symptoms, perceived health status, and life satisfaction. Additionally, this study identifies the relationship between older adults' sociodemographic characteristics and their leisure participation based on the social gerontology theories. Research findings show that meaningful leisure engagement, particularly travel and exercise, can be a positive factor in older adults' perceived quality of life. Interestingly, watching television is positively related to relationship satisfaction with spouse and children, but negatively influenced other quality of life indicators. Older adults' sociodemographic characteristics also play an essential role in their leisure participation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The number of older people living in the United States has steadily risen over the past 10 years. Moreover, approximately 75% to 80% of this population has chronic medical conditions most often associated with a disability. The consequence of living to an older age is that individuals become more prone to acquiring disabilities. For example, adults 45 years old and under have a 3.1% chance of acquiring a disability, whereas adults aged 55 to 64 have an 18.5% chance of experiencing some form of disability. By the year 2020, at least 52 million Americans 65 years and older are expected to be living with a disability. The Health and Retirement Study utilizes Diener's Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) as a measure of well-being. In order to better understand the well-being of older individuals, we explored the relationship between age, highest degree, gender, marital status, total net worth, race, Hispanic ethnicity, life satisfaction, volunteer work, helping activities, self-rated health, living with a partner or spouse, having any children, having other family members, having friends, functional limitations, perceived positive and negative social support from a partner or spouse, children, other family members, and friends, anxiety and depression with the well-being of aging individuals with disabilities. The first study examined the psychometric properties of a widely-used scale assessing life satisfaction. To this author's knowledge, a full examination of the psychometric properties of both the items and the rating scale along with a study to validate the findings has not yet been performed. The Rasch analysis determined that removing two items from the original scale, and reducing the rating scale to five points improved psychometric statistics, including person separation. These results address the concern that the SWLS in its original form posed difficulty in differentiating people at the low and high level of well-being (Athay, 2012). The purpose of the second study was to determine correlative relationships between multiple independent variables that were reported within the literature as being associated, with the modified well-being scale modified from the results of the Rasch analysis. This study found associations between the total number of functional limitations, highest degree earned, global life satisfaction, volunteer work, and helping activities and well-being. Results from this study indicated that as the amount of functional limitations increased for an individual, his or her well-being subsequently decreased. Functional limitations can reduce the ability to volunteer, help others, thus reducing life satisfaction. The positive association between highest degree and well-being was supported by two studies (Blanchflower & Oswald, 2004; Keyes, Shmotkin, & Ryff, 2002). The statistically significant relationship between global life satisfaction, which measures life satisfaction with a single-item, with well-being is not surprising. This result is consistent with previous studies of life satisfaction that reported high convergent validity of the SWLS with other measures of life satisfaction including the life satisfaction index (Pavot, Diener, Colvin, & Sandvik, 1991; Dolan & White, 2007). In addition to life satisfaction, volunteer work and helping activities were found to be significant. Individuals who indicated better well-being had a higher probability of participating in volunteer work (Thoits & Hewitt, 2001), and well-being was not only higher among individuals who volunteer, but the trait increased with increasing hours of volunteer work (Morrow-Howell et al., 2003). Although helping others could be applied to volunteer work, it is important to note the impact of providing for others. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

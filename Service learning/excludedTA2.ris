AB  - Purpose: To describe some of the benefits of service learning (SL), considerations in course development and construction, and implementation and outcomes of an SL course in the undergraduate communication sciences and disorders (CSD) program at a small, public university in northwest Washington. Method: A review of the literature on SL and a description of the author's experience in course development are provided on the basis of a computerized database search, library search, and discussions with the Western Washington University Center for Service Learning. Conclusions: Teaching an SL course can present challenges to both faculty and students; nonetheless, incorporating SL into the undergraduate CSD curriculum is an excellent way of enriching the academic experience and improving critical-thinking skills of young students. SL provides hands-on opportunities for students to apply what they are learning in their CSD classes to real-world contexts, gain a better understanding of course content through engagement in real situations, and integrate information from a variety of courses in and outside of their major.

AB  - This article describes and presents the communal story of three lecturers involved in the genesis and development of a multi-tiered service and support system instituted by the Faculty of Education in Johannesburg in conjunction with eight partner schools and a community organisation. The multi-tiered system comprises of pre-service teacher education students, B Ed (Hons) school counselors and M Ed Educational Psychology students. We describe the genesis of the system by first providing a contextual overview against the backdrop of a framework of social justice and care in the Faculty of Education and argue that as an academic enterprise the community engagement initiative contributes to a greater integration of theory and practice. We also posit that this integration, partly based on Bernstein's notion of an integrated curriculum, which is framed in a particular manner leads to curriculum innovation in all the modules and also includes a revision of roles and power relationships generally assigned to lectures and students in a higher education context. Such an integrated curriculum brings enriching and rewarding experiences as well as numerous challenges. We acknowledge the role of institutional support in this process but conclude that by working collaboratively with students and community members in critically reflecting on the challenges and ways of addressing them, we are encouraged to envisage new pathways for bridging the distance between the `academic world' and the `world of the people'. In this way we attempt to address both structural and discursive aspects of curriculum development and in the process generate a new discourse of engagement (Palmer, Cooper & Bresler, 2001:160).

AB  - This article addresses the issue of the theory-practice divide in pre-service teacher education from the viewpoint of design-based research (DBR). Using the example of a course in service learning (SL), the authors discuss their reflection on a curriculum that failed to help the students convert declarative knowledge to procedures of pedagogy, or to internalise this knowledge to become part of their disposition as teachers. The students' theoretical work had remained in an epistemological apartheid zone where it did not meet with practice in either- procedural, conditional-, or reflective knowledge-making. The authors then explore part of a curriculum revision model as proposed by Ruthven et al. (2009) who use DBR principles for curriculum refinement, including some of their "intermediary framework" set of tools in a revision that aimed to create an interface for theory and practice.

AB  - The article describes the use of a simulation game in HIV/AIDS education with pre-service teachers in Johannesburg, South Africa. The use of a simulation game, as novel experiential pedagogy, was an attempt to raise awareness about HIV and AIDS and to demonstrate that anyone can be at risk of HIV infection. Using a generic qualitative research design, the data were collected over a three-year period by way of video recordings of the simulation game, recordings of large and small group discussions afterwards, and via questionnaires and written reflections by the education students four weeks afterwards. Content analysis and discourse analysis led to the construction of three main themes. First, we found that the novelty factor of the simulation game for raising HIV/AIDS awareness was confirmed both during the game itself and after a period of time had elapsed. Second, in light of many education students' naivety about the intersection of biological, socio-cultural and economic issues at play in the spread of HIV, the game prompted more reflexivity about the disease and helped to broaden the participants' discussions. Lastly, the data revealed the disjuncture between theory and practice in HIV/AIDS education. We propose that in raising awareness of HIV and AIDS, educators should move towards more engaging and challenging pedagogies that address the learning needs of the `new' generation of university students.

AB  - There is a need within health, physical education, recreation, dance, and sport programs to increase community engagement via experiential learning. The Chase Charlie Races are presented in this article as a model pedagogical strategy to engage community youths and families in a training program and running event to help promote fitness. Key considerations for conducting a community-based initiative are discussed, such as how to assess project needs, overcome financial and operational challenges, and evaluate the program. An analysis of the benefits for the community and the student stakeholders supports the implementation of this type of program. (Contains 2 tables.)

AB  - Using the recommendations in "Turning Points 2000" as a point for comparison, this study examined how middle level instruction was being implemented in over 50 middle schools in 10 states, focusing on the balance between equity and excellence. Middle schools participating in the study were located mainly in suburbs of Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota; Madison and Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Chicago, Illinois; Cleveland, Ohio; Rochester and Syracuse, New York; St. Louis, Missouri; and Tampa, St. Petersburg, and Orlando, Florida. The schools had received excellence awards, were feeder schools for highly rated high schools, or were in districts widely regarded as successful in their state and region. Information on the middle schools was collected through Web site examination and on-site visits with the principal, staff, and students. Among the main findings of the study are that the grades 6-8 structure was the most common, and almost all schools had a 7-hour day for students. Sixty percent of schools used an 8-period day. Longer instructional periods promoted innovative teaching and reduced discipline problems. There was much variety in how schools incorporated the traditional teacher-based advisory program. Schools found ways to build positive connections between adults and students, including extended off-campus retreats and field trips, service learning, and looping. The vast majority of middle schools organized teachers and students into teams. Team effectiveness was related to common planning time for teachers, team stability, and systematic staff development. Tracking was used frequently, especially in mathematics and language arts. The themes of building trust with staff and creating a shared vision were commonly reported by principals. All the schools had some mechanism of including parents in leading the school. (Contains 24 references.) (KB)

AB  - Significant shifts are occurring in higher education pedagogy, research methodology, and community development, ones that value civic engagement and experiential learning as bridges to holistic education and sustainable social change. Engaged scholarship through university-community partnerships can result in providing a well-rounded education for students, a widening of the university's knowledge base, and an empowering investment in community change. Yet, perpetuating unequal power relations and contributing to a deficit-based approach of service can thwart the social change efforts of community-based education. Critically engaging these complex notions, while integrating promising pedagogical practices, is crucial for effective service-learning and community-based research. This paper provides an overview of these topics and the personal and collective challenges and benefits students, faculty, and communities face as a result of campus-community partnerships.

AB  - At the culmination of an 11-year qualitative, cross-sectional study of life events, 48 high-ability high school graduates fitting common stereotypes associated with giftedness completed an open-ended questionnaire, part of which focused on positive life experiences and sources of support. Findings included that intense investment in academics, activities, and service contributed to new perspectives, vision and direction, confidence in competence, social connections, spiritual growth, and additional opportunities. Some experiences were considered life-changing. Participants' language reflected individual accomplishment, a dominant-culture value, but the main themes reflected fulfillment, validation, satisfaction, and, unexpectedly, many values associated with nonmainstream cultural groups. Findings are presented within a core-values framework associated with positive psychology.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to describe the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) undergraduate psychology students were able to articulate while engaging in a career preparation seminar with an embedded service-learning internship. Results from the students’ reflective journals indicated students were able to describe a wide range of KSAs used and gained in their service-learning internship: communication skills, interpersonal skills, and working effectively with diverse populations. Although students were initially apprehensive about the time commitment, ultimately they found it was manageable and worthwhile; they reported enjoying helping others, gaining necessary workplace skills, increasing their knowledge of diversity, and learning more about the value of their psychology degree.

AB  - In this article, we describe a way to encourage students to envision "real utopias" through the Global Village experience at the Heifer Ranch in Arkansas. The Global Village experience introduces participants to issues associated with global hunger, poverty, environmental sustainability, and resource consumption and provides opportunities to experience simulated poverty and resource inequality. Using student journals recorded during the experience and participant observation, we demonstrate how students' learning is enhanced by temporarily living outside their typical comfort zones and closer to the global averages of consumption. We find that the Global Village experience is an effective and unique tool for engaging students in global and transnational issues and for encouraging students to imagine other possible worlds.

AB  - Since its inception nine years ago, CPED members have re-envisioned and implemented a new purpose for the professional practice doctorate in education, or Ed.D. This new purpose is grounded in the goal of preparing doctoral students to serve as scholarly practitioners, those who engage community as stakeholders in the process of improving problems of practice. Forming practitioners to be leaders in their communities under the CPED framework requires faculty who look beyond traditional roles by embEd.D.ing themselves in communities to work alongside practitioners working to transform their communities. Unfortunately, at many institutions, community-engagement is considered counter-normative to the traditional interpretation of research, teaching, and service, though it need not be. This paper will discuss the implications of CPED's community-engagement principle for Ed.D. programs, institutional policies, and academic environments in which community-engaged faculty do their work and the importance of these faculty members in the design of the Education Doctorate.

AB  - This paper reports on the implementation of a model that infuses service-learning into a four-year foundation phase teacher education programme. We argue for an integrated curriculum design utilising specifically the teaching (laboratory) school of the faculty, not only for clinical experience or work-integrated learning, but also for service-learning. In this way, the relation of the teacher education programme to the teaching school and its location within Soweto, an area within Johannesburg, optimises the affordances of learning from and through experience for students. The service-learning activities were designed to inform and draw on students' practical and situational learning (learning in and about context) and address the notions of integrated and applied knowledge in the 'Minimum Requirements for Teacher Education Qualifications' (RSA DHET 2011). We argue in this paper that the incremental inclusion of service-learning over a four-year period and the varied nature of the service-learning projects within the programme extend students' learning from practice, provide opportunities for students to see people outside of formal education as 'experts' who have something to contribute to their education, and maximize the potential civic and academic outcomes for students.

AB  - The paper explores relevant past research on service-learning in Information Systems courses since 2000. One of the conclusions from this is that most of the publications are not founded on specific theoretical models and are mainly about sharing instructor or student experiences. Then several theoretical frameworks from Education and other disciplines and their relevance for service-learning are analyzed. As a result, several directions for future research towards improvement of service-learning in IS education are proposed.

AB  - Sociology has a long history of engagement with social justice issues, and through concepts like the sociological imagination' we equip our students with the ability to think through, and ideally work to change, inequities. This engagement is under threat, however, from recent changes in the higher education sector that have shifted the focus from learning experiences to qualifications. There is little room within accreditation frameworks for social justice as an educational goal. This article will place these discussions of engagement and social justice as key outcomes of a sociology degree within the broader context of the changing higher education sector, and will explore how we teach students to use their sociological imaginations outside of the classroom. We recognise that this is a messy process, involving ambiguous learning spaces, sometimes conflicting institutional versions of engagement' and unforeseen outcomes. Nevertheless, engaged' sociology should encourage students to exercise their sociological imaginations and their own capacity to act as agents of social change.

AB  - This paper examines the introduction of community service learning activities in lower division (200 level) undergraduate Sociology of Social Problems courses. Data from student evaluations & grades are presented for five semesters of this class between 1994-1996 (N = 98), prior to the introduction of service learning activities. Despite generally positive feedback from students & increased enrollments, results suggest that student performance as measured by grades has not significantly changed with the introduction of community service activities. Also student evaluations of the class are somewhat lower. The community service learning option itself is discussed, & examples & descriptions of community service sites are presented. A discussion of implications for future research on community service learning outcomes concludes the paper. 3 Tables, 23 References. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - The purpose of this quantitative research study was to identify if there was a relationship between student or administrator characteristics (Independent variables) and the application of various disciplinary actions (Dependent variables). This study examined student’s gender, race, grade point average, number of credits, and disciplinary dispositions assigned when students violate school procedures. For the purpose of this study, the dispositions were after-school detention, Saturday school, behavior counseling, in-school suspension, alternative placement, out-of-school suspensions, and expulsion. The findings of this quantitative study were consistent with much of the literature. Punitive disciplinary strategies such as out-of-school suspension increase the likelihood of a student dropping out of school. This study suggests that non-punitive disciplinary actions can work to reduce negative student behavior. However, the number of behavior infractions committed by female students was disturbing. Therefore, recommendations from this study include professional development to address issues of negative female behaviors. Similarly, another unanticipated finding pertains to the issue of violence. According to the study, the likelihood for being referred for committing an infraction of violence increases by 70% with each office referral.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between manifestations of racism in medical school and subsequent changes in graduating medical students' intentions to practice in underserved or minority communities, compared with their attitudes and intentions at matriculation. Method The authors used repeated-measures data from a longitudinal study of 3,756 students at 49 U.S. medical schools that were collected from 2010 to 2014. They conducted generalized linear mixed models to estimate whether manifestations of racism in school curricula/policies, school culture/climate, or student attitudes/behaviors predicted first- to fourth-year changes in students' intentions to practice in underserved communities or primarily with minority populations. Analyses were stratified by students' practice intentions (no/undecided/yes) at matriculation. Results Students' more negative explicit racial attitudes were associated with decreased intention to practice with underserved or minority populations at graduation. Service learning experiences and a curriculum focused on improving minority health were associated with increased intention to practice in underserved communities. A curriculum focused on minority health/disparities, students' perceived skill at developing relationships with minority patients, the proportion of minority students at the school, and the perception of a tense interracial environment were all associated with increased intention to care for minority patients. Conclusions This study provides evidence that racism manifested at multiple levels in medical schools was associated with graduating students' decisions to provide care in high-need communities. Strategies to identify and eliminate structural racism and its manifestations in medical school are needed.

AB  - This study compared perceptions of personal and leadership life skills development of high school 4-H leadership activity participants by whether they participated in the 4-H Junior Leader Club (JLC) and/or the CHARACTER COUNTS! (CC) peer teaching program. The target population was all high school students who participated in either the CC or JLC program when both programs were available. Participants were typically 15 years old, female, white, lived in towns with a population under 10,000 and received mostly A's and B's in high school. Participants perceive they have high life skills in all areas measured by the Leadership and Personal Development Inventory (LPDI). No difference exists in perceived personal and leadership life skills development among students who participated in the CC or JLC programs, or in both. Relationships do exist between personal and leadership life skills development constructs and certain personal characteristics of the students who participated in selected 4-H leadership development activities. Future research should consider using the researcher's reconfigured scales from the LPDI to study 4-H participants involved in more structured 4-H experiences. (Contains 3 tables and 1 figure.)

AB  - The present study addresses the efficacy of using service-learning methods to meet the GAISE guidelines (http://www.amstat.org/education/gaise/GAISECollege.htm) in a second business statistics course and further explores potential advantages of assigning a service-learning (SL) project as compared to the traditional statistics project assignment. Second semester business students were given the choice of participating in a SL project or doing a traditional project assignment. When the projects were completed, students reflected on their experiences via survey. Both groups responded equally (agree or strongly agree) to the Likert scale questions: 96.15% reinforced learning objectives, 98.08% applied to real world, 84.62% positive experience. Responses to the open ended questions revealed that more students in the SL group (p = 0.019) wrote about the benefits of dealing with real world data, more SL students felt their work benefited others (65% felt their statistical expertise was valuable) and more (p = 0.005) SL students felt that the experience will help them in future classes. These results suggest that while both groups were able to effectively support the GAISE guidelines, participation in the SL option offered an enhanced learning experience that included elements of social responsibility and personal growth. The experience was perceived more enjoyable and relevant to the real world adding elements of student empowerment while assisting a local agency in need of statistical expertise suggesting one can reap positive learning benefits by introducing service-learning pedagogy into a non-majors statistics course.

AB  - For the past two decades, service learning has gained attention and increased implementation as a mode of experiential education in primary, secondary, and postsecondary environments. The 1980s saw the creation of Campus Outreach Opportunity League (1984) and Campus Compact (1985), both of which promoted civic engagement and learning through service in higher education. The National and Community Service Act of 1990 provided, among other authorizations, grants to public schools to support service learning, and the National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993 established the Corporation for National and Community Service, which encourages service activities through its three major programs: Senior Corps, AmeriCorps, and Learn and Serve America. These pieces of national legislation, plus independent institutional- and community-based initiatives, have together ensured the growing utilization of service learning at all educational levels. Sometimes referenced as a synonym for generic volunteer and practical experiences, service learning is actually an intentional, structured tool for social change rooted in a 'philosophy of reciprocity, which implies a conceited effort to move from charity to justice' (Jacoby and Associates 1996). Service learning not only enhances students' knowledge in a particular discipline but also requires that they apply that knowledge to the practice of addressing social problems in collaboration with community partners who define and direct the community-based service-learning experience. Students also engage in structured reflection on the connections between theory and practice, thereby increasing their critical-thinking skills. This chapter looks at the historical background of service learning and its connection to the higher education civic engagement movement, as well as the current literature in the field. The chapter has sections that examine: Service learning and the higher education civic engagement movement; Service learning, civic engagement, and social work education; Service learning for social change and social justice; and Promoting service learning in social work education.

AB  - The growing interest in service learning in higher education is connected to the idea that it helps students achieve course objectives and develop a sense of civic responsibility. Thus, it ties into broader goals within the institution of engagement of students and outreach to communities. This research examines students' perceptions of service learning as a means to achieve the course objectives and facilitate a sense of civic responsibility. Research has shown that generally integrating service learning contributes to increased learning benefits compared to those courses that do not have integrated service learning. Reflection plays a key role in enhancing student learning. This leads to more meaningful learning experiences that can be more readily applied in a variety of settings and to real-world problems. Service learning also promotes a greater sense of connection to the communities in which our students live. The resulting data provided information on how service learning impacts students' perceptions of achievement of course objectives, civic responsibility, and the impact of reflection on learning outcomes. The study has implications for faculty in higher education who are interested in integrating service learning within their courses or disciplines. Recommendations are suggested based upon the results of this study. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

AB  - The article discusses online learning and service-learning. The benefits to students engaged in service activities to create a richer and more important connection to course material have been documented and used in higher education. Before implementing service-learning in online classes there are some helpful tips such as selecting the appropriate course, establishing clear expectations, and responding to questions and concerns quickly from both students and community partners.

AB  - The higher education service-learning literature is rich with case studies, guidelines for service-learning course and program development, and demonstrations of the impact of service-learning on students. Minimal discussion, however, focuses on the "strategic placement" of service-learning in disciplinary curricula, and how curricular placement might support and enhance student learning and developmental outcomes. This study offers a summary of curricular placement themes from the service-learning literature and reviews findings from a survey of two national service-learning electronic mailing lists about intentional decision making related to departmental curricular placement of service-learning. Both the literature review and survey data support the need for a curricular placement research agenda, particularly tied to promotion of student learning and developmental outcomes.

AB  - This chapter addresses how psychology educators can partner with agencies in their communities to provide a research project that is not only an educational experience for their students, but also a valuable service to the agencies. It also addresses student satisfaction with service learning in research design and statistics courses by describing the methods and results of a preliminary student satisfaction survey. The service learning project gave students the opportunity to conduct an actual evaluation of a program to assist an under-resourced program in their community. After the course ended, students received an email requesting their voluntary completion of a survey to assess their satisfaction of the Service Learning component in Program Evaluation. Students indicated a high level of satisfaction with the Service Learning component in Program Evaluation on close-ended questions. Although both qualitative and quantitative responses to this experience were overwhelmingly positive, there are some suggestions for future instructors who may wish to incorporate a service learning component into their Program Evaluation courses. Future research should look beyond satisfaction to see if students who have the service learning experience learn more about Program Evaluation than those who do not.

AB  - Background and Purpose. Service learning (SL), a well-established curricular component in many health professions programs, such as dentistry, medicine, and nursing, is now becoming recognized as an effective pedagogical method in physical therapy. However, there is little known about physical therapist student perceptions of and attitudes toward SL, and there is even less information describing the perceptions and attitudes of the community organizations and partners with whom they work.Subjects. Seventy-five physical therapist students and 24 local community-partner organizations participated in this study.Methods. Pencil and paper surveys were administered to assess the impact of SL experiences threaded into the curriculum of a professional physical therapist education program.Results. Both the physical therapist students (100% response rate) and community partners (80% response rate) overv,helmin ly indicated that their experiences ere positive, that they valued the partnerships, and that they benefited from service learning.Discussion and Conclusion. The fact that both groups perceived benefits from SL experiences provides additional support to the value of SL as a pedagogical method in physical therapist education. Future research should include evaluation of post-graduate and alumni surveys to observe lasting effects of community service expertences on physical therapist practice.

AB  - The school where Chris Piccone teaches eighth-grade English maintains a desire to pull its community from its comfort zones to experience first hand the crushing poverty in the Dominican Republic. Although he always thought of himself as a bleeding heart, who was proud that he pushed his students out of their academic comfort zones, he realized that he wasn't ready to accept that himself. He gradually realized that, in order to continue engaging students, he also needed to be pushed into such new territory as the Dominican Republic. This article describes the Berkeley Preparatory School's mission service trip, and the author's life-changing experiences on the journey. Piccone writes about ways that this trip gradually wore away at his reluctance to face poverty and suffering head on, how he, his students, and colleagues, learned to acknowledge its existence, and how they recognized a shared responsibility for addressing poverty on a personal level.

AB  - For service-learning proponents, the emphasis on assessment presents special challenges: definitions vary widely; credible testing is in its infancy; and tracking causal effects on academics is difficult, intrusive, and expensive. Political will may diminish if schools are forced to choose between school service programs and high test scores. (MLH)

AB  - This brief addresses how to engage and mobilize young people in order to prepare them for when disaster strikes. Perhaps more importantly, this brief seeks to do so in sustainable ways to avoid desensitizing youth to the effects of disaster, and prevent wavering attention. There are two ways to serve students--help them when disaster strikes their community, and empower them to help others in need. The purpose of this brief is to emphasize the latter: involve and prepare students for civic engagement as a means to prepare for and respond to disasters, if or when disaster strikes. A brief list of related Internet resources is also included. (Contains 6 endnotes.)

AB  - Using a hybrid portraiture interpretivist case study methodology, this study explores the development of democratic educational values of pre-service teachers who participated in a “nested” service-learning practicum during their first semester in a secondary teacher preparation program. In this nested model, both the pre-service teachers and the middle school students with whom they worked participated in service-learning. The study is in response to the findings of previous researchers that democratic educational values have, in many classrooms, been pushed aside by the pressures of the standardization and accountability movement and by the belief that democratic educational values are critical to a public educational system which supports civic identity and participation. Data collected over the course of one semester included reflective journals, blog postings, observations of the service-learning seminar, observations of teaching practices in the field, and audio-recorded semi-structured interviews. Four participants were interviewed three times each, and all four participants were observed both in the service-learning seminar and in their field placements. While this study did not find that participation in a nested service-learning model led to pre-service teachers becoming active agents of change, it did find that the nested service-learning experience helped the pre-service teachers to begin to lay a solid foundation in their understanding of basic democratic educational values, in their plans to embrace democratic educational values in their future classrooms, and in their view of themselves as democratic educators.

AB  - Background: An interprofessional service-learning experience, using the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Point-in-Time ( PIT) count of unsheltered homeless, was used as the basis of exposing nursing and public health students to those facing homelessness and housing insecurity in their community. Method: Learning experiences included pre-and post-PIT count training, PIT count participation, debriefings, online and in-class reflections, and discussion of poverty-related readings. Students unable to participate in the actual count presented nutrition education programs in congregate meal sites. Results: Participation in the PIT count received positive student feedback and reflected development of knowledge and empathy of those experiencing homelessness and housing and food insecurity. Conclusion: Health professional programs can use the PIT count to expose students to individuals living in poverty, as well as provide meaningful curricular opportunities to foster a culturally competent and empathetic health services work force.

AB  - This chapter concerns itself with the integration of policy and practice in the professional training of Master's level social workers.

AB  - This case study explored the potential for using a synchronous online piano teaching internship as a service-learning project for graduate pedagogy interns. In partnership with the university, a local music retailer, and a local middle school, three pedagogy interns taught beginning piano to underprivileged teenaged students for 8 weeks. All instruction took place in the synchronous online environment using acoustic Disklavier pianos, Internet MIDI, Facetime, and traditional method books. As a result of the experience, the students demonstrated musical understanding and the pedagogy interns developed teaching techniques, displayed improved comprehension of course content, learned about current distance teaching technology, and considered the role of music education in society. Based on these results, it might be feasible to provide piano lessons to underserved populations in remote locations while offering meaningful internship experiences to pedagogy students through distance service-learning projects.

AB  - This article explores the particular challenges and possibilities of service learning pedagogy for basic writers. Because a number of scholars of service learning and basic writing (Adler-Kassner, Arca, and Kraemer) are concerned primarily with developing underprepared students' academic literacies, I investigated how the students in a service learning basic writing class situated their service experience--represented that "text" rhetorically--in their major academic research essay for the course. The article draws on one student's experience of making connections among the "rich mix" of course texts, including personal experience, as a best case. From this example, I argue for strategies of service learning pedagogy that could better help basic writers achieve their goals for academic writing. (Contains 3 notes.)

AB  - <bold>Background: </bold>In hospital settings, delirium affects as many as 50% of older patients, aggravating their symptoms and worsening their condition, and therefore increasing the risk of in-hospital complications and death. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of structured, non-pharmacological care, delivered to older hospitalised patients by trained volunteers (students of medical fields), on the reduction of incidence of adverse health-related outcomes.<bold>Methods/design: </bold>This trial will be a randomised, investigator-blind, controlled trial conducted in an internal medicine and geriatric ward in Poland. We aim to include 416 patients who are 70 years of age and have been hospitalised for medical reasons. Eligible patients will be randomised 1:1 to receive structured, non-pharmacological care delivered by students of medicine, psychology and nursing, together with standard medical treatment or standard medical care alone. The protocol of interventions has been designed to cover nine main risk factors for delirium, with the scope of multidisciplinary interventions being individualised and tailored. The protocol will be aimed at immobilisation, vision and hearing impairment, cognitive impairment and disorientation, stress and anxiety, sleep-wake cycle disturbances, dehydration and malnutrition, and pain. A structured evaluation of patients' cognition, mood, anxiety and functional performance is planned to be carried out twice, on the day of group allocation and at discharge; structured screening assessment for delirium will be conducted daily using the Confusion Assessment Method. The primary outcome will be the incidence of delirium in hospital; secondary outcomes will be in-hospital changes in cognition, mood and anxiety, and functional status, occurrence of falls and death.<bold>Discussion: </bold>Delirium prevention programmes are being introduced worldwide. A particular novelty of our project, however, is that invitations for voluntary work with older patients at risk for delirium will be addressed to medical students. With the use of the service learning method, the students will shape their attitudes, increase their knowledge and understanding of hospital care, and master competencies to work within interdisciplinary teams, which establishes the originality and practicality of the project.<bold>Trial Registration: </bold>Polish Science Database, 317484 .

AB  - Pharmacy schools are adopting service-learning to foster communication and interaction skills, social responsibility, and a philosophy of caring. This study describes the extent students believed two required service-teaming programs met these objectives. Students in the first year (P1) of a four year doctor of pharmacy program spent 24 hours per term at community service agencies and second year students (P2) attended clinics for the medically underserved for four hours per term. Most of the students (93.4 percent) completed the Service Experience Questionnaire, an internally consistent instrument consisting of forty-nine closed-ended items, after their experience. A majority of Fl's (64.0 percent) and P2's (86.0 percent) felt that the experience was educational. These experiences enhanced their respect for the individual, awareness of others in need, confidence in interacting with others and provided them with an opportunity to improve their communication skills. These results support the utility of an experiential learning pedagogy to meet the AACP's educational objectives.

AB  - Experiential programs are thought to increase student learning in a variety of educational settings. Service-learning is a growing trend in study abroad yet it remains an option that is not yet widely acknowledged nor well understood. Designed to be a transforming experience, documenting the ways in which students undergo change from an international service-learning experience helps to identify best practices in program design and implementation and lends credibility to service-learning as a worthwhile study abroad option. This case study analyzed students participating in the International Partnership for Service-Learning and Leadership (IPSL) program in Quito, Ecuador during the fall 2006 semester. The study focused on students' transformation, including their motivations, goals, and outcomes. The effect of the variables of student gender and type of service site on the service-learning experience, as well as the impact of key people in the service-learning program, were also examined. A variety of qualitative techniques were employed: a series of student questionnaires; observations in the community agencies and the required service-learning course; interviews with agency staff and the service-learning course instructor; and document analysis of student journals, IPSL website and pre-departure materials, on-site orientation information, the service-learning course syllabus, and agency literature. The results indicate the overall impact of participating in an international service-learning program is tremendously positive and allows students to expand upon their motivations and goals and achieve profound benefits in the areas of cultural adaptation, knowledge acquisition, and impact on their values and future career plans. While the findings revealed some evidence of gender and service placement type differences, they were not frequent or substantial enough to make any claims regarding their effect on the student experience in international service-learning programs in general. Although difficult to quantify, those who had a role in the IPSL Quito program impacted the student outcomes resulting from the international service-learning experience to some degree, however marginal. While much can be gained through participation in education abroad, this study demonstrates that the inclusion of a service element allows students to experience their learning in a more in-depth and meaningful way.

AB  - The literature on integration of academic and vocational education was reviewed to identify strategies for school districts planning to integrate their academic and vocational programs. Among the topics examined were the following: reasons for integrating academic and vocational education; meaning of curriculum integration; essential components of integrated programs; forms and examples of curriculum integration; effectiveness of various curriculum integration efforts; and policy questions entailed in integrating academic and vocational programs. After the literature review had been completed, an instructional guidance system was proposed as a starting point for school divisions planning to integrate academic and vocational education. The proposal called for the following: curriculum of integrated academic and vocational education that is organized around academic and technical skills and personal qualities and delivered through situated learning; interdisciplinary approach in both academic and vocational classrooms; collaboration between vocational and academic teachers to devise thematic units/projects/assessments; curriculum situated in both school- and work-based learning environments; and appropriate connecting activities, including career counseling and service learning, to link both environments.

AB  - This paper explains Dr Jason Cope's work on entrepreneurial learning, and illustrates his approach and how it can be applied to deepen understanding of, and practice in, entrepreneurship education. It begins with a biography of Cope, which summarizes his academic life and offers a timeline for his publications. This paper then explores his philosophical position, before dividing his research into three main phases. In the first, it examines and explains his early work into experiential learning; reflective learning; learning from crises and the role social influences play in entrepreneurial learning. In the second, developments stemming from his PhD are explored. Here, ideas in relation to entrepreneurial learning and the links he makes to transformative learning and double-loop learning are discussed. Finally, in the third part, Cope's entrepreneurial learning framework is explained and key contributing concepts are introduced. This part examines how Cope's theoretical framework was used to undertake research and subsequently to explain how entrepreneurs learn from failure. In the final sections of this paper, the practical implications of his contribution to entrepreneurship education are presented, in the contexts both of higher education and of the development of students, and then for entrepreneurs themselves.

AB  - Service learning links community service and volunteerism with academic learning. It is a collaborative effort that brings schools, community-based organizations, parents, and other community members together in a common enterprise of individual and community growth. Service learning is based on a number of existing links between schools and communities and can be traced to at least three sources: John Dewey, experiential learning, and citizenship education. Three concepts are important to enriching the relationship between curriculum and service. First, an organization's commitment to service learning is essential to linking service to the curriculum. Second, service learning is different at each level of education. Third, there must be a continuum of curriculum and service integration. The most effective service learning coordinators are flexible facilitators of change. They work to make service learning a core value in their organization, provide meaningful training for adult participants, create a service learning communication network, support teachers, and create an environment where students are equal partners. Effective collaborations have the following characteristics: strike a balance between partners, are ongoing, prepare participants for service, provide for clear and frequent communication, are supported by a strong advisory board, and focus on sharing. Service learning displays adaptability, durability, and flexibility. It can be recommended as a model of school change and teacher training. (YLB)

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to discuss an innovative assignment, The Occupational Outline and Disability Status Report, and to describe how a community-academic partnership was formed. Community-academic collaborations provide students with the opportunity to observe children in natural environments. This partnership facilitates the development of clinical reasoning skills necessary for pediatric practice in community settings. Through observation of ordinary childhood occupations at a children's museum and a written assignment, students identify the significance of play and social participation while hypothesizing about the influence of impairments on performance.

AB  - In this case study design I explore the Student Success Teachers (SSTs) perspectives on the impact of a service-learning program, LEAD program has on their students, teacher candidates and themselves in their role. LEAD is presented as a proactive approach for 21st century learning as it promotes resiliency skills for our in-risk youth. I identify the challenges and benefits it presents to the SSTs, teacher candidates, and in-risk students within the two local school boards. Both former and current SSTs were interviewed on their experiences with implementing the LEAD program as part of their student success initiatives within their school. Data was collected and analyzed both through pencil and paper and audio recordings. The results of this study indicated 4 main themes that were present amongst all interviews. The themes were: communication, selection process, group dynamics, and assessment and evaluation.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the role of ethics and service learning client work in public relations education. Interviews were conducted with students at three universities who had completed public relations client work. Findings suggest that ethics in client work involves honesty, respect, following personal convictions, bracketing personal values, and balancing ethical values. Students perceived that client work prepared them to be accountable, perform quality work, rely on mentoring, and learn that being ethical takes practice. Ultimately, client work appears to help students explore ethical beliefs and competencies in a realistic environment with assistance.

AB  - This article describes the process by which the author became a gerontologist through the metaphorical use of parades. The narrative suggests that a similar experience can be provided to students by helping them notice the parade of elders in their lives, enter the parade they see, recognize the sociohistorical context of the parade, make meaning of their observations and commit to the welfare of elders. The narrative account of the shift from gerontological social worker to professor of gerontological social work proposes suggested ways in which students can be exposed to the field of gerontology in ways that will encourage them to consider entering this field. The patchwork nature of author's path to gerontology contained snapshots of lives well lived, gifts of insight from those he served and challenges born of the mistakes he made. Each of these pieces, experienced individually in time, brought partial understanding to his eyes and heart and provided individual clues to follow. Teaching every single gerontology course with a service learning format that involves his students with elders in a meaningful, personal and up-close manner has allowed him to see older people through their fresh eyes.

AB  - This article presents a model that is based on Eyler and Giles' Five Elements of Citizenship, where students learn about Volunteer UCF through marketing strategies, participate in one-time service or educational events, and then pursue continuous involvement based on their positive experiences. Students transition to leadership roles by serving on a social topic committee and move up to social topic director managing their own committee. Some students aspire to be an administrative student leader and incorporate large-scale institutional projects and events. The final stage for students is committing to lifelong community engagement opportunities post-graduation. The results will inform where the touch points are at the higher education institution, so administrators can apprise bureaucracy and cultural barriers to help students progress through the scale for service within the continuum.

AB  - This study examined English teenagers' community involvement. Participants were all 14-16-year-old students in 3 large public schools (rural, urban, and suburban), none of which had service learning as part of the curriculum. Over 1,000 students completed questionnaires that examined regular and one-time involvement in community service activities over the past year; views on volunteering and campaigning; and ways the students became involved or reasons they did not become involved. The questionnaires also asked about the students' involvement in religious and youth organizations and their views on traditional political parties. Researchers conducted 100 individual interviews with students to investigate these issues in-depth. The interviews included both volunteering and non-volunteering students. The results of the study were as follows: most students had given money or time to a charitable cause at least once; students were involved in a range of activities; only 13.5 percent were members of a group campaigning for something; there was a low level of commitment to involvement in formal politics; about 12 percent were involved in regular, long-term voluntary activities, and all 12 percent cited positive outcomes from their activities. The most common factor among involved students was having a family member or friend already involved in some kind of activity. Religious beliefs and membership in organized youth groups were also important factors. (SM)

To implement academically, defensible service learning requires faculty endorsement, consideration of course credit, an enthusiastic champion able to negotiate agreements with organizations, organizations' identification of their own projects so they are willing to both fund and supervise them, curricular underpinning that imparts the project skills necessary for success, embedding at a time when students' clinical identity is being formed, small packets of curriculum elements delivered "just in time" as students engage with their project, flexible online platform/s, assessment that is organically related to the project, providing cross cultural up-skilling, and focused on the students' responsibility for their own product. The result is a learning experience that is engaging for medical students, links the university to the community, and encourages altruism which is otherwise reported to decline through medical school.

AB  - The Duke TIP Leadership Institute was developed specifically for a 2-week summer experience; however, the model can be applied to today's high school classroom. Through a combination of fundamental leadership skills and guided service learning, students identify important unmet needs within their community and begin working to address them. This authentic learning experience aids students in personal development and fulfills curricular objectives by connecting the school and the greater community.

AB  - Objective. To integrate pharmacy education into a diabetes and hypertension screening program to improve pharmacy student disease knowledge and screening skills and provide a valuable service to the community. Methods. One hundred eighty third-year PharmD students were trained and subsequently screened people aged >= 35 years in 2 Thai communities. Those with high risk factors were encouraged to see a pharmacist or nurse for further evaluation and referral to a physician for diagnosis. Results. After training, the third-year students showed significantly higher knowledge scores on diabetes and hypertension than a control group of second-year students (p<0.05). More than 80% of the third-year students were rated by pharmacist observers as having good community screening skills. More than 95% of community participants were satisfied or very satisfied with the screening session. The active screening program improved the screening coverage in the targeted communities from 41 people/month under the passive screening program to 127 people/month and improved the coverage rate over a 6-month period from 24% to 73%. Conclusion. This active screening project by pharmacy students enhanced the health knowledge and awareness of members of the targeted communities and increased pharmacy students' knowledge of and ability to screen for hypertension and diabetes.

AB  - Global health education and health promotion have the potential to engage students, scholars, and practitioners in ways that go beyond the classroom teaching routine. This engagement in global communities, can range from reflection on continuing deep-seated questions about human rights and civic responsibility to the use of health education and promotion–related theoretical, intellectual, and practical skills. In the arena of global health education and promotion, these skills also range from leadership and advocacy to decision making, critical and creative thinking, teamwork, and problem solving. In recent times, there has been a growing interest in cross-cultural collaborations and educational initiatives to improve stakeholder’s understanding of global health principles and practices, to enrich the experiences of health professionals, and to improve the lives of those who are disenfranchised and live across borders. In this article of Health Promotion Practice, we highlight two unique cases of cross-national collaborations and provide a glimpse of the various shapes and forms taken by cross-cultural educational initiatives for global health education and promotion. We summarize the history, philosophy, and current working practices relevant to these collaborations, keeping in view the global health domains, competencies, and activities. In addition, we also compare the key components and activities of these two case studies from Rwanda and Mexico, wherein communities in these two countries collaborated with academic institutions and health professionals in the United States.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the concept of a whole-person approach to educating for sustainability (EfS), with a focus on persons' identity, motivation and higher order dispositions. To propose that approach as an alternative to the prevalent focus on specific capabilities and competencies in higher education for sustainability. The paper brings to bear psychological research on the development of critical moral consciousness, research on dispositions for learning in higher education, and field research on spiritually inspired service-learning. Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, critical analysis is undertaken on the discourses that represent two fields of study in order to explore the application of the theory of the ontogenesis of ``critical moral consciousness{''}. The model is applied to two discrete areas to consider implications for higher education field research on grass-root Baha'i-inspired service-learning and EfS, and students involved in design education. Findings - The findings suggest that a whole-person approach to EIS may yield more fruitful societal and personal benefits than traditional, and predominantly, behavioural approaches. Research limitations/implications - The paper only refers to two case studies. One case study is of a faith based organisation used to represent a whole-person approach to EfS in a social context. It could be that the findings of this case are influenced by perceptions of religious activity (for both authors and readers). The second case study is of a particulate discipline area design. Whilst the findings represent learners in the design context, it may be that learners in different contexts have different (or similar) results. Originality/value - Sustainability has now become a common orientation for learning. The paper contributes conceptual understanding of the types of dispositions higher education needs to foster, as well as congruent pedagogies, in order to nurture human motivations necessary to advance sustainability. In particular, there is a need for EfS to focus on the cultivation of critical moral consciousness and higher order dispositions as a specific orientation towards studies, work, and social interactions.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to report the findings of a study, conducted among Wilderness Education Association Affiliates, aimed at understanding the service-learning options provided. Several definitions and viewpoints regarding service-learning can be found throughout the literature; only a few are presented to introduce the topic. E-mails were sent in early 2005 to 57 WEA affiliates inviting them to participate in an on-line survey about the service-learning options they made available to students. Four invitations were returned due to undeliverable addresses. Several WEA affiliates offer their students options for service learning. With perceived benefits of enhancing the educational experience, developing environmental ethics, creating a sense of place, and complementing the WEA curriculum, it appears that service-learning has a place within outdoor/leadership/resource management and/or WEA programs.

AB  - Civic education, not so long ago, was regarded as a core purpose of grade school preparation for adulthood, a mandate to educate young people about U.S. history, freedom and values, and citizenship's responsibilities. The landmark 1999 Civic Education Study, conducted by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement, found the mean scores of U.S. 14-year-olds significantly higher than the international means of 28 other countries. This issue of "Basic Education" begins by looking overseas to the Czech Republic in the article "Civic Education in the Czech Republic: Citizenship after the Fall of Communism" (Ondrej Hausenblas) that recounts the challenges facing citizenship education in a post-communist society. The article, "A North Carolina Partnership Shares Lessons Learned about Civic Education" (Debra Henzey), brings readers to North Carolina, where a statewide collaborative works with public schools and community organizations to support civic education. The article "Service Learning: A Promising Practice" (La Verna Fountain) explores how students may acquire a new sense of civic responsibility and experience their capacity to shape public policy. The article "What's in a Name: Law Related and Civic Education" (Annette Boyd Pitts) examines how classroom exercises such as the case study and debate bring to life legal processes, principles of law, rights, and responsibilities.

AB  - This article explores how 12 classroom teachers, enrolled in one of the author's graduate social studies methods course, used service-learning as an instructional tool to help students practice active participation in their community and beyond, while also recognizing the relevance of academic coursework as they applied their knowledge and skills to meaningful issues and contexts beyond the four walls of the classroom. This study is separated into two distinct, but related phases. Phase 1 includes data collected from the twelve teachers. First, the authors present the methodology, findings, and conclusions for phase 1 in a sequential manner. Next, the data for phase 2 is presented, which emerged from one of the graduate student's projects discussed in phase 1. Phase 2 includes data collected from the classroom teacher's 4th and 5th grade students and uses narrative inquiry to tell the story of how the project developed and the impact it had on the students. The teachers involved in the service-learning projects evolved through reflecting on the process of implementation. Based on the findings, the authors conclude that the teachers in this study gained the skills to: (1) effectively integrate civics-centered curriculum and meet state content standards through service-learning projects; (2) facilitate student-led instruction in a democratic classroom; (3) increase effective communication and build partnerships beyond the classroom; and (4) use structured reflections as a tool for growth and evaluation. Based on reactions from their respective students, the teachers were encouraged by student leadership, collaboration, motivation, engagement and meaningful learning experiences. All 12 teachers in this study reported improved teacher dispositions and increased confidence regarding the implementation of a civics-centered curriculum. Findings from the second phase of the study suggest that projects that are situated in a real-world context focusing on community needs and student interest can impact students' level of involvement and sense of agency. Service-learning projects may have a catalytic ability to motivate students into using active democratic skills to better their surrounding community. (Contains 1 note.)

AB  - This case study examines the sustaining factors of a fully implemented and nationally recognized high school service-learning program. More specifically, it investigates why Community Service Learning has sustained itself for nine years at a New England high school recognized as a National Service-Learning Leader School by the Corporation for National Service. The study describes the process of adoption, design, implementation, and paths to institutionalization. It also considers the organizational conditions that promoted institutionalization at this site. The research approach was primarily qualitative. The study exposes the broad narrative of the case from the perspective of four data sources: observations, documents and artifacts, interviews and a faculty survey. Key actors and supports as well as obstacles and coping processes are noted in the findings. Recommendations gleaned from the study are directed at sustaining comprehensive service-learning programs that provide a framework of meaning and higher purpose to academic work. The findings indicate that Community Service Learning at this site was institutionalized more as a learning process or pedagogy than a separate educational or adjunct program. Its design was wide in focus and application, thus allowing for educational diversity and autonomy in a wide range of users. A combination of high user assistance, administrative pressure and commitment, as well as high system level support were instrumental factors that influenced institutionalization. A theme that ran through the findings was that program leadership was adept at using multiple organizational approaches to implement and sustain this innovation. A focus on service, understood as promoting community development, was found to be the critical element that enabled overall implementation and enhanced sustainability. Recommendations are presented for future studies involving fundamental issues of quality and community impacts in fully implemented programs.

AB  - Engaging students in the surrounding community is often the goal of nursing classes, especially those that focus on community. Although ethics may be one of the most important subjects in nursing education, teaching it is challenging. An exemplar is used to discuss how a service learning assignment was used to demonstrate and evaluate students' understanding of the ethical principle of beneficence. A properly designed service learning assignment provided students the opportunity to practice nursing as a caring art with each of Johnson's five distinctive practices. It gives them the occasion to do the right thing.

AB  - The contributors in this volume will enrich the academic literature on critical service-learning in several important ways. First, several contributors will document the work of critical scholar-practitioners who have implemented critical service-learning projects in international contexts. Second, several contributors will highlight the transformative work implemented by schoolteachers in K-16. Third, the contributors will provide a critical analysis of how the larger power structures have generated specific social problems within the contexts of their given learning initiatives. Not only is this analysis necessary to help teachers, scholars, administrators, and citizens make sense of the social, political, and historical forces that perpetuate institutional forms of injustice against most global citizens, but it ensures that they recognize what accounts for specific social actors accruing unearned privileges inside and outside of their own lived worlds. Fourth, they will highlight how the neoliberal agenda has impacted life within their learning communities and how they were able to find fissures amid the status quo to implement and sustain their political projects. Finally, they will document how students' newfound understanding of social stratification and oppression led them to become to become agents of change in their schools and in their communities. Students will be portrayed as critical agents who hold the insight to engage in cultural work with their teachers, community groups, and other activists, where they conduct research projects to understand the interworking of their world, advocate for the implementation of policies, practices and initiatives to eliminate injustice, and teach others about what they have learned and why they have become civically engaged citizens. Part I of this volume promotes sustainable learning that is different from traditional service-learning pedagogies or charity work, which swoops in and out without any learning occurring or sustainable change in how students view the nature of social stratification. The chapters here discuss challenging unjust policies and practices and asymmetrical relations of power and define how service is conceptualized among participants in critical service-learning projects. Part II of this volume discusses the visions associated with critical service-learning in teacher education programs and other K-16 settings. None of these suggest a method for doing critical service-learning, which would be too reductive. Instead, each posits its own vision and demonstrates this with examples of critical work.

Public benefits campaigns also provide effective service-learning experiences that enhance student learning and engagement in issues related to the study of poverty, policy, and social justice. Recommendations are offered for effective implementation of such service-learning opportunities with public benefits campaigns. (Contains 1 note.)

Methods:As part of their Rural Track Clerkship (RTC) Program, the University of Missouri School of Medicine developed the Community Integration Program (CIP). Students, individually or in groups, voluntarily identify a health need and implement a community-based project to meet that need. Results:From 2007 to 2013, 80 (53%) students participated in the CIP and 86% completed the 11-item post-experience questionnaire. After the experience, participants reported a deeper understanding of the broad impact of a rural physician and the impact of rural culture on physician interactions. Participants reported they felt more integrated into the community, had a greater understanding of community health needs and resources, and were more likely to participate in future community service activities. Conclusions:The CIP exposes students to rural culture and helps them understand community health needs. Replication of this program can increase student interest in rural medicine and better prepare students for rural practice.

AB  - Despite the potential environmental impact of urban planning, there is little research on Environmental Education (EE) in the context of urban planning curricula. This study follows graduate planning students' learning experience during group projects assigned as part of a planning course at the Technion--Israel Institute of Technology. These participatory projects, characterized as project-based learning and service learning, took place in several communities in Israel. We examined the types of learning impacts the projects engendered by analyzing the reported experiences of the students using parameters from the field of EE. The main goal of this research is to understand the contribution of such practical, hands-on project exercises to the course curriculum for inculcating environmental education themes. Findings indicate that projects helped students acquire and/or improve professional tools. They enhanced motivation to consider environmental concerns in their work and in some cases changed students' personal environmental behavior.

Saoi is a Gaelic term meaning learner, wisdom and scholar. In the mountains of western North Carolina, an area with many Scotch-Irish descendants, this name evoked an appropriate reference to community and history. Mellie and Sally envisioned a program that would encourage students to make academic connections with their community and form social bonds with each other. Working collaboratively with their students, Mellie and Sally crafted an integrated set of experiences that featured team building, community service and inquiry learning.

Student groups of approximately six or seven worked with local agencies to develop a research plan for the agency. Students found the SL project to be a positive experience. The SL outcomes resulted in a greater appreciation of research, including a greater interest in and comfort with conducting research. Results also are compared to a similar SL project in which the entire class, rather than a small group, worked with one agency. The implications are discussed. (Contains 3 tables.)

AB  - Civic engagement among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or questioning (LGBTQ) youth and heterosexual cisgender allies can challenge oppressive systems. Among 295 youth in 33 Gay-Straight Alliances (GSAs; 69% LGBQ, 68% cisgender female, 68% white, M age = 16.07), we examined whether greater GSA involvement was associated with greater general civic engagement, as well as participation in greater LGBTQ-specific advocacy and awareness-raising efforts. Further, we tested whether these associations were partly mediated through members' sense of agency. Greater GSA involvement was associated with greater civic engagement, advocacy, and awareness-raising; associations did not differ based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Finally, the association between GSA involvement and civic engagement was partially mediated through youths' greater sense of agency. Agency did not mediate the association between GSA involvement and engagement in advocacy or awareness-raising efforts. The results suggest GSAs are settings with potential to foster students' capacity to be active and engaged citizens.

AB  - In the fall 2000 semester, an assistant professor and her graduate teaching assistant incorporated a service-learning project into their research methods course in an effort to engage more students in the course. The project allowed the students to apply their newly acquired research methods skills to a "real world" organization serving their immediate community, the university. This paper, which proceeds in four sections, discusses how we incorporated service learning into a research methods course. The first section reviews service learning and research that has examined the effects of service learning on students and their communities. Second, a detailed description of the service-learning project is provided which we implemented in the research methods course during the Fall 2000 semester. The third section of the paper discusses the contribution that the students' work made to the organization they served. Finally, the paper concludes by examining different methods of evaluating Students' learning in a course that uses service learning to meet course objectives.

AB  - To mean something to the world is the deepest hunger of the human soul. Platon My study explored the role of service-learning in the curriculum of high school students with disabilities in a private school setting by looking at the historical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and curricular ramifications of service-learning and its effect on students' development in caring for self and others. I looked at the ways in which giving back to others through service-learning affects a student's quality of life, both in and out of school. Service-learning is one of the pedagogies currently developing in education in general and in curriculum design in particular. But there is limited literature related to the involvement of students with disabilities in service-learning. The few studies that are recorded offer little explanation and insight into the validity and worth of this area of learning in the education of high school students with disabilities, particularly as service-learning relates to altruistic behavior. Qualitative methodologies, particularly narrative inquiry and portraiture, were chosen for this study because they help to understand and interpret the phenomenon. I explored meanings that high school students with disabilities made for themselves as they participated in service-learning. The highlight of this project for me was living with the students for one week as they engaged in their service-learning project. The high school students from this school, through their reflective experiences, shared both the joy and the relevance they found in their service-learning experience. As one learns from the book, Man's Search for Meaning , by Viktor Frankl, when one engages in service or some other-centered activity, one is moved toward wholeness, psychological well-being, and mental health. All of these characteristics are vital to the lives of those that are able-bodied as well as those that are living with disability, and service-learning should be a component of all special education curricula and available to all students, both able-bodied and disabled.

AB  - This article examines the relationship between the service participation of high school students and the growth of their sense of social responsibility. Social responsibility is viewed in this study as the capacity to focus not only on one's own needs and obligations but also on the needs of society as a whole. Components of social responsibility include ethical decision-making and action, a feeling of connection to one's fellow citizens, an awareness of social and political issues, and active involvement in public life. Furthermore, service participation has been associated with positive growth in an adolescent's social relatedness, moral judgment, political awareness, and sense of agency. In general, service may be divided into two broad types. The first and most common type of service involves students in rendering direct help to other individuals. The second type of service involves students changing social and political structures. Although participation in both types of activities may be motivated by similar impulses to be kind, these two types of activities are rooted in different forms of empathy and social consciousness. In conclusion, the benefits of service participation for growth in social responsibility hold true even for those who are not inclined originally in service projects or to be affected by service. Moreover, service participation across two or three years shows a greater influence on thinking about social responsibility than participation in one year only.

AB  - This project sought to investigate the learning that comes about from the intersection of outbound mobility experience programs (OMEs) with service learning in pre-service teacher education settings. The aim of the program of international service learning in the case study was to encourage pre-service teachers to rethink potentially ethnocentric assumptions. The guiding research question was, "What outcomes ensue from the combination of OMEs and service learning for pre-service teachers?" The focus of the paper was on OMEs that took place in China and Malaysia. Findings included that the combined program aided development of global mindedness, learning by being there, teacher experience in a new context and the development of a professional identity in the participating students.

AB  - This study evaluated the cognitive process of students participating in a 20-hour service-learning experience while enrolled in a collegiate Social Problems course. This study examined student attitudes about social problems and their ability to affect change and examined relationships between demographic variables, student attitudes, and their stages of cognitive process. The population was all students who were enrolled in a Social Problems course during the Fall 2005 semester. Of the 77 students enrolled in the course, 48 completed both the pre-test and post-test questionnaire and 64 completed the service-learning journals and papers. The researcher used a mixed method research design. The quantitative study used a pre-test and post-test questionnaire to evaluate changes in attitude towards service learning. The qualitative study evaluated journal entries and papers using the Constant Comparative Method of Qualitative Analysis to assess stages of cognitive development. The major findings of the study were: (1) Students progressed through six stages of cognitive development—Shock, Guilt, Normalization, Cultural Sensitivity, Engagement, and Empowerment, however no student experienced all stages; (2) Three new stages were discovered—Guilt, Cultural Sensitivity, and Empowerment; (3) All students who had not volunteered before experienced Shock; (4) Shock occurred for some students who had previously volunteered; (5) Students experiencing Guilt were primarily White and from families with parental incomes greater than $75,000 a year; (7) A majority of students experienced Empowerment; (8) Most students volunteering more than 10 hours a month experienced Empowerment; (9) All People of Color experienced Empowerment; (10) Results from pre-test and post-test questionnaires did not indicate a significant change in attitudes towards service-learning as a result of participating in the service-learning experience. Educators should: (1) Be prepared to assist students as they experience multiple stages of the cognitive process during their service-learning experiences; (2) Give instruction in reflective journaling, provide students with guided journal questions, and monitor stages of the cognitive process;(3) Incorporate service-learning into curriculum to enhance cognitive learning and empower students; (4) Replicate with a more diverse population and larger sample size.

AB  - Schools of library and information science (LIS) routinely offer their students experiential learning opportunities such as internships or practicums. These courses are viewed as a means of introducing students to the realities of the workplace and of fostering a sense of professional identity and values. Service learning is an increasingly popular and distinct form of experiential learning. This paper selectively reviews literature related to experiential learning and service learning and discusses the unique aspects of each as applied to general LIS education.

AB  - This study aimed to identify factors that influence acts of altruism among gifted female adolescents in Singapore within the context of their overseas learning experiences. Ten teacher-nominated gifted adolescents from ages 15 to 17 who had exceeded the mandated hours (12 hours per year) of voluntary community service in their school were the respondents for this study. Semistructured interviews were conducted and data were analyzed using a grounded theory approach. The study showed that personality factors and value system (empathy, high sense of justice, optimism), social skills, and social factors (family, school culture, and service-learning experiences) contributed to acts of altruism among gifted female adolescents. Research results can be used as a guide to structure educational experiences that help foster a caring and socially responsive classroom for gifted pupils, enabling them to use their talents for the betterment of society.

AB  - This research aimed to develop a service learning instructional model and to study the use of the developed service model. The research was conducted through a methodology and development process, which was divided into three phases. In phase 1, a study into the existing context and needs of the community, concepts, theories, and related research on the development of service learning instructional model was done. As part of the phase-one study, a people forum attended by the students and the locals was organized. The data gained from the forum was used to synthesize the model. In phase 2, a tentative model of the service learning instruction was constructed. In phase three, the actual use of the developed model with the pre-service teachers who were second year students enrolled in a course "Source of Knowledge and Local Wisdoms" during semester 2 of the academic year 2012 was studied. Seventy-four students were sampled through Cluster Sampling, and the data was analyzed through behavior comparison assessed by t-test Dependent Samples. The results of the research revealed that the elements of the service learning instructional model included principles, concepts, theories related to service learning instruction, aims of the model, teaching process, social system, responses, and support system. In addition, the results of the actual use of the developed model unveiled the four stages of the model which is called "PCAR Model" P-Preparation, C-Class Presentation, A-Activity Based Learning, and R-Reflective Thinking. The teaching and learning activities enable the students to be responsible for the society and to perceive self-capabilities.

AB  - As teacher educators, we argue that the colonial history of First Peoples, coupled with alarming educational disparities, warrants a specialized approach to Indigenous service-learning within teacher training that requires a critical examination of positionality by service-learners. Our study examines the service-learning experiences of non-Indigenous pre-service teachers working in Indigenous classrooms over a three-month period through reflections and focus groups. The results underscore the risk that a lack of critical reflection by service-learners could play in widening existing educational gaps, and concludes that a reversal of perspective on the education gap could enact the possibility of reconciliatory pedagogy.

AB  - Background and purpose: The purpose of this research was to understand the experiences of pre-service teachers in a service-learning program. The research questions that guided this research were: (1) How does an after-school service-learning program that utilizes pre-service teachers develop students' pedagogy? (2) What are the experiences of pre-service teachers teaching in low SES schools through a service-learning approach? Methods: During the 2016-2017 school year, nine pre-service physical education students took part in a service-learning program. The REACH program was a free after-school physical education and literacy program for 5th and 6th grade students at a low SES school. This program consisted of two-hour sessions, twice per week, for 30-weeks starting in the Fall and ending in the Spring. Data consisted of interviews, pre-service teachers' journals, researcher journals, and researcher field notes. In total, 500 pages of data were analyzed using the constant comparative technique. Two researchers independently coded these data and a peer reviewer then separately reviewed the data and findings. Results: Three themes emerged from the data analysis. Theme 1 - Developing pedagogies in real-world settings. Theme 2 - Connecting with students and learning how to manage behavior. Theme 3 - Teaching in a low SES school: A wake-up call. Conclusions and implications: Pre-service teachers in this study were able to practice their pedagogy in a real-world environment and gain valuable experience in developing classroom and behavior management skills. The REACH program provides a model for a service-learning approach where pre-service students can practice and refine their teaching skills through extended involvement in an after-school program that served students in a low SES community.

AB  - An increased emphasis on multiculturalism in the United States has necessitated an awareness of culturally responsive pedagogy in physical education teacher education (PETE) programs. Practica in such programs along with reflection on these experiences are methods by which pre-service teachers can better appreciate the diverse nature of their students. The following study reports observations from the reflective journals of thirty junior and senior physical education teacher education pre-service teachers enrolled in a multicultural service learning practicum at a large southeastern university. Analysis of the pre-service teachers' journals revealed several thematic perspectives pertaining to (a) boundary crossings, (b) insider and outsider perspectives, and (c) language barriers. Results indicated that teachers in the practicum recognized the importance of utilizing multiple strategies of instruction for their students. Implications for PETE programs are that the multicultural learning practicum is of benefit to pre-service teachers' development of culturally responsive pedagogical skills, thus permitting them to acquire knowledge from diverse students' backgrounds.

AB  - This article revisits the scholarship on emotion in composition studies and extends this work through a consideration of emotion in community-based writing courses. With examples from student reflection essays from one such course, Writing With the Community, I explore emotion as a generative aspect of the students' semester writing projects for community organizations. In particular, I examine students' emotional responses to their community work, which include empathy, shame, anger, and unease, as I argue that students' emotions were an effective means of attaining their writing goals and a necessary component of their desire for social action and justice. I also offer three concepts from education theorists--emotional scaffolding, encouraging students to inhabit an ambiguous self, and emotion as a mode of critical inquiry--which I develop as strategies for achieving common goals in community-based writing courses.

AB  - This study investigated the benefits of incorporating the pedagogy of service-learning in two first-year seminar courses by examining: (1) the unique ways service can be incorporated in freshman classes; (2) the extent of interpersonal connections made as a result of the service; and (3) the impact of service on future community service involvement. First-year students enrolled in the Alpha seminar program in either of two introductory classes were surveyed. Responses were received from 14 students from 1 class (response rate, 35%) and 21 students from the other (response rate, 47%). Results of the survey show that most students in both courses found the service-learning experience to influence subsequent service positively, to facilitate connections within the class and in the community, and to be very beneficial overall. More research is needed to determine the aspects of the service-learning experience that contributed most to change in student perceptions and behaviors. An appendix contains the survey. (Contains 3 tables and 17 references.) (SLD)

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of two higher education institutions in the Western Cape, South Africa, and how their initiatives and collaboration brought about a particular health promoting schools (HPS) program in a resource poor setting. The aim of this paper is to reflect on the importance of the role that external systemic actors and stakeholders can play in the process of designing and implementing HPS programs in resource poor settings. Design/Methodology/Approach: In this paper a complex systems approach is employed to describe two different participatory methods of engagement with HPS by higher education institutions. On the one hand, engagement took place in terms of a formal and funded project, directed at the organizational level of the school, with capacity building as its aim. On the other hand, engagement was initiated informally (as part of a service-learning project) via collaboration with the formal project, directed at the individual level of learners in the school. Findings: In recognizing the complex nature of planning and implementing HPS programs, the paper demonstrates that HPS approaches could benefit from engaging with resources outside the ambit of institutional health and educational policies and structures. Originality/Value: By acknowledging the systemic nature of implementing HPS strategies, novel collaborations emerge as a result. The paper highlights the important role that external stakeholders such as higher education institutions play in creating and sustaining tailor-made HPS programs for schools based in resource poor settings.

AB  - Service-learning projects are becoming more prevalent in Information Systems education. This study explores the use of community-based research, a special kind of a service-learning strategy, in an Information Systems web development course. The paper presents a case study of a service-learning project to develop an educational web portal for a second-grade class by an Information Systems student and an elementary school teacher. The study's findings demonstrate the reciprocal benefits of community-based research to the IS student and the community partner. In spite of these benefits, there are pedagogical challenges to using community-based research as a service-learning strategy in an Information Systems course. The study's findings have implications for structuring effective service-learning experiences to promote student learning and to secure community gains from technology projects.

AB  - Community colleges educate students from both oppressed and marginalized groups, yet there is almost no literature on community colleges and issues of social justice. Student participation in service learning has been tentatively linked to development of a social justice lens. In this study, I analyze community college students' post-course civic engagement surveys to investigate the effect of service learning experiences on the emergence of any of three types of citizenship: personally responsible citizenship, participatory citizenship, or justice-oriented citizenship. Findings were mixed for personally responsible citizenship, but there were significant data supporting the development of participatory citizenship and justice-oriented citizenship in students who had taken between two and five previous courses that had included service learning. These encouraging findings support the idea that service learning plays a role in helping community college students transform inequitable structures in their communities.

Ss comprised 3 groups: (1) 425 individuals completed telephone interviews concerning perceived relationships between worker characteristics and age group; (2) 65 students (average age 25.09 yrs) taking Project ALIGN courses completed pre- and post-project questionnaires and kept journals; and (3) 25 mature workers (average age 60.5 yrs) selected by the South Alabama Regional Program Commission staff completed questionnaires concerning beliefs about aging. Results show that involvement in the service-learning project improved students' attitudes toward older workers. Students and mature workers reported significant differences in attitudes toward mature workers before but not after completing project courses.

AB  - The article examines how service learning can be linked to social networking sites such as MySpace and used in the formal classroom setting to facilitate learning and critical thinking. It explores how students can be encouraged to produce alternative media that have a radical educational impact. A key element of any activist effort to teach with and about alternative media that is mentioned in the article is to encourage the widespread development of critical media literacy, which is the ability to read the values and beliefs embedded in the knowledge that is circulated in the society.

AB  - Constituting a mandatory component of teacher education programs, field experiences offer preservice teachers the opportunity to observe in-service teachers as well as plan and teach lessons in authentic settings; however, participating in these activities does not necessarily result in preservice teachers’ developing teaching and learning competencies. One essential aspect of field experiences that constructively impacts preservice teachers is indeed the opportunity to reflect upon, inquire about, analyze, and discuss their teaching in order to enhance their practice. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore how preservice teachers used the seven processes (being videotaped, watching one’s video, selecting a clip, providing a rationale, crafting questions about their practice, meeting in the form of a video club, and responding to exit slips) of videotape analysis to develop an inquiry-oriented approach to their teaching and learning and reflective thinking about their teaching and learning. This study was conducted within the context of a video club, a researched professional development activity with documented benefits. A qualitative case study approach was used to describe the participation of and interactions among four preservice teachers during their first field experience where they taught lessons at a field school. I videotaped lessons taught by the 4 participants, who selected portions that were viewed during video club meetings. All participants met to view, analyze, and discuss the video clips. Data were obtained through videotaped recordings of lessons, observations, interviews, transcripts, memos, exit slips, and artifacts. Findings established that each of the seven processes contributed in different ways to help these participants develop an inquiry-oriented approach to their teaching and learning as well as develop their reflective thinking about their practice. The seven processes were interconnected and created a framework that helped these participants investigate their teaching and learning as well as develop their ability to engage in reflective thinking. In addition, I found that my role as a facilitator assisted in the participants’ learning. Key words: videotape analysis, video club, preservice teachers, field experience, reflective thinking, noticings

AB  - While there has been a steady increase in the understanding of how service-learning affects students, there remains a dearth of research on how using service-learning pedagogy impacts faculty. In this research study six themes emerged that illuminate how using this innovative pedagogy shaped and influenced faculty members' understandings of, and approaches to, teaching and learning.

AB  - It is argued that, although the goal of service education is to cultivate citizens concerned with society's problems, clarity in practice & mission are often lacking. Proposed is a taxonomy of experiential education that overcomes this deficiency & relates service learning to four levels of value: vital, social, cultural, & personal. The three major program types -- internship, coop, & service learning -- are described in terms of goals of the academy, the student, & the host organization. Understanding the relationship between program types, goals, & outcomes makes meaningful program evaluation possible, while organizing the service learning field in terms of the targeted value overcomes the fragmentation of departmental specializations & permits functional integration.

AB  - Purpose: A collaborative partnership model was used to develop and implement a state-wide community education program on universal design. Design and Methods: University faculty, extension professionals, older adult service agencies, service learning students, and a community retail chain made up the original partnership. Results: This collaboration resulted in a five-stage partnership model. The model was used to develop and disseminate a consumer education program to promote aging in place. The five stages include (a) identifying partner strengths and shared learning, (b) program development, (c) implementing the universal design program, (d) facilitating collaborative outreach, and (e) shifting toward sustainable outreach. Implications: A lack of knowledge exists among consumers, builders, and health care professionals regarding strategies for aging in place. Collaborations between educators, outreach professionals, students, and a retail partner resulted in increased interest and awareness about universal design changes that enable seniors to age in place.

AB  - Education is viewed as central to improving future palliative care for children and families across all countries. International education initiatives will ensure practitioners are aware of global health issues and can provide culturally sensitive care. Creative and innovative means of meeting such directives are required to achieve meaningful student learning. This paper focuses on one innovation, a children’s palliative care workshop using case studies as a teaching method, with nursing students from the USA and nursing and midwifery students from the UK. Key learning points arising from student evaluation were recorded under three main themes, these were: differences across countries, similarities across countries, and making learning fun and memorable. Findings indicated that this joint learning activity was viewed positively by all students and has enabled them to learn with and from each other, potentially impacting on their future practice.

AB  - In the last decades, many higher education institutions have developed practices of internationalization of curricula aiming at developing intercultural competences among the non-mobile majority of students. Some of them have developed service-learning activities focusing on working with underserved communities from different cultures. This article shows some challenges on how intercultural competence of college students participating in a community-based mentoring program could be assessed. Outcomes are based on mixed-method research from a survey given to a treatment group that participated in a mentoring program (n = 95) and a control group (n = 71), and on 10 daily life stories from university students who were enrolled and participated in the mentoring program. Paradoxically, results show scarce differences between groups in Attitudes, Skills, Comprehension, and Desired Internal Outcomes in favor of the control group. But, on the other hand, some slightly significant differences in favor of the treatment group are observed with regard to Dominance Orientation and Symbolic Racism. These results bring new hypotheses and discussions helpful for scholars and administrators, especially coming from the learnings that students showed, particularly in qualitative data.

AB  - This study describes the findings of a community engaged service learning program in which nine female and three male students ranging between 22 and 31 years of age from a large South African university participated in a study conducted in two metropolitan areas of South Africa. They were all senior level students registered for Criminological Evaluation and Assessment, a practically-oriented module aimed at equipping students with the required knowledge and skills to conduct criminological assessments. The students voluntarily assisted correctional centres with the assessment of sentenced offenders and in the compilation of individualized Correctional Sentence Plans (CSP) to inform the rehabilitation process of offenders. Students reported their reflections on their service learning experiences using on-line interviews and with question prompts. Extracts from the thematic data analysis suggest students perceived themselves to be instrumental to the Department of Correctional Services in the fulfilment of its goals, while they benefitted from enhanced learning and social responsibility.

The National Society for Professional Engineers (NSPE) and American Society for Civil Engineers (ASCE) codes of ethics explicitly encourage engineers to seek opportunities, beyond their work-related responsibilities, to serve their communities. Examples of how this can be encouraged as a part of the educational experiences of engineering students are explored.

AB  - This volume makes two important contributions: First, it provides a framework grounded in theory and best professional practice that middle and high school teachers, their students, and community partners can use to design, implement, and evaluate service-learning projects that address authentic community needs. Second, it demonstrates ways collaborative service-learning can enhance students' intellectual development, promote their academic achievement, strengthen their citizenship skills, and accelerate the kinds of educational accountability and reform initiatives emphasized in the national educational standards movement, and the 2002 No Child Left Behind Act. This book: (1) provides what may be the only comprehensive guide to implementing, assessing, and celebrating service-learning in today's middle and high schools; (2) emphasizes and explicates a collaborative approach to service-learning in which teachers, students, and community partners team together to advance learning and meet genuine community needs; (3) demonstrates how service-learning teams use key elements of standards-based education, multiple intelligences theory, and cooperative learning to guide project development, implementation, assessment, and evaluation; (4) offers optional designs for service-learning projects that are suitable for use by interns and beginning teachers, as well as by experienced and master teachers, and that can be used in a developmental sequence by school and community partners to build from small, individual projects toward school, system, and community wide projects; and (5) includes end-of-chapter activities that help those who use the book as a text to practice the model and its strategies, and use results to create their own service-learning projects. The book is organized in three parts that present service-learning along a theoretical to practical continuum. Part I lays the foundations for the method by proposing a collaborative model for service-learning. Part II explicates this model and explains the four sets of processes that teams use to commit to a project, cooperatively determine students' project outcomes and ways to measure them, develop learning activities to help students achieve outcomes, and then evaluate their projects and celebrate growth. Part III provides resources for carrying out the collaborative model. A wide range of educators will find this book useful. Its distinctive contributions and features are particularly valuable for teacher educators, students, and community partners already committed to service-learning projects; to those who are introducing service-learning into their practice; and to instructional supervisors, school administrators, and community agencies seeking to create a climate for service-learning or to enrich initiatives already underway. Following a preface, this book is divided into three parts. Part I, Foundations for Service-Learning, presents the initial chapters of the book: (1) A Collaborative Model for Service-Learning; (2) Designs for Service-Learning Projects in Middle and High Schools; and (3) Preparing to Use Service-Learning. Part II, Designing Service-Learning Projects Using the Collaborative Service-Learning Model, continues with: (4) Committing to a Service-Learning Project. Setting Goals in a Student Outcomes Plan; (5) Linking Service and Learning with Reflective Learning Experiences; and (6) Evaluating Projects and Celebrating Growth. Part III, Resources for Service-Learning Projects, offers the concluding chapters of the book: (7) Strategies for Encouraging Commitment to Projects; (8) Strategies for Measuring Student Outcomes; (9) Strategies for Designing Reflective Learning Experiences; (10) Strategies for Evaluating Projects and Celebrating Growth; and (11) Additional Resources for Service-Learning.

AB  - PURPOSE: The objectives of this paper were to evaluate pre- to post-treatment outcomes of patients attending a student-run free physical therapy clinic in order to provide new evidence concerning patient response to student care. We hypothesize improved functional and quality of life scores as measured by outcome scales. METHODS: Twenty-eight patients were included in this retrospective chart review. Data were analyzed through SPSS Statistical software (ver. 13) using paired t-tests to compare baseline and follow-up data for the following measures: blood pressure, numeric pain rating scale (NPRS), quality of life visual analog scale, SF-8 quality of life scale, and population demographics. RESULTS: Most of the patient population was between the ages of 30 and 59 yrs (78.4%) with an unemployment rate of 75%. Significant changes (p<0.05) were exhibited in both the physical health portion of the SF-8 survey and the NPRS. Although not statistically significant, the mental health portion of the SF-8 survey showed notable improvement. CONCLUSION: Service learning provides opportunities for students to serve the community while expanding clinical experience. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of student-run pro-bono physical therapy clinics in improving the quality of life for both physical and pain measures.

AB  - Drawing on key aspects of structuration theory, this case study examines student sensemaking efforts based on an international service learning (ISL) program conducted annually over a period of three years, wherein 11 U.S. students and 2 faculty members worked in a remote village in Moldova, teaching local students and community representatives to operate an online news outlet and interviewing young adults and professionals. Team members also interviewed Moldovan citizens, journalists, and politicians as part of a media research project. We adopted a meta-analytic approach to written student reflections to examine the processes through which students worked to understand cultural differences in a situation characterized by low community capabilities to either problem solve or to be self-sustaining, which further challenged their pre-existing assumptions.

AB  - Although critical ethnographers have explored in some depth the ways that social critique informs how youth assess their schooling experiences, the implications of social critique by educators themselves have been of much less interest. Yet, numerous professional educational movements have been wrought from social critique or, at the very least, from critique of school practices that fail to contribute to more equitable social outcomes. Featuring one middle-school classroom contextualized by such movements in the field of education, this article presents an analysis of student appropriations of the messages embedded in a year-long community service-learning project. The project engaged students in democratic action framed by the question: Do our voices count? It is argued that while students embraced a newfound political agency through this work, the lack of opportunity to question individualism, the structural dimensions of urban poverty and their own relative privilege in the school ultimately produced social divisions rather than social critique.

AB  - International service learning (ISL) courses within physical therapy (PT) education programs are designed, in part, to promote the development of professional values. Assessment of students' professional values, however, is a challenge for educators, METHODS: This study focused on the reflective learning component of an elective 10-day ISL course, evaluated whether PT professional values were manifested in students' written reflections, and characterized the level of student reflections using Bradley's criteria. Twenty-one third-year PT students participated. A qualitative content analysis of each student's written assignments was conducted. RESULTS: Although explicit instruction on PT values was not provided, reflections on professional values were identified in 97% of assignments. All three of Bradley's levels were found in all three written assignments, with the highest proportion of level 2 and 3 reflections being found in unstructured journals. CONCLUSION: Although no instruction specific to PT professional values was provided, values were implicit in student written assignments during this ISL course.

AB  - In increasingly fragmented environments, it is insufficient to train natural resource students to only develop site level plans. They must be encouraged to think about planning larger landscapes. Natural resource students also need to develop competencies in ``softer skills{''} such as communication, leadership, teamwork, and addressing public concerns. This article describes an approach to combining the pedagogies of service learning and problem-based learning in a capstone course in landscape level planning. Students work in interdisciplinary teams to develop a plan that meets the needs of diverse stakeholders who represent more than one property owner. Feedback indicates that students are learning problem solving skills and how to think and plan at the landscape level.

AB  - An innovative collaborative partnership between bachelor of science nursing (BSN) students and local public schools was developed in response to a call for increasing awareness of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening in Michigan's underserved populations; through this partnership, community health nursing students provide health education for middle- and high-school aged students who became colon health ambassadors and delivered important messages about the importance of colorectal cancer screenings for their significant others age 50 and older. At the completion, the program reached approximately 1,800 school-age students and their family members. The program provides nursing students with unique service-learning experience while improving their theoretical knowledge and clinical skills in health disparities and community health nursing. The purpose of this article is to describe the development and implementation of this community-academic collaboration and discuss the evaluation of educational outcomes as community health nursing experience.

AB  - Research service-learning (RSL) is an emerging pedagogy in which students engage in research within a service-learning context. This approach has great potential to promote science literacy because it teaches students how to use scientific knowledge and scientific ways of thinking in the service of society and helps them to better appreciate the strengths and limitations of the scientific method. We used RSL to promote science literacy in an introductory course for nonmajors, Conservation Biology of the Eno River. In this paper, we describe RSL, explain how we used it to design this course, and describe some lessons learned. We also describe the benefits of RSL for students, faculty, the community, and universities. Our hope is to provide science educators with another useful strategy for promoting science literacy.

AB  - Background: Health professions education recognizes the value of students' engagement in community service, exemplified by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education's adoption in 2007 of a standard requiring service learning opportunities to be available for medical students. Description: At our institution, a community service office was established in 1993 to provide students information about volunteer community service opportunities. Evaluation: Since 1993, more than 150,000 service hours have been performed by students in the community. There has been a clear increase in medical student participation. We have found that medical school community service participation is positively associated with better academic performance and can influence residency selection and participation in service following graduation. Conclusions: With the increased need to develop service opportunities for students, institutions will be required to establish infrastructures to support this. We offer recommendations to others interested in a creating a similar office or program for students.

AB  - Reviews values-oriented paradigms of W. Perry (1970), L. Kohlberg (1975), and C. Gilligan (1982) and presents a service learning model (SLM) that enables students to offer community services and to develop values. Explanations of the SLM's 5 phases of exploration, clarification, realization, activation, and internalization are provided, as well as descriptions of the key variables of intervention, commitment, behavior, and balance. Sample student profiles, goals for students, and developmental transitions to advanced service-learning phases are outlined. Parallels with other developmental paradigms are presented, and assumptions and limitations of the SLM are explored. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - As schools guide students in acquiring the skills and knowledge necessary to become responsible citizens, the question arises as to how they can better go about providing them with a well-rounded education: academically, socially, and emotionally. Providing Resource Opportunities with Learning (P.R.O.W.L.) suggests the following solutions: (1) create a partnership within the middle school community that accomplishes three goals: (fosters a relationship among local business firms, community service organizations, and adolescent students); (2) integrates public school curriculum with the business world; and (3) provides relevancy for students' lives. At Sarasota Middle School (Florida), P.R.O.W.L. provides an environment for relevant thinking, problem solving, and an awareness of the knowledge and skills leading to quality employment and post-secondary education. This booklet outlines the P.R.O.W.L. program in five sections: (1) "Proposed Pilot Program"; (2) "PROWL Team Responsibilities"; (3) "Forms"; (4) "Explorer Team PROWL Project 'So You Wanna Build Something'"; and (5) "PowerPoint Notes." A brochure explains the school perspective, the business perspective, and the community perspective of P.R.O.W.L.; and suggests desired outcomes for students, businesses, and schools. (BT)

AB  - This packet contains lesson plans with real-life service projects that students can do throughout the school year, from September 2000 to August 2001. The lesson plans in the packet provide teachers with flexibility to offer them to students as young as grade 5 and as old as grade 12. The lesson plans, although essentially social studies, service learning, or civics lessons, can be used to enhance other skills, such as research techniques, problem solving, creative writing, and personal development. Each lesson plan in the packet features a variety of class activities, individual assignments, a real class service project that will be determined and implemented by the students, and reflection activities. Keeping a student journal is a component of all 12-months' plans. Each lesson plan varies in time commitment; some require only one or two class periods, while others require as many as five class periods. The packet contains a calendar of "timely tips" and real-life service projects. Includes a list of resources. (BT)

AB  - The aim of this article is to present the methodology of service learning as an especially significant contribution to citizenship education. Service learning is an activity that combines community service and curricular learning. It is an educational setup in which a circular link is formed between participation in services created to meet a community need and the learning of knowledge and values. The project presents an initiative for education in values and citizenship based on experience, participation and critique. Service learning is at the same time an excellent instrument for making education more inclusive and for helping students develop a set of basic skills that can only be acquired through a comprehensive, contextualized activity Through service learning, students acquire a real, committed engagement with the search for the common good; this acquisition of commitment is a key formative mechanism in achieving a complete education for citizenship. The article begins by analyzing the different elements that make up citizenship education and the pedagogical means required for their acquisition. The concepts of `practice' and `citizenship practice' are the basis for proposing service learning as an ideal methodology for educating participative citizens who can contribute to the common good. The rest of the article is devoted to analyzing each of the constitutive aspects of service learning. This portion of the article begins by presenting a more-precise definition of `service learning' and continues with an analysis of the components of service learning: social needs, the learning of contents and competences, community service, partnerships between institutions and the required networking. The article concludes by reviewing the different levels at which service learning has an impact and identifying and organizing the various personal acquisitions and institutional achievements that this type of educational activity provides.

AB  - Privileged members of society take part in traditional forms of civic engagement at higher rates than less privileged members of society. Work on this civic empowerment gap has focused on the civic engagement of less privileged members of society rather than how more privileged members of society contribute to the maintenance of this gap. Service learning is a widespread pedagogy for civic education that has positive impacts on civic engagement. This study describes how a group of private school students learned about public education through their involvement in service learning. The study focused on a group of fifteen 10th grade students in a private, Quaker, independent school. These students were taking a class about Quaker values that involved tutoring 1st grade students in a public school. The study employed a sociocultural, qualitative methodology involving participant observation, interviews, video recordings, and review of written student work. The study shows that tutoring in a public school and discussing public education gave the 10th grade students an opportunity to learn about public school students, their teachers, and their parents. The 10th grade students' proximity to the practice of these groups during service created different opportunities for learning. More direct engagement with the students, teachers, or parents enabled the 10th graders to tell more detailed stories during discussions about public education and presented more challenges to their original ideas about students, parents, and teachers in public schools. In this case, learning occurred through a dialogic interaction between experiences in service and in the classroom. When students discussed public education without close engagement with the practice of others during service they talked about the issue without detailed inclusion of the perspectives of others, relying on ideas they held prior to the experience. However, when students had the opportunity to engage directly with others during service, they addressed public education in a way that gave greater consideration to others, adapting the ideas the students held prior to the experience. This illustrates the way that service learning both has the potential to further and to inhibit the development of ideal civic practices.

AB  - Business educators have a responsibility to ensure that future managers, employees, and shareholders are well versed in governance. Governance provides a vital link between organizations and society, allowing people to place their trust in an organization, support its mission, and ensure a continuing flow of resources to accomplish the mission. This article discusses coursework in board governance that combines a 5-month internship on a community nonprofit board with academic class work on governance topics to create a unique learning opportunity. The course combines elements of internship, mentorship, and service learning with more traditional academic activities such as lectures, guest speakers, research, and analysis. Students gain greater awareness of the needs of the broader community and the challenges of serving them. The community gains from a growing pool of people with governance knowledge and skills who understand the value of community service. (Contains 2 notes and 3 figures.)

AB  - Purpose: This study explores the perceptions of health profession students participating in academic service learning in Morocco with respect to adapting health care practices to cultural diversity. Methods: Authors utilized semi-structured, open-ended interviews to explore the perceptions of health profession students. Nine dental hygiene and nursing students who traveled to Morocco to provide oral and general health services were interviewed. After interviews were recorded, they were transcribed verbatim to ascertain descriptive validity and to generate inductive and deductive codes that constitute the major themes of the data analysis. Thereafter, NVIVO 8© was used to rapidly determine the frequency of applied codes. The authors compared the codes and themes to establish interpretive validity. Codes and themes were initially determined independently by co-authors and applied to the data subsequently. The authors compared the applied codes to establish intra-rater reliability. Results: International service learning experiences led to perceptions of growth as a health care provider among students. The application of knowledge and skills learned in academic programs and service learning settings were found to help in bridging the theory-practice gap. The specific experience enabled students to gain an understanding of diverse health care and cultural practices in Morocco. Conclusion: Students perceived that the experience gained in international service learning can heighten awareness of diverse cultural and health care practices to foster professional growth of health professionals.

AB  - This paper describes an initial attempt to integrate aging content into two required research courses via a qualitative research experience for students. The model employed required collaboration between the disciplines of social work and sociology in a small rural program. Students, receiving initial instruction in qualitative research, were required to work in groups to develop an interview schedule around an assigned topic and complete qualitative interviews with older adults. Continuing into the second course, students analyzed and produced a paper on the results of their interview on the topic. Additionally, an analysis of their learning process was completed. Implications of the model and lessons learned are explicated. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - This collection of essays gives the reader intimate views of the author's perspectives on topics ranging from social justice and education to service learning. The book is divided into four parts. Part 1 focuses on the general nature of the author's social and cultural critique of education. Relationships between educational policies and practices, and broader social and cultural concerns, are examined. Part 2 deals with a number of curricular approaches designed as alternatives to the conventional and stultifying programs that currently pass for education in American schools. Critiques of moral education, character education, service learning, and holistic education are offered. Part 3 is in the nature of a still deeper exploration into the possibilities of using religious and spiritual discourse in educational inquiry. The papers in this part represent the author's current focus of interest as well as the locus of his personal spiritual struggle. Part 4 consists of only one selection--an essay that is primarily autobiographical in nature--that was written for a book of collected essays on how various academics have or have not integrated their Jewish origins with their scholarly work. This book concludes with an afterword by Jeffrey Kane. (RT)

AB  - The pragmatic inquiry process used in the Corporantes Pathfinder Notebook (CPN) enables students and others to discern their gifts, find purpose and direction in their lives, and seek a FIT between their values and various corporate cultures before making extensive commitments in their field of studies and their employment. Based on Peirce's theory of Pragmtism the CPN fosters investigation, interpretation, and action resulting from reflected narratives written in response to a series of questions in the CPN. The CPN was used successfully as a framework in a Business Ethics course for connecting career decisions to their personal lives. Other pedagogic activities were used such as case studies, role playing, service learning, team projects investigating ethical climates of corporations, as well as Socratic questioning and discussions of moral dilemmas to develop ethical sensitivity and understanding of ethical challenges and decisions. The CPN also has been used successfully by Senior executives in over fifty applications.

AB  - Background: Latin America is a region with huge health inequalities and a tremendous growth in the number of medical schools during the last decades. The role of the medical schools in reducing health inequality has not been systematically explored. Methods: A qualitative framework method was used to explore the meaning, barriers, and facilitators of the concept of the social accountability of medical schools in Latin America. Twenty nine Latin American academic leaders from seven countries participated in an expert panel discussion. The Atlas ti.7 software was used to analyze the information. Results: Social accountability was identified as a core dimension of the mission of medical schools. The panel identified a gradient of three dimensions associated with social accountability. First, a formative dimension related to student selection, curricular structure and community based learning initiatives. Second, a societal dimension associated with institutional mission, community partnerships, and social research projects. Third, a political dimension related with involvement in health policies and primary care engagement. Lack of accreditation standards was identified as a main barrier to improve social accountability. Conclusions: Latin American leaders consider that medical schools should develop specific formative, societal, and political initiatives in order to be socially accountable.

AB  - Many social work students are reluctant to consider entering into practice with older people because of negative attitudes towards older people and old age. Within social work education such negative views are frequently seen as the consequence of ageism, and thus in need of challenging. An understanding of the ageism within society is clearly important. However, there are risks inherent in adopting an 'anti-ageism' approach which is predominantly cognitive and impersonal, and which may label students' own feeling as unacceptable. Students may then be unlikely to express or explore their true feelings, and therefore not helped towards changing these attitudes. Experiential and learner-centred formats provides more effective methods for attitude change. Such methods focus on helping students to examine their existing understanding of old age and older people, and the impact these attitudes have on their practice. Two strategies are presented which can assist students in this self-assessment: a repertory grid, and a biographical approach. Their use with a group of first year social work students is discussed.

AB  - A significant number of community service-learning projects in higher education involve the teaching or tutoring of immigrants in English. As in related service-learning scholarship, these projects are commonly informed by perspectives on cultural difference, social justice, and power relations in U.S. society. Yet while faculty pair their students' work in immigrant literacy programs with the classroom examination of issues of race, class, gender, and ethnicity, very little of the scholarship suggests that these students are led to critique the role of language ideologies in U.S. society. In this article I urge that institutionalized notions of English in the U.S.--such as the putative role of English in social mobility and the widespread belief that English was always voluntarily adopted by immigrants--be considered closely in our community literacy projects. My argument calls upon sociolinguistic and historical studies of the Progressive period and examines most closely language ideologies in the settlement house movement, an important origin for historians of community service-learning.

AB  - In this article I describe the work of Leonard Covello, a New York City language educator and high school principal of the early 20th century who argued for Italian and Spanish heritage language (HL) preservation in schools. Although Covello promoted standard language Italian and Spanish in the HL classroom, he also encouraged HL students to use their languages and language variations for community service and activism in their East Harlem neighborhoods. Through historical evidence, I show that HL students' community work in their languages and language variations helped them develop a civic identity that contrasted with the delinquent roles presupposed for them in the public sphere. I conclude by offering Covello's work as a perspective for language educators in the 21st century. (Contains 9 notes and 2 figures.)

AB  - Recent trends toward occupation-based practice and the move toward masters-level occupational therapy (OT) education has forced OT educators to reevaluate their programs to meet the needs of the contemporary health care environment. Service learning is one way to bridge the gap between theory and practice. The Master of Occupational Therapy (MOT) Program at Cleveland State University (CSU), in keeping with its focus on occupation, incorporates three service-learning components into its curriculum. This paper, written by a second-year MOT student at CSU, discusses two of these experiences in depth. The first, which took place at a homeless shelter, included both a didactic and 'clinical' component, with an emphasis on community-based mental health OT services. The second, which included a training component and a structured program, involved co-leading after-school social-emotional learning groups for low-income urban youth. Both experiences served to expand the clinical skills and reasoning of the MOT students while introducing both the students and agencies to the role of OT in non-traditional community settings. Based on these experiences, the author highly recommends that all masters-level OT programs should, if they have not done so already, institute service learning as a core component of their curricula, in order to prepare their students for contemporary OT practice.

AB  - We investigated the effectiveness of field visit as an experiential learning method by assessing course learning outcomes among postgraduate management students in managerial economics course. The study documents the planning and organisation of the field visit to an industry within the framework of Kolb's (1984) Experiential Learning Method as well as the assessment of learning from an industrial field visit against the specified course learning outcomes. While the perception survey showed that majority of the students valued learning from the field visit, we found huge variations in students' performance in final exam in terms of course learning outcomes. Assurance of learning analysis in the context of cognitive domain of Bloom's taxonomy showed that industrial field visit is more suitable for evaluating lower order learning in terms of knowledge and comprehension. We discuss the results in detail towards integrating experiential learning through field visits and future implementation of field visits in managerial economics course for better learning outcomes.

AB  - This chapter offers a situated account of English and vernacular literacy practices from a postcolonial perspective. Situated in ongoing endeavors in a variety of local contexts in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India, where the author was raised and schooled, this chapter calls attention to some key educational sites through which these policy-related inequities are reproduced, and some ways in which individual teachers and institutions assume the responsibility to make conditions more just and equal. The chapter concludes with a discussion of how a postcolonial research framework allows one to understand not only grounded inequities around language policies in terms of historical colonial pasts, but also how fellow humans draw on particular rationalizations to harness the vernaculars and work toward moving all to more equal footings. This article seeks first to define postcolonial framework, and then, secondly, to determine the ways that postcolonial framework informs English and vernacular debates in applied linguistics.

AB  - Older adults are the fastest growing population cohort in the United States. As this population sector ages, the demand for geriatric-trained clinicians will increase. Nutritional health is one part of the aging equation that can positively or negatively impact an older adult’s quality of life. Registered dietitians are the food and nutrition experts uniquely positioned to provide their expertise and skill set in caring for the older adult. Therefore, it is important to determine if nutrition and dietetic students are being educated and trained on nutrition in the older adult population. The purpose of this study was to investigate nutrition and aging content inclusion in accredited nutrition and dietetic programs. Purposeful, total population parameter sampling was used to target all accredited nutrition and dietetic program directors. All program directors were introduced to the research through email; each received an introduction to the study, a recruitment statement, and a survey link. The survey was developed by the researcher after reviewing two previous surveys administered to nutrition and dietetic program directors. Permission was granted from each author of the reviewed surveys to use and adapt questions as needed. Pearson’s Chi Square test was used most prevalently to test for associations between categorical variables. Results from the survey respondents indicate a majority of programs do not offer a separate course in nutrition and aging; yet, most programs include nutrition and aging content within other courses (i.e. lifecycle, community nutrition, medical nutrition therapy). Program directors also indicated that nutrition and aging content is covered through additional activities or experiences (i.e. clinical rotations, service-learning, supervised practice). Nearly all survey respondents indicated that including nutrition and aging content within the curricula is important. The results of this study suggest that curricular offerings related to nutrition and aging content within nutrition and dietetic programs have not changed over the past 15 to even 30 years. Non-traditional approaches, such as simulations, modules, or experiences may be the best way to provide nutrition and aging content in programs that are already packed full of other course requirements.

AB  - Older adults are the fastest growing population cohort in the United States. As this population sector ages, the demand for geriatric-trained clinicians will increase. Nutritional health is one part of the aging equation that can positively or negatively impact an older adult's quality of life. Registered dietitians are the food and nutrition experts uniquely positioned to provide their expertise and skill set in caring for the older adult. Therefore, it is important to determine if nutrition and dietetic students are being educated and trained on nutrition in the older adult population. The purpose of this study was to investigate nutrition and aging content inclusion in accredited nutrition and dietetic programs. Purposeful, total population parameter sampling was used to target all accredited nutrition and dietetic program directors. All program directors were introduced to the research through email; each received an introduction to the study, a recruitment statement, and a survey link. The survey was developed by the researcher after reviewing two previous surveys administered to nutrition and dietetic program directors. Permission was granted from each author of the reviewed surveys to use and adapt questions as needed. Pearson's Chi Square test was used most prevalently to test for associations between categorical variables. Results from the survey respondents indicate a majority of programs do not offer a separate course in nutrition and aging; yet, most programs include nutrition and aging content within other courses (i.e. lifecycle, community nutrition, medical nutrition therapy).

AB  - The environmental threats humanity faces have led businesses to increasingly commit to improve their environmental performance and to increasing attempts to address environmental issues in management education. This article presents a matrix of (a) principles that can underlie and (b) attributes that can be generated by environmentally focused management education and uses the matrix to identify topics, assignments, and assessment mechanisms that can be incorporated into environmental management education. Particular focus is given to skills related to facilitating organizational change. Environmental change-related course projects are suggested as particularly helpful in the development of these attributes, and use of service learning applied to campus sustainability issues is suggested as offering significant opportunities for engaging students in change-oriented projects. Observations related to implementing such projects based on the author's experience with them are offered. The article's concepts and ideas can provide guidance to instructors wishing to incorporate environmental sustainability into their management courses; an application with respect to human resources is included. (Contains 4 tables and 4 notes.)

AB  - In the field of service-learning, research has been focused on a number of areas, particularly student outcomes. However, for the most part, the issue of organizational culture has been overlooked. In this article, the possible connection between organizational culture and service-learning is discussed. The key point is that organizational culture should be an important consideration for any service-learning program. In this sense, an organizational culture that is inconsistent with the aims of service-learning will result in a hostile environment, which, in turn, will most likely lead to the failure of a program. Several obstacles are identified related to organizational culture that could threaten the design or implementation of service-learning. Furthermore, a number of possible solutions to these problems are provided. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Education & Society is the property of James Nicholas Publishers Pty.

AB  - As National School Lunch meal programs are undergoing major changes to provide millions of U.S. school children with more balanced meals, the education of nutrition professionals to support these nutritional objectives is receiving greater attention in dietetic training programs. A dietetic program, in collaboration with four local school districts, completed a grant project funded by the American Dietetic Association. The objectives of the project were to (1) provide experiential learning in the school nutrition services setting, (2) provide opportunities for students to use the computer tools available to management, (3) increase student understanding of current regulatory and documentation requirements, and (4) spark interest in this expanding area of practice for registered dietitians. Through training in the computer laboratory, students were ready to practice those skills in real-life situations, and were an integral part of the software application at school sites. At the completion of the school nutrition project, students had hands-on experience in the school setting and possessed a large portfolio of practical and technological skills. This project can serve as a model for dietetic educators to encourage and prepare future dietitians to work in school nutrition services. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This book serves as a call to action to anyone who works with young people. It discusses what it means to care for young people at all levels of social interaction: as individuals; in a professional capacity; within an organization; and as a society. It attempts to integrate theories and concepts of those who work with youth. It is intended to mobilize the energy into intentional actions that make sense both in individual contexts and in the context of broad social terms. Following an introduction, Chapter 2 sets forth a definition of caring in practice. Chapter 3 discusses some questions about care in practice and the role of both parties in the caring relationship. Chapter 4 develops a framework by which to consider the development of caring in individuals. It reviews the research on the impact of youth community service in developing skills. Chapter 5 looks at how caring can have an impact and how that impact can be demonstrated. Chapter 6 moves care from an individual level to caring schools and other organizations. The last chapter attempts to bring what is said about caring to an examination of society as a whole. (Contains 39 references.) (JDM)

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To provide an overview of the Community Health Fellowship Program (CHFP), describe the types of projects completed by the community health fellows from 2005 to 2009 and to assess the program's effectiveness from the perspective of fellows and community partners. METHODS: We developed the CHFP for training medical students in community-based participatory research (CBPR), and understanding the components of successful community partnerships for addressing health disparities in underserved communities. The program has didactic and applied community research components. RESULTS: From 2005 to 2009, fellows completed 25 research projects with 19 different community partners. Fellows reported favorable attitudes about the program, their mentors, and their community projects; their research knowledge increased significantly in most areas, especially their ability to develop a succinct research question, familiarity with CBPR, and delivering a formal research presentation (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P <.05). Community partners reported favorable attitudes toward the fellows and the program; using a 5-point Likert scale (1 = not favorable, 5 = very favorable), they reported highly favorable attitudes about fellows' level of responsibility (4.85), level of cooperation (4.85), familiarity with the needs of the medically underserved (4.69), and knowledge of how to apply local solutions to health problems (4.54). CONCLUSIONS: The CHFP has high favorability and support among fellows and community partners; the program can serve as a prototype for training future physicians in understanding and addressing the needs of the underserved, through community partnerships, and community-based participatory research.

AB  - 'Operation Sick Bay' was the inspiration of the 3 full-time nurses at Framingham High School, which has a population of 1,800 students and 300 teachers and staff. The primary focus of Operation Sick Bay was to create a health services environment conducive to learning about health and illness, developing lifetime skills in self-help and self-care, providing a restful atmosphere, and involving students and staff in taking pride in their school health services center. The 'sick bays' are small units with privacy curtain closures used for students who need to lie down because of illness. There are 3 bays for female students and 3 for male students. Instead of the usual cream-colored walls, the project provided the opportunity to create a colorful environment designed to provide health information to students.

AB  - Purpose: This article describes a connection between service learning and American Sign Language (ASL) instruction. The Deaf community served as communication partners for university students, enabling them to use language skills in a natural setting. Method: The rationale and implementation of pairing ASL with service learning are presented. A review of one study provides information about student perceptions of service learning, and a second study presents evidence about the development of ASL skills through a service learning experience. Results: Service learning proved to be a valuable teaching method for ASL instruction, facilitating an increase in cultural awareness and ASL skills. Students' anecdotal evidence about service learning experiences indicated that they gained insights beyond just the improvement in language skills. Conclusions: The connection between service learning and ASL instruction is advantageous because students gained cultural understanding as well as language skills. This course design could be used at other institutions where a Deaf community is accessible.

AB  - The explosion of service learning as a teaching methodology in higher education has generated increased awareness of the potential for liability related to student experiences with service partnerships all over the world. At present, there are few instances of legal problems occurring using service learning with students, but risk management not risk avoidance may be the best form of preventing legal problems from occurring. Reviewing areas of potential liability with the service partner, the student, faculty and college institution for possible risks may reduce future problems. Strategies for dealing with potential identified risks are discussed in this article including identified agency risks, the capacities of the students, employment status, liability insurance, and agency incorporation. Reducing the risk with students includes evaluating the harm to and by students, assessing the student population, prerequisite courses, assumptions, developmental age of the student, good communication and use of an honor Code. The higher education institutions and faculty may reduce risk by instituting student contracts, maintaining student privacy, and using waivers. Good risk management through preparation of all involved in service learning projects is the key to success.

AB  - Although service-learning has the potential to infuse technical communication pedagogy with civic goals, it can easily be co-opted by a hyperpragmatism that limits ethical critique and civic engagement. Service-learning's component of reflection, in particular, can become an uncritical, narrow invention or project management tool. Integrating cultural studies and service-learning can help position students as critical citizens who produce effective and ethical discourse and who create more inclusive forms of power. Rather than being tacked on, cultural studies approaches should be incorporated into core service-learning assignments.

AB  - The purpose of this research was, first, to study why a professor would implement and then continue to use a service learning methodology and, second, to study how a professor is shaped by service learning experiences. An in-depth case-study design was used to study the impacts of personal and contextual factors on one higher education professor implementing service learning in her classroom. Interviews, observations, and document reviews were used to gather data. The focal point for this study was a professor of a senior-level Nursing Leadership and Management course who successfully incorporated a service learning methodology and continues to do so. This study investigated the expert service learning professor and her interactions with students, peer faculty, and administrators. Institutional constraints, instructional considerations, and individual variables, including her motivations to successfully continue using a service learning methodology, were also examined. Findings, based on the four research questions that guided the current study, included the following: strong personal values are important motivating forces; student resistance is a negative factor; institutional constraints, including promotion and tenure policies, are influential to implementation; and communication with faculty peers is a factor in implementation. Insights and themes have potential value for higher education faculty, especially nursing educators and others in health disciplines.

AB  - There is little research about making instruction at school meaningful. This is surprising given that ample research suggests that many students do not find school a meaningful place, as documented by decline in interest during middle school, the frequency of boredom at school and decline in search for meaning among high school students. This article starts with an outline that considers both objective and subjective meaning in life. A review on different aspects of meaning in school, such as teaching meaning, purpose, identity, coherence, caring, aesthetics and agency, suggest that many ways to improve meaning in school have been underused and understudied. The inclusion of the philosophy of meaning in life extends the scope of research on interest by adding new components of objective meaning that may enrich school activities. This article will review both what has been done and what needs to be done. The article concludes that taking the perspective of meaning in life into account would open new avenues for empirical research in educational psychology.

AB  - Results are presented from a mixed-method analysis of how service-learning infused into a teacher education course can play a significant role in helping preservice teachers identify their understanding of academic, personal, professional, and civic engagement skills. This is a 3-year study that used two types of analysis qualitative and quantitative. Qualitative analysis was gathered over three iterations of a fall semester course (2010, 2011 and 2012) through content analysis of reflective writings during service-learning experiences. In addition, the researcher surveyed students through quantitative questionnaires over a 2-year period (2011 and 2012) and paired qualitative with quantitative results to further categorize and clarify the broader impacts of students' learning. Results from this study highlight how an academic service-learning experience that is infused into a course of study can both inform and enhance pedagogy and theory in teacher education.

AB  - Although the campaign and election of Barack Obama as the nation's first President with a background in community organizing (CO) has boosted the visibility and popularity of the field, graduate social work programs have not taken full advantage of the opportunity. This article, therefore, presents a three-fold argument regarding the future of CO education. There is an increasing demand and need for trained organizers and community organizing education. This historical moment holds significant potential for CO education in social work. Graduate schools of social work with CO programs should broaden their outreach to attract potential students and activists to careers as social change agents.

AB  - Citizenship is a critically important area of adult functioning so that its development should be of much greater significance in developmental science. Furthermore, it provides a means of exploring a number of key issues in developmental science. It is a prime example of social cognition, and lends itself to examination of interesting issues about development itself and developmental processes. Because it results from lifelong socialization and is influenced by most childhood socialization factors such as families and schools, it offers a useful means of studying socialization. It varies across most indicators of youth diversity so can be a safe way of indexing the increasing heterogeneity of our youth. And it is both a contributor to and an expression of positive youth development, a powerful new approach to research and policy. In this regard, it provides a useful tool for investigating the development of human capital. It should be one of the most important topics in developmental science, not a side issue that only a few people study, that is not covered in child development texts, as is now the case. But attention is needed to the development of theory and measurement.

AB  - Started as a program in 2003 and then incorporated as a nonprofit in 2008, each year, LearnServe has taken students of diverse backgrounds from the Washington, DC area to experience a summer of international service-learning and social entrepreneurship. However, the students who travel abroad are not always prepared to go or able to successfully complete the post-trip activities. With experiences of extreme homesickness and severe culture shock, a lack of true social empowerment projects during the trip, and a lack of engagement in social entrepreneurship after the trip, the program directors realized there was a need to improve the LearnServe curriculum. The aim was to create an improved educational experience that prepares students to travel, engages them during the trip, and creates sharing and entrepreneurial opportunities afterwards. This paper presents the design research and prototyping work completed to redesign this service-learning program so that it meets its goals for success, more effectively preparing students to have a successful service-learning trip abroad and engaging social entrepreneurship work upon return.

AB  - Students in Abnormal Psychology who pursued a service-learning opportunity worked with troubled youth in the juvenile justice system. Consistent with an a priori hypothesis, results revealed the following pattern: (a) service-learning students and traditional students exhibited similar levels of academic performance early in the semester; and (b) as the semester progressed, and service-learning students became more involved in course-related service, they showed increasingly superior academic performance relative to traditional students. As hypothesized, service-learning students were more likely than traditional students to perceive themselves as: (a) achieving personal development in the area of social responsibility and (b) learning to apply course concepts to new situations. Preliminary evidence that the project made clinically significant contributions to the service agency is also presented. Innovations to be implemented in this ongoing project are discussed, and recommendations for research are noted.

AB  - Thirty-two students (mean age 19 yrs 11 mo) enrolled in an abnormal psychology course with a service-learning (SL) program were surveyed regarding mastery of course-related concepts, social responsibility, and clinical benefits to the service agency. Their responses were compared to those of 93 students (mean age 20 yrs 8 mo) of the class who did not pursue service-learning. Results revealed the following patterns: (1) SL students and traditional students exhibited similar levels of academic performance early in the semester; and (2) as the semester progressed, and SL students became more involved in course-related service, they showed increasingly superior academic performance relative to traditional students. As hypothesized, SL students were more likely than traditional students to perceive themselves as: (10) achieving personal development in the area of social responsibility and (2) learning to apply course concepts to new situations. Preliminary evidence that the project made clinically significant contributions to the service agency is also presented. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a retrovirus that develops into acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) over time. It has become a global pandemic, with over half of the population infected with HIV are adolescents in the age range of 13–24-years-old. This qualitative historical content analysis examined 30 years of publiclyavailable HIV intervention programs directed toward youth in the United States for effective methods to reach the adolescent population. Findings consisted of 11 different intervention program types targeting adolescents including abstinence-based, comprehensive, youth development, risk reduction, clinic-based, parent-child relationship, didactic only, service learning, early childhood, behavior and culturally tailored, and school-based programs. There were certain programs that impacted the adolescents more than others, such as comprehensive, clinic-based, parent-child relationship, and programs that were behaviorally and culturally tailored. Each program utilized different methods of communication for outreach, through peers and family relationships, and social media outlets.

AB  - This study examined the effects of a small-scale, very short-term (8-10 h) service-learning experience on college undergraduates. Repeated measures analysis of variance indicated that students participating in this experience reported maintenance of their sense of social responsibility, an increased sense of the meaningfulness of college, and an increased likelihood of choosing a service-related occupation, when compared to non-participating matched counterparts. These findings provide support for the notion that minimally resource-intensive service-learning programs can provide students with some of the benefits of service-learning that have been identified in longer, more intensive experiences.

AB  - The objective of this study was to examine whether continuing education that focuses on service learning could provide older students (over the age of 50) with knowledge and skills that increase their life satisfaction, confidence, and community integration. We also examined whether it could provide them with meaningful and purposeful experiences. We surveyed older students prior to a service-learning program on satisfaction with life, self-esteem, extroversion, life purpose, depression, loneliness, and self-control coping. After completing the service-learning program, we again surveyed the older students, using the same measures one year later. We found that the service-learning program benefited the students in terms of their self-esteem, loneliness, confidence, and skill development. In addition, we learned that those who were less satisfied with their life prior to the service-learning program made the highest gains in life satisfaction following the service-learning program. We conclude that continuing education that focuses on service learning may be one way to provide older students with meaningful and psychologically beneficial social experiences.

AB  - Summer reading programs are a form of extended school year services for students in special education. However, previous studies have not reported including high percentages of participants in special education, nor have studies sufficiently controlled for selection bias. This study combined propensity score weighting with partially clustered models to examine the effects of a summer reading program on the growth in reading skills of K–4 students, roughly 50% to 75% of whom were in special education. Results suggest that students in most grades improved on some but not all skills. However, fewer improvements were apparent when participating students were compared with peers via propensity score analyses. In addition, Grade 3 students in the control group outperformed their peers who attended summer school.

AB  - These essays address education for citizenship at a specific, concrete level. The collection offers examples of efforts to create among students a new set of what Alexis de Tocqueville called "mores" or culturally defining "habits of the heart" that enhance citizenship, foster a sense of connectedness to a community, and support the practices, basic values, and institutions necessary for the democratic process. An introduction entitled "Some Themes from Recent Innovations and Questions for the Future" is given. The 13 essays following the introduction are: (1) "Teaching American Politics through Service: Reflections on a Pedagogical Strategy" (Craig A. Rimmerman); (2) "Service Learning as Civic Learning: Lessons We Can Learn from Our Students" (Richard M. Battistoni); (3) "The Urban Agenda Project" (Otto Feinstein; James D. Chesney); (4) "Citizenship Courses as Life-Changing Experiences" (William D. Coplin); (5) "Public Affairs Internships: Coming of Age" (Glen A. Halva-Neubauer); (6) "Enhancing Citizenship through Active Learning: Simulations on the Policy Process" (Joseph Cammarano; Linda L.

AB  - Mentoring provides students with role models, inspiration and encouragement that helps paint the promise of a successful future. In this article, the author discusses examples of successful mentoring programs in career and technical education. Among them is the High Tech Girls Society (HTGS). The program was started in the 2003-2004 school year in order to increase the representation and success of women in nontraditional career fields. It provides girls with the opportunity to participate in activities with business and postsecondary partners that support nontraditional careers for women. It also provides girls the opportunity to perform community service and links them with SkillsUSA. She talks about the success of Project Lead the Way (PLTW) program, as well as the partnership between the CHRISTUS Spohn Health System and Foy H. Moody High School, which were recognized by ACTE.

AB  - Across the country, career and technical (CTE) students are learning skills that will help them make a living, while also learning the meaning of giving that will help them, as Churchill put it, "make a life." Service-learning is an integral component of American education that goes on every day in CTE classes and career and technical student organizations (CTSOs). Much like CTE, service-learning puts coursework into context and fosters rigor and relevance; this helps to develop youth who are productive, civic-minded and bright. For CTSOs, helping young people become good citizens is an important part of what they do, and many have adopted service projects and encourage their chapters to become involved in them. This article focuses on the difference service-learning can make in the lives of students and on the teachers as well. (Contains 5 online resources.)

AB  - Biomedical research enterprises require a large number of core facilities and resources to supply the infrastructure necessary for translational research. Maintaining the financial viability and promoting efficiency in an academic environment can be particularly challenging for medical schools and universities. The Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute sought to improve core and service programs through a partnership with the Indiana University Kelley School of Business. The program paired teams of Masters of Business Administration students with cores and programs that self-identified the need for assistance in project management, financial management, marketing, or resource efficiency. The projects were developed by CTSI project managers and business school faculty using service-learning principles to ensure learning for students who also received course credit for their participation. With three years of experience, the program demonstrates a successful partnership that improves clinical research infrastructure by promoting business best practices and providing a valued learning experience for business students.

AB  - This article describes a critical service-learning project that resulted from an educational partnership among a national teachers' union, a local teachers' union, and a major research university. The partnership—funded by a grant from the Corporation for National and Community Service, Learn and Serve program—focused on professional development opportunities for K–12 educators across subject areas throughout an urban school district. Teachers enrolled in a university-level graduate course where they learned about critical service-learning, engaged in community-based activities, developed partnerships with local organizations, and facilitated critical service-learning projects in local schools and communities. Here, we highlight one of the many projects that emerged from this partnership as we attempt to connect theory with practice by reframing service-learning as learning and participation. We ask: How can a reframing of service-learning as learning and participation impact how we understand the educative and social engagements of four urban youth?

AB  - This dissertation aims to foster a discussion among adult education practitioners on the connections between transformative learning theory and ethnoculture-based community service learning. Based on the concept of perspective transformation described by Jack Mezirow (1991), the study explores how perspective transformation occurs in a ethnoculturally based community service-learning course whose focus is on helping students to understand themselves within the context of their ethnic and cultural identity. As a practitioner of adult education I am looking for ways that my research, teaching, and practice are connected. The dissertation employed qualitative research, in particular drawing on ten in-depth interviews, and participant observation, and reflection papers to examine a variety of perspectives in order to analyze the implications of transformative learning theory for practitioners working with refugee and immigrant students. My research data consistently speaks of a heightened sense of cultural identity and personal development, a greater mastery of leadership skills, an enhanced self-esteem, and more complex patterns of thought in the form of critical reflection. Most of the immigrants and refugee students expressed that CIRCLE expose to a large and diverse immigrants and refugee community had significant and positive effects on their identity development process. In summary, my study suggests that the ethnoculturally-based community service can and often does have a transformational impact on participants.

AB  - College and university faculty in Family and Consumer Sciences (FCS) programs are becoming more involved in online course design and instruction. The purpose of this article is twofold. First, examples of several existing FCS online programs are presented. Many online programs are being offered in the United States, and several are offered in an international setting (e.g. British Columbia, Saudi Arabia, and Thailand). Second, four models of education that FCS instructors can draw upon for teaching online are presented. The models are positivism, constructivism, the community of inquiry approach, and experiential learning. Positivism should be utilized when the goal is to teach specific and basic knowledge, which is usually contained in lectures and readings. Other models are more appropriate when the goal is to cultivate students' higher level thinking through dynamic learning processes. Constructivism is based on the assumption that learners are active creators of knowledge and meaning. The community of inquiry approach highlights the importance of building relationships for learning. The experiential learning model involves direct participation in realistic contexts and should be followed with reflection on the general principles of the learning situation. Online teaching strategies, examples, and limitations are presented for each model. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

The author points to a study that shows when service education is geared toward civic and political activity, students do increase their participation in these areas. He argues that service education be geared in this direction.

AB  - This book considers service learning an integral aspect of Catholic education. The first four chapters of the book offer theoretical considerations regarding the essential elements of Catholic service learning: the theology of ministry; notable adolescent milestones; Catholic social teaching; and curriculum development. The final chapters are more practical, offering operative insight into the challenges associated with taking education beyond the classroom walls and retaining the ministerial dimensions. The book states that "service learning" refers to projects and programs that prepare teenagers and young adults for their ministry as Jesus' disciples. Following an introduction, chapters in the book are: (1) "A Theology of Mission and Ministry for the Young"; (2) "Called to the Vineyard: Service Learning for the Developing Youth"; (3) "Catholic Social Teaching and Service Learning"; (4) "Balancing Pedagogy and Ministry"; (5) "Challenges to Off-Site Learning Programs"; (6) "Meeting Challenges as Jesus Did"; and (7) "Building a Civilization of Love: Service and the Next Generation." (Contains 25 endnotes, a resource list of books and Web sites, and a 14-item bibliography.) (BT)

AB  - This study examined the value of service, both as a constitutive element in Catholic secondary education, and as it is experienced and understood in the lives of adolescent males. The participants' descriptions of experiences with service provided the foundations for any insights and conclusions. The research questions lent themselves to qualitative methodology. The researcher interviewed 7 recent graduates who participated in the Habitat for Humanity experience sponsored by the school in addition to the Director of Service Learning at the school. Each participant was interviewed on three occasions: first, focusing on the life history of the participant to establish a context for the experience of service; in the second interview, the participant reconstructed the concrete details of their experiences with service; and finally, to invite the participants to reflect on the meaning of their experiences. Extensive document analysis took place prior to, during, and after each of the interview protocols. Coupled with these two sources of data was in-depth participant observation. Through a process of triangulation, the interpretation of the data was confirmed. The research surfaced seven themes with regard to the experience of service in the life of male adolescents: (a) family influence and support of service, (b) feeling called to service, (c) service as an eye-opening experience, (d) service and identity formation, (e) service and growth into commitment, (f) service and the value of community, and (g) passion versus ambition or vocation versus occupation. Additionally, the participants' varied expressions for service were presented as well as the reflections of the Director of Service Learning for Social Justice. The findings of the study suggest that the experience of service during this period of adolescence helped to surface issues of identity in a positive and constructive manner, increased the participants' confidence in his own talents and abilities, fostered an openness to commitment and hopeful aspirations for the future, and encouraged the discernment of values for life as well as responsibility for one's self and to the world.

AB  - Field-based experiential learning is an effective way to introduce alternative dispute resolution concepts. This article presents a model of field-based learning in Cyprus that integrates concepts of conflict resolution with real-world experiences. Through this process, students learn to assess the effectiveness of conflict resolution strategies and to research, analyze, and report on conflict processes and their resolution. Although the model is based on a course in Cyprus, the example and course model are applicable to other locations and other conflicts. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - This paper outlines a critical pedagogic approach to field-based learning (FBL) at graduate level. Drawing on student experience stemming from a FBL module and as part of an MA programme in Environment, Society and Development, the paper addresses the complexities associated with student-led, participative critical enquiry during fieldwork in Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina. The paper examines emerging student discourses through a group assessment and a series of individual reflective journals. Both are contextualised in relation to FBL module learning outcomes. Finally, aspects of fieldwork influencing the feasibility and effectiveness of participative critical enquiry as a field-based pedagogic endeavour are considered.

AB  - The author examines in how far service learning as a didactic model in higher education could help optimize learning processes among students. Service learning constitutes a specific form of teaching and learning which combines teaching units aimed at imparting theoretical knowledge with social commitment by students. The aim of service learning is to optimize the linking of theory and practice and to promote social commitment among students. In a quasi-experimental pre-post-design, a total of 116 students were interviewed during the course of one semester. The survey focused on variables of self-controlled learning and of the perceived increase in knowledge. The results show that, compared to conventional forms of instruction, students participating in service learning courses experience, among other things, a greater increase in knowledge.

AB  - The post-war controversy on social or political education was repeated five decades later as a controversy about a Bund-Lander Commission model program. Studies of the last ten years show that social learning does not simultaneously signify or bring about political learning because the spheres of the private and of the public differ. The central competence in the domain of democracy is the ability to deal with conflict, which - as a principle of controversy and in addition to the passage from the social to the political - marks the special didactic principles of political education. The same course of development may be taken by projects of service learning and of the model program outlined by the Bund-Lander Commission.

AB  - Service-learning has a long and distinguished history of providing valuable experiences to students across all academic levels. Professional disciplines are well situated to provide students with opportunities related to service-learning while also providing needed health care services to communities. This article and Part 2 on pages 516-518 of this issue describe a service-learning initiative implemented in a bachelor of science in nursing program. Part 1 details students' perceptions of outcomes realized from the program, and Part 2 describes community outcomes. The purposes of the program were to enhance students' skills in history-taking, blood pressure and heart rate assessment skills, and beginning counseling skills, as well as provide the university community with blood pressure screening and counseling in a convenient and accessible location. Data on students' perceptions were collected for each semester of the program and for 1 year after students' participation in the program. Students perceived gains in blood pressure and heart rate skill performance, beginning counseling skills, their understanding of tailored client action plans, and their professional commitment to the health of the community.

AB  - Health promotion skills are a key component of most nursing education programs. While many curricula center around a singular health promotion project contained in one course, this nursing program saw the opportunity to use service-learning as a vehicle for developing a range of both health promotion and research skills. This report details a service-learning research program involving second and third year nursing students. Students conducted a community needs assessment, and designed, implemented, and evaluated health promotion programs that were developed as a result of the community needs assessment. Students collected data on the effectiveness of their programs through pre- and post-test design. Once in their statistics and research courses, students analyzed the data and prepared the data for presentation, developing their research skills. Results from the community on pre- and post-tests indicated significant gains in knowledge regarding hypertension and diabetes risk factors, prevention strategies, and intent to change behavior. Student outcome data was also collected and showed students perceived they had increases in the following skill sets: health promotion, assessment, civic engagement, and research.

AB  - Service-learning invites you to bring who you are, what you know, and what you can do into the classroom and the world beyond (the wall-less classroom) in applying your whole self to creating community change. In the process, what you. discover in the intersection of 'you' and 'not-you' will shape and transform your understanding of yourself and your place in the world, if you let it. Putting who you are and what you know into practice will change who you are and what you know and enlarge your understanding of yourself and the world of others who are both different from and similar to you. In forming a community with others (other students, the instructor, the individuals who comprise your community partner), you increase the possibilities for creating transformation, as you experience deeply the principle of the whole being more than the sum of its parts. You are welcomed into a learning experience in which a community addresses real-world challenges in a way that an assortment of individuals cannot, and 'it starts when you say we/and know who you mean, and each/day you mean one more.'

In this article, the authors describe the course; connect it to literature on grassroots change-making, integrative learning, and service-learning; and, through the inclusion of student authors, allow the sharing of insights in the students' own voices.

AB  - The Leadership Attitudes and Beliefs Scale (LABS-III; Wielkiewicz, 2000) was validated against a measure with a more traditional, position-based definition of leadership. Disagreement with Hierarchical Thinking was associated with a higher GPA. A Life-Long Learning scale was strongly associated with GPA, Systemic Thinking, and social activism. These results suggested there are likely to be multiple leadership development paths. Educational practitioners interested in leadership development may find it fruitful to broaden definitions of leadership development activities to include service learning trips, social welfare activities, learning communities, volunteering, internships, and other activities that develop social consciousness and life-long learning.

AB  - This essay presents perspectives on the range of potential reciprocity in literacy research and service learning, focusing attention on opportunities for individualized and institutional reciprocation, as observed by Takayoshi and Powell (2003). Researchers and students involved in community-based research or service programs have several opportunities to give back to their research participants and service organizations, and the more they are aware of these opportunities or can make these entities aware of these benefits and act upon them, the more productive such research and service can be to the field of literacy studies as well as to those who participate.

AB  - This booklet addresses student membership on local boards of education. It is intended to serve as guide for boards considering adding youth to their membership. It discusses the following topics: (1) the benefits to both students and the board of youth serving as board members; (2) researching issues before accepting students on boards; (3) establishing the type of student commitment the board needs to fulfill its mission; (4) creating a structure for student membership, which includes researching any legal roadblocks, creating a student candidacy, developing roles and responsibilities for board members, and creating an inviting environment for youth; and (5) assessing the board members' performance and involvement. Included in the booklet are models for student board membership from school districts in Alaska, Maryland, and Oregon, where student board membership has proved effective. The models include background and history of student board membership in each of the three districts and excerpts from policy documents establishing and governing student board membership. The booklet also contains sample assessment instruments for both adult and youth board members and a short list of additional resources. (WFA)

AB  - Service-learning work is uneven. It is shot through with contradictions, inconsistencies, and imperfections. Service cannot (in fact, must not) adhere neatly to a one-size-fits-all criterion. It is the giving of one's self. It is the connection of human beings dialectically related to the structures/systems within which we live. It must be process. To that end, the following pages illustrate such a process in praxis, which juxtaposes developing work with our partners (action) with constantly new understandings of theory that further enhanced the developing work (reflection). So, the work here is twofold. On one hand, this chapter illuminates a particular partnership, what has been learned along the way, and how the partnership can be sustained. On the other hand, it formulates an argument regarding the importance of creating and the need to support a type of insurgent educator who is prepared to push the disciplined boundaries of service-learning in order to work against neoliberal and alienating trends in schooling. Permit me one more introductory remark. When treating the action portion of this evolutionary trajectory, the first person plural is preferred since the developing work secured contributions from many people from both the United States and Jamaica, particularly my partner, who has joined me in this work from its inception in 1998. Plus, the work is intimate and cannot be captured with a distant third person narrative. How else shall we narrate our lives? As well, perhaps I seek to assuage embittered notions of our (that is, United States) position of power in an undoubtedly hierarchical partnership. We went there. Our partners did not come here. Our partners could not come here. So, the story begins with stratified positions. The work involves closing our social distance. The chapter concludes with final comments on where we are now in terms of that social distance and suggests the degree to which service-learning may or may not have revolutionary potential.

AB  - <bold>Introduction: </bold>Policymakers have recommended recruiting or training (or both) more US physicians who can provide care in Spanish. Few longitudinal medical Spanish programs have been described and evaluated.<bold>Objective: </bold>This study aims to describe development and evaluation of the preclinical phase of a 4-y program designed to graduate physicians who can provide language-concordant care in Spanish.<bold>Setting: </bold>Study was done in one public medical school in southeastern USA.<bold>Program Description: </bold>The program targeted intermediate/advanced Spanish speakers. Standardized fluency assessments were used to determine eligibility and evaluate participants' progress. Curriculum included didactic coursework, simulated patients, socio-cultural seminars, clinical skills rotations at sites serving Latinos, service-learning, and international immersion.<bold>Program Evaluation: </bold>For the first two cohorts (n = 45) qualitative evaluation identified program improvement opportunities and found participants believed the program helped them maintain their Spanish skills. Mean interim (2-y) speaking proficiency scores were unchanged from baseline: 9.0 versus 8.7 at baseline on 12-point scale (p = 0.15). Mean interim listening comprehension scores (second cohort only, n = 25) increased from a baseline of 77 to 86% (p = 0.003). Proportions "passing" the listening comprehension test increased from 72 to 92% (p = 0.06).<bold>Discussion: </bold>We describe development of a longitudinal Spanish program within a medical school. Participation was associated with improved Spanish listening comprehension and no change in speaking proficiency.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the factors associated with teenagers’ willingness to volunteer with elderly persons using an expanded model of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). Participants consisted of 258 ninth-grade students at a large high school in the northern part of Israel. Participants completed a structured questionnaire consisting of 52 items, which examined their attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, past behavior, personal identity, and perceived moral obligation. Their willingness to volunteer with elderly persons was assessed using six vignettes, varying in the severity of the elderly person's health and functional conditions described. Additionally, the students’ sociodemographic variables were examined. Overall, students’ willingness to volunteer with elderly persons was low; however, it increased when the elderly person in the vignette was described as relatively healthy. Statistically significant relationships were found between willingness to volunteer and personal identity, as well as between willingness to volunteer and attitudes toward volunteering with elderly persons. A statistically significant but moderate relationship was found between willingness to volunteer and subjective norms. Multiple regression analyses showed that attitudes, subjective norms, and personal identity were the main predictors of willingness to volunteer with elderly persons, explaining 58% of the variance. The expanded model of the Theory of Planned Behavior provided an appropriate framework for understanding the factors associated with teenagers’ willingness to volunteer with elderly persons. Our findings stress the need to develop educational intervention programs regarding gerontologically-related subjects and to disseminate them among the population in general, and among youth in particular.

AB  - Reviews the book, Democratic Dilemmas of Teaching Service-Learning: Curricular Strategies for Success by Christine M. Cress and David M. Donohue (2011). In this book nearly two dozen faculty members from a wide range of disciplines reflect on how engaging students in the community shapes opportunities for democratic learning, how students make meaning of their service experiences, and how they have handled the inevitable challenges they have faced. Although all of the authors describe dilemmas within courses they teach, their insights offer much for all of us who challenge and support students in the process of learning about themselves and their place in the world. The reviewer found this book to be powerful, provocative, and instructive. This book is recommended highly to all who engage students in activities that have the potential to raise social, moral, ethical, and democratic dilemmas—which encompasses most of what is most rewarding about student affairs work.

AB  - Reviews the book, The Future of Service–Learning: New Solutions for Sustaining and Improving Practice edited by Jean R. Strait and Marybeth Lima (2009). This is a timely book asking the reader to consider what is next for service–learning. This book raises numerous questions to push service-learning further and to address the current climate of higher education. The book is divided into three sections. Pan I explores issues of service-learning administration, part II examines service learning's ability to lead to research, and part III discusses future directions for service–learning design. Discussions regarding changing student demographics, an increase in web-based courses, and the current financial climate facing institutions of higher education are addressed in this book, which includes case studies, anecdotal best practices, and reviews of current research on various aspects of service-learning in higher education. Thus, this book is primarily geared toward service–learning practitioners and those interested in service–learning research within higher education.

RARE is a place-based education and service-learning program that encourages students to participate in restoring ecosystems in their communities. It is said that place-based education is the starting point for teaching concepts in science, while service-learning is a teaching and learning strategy that integrates community service with instruction and reflection.

AB  - Service-learning (S-L) has been regarded as a relatively well-established and effective teaching pedagogy. Students who participate in S-L are more likely to learn more efficiently, more effectively, and remember more of what they have learned than their counterparts. Current studies have been done on the experiences of students in service-learning and implementing S-L components. Other research has focused on the barriers to conducting effective S-L. However, no qualitative studies have examined a faculty component of S-L. Also, there have been few studies or discussions delineating faculty perceptions or experiences in S-L. An e-mail survey supplemented with personal interviews was utilized in an effort to understand experiences of participating in S-L. Of specific interest were faculty perceptions of the costs and rewards in employing S-L in gerontology-related curriculums.

AB  - Traditionally, the school has been the primary role model for citizenship development. One method schools may use to convey the roles and models of involved citizens is through community service experiences. Public and private schools throughout the United States include community service as part of the curriculum and/or extracurricular activities. Service promotes responsibility, a caring ethic, and growth of community. Service can improve society through individuals working together and forming a bond with one another. Service provides opportunities to witness the diverse cultures of society. Through service, students may experience affective and cognitive development, form relationships with community members, and relate their schools' commitment to the community. Although current research focuses on the service experiences of public school students, private school students have been consistently noted as being more active in community service (Eberly, 1993; Frase, 1995; Newmann & Rutter, 1985/1986). Therefore, this study examines the impact of community service in private high school settings. The study explores service learning, its connection to civic education, and its effects on students, their communities, and their schools. The central questions are these: What insights do students gain from service experiences? What motivates students to serve? How do students' expectations of service match their experiences? What is the school's role in service? What characteristics make a school service program successful? The research methodology for the study is qualitative to describe and to explore what students experience and internalize from community service.

T1  - Free Medical Clinics: Helping Indigent Patients and Dealing With Emerging Health Care Needs

AB  - An innovative movement of free medical clinics, which began in the 1960s, has helped indigent people without access to traditional health care. In this article, the author relates his experiences at three free clinics. Aside from the delivery of good care to deserving people, these clinics also had an impact on other relevant issues in medicine: The first of these clinics became involved with a chronic illness that affected medical research, the second provided another venue for medical teaching, and the third increased volunteerism, especially among senior clinicians. These secondary features are the focus of this article. The first clinic, created in a time of troubling social change, cared for many young people with infections, probably including some who were part of an evolving epidemic that was only later recognized as HIV/AIDS. The second clinic began when the traditional hospital and outpatient clinic settings for teaching medical students-both in their preclinical years and during clerkship rotations-were not conducive to learning the skills of interviewing and physical examination of cooperative patients. The more informal, less frenetic pace of a free clinic appealed to students and some residents as a place to build clinical skills. The new Liaison Committee on Medical Education standard to provide student service learning may formalize the use of free clinics in medical schools. The third clinic, like any of the 1,200 or more free clinics in the United States, cares for indigent people who have no access to established health care. The free clinic movement, which can provide some of the needed care, relies on volunteer physicians, many of whom are older and retired clinicians, who find that their contribution to free clinic care can be both useful to the patients and most rewarding to themselves.

AB  - What does it take to develop enlightened leaders who can transform their organizations and communities? The quest to develop enlightened leaders who are self-aware, learning centered, adaptable, interpersonally competent, and team oriented is a challenge faced by many management programs. The Master of Science program in Executive Leadership and Organization Change (ELOC) was designed to develop enlightened leaders who can demonstrate outstanding and transformative leadership in their organizations and communities. The ELOC program is an innovative executive-level master's program designed to develop leadership and change management skills through the pedagogical framework of ACT (action learning, competency development, and teamwork). ELOC students participated in a public engagement practicum course in the first summer of their program. A description of the ELOC program as well as a description of the service-learning course is presented. Key components in the program and course that facilitated the desired executive leadership development are highlighted. (Contains 4 tables and 1 figure.)

AB  - This study outlines the use of a community-based learning (CBL) applied to a Retailing Management course conducted in a 16-week semester in a private institution in the East Coast. The study addresses the case method of teaching and its potential weaknesses, and discusses experiential learning for a real-world application. It further addresses CBL as an important teaching application of experiential learning for the students to have a meaningful experience of studying and making recommendations about multiple aspects of retailing management for a local retailer. Course evaluation results that compared non-CBL and CBL classes showed that the mean scores in selected questions of CBL classes were statistically higher than those of non-CBL classes and the effect size was moderate. Qualitative student comments further suggested benefits and limitations of a CBL course. Notwithstanding the challenges to the instructor and the students of a CBL course, CBL applied to Retailing Management course provided meaningful benefits to the instructor, the students, and the community partner.

AB  - In this study we examined the role that high-impact practices play in shaping first-year students' sense of belonging as it relates to peers and institutional acceptance. We used data from the National Survey of Student Engagement (N = 9,371), and results revealed troublesome gaps for historically underrepresented populations in their sense of belonging among their peers and affiliation with the institution. Yet, when students participated in certain high-impact practices (learning communities, service learning, research with faculty, and campus leadership), positive associations were found, even after controlling for other institutional- and student-level characteristics. Implications for first-year programming are discussed.

AB  - Service-learning has been shown to be an effective technique for teaching diversity; however, the literature is scant concerning theoretically informed approaches. This study fills that void by drawing upon the work of Freire, Rendón, and others. After describing how an integrative praxis approach is applied in a sociology course, the authors discuss findings from a pilot survey administered to students who took this course. Findings indicate that students' awareness and understanding of the complexities confronting diverse populations increased. Contributions of this exploratory study include presenting a theoretically informed pedagogy that may be used to teach diversity in various disciplines.

AB  - Data from the National Educational Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) conducted by the National Center for Educational Statistics were used to examine the relationships of demographic factors, parental monitoring variables and family structure on two groups of Asian youth: (1) affluent Asians of Japanese, Chinese, Filipino or Korean descent, and (2) Indochinese Asians (less affluent) of Southeast Asian descent and compared them to non-Asians. This study examined Hu's (1989) bi-polar model of American Asian socio-economic status using descriptive statistics and regression analysis. Moreover, these data were used to determine the level of impact the aforementioned variables had on non-formal educational programs. The target sample included a sample of 24,599 eighth-grade students from 1,052 schools participating in the study. Percentages, frequencies and block (multiple) regression were computed to examine the relationships and differences between the dependent variable (participation in non-formal education) and the independent variables (demographic, parental monitoring, and family structure factors). Overall findings showed little difference between Asian youth and non-Asian youth relative to their participation in non-formal education. Socio-economic status and the number of siblings were variables showing the most significance between groups. Demographic factors showed that Asians were primarily located in urban areas in western and southern United States. Parental monitoring variables were nearly the same among all three groups with the exception of parental contact with the schools, of which both Asian groups showed less contact. Family structure variables revealed larger families with the Indochinese. Participation in service-learning programs was suggested as a possible alternative for bridging non-formal programs (like 4-H, scouting) with formal education.

AB  - Service-learning has become a popular pedagogical tool to promote academic and civic learning. One form of service-learning provides physical activity for underrepresented community groups, including children with disabilities. Using experiential learning theory, the purpose of this descriptive case study was to evaluate college students’ experiences in a physical activity-based service-learning program for children with disabilities. Through convenience sampling, 97 program participants (82 female, 15 male), most of whom were White (N = 85), were recruited for participation. Data included a pre- and postsurvey of civic learning, participant interviews, reflective journaling, and program observations. Qualitative data were analyzed using constant comparison and inductive analysis, and quantitative data were analyzed using Mixed ANOVAs. Results revealed that the program resulted in enhanced civic and academic learning. Themes included making a difference, academic and career connections, emotional and personal growth, and program reflection. Implications of the study and future directions for research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Service learning can help students to engage in the community while applying lessons learned in their coursework. Using self-determination theory, we evaluated the relationship among self-efficacy, self-regulated motivation, and civic learning in service learning courses. Participants included 242 college students (122 females, 120 males) across 28 service learning courses at a large, research-intensive university in the American Midwest. A conceptual framework was developed and tested using structural equation modeling. Results indicate that self-efficacy for community service has a positive impact on civic learning directly and indirectly through self-regulated motivation. The direct effects in the model were stronger than the indirect effects. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Designed for teachers who view service learning as a teaching strategy to improve instruction, this guide assumes that participants in the training are teachers who will use service learning to help their students achieve the objectives of the school curriculum. Some of the training sessions, such as reflection and defining service learning, may be useful for non-school-based programs as well. Most of the guide, however, is shaped by the belief that service learning is "good education." Service learning is as an experiential teaching strategy with an ultimate aim of promoting student understanding of established content, concepts, and skills. Intended to help teachers add service learning to their repertoire of instructional methods, the guide outlines 10 training sessions emphasizing curricular relevance, cognitive reflection, and experiential pedagogy. Following a brief introduction, the 10 sessions are entitled: (1) "Defining Service Learning"; (2) "Curriculum Infusion"; (3) "Reflection"; (4) "Experiential Education and Active Learning"; (5) "Student Involvement"; (6) "Community Involvement"; (7) "Assessment"; (8) "Citizenship Competencies and Service Learning"; (9) "Policy"; and (10) "Project Evaluation." Planning sheets also are provided. The guide models active learning strategies throughout each session. The design encourages teachers to talk among themselves in various group settings, to develop assessment criteria, to trade ideas and experiences, and to use new information in concrete ways. (Each session contains references.) (BT)

This article highlights a series of parenting education workshops that were incorporated into a parent-child relationships course, utilizing a developmental assets framework. Student reflections and parent evaluations are used to consider the extent to which the service-learning activity enabled students to apply course content to real-world experiences, view themselves as emerging professionals, and have a positive impact on the community. Implications for continuing or replicating similar service learning experiences are included.

Service learning resides at the crossroads of youth development and community improvement as it focuses equally on student growth and community problem solving. It steers real-world education toward projects that promote the public good. Service learning, as a teaching strategy, motivates students by taking them beyond the classroom to address community problems that they care about. It is particularly useful for career and technical education teachers, who are already using real-world experience to enliven coursework.

AB  - This essay takes up a re-evaluation of the ossified view of food events that have circulated in the canonical texts of multicultural education. While agreeing with the critique by progressive multiculturalists against a 'touristic' approach to diversity, the author argues that such a conception of food-centered events in schools has obscured how such activities can foster multi-ethnic and multicultural community building. By looking at popular discourses such as newspapers which describe school gardens in particular, the author identifies how school-community partnerships centered on food are developing in multi-ethnic contexts to promote progressive ideals such as volunteerism, civic engagement and environmental awareness.

AB  - A vast number of documented and undocumented foreigners arrive in the United States every year. Many enter the school system unable to comprehend academics because they cannot readily comprehend English due to their language barrier. Assistance for English language learners (ELL) is mandated by Federal law for K-12 students. Finding ways to provide assistance to such large population becomes a major challenge. The qualitative, exploratory case study investigated one possible program at an at-risk school where 15 parents and their 3 rd, 4th, and 5th grade students participated in planned activities once per week for 12 weeks with the goal of improving the comprehension of English in a manner that both parents and students can more freely participate in the academic environment. The study sought to ascertain whether or not after completion: (a) participants' English speaking skills and comprehension improved and (b) they felt more comfortable about their participation in an academic setting. Data for the study were collected using constructed protocols for pre and post interviews, observations, and field questionnaires. Analysis of data identified improvement patterns and conjoined themes that indicated a rise in comfortability levels. The results from this project study can be used to train new teachers during orientation and refresh veteran teachers during professional development classes on how to handle ethnic diversity and cultural tolerance. The implication for positive social change is: (a) the closing of the achievement gap between ELL students and their native English speaking peers, (b) more comfortable interactions between ELL parents and school personnel, and (c) the creation of a blueprint for future culture and diversity trainings.

AB  - This study examined the effectiveness of the Men of Ross Elementary (MORE), a mentoring program, in improving the reading achievement of African American males. The sample for the study consisted of 61 third through fifth grade African American male students from an urban school in Memphis, Tennessee. The goal and mission of the program was to motivate and reinforce learning expectations by providing mentoring and extra-curricular activities for the students in the program. The participants were allowed to participate on the step team, go on various field trips, and act as ambassadors for the school when community people visited. The participants participated in service learning projects, and they stayed after-school twice a month to participate in various activities. The participants in the MORE Program were exposed to the school's and district's curriculum. In addition, the participants were required to maintain a C average, to accumulate at least 25 Accelerated Reader (AR) points by the semester end, and to behave appropriately before, during, and after school. They met with an assigned mentor every three weeks to assess learning expectations. The mentors consisted of male staff and male parents. The participants were administered the pre and post Scott Foresman Reading Assessment and the STAR Reading Assessment, which is a computerized norm-referenced test of reading skills. Both assessments measured the students' reading levels and ZPD (Zone of Proximal Development). The results of the study indicated that the MORE Program did not have a significant impact on students' reading achievement. Descriptive statistics and an ANOVA were used to analyze data.

AB  - Management Information Systems (MIS) departments are tasked with preparing students to successfully work for organizations in information technology (IT) related jobs. Accordingly, MIS departments develop a curriculum that provides both technical depth and business acumen. Typically, the business core provides the business acumen and the department’s curriculum provides technical depth. The courses that contribute to this technical depth include domains of programming, networking, database, systems analysis and design plus additional domains as electives. Each course is taught as a stand-alone course, and integration across courses is minimal. The problem with this approach is that the different areas in MIS are tightly related. The authors propose and take an innovative, holistic approach to integration. Three faculty members teaching the systems analysis and design (SAD), the database management (DB), and the capstone database and development (CAP) courses integrated their courses using a common service learning project. Overall, project integration resulted in improved academic performance across the three courses. It is concluded that this approach to integration will work across many disciplines and can be accomplished with various combinations of courses.

AB  - Background: Although past studies of service-learning focus on assessing student growth, few studies address how to support students in applying theory to their service-learning experiences. Yet, the task of applying theory is a central component of critical reflections within the social sciences in higher education and often causes anxiety among undergraduate students. Purpose: This article identifies a pedagogical model that helps students navigate the selection and application of theory to their service-learning experiences. Methodology/Approach: The pedagogical model is based on a case study of an upper-division anthropology service-learning course, which included survey and interview data to assess the model's effectiveness. Findings/Conclusions: The findings indicate that a familiar framing analogy, combined with a specific set of scaffolded in-class activities that takes into consideration Perry's scheme of learning, is useful for bridging the gap between understanding theory and selecting and applying a particular theory to service-learning projects. Such an approach helped relieve student anxiety and confusion surrounding theory application and service-learning. Implications: To grow as scholars, students must be able to match theory to real-world situations on their own. By combining a framing analogy with scaffolded activities, instructors can help students transition from memorizing theories to applying them to their service-learning.

AB  - This paper reports first-year findings of a study that identified school-based-learning activities in Louisiana. The paper also describes experimental projects in operation and provides a curriculum framework for schools interested in initiating a service-learning project. Data were obtained from a survey of all school principals in 8 Louisiana parishes and 55 superintendents. A total of 248 surveys were mailed with 140 being returned for a response rate of 56.5%. Findings indicate that except for those programs funded by subgrants, there are currently not many true curricula school-based service-learning (CSBSL) programs in the state. CSBSL is any integration of curricula content and service to the community, through which course objectives are achieved simultaneously with true benefit being provided to one or more segments of the community. Guidelines for developing a CSBSL program are presented: (1) select a topic or theme; (2) select objectives in collaboration with the community; (3) plan activities based on student input; (4) establish time lines with regard to community and classroom considerations; (5) conduct activities; and (6) evaluate the program by eliciting responses from teachers, students, and the service receiver. Hypothetical uses of service-based learning in an elementary, middle, and high school are included. One figure illustrating the guideline model is included. Contains 19 references. (LMI)

AB  - Service-learning involvement can be a useful adjunct to a traditional educational experience and can provide clinical exposure in mental health practice settings for undergraduate nursing students. Education and practice collaboratives in community settings benefit community partners through the service provided by students to the respective community organizations. Benefits to students are obvious through greater exposure to community agencies, avenues to meet academic clinical course objectives, and incentives for their critical and independent thinking. An overview of the process of engaging students in community engagement opportunities that provide clinical hours in an undergraduate mental health course is presented.

AB  - As long as there have been internships or experiential learning, there have been problems. While internships provide an excellent opportunity for students to work in their chosen field under professional supervision, they also expose students to the potential problems that all workers may experience. These include not being perceived as "professional," being give too much or too little meaningful work, or becoming the objects of discrimination or harassment. This paper uses survey data & professional experience to examine the problems & pitfalls of the internship experience & offers suggestions for dealing with these situations.

AB  - It is imperative that school administrators continue to develop and maintain strong family and consumer science (FCS) programs in their secondary schools across the nation. Today's youth and their families need the knowledge, experiences, and skills gained in these family-focused programs. FCS teachers provide necessary interpersonal, occupational, and leadership opportunities. With increasing federal and state educational mandates, accompanied by trends of decreasing funds from these governmental sources, school administrators have been forced to make difficult decisions regarding cuts in programs. How can teachers, supervisors, and administrators evaluate the quality of programs? As resources have decreased, elective courses have been cut and some FCS programs have seen reductions in course offerings and staff. Administrators must justify their decisions to the school board and taxpayers in the community. Some of the common questions administrators must answer include: 1) Is the content current and relevant? 2) Does this program serve a wide variety of students? 3) Is service learning evident and are there opportunities for leadership development? 4) What are the student-teacher interactions? 5) How is information shared with administrators? By asking questions such as these. The answers allow administrators to identify strong, family-focused, relevant, integrative programs that are vital in meeting the needs of today's youth.

AB  - Adult language learners have specific learning goals that reflect their lives within a global society, and adults negotiate multiple and changing identities throughout their personal, academic, and professional lives. Chapters in "Authenticity in the Language Classroom and Beyond: Adult Learners" highlight how teachers have the ability to transform language instruction from a mechanical learning experience to a dynamic interaction to assist learners in reaching real-world goals. Rather than focus only on native-speaker norms of language production, English language instruction can provide adult learners with opportunities to create and act on their own texts, engage meaningfully with audiences, and develop interactions that mirror their purpose for learning. The chapters in this volume demonstrate how language teaching practices engage learners in authentic experiences, using and producing texts to meet international and localized communication needs. All the chapters in this volume demonstrate that authenticity is more than just the materials we use. Authenticity also means using language for real purposes. It means engaging students in collaborative learning, involving discussions, negotiations, and decision making. Authenticity is creating real uses for English, not just modeling native-speaker language and culture. With English increasingly being used as a lingua franca to connect second language speakers, authenticity takes on new meanings as we seek to develop learners who can face the challenge of communicating effectively in an increasingly globalized world. This book contains 22 chapters. Chapters include: (1) Introduction: Authenticity, Creativity, and Localization in Language Learning (Sarah Rilling and Maria Dantas-Whitney); (2) Where Can I Get My Shoe Fixed? Authentic Tasks for Students in EFL Settings (Jan Edwards Dormer); (3) Sharing Our Culture With Visitors: English for Tour Guides (Janet M. D.

AB  - The healthcare system is facing enormous challenges due to increasing diversity of the patient population and a decline in the traditional physician values of altruism and compassion. As a result, schools of medicine have been challenged to preparing future physicians to attend these realities by integrating cultural competence and leadership training into the curriculum. Service learning represents a viable educational approach to enhance cultural competencies and servant leadership skills. Linking these concepts through an experiential activity offers a pedagogic solution for medical educators while reinforcing the underlying elements of medical professionalism. The current study examined the effect of participation in a service learning experience on medical students' cultural competence and servant leadership behaviors. The study also sought to determine if gender, ethnicity, and medical specialty influenced students' cultural competence and servant leadership behaviors. Data from the Inventory for Assessing the Process of Cultural Competence Among Healthcare Professionals-Student Version (IAPCC-SV®) and Servant Leadership Questionnaire (SLQ) were collected from 101 fourth-year medical students who took part in a required service learning experience. The findings indicated that participation in service learning had a positive effect on medical students' cultural competence and servant leadership behaviors. Results also showed that respondent's ethnicity had a moderating effect on cultural competence scores, while servant leadership scores were influenced by participants' medical specialty. Furthermore, the results revealed a positive correlation between cultural competence and servant leadership. The findings support service learning as an effective strategy for developing students' altruism, compassion and commitment to serve the diverse populations they will encounter during clinical practice.

AB  - This qualitative study examines how service-learning pedagogy can facilitate graduate students' learning of assessment. Interviews with 14 students enrolled in a student affairs graduate program suggest that (a) direct application of content knowledge through a service-learning course enhanced students' learning of assessment, (b) exposing students to the utility of their assessment findings deepened students' understanding of the value of assessment in student affairs, and (c) students shifted their focus from grades to conducting a rigorous assessment study as they experienced the value others placed on their service.

AB  - Purpose: The current investigation assessed the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of the Cooking Up Health (CUH) culinary medicine elective that was offered to medical students at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine. The elective included a combination of didactics, plant-based culinary sessions, and service learning, in which students translated nutrition and health connections to elementary school children in at-risk communities. Method: Nine medical students enrolled in cohort 1 and 12 in cohort 2. Students completed assessments before and after the course measuring confidence in nutrition and obesity counseling, attitudes toward nutrition counseling, personal dietary intake, and cooking confidence and behaviors. Results: The elective showed high feasibility and acceptability with strong class attendance (96%–99%) and retention (89%–100%). Over the course of the elective, students across both cohorts showed increased confidence in nutrition and obesity counseling (ps < 0.001), cooking abilities (ps < 0.01), and food preparation practices (ps < 0.04). Cohort 1 reported decreased meat consumption (p = 0.045), and cohort 2 showed increased fruit and vegetable intake (p = 0.04). Finally, cohort 2 showed increased knowledge and confidence regarding consuming a plant-based diet (ps < 0.002). Students reported an increased appreciation for the role of nutrition in health promotion and disease prevention and an intention to incorporate nutrition into patient care. Conclusion: This study provided preliminary evidence demonstrating feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of the CUH culinary medicine elective for increasing medical students' confidence in nutrition and obesity counseling of patients and in their ability to use nutrition and cooking for personal self-care. Ultimately, this program of research may provide evidence to support widespread integration of CUH into medical education and has the potential to prepare medical students to properly advise patients on nutrition to combat the rising rates of obesity, diabetes, and preventable diseases related to nutrition.

AB  - Although service learning was established as a method for combining relevant student learning opportunities with community engagement, recent critiques highlight the shift from achieving community-defined goals towards a predominate focus on assessing student learning. Focusing on a community's decision-making process regarding a homeless shelter, this article describes a cross-curricular project that combines critical service learning with participatory action research. Using community and participant defined goals and interactions to steer the research process enabled achievement of both student learning and attempts at community transformation.

AB  - Two courses in the field of child and family development are used to exemplify the impact of community-based service-learning on student outcomes. The courses, Developmental Dysfunction and Divorce and Remarriage, are structurally described from course conception to evaluation following five processes: establishing partnership, crafting service goals, instituting students' support mechanisms, designing an integrative curriculum, and creating assessment measures. Students' outcomes were presented using grade average comparison, students' testimony, and reflections. Students who participated in a community-based service-learning course scored higher than students in other classes. They also indicated gains in knowledge, interpersonal skills, civic responsibility, caring, and career and personal growth. Community partners outcomes were assessed based on attrition rate, partners' recruitment of others, continued interest, and written feedback.

AB  - This thesis examines the combining of pedagogy in an after school maritime setting utilizing adventure-based education and experiential learning activities. It presents the relevancy of constructivist learning theory, intergenerational knowledge, culture, and traditional education in forming an effective program of youth development and character education. The author proposes a curriculum that is a model of use of the aforementioned theories in an effort to offer a more holistic and balanced approach to learning and development in youth. Lastly, the author proposes that maritime culture and its associated skills training (boat building apprenticeships, marine stewardship, deck hand and expedition skills) has the distinct advantage of containing inherent adventure-based activities. These activities replicate Kurt Hahn's "antidotes for the decline of modern youth" (Hahn, 1947, p.30) by engaging youth to strive through adventure to confront all physical, emotional and mental challenges that they encounter.

AB  - The primary goals of my study were: 1) to provide an understanding of the processes through which the socio-cultural tools provided by Catholic high-school service-learning pedagogy, mediate moral action. 2) to explore the experiences of Catholic service-learner exemplars and the processes, tools, language and symbols used to describe their experiences and subsequent moral action, and 3) to seek the possible connections between moral action and religious identity as it develops within a particular socio-cultural context. This study is qualitative and uses a multiple-case study design. I choose this methodology as it provides rich descriptions and deeply explores the phenomenon of continued moral action of young adults after participation in Catholic high school service-learning. The findings of my study determined that Catholic high school service-learning programs are a means for forming young persons who are not only committed to service, but are committed to living their faith in a way that is consistent with their moral identity. Furthermore, these young people demonstrate a distinctly Catholic moral identity that is consistent with the Catholic socio-cultural context of their high school programs. Implications for practice are presented.

AB  - Service learning is a well-recognized form of experiential learning and 21st century pedagogy that connects classroom knowledge and skills with real world experience. While research has provided plenty of evidence that service learning has multiple benefits for students, there is very little empirical research on well-established high-quality service-learning projects. Through the lens of experiential learning theory, this single case study explored how high school students participating in a high-quality service-learning project were affected by their lived experience, determining what specific elements and activities provided the most benefit and meaning for them. Common themes associated with students' high-quality experience included increased student involvement and interaction with peers and community, gaining a sense of teamwork/cooperation/collaboration, feeling of greater community awareness and involvement, a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction and a feeling of making a difference in their community. Additionally, this research identified partnerships, diversity and mutual respect, strong youth voice and curriculum connections as the most important essential elements for quality practice, and student involvement and role as the most important meaningful and satisfying components of their experience. These findings can help add to the gap in empirical research of what constitutes high-quality service-learning programming and can also provide valuable practice information for educators so that they can design and implement more effective and quality service-learning projects that ultimately lead to greater student outcomes.

AB  - Leaders of health professional schools often support community-based education as a means of promoting emerging practitioners’ awareness of health disparities and commitment to serving the poor. Yet, most programs do not teach about the causes of health disparities, raising questions regarding what social and political lessons students learn from these experiences. This article examines the ways in which community-based clinical education programs help shape the subjectivities of new dentists as ethical clinician-citizens within the US commodified health care system. Drawing on ethnographic research during volunteer and required community-based programs and interviews with participants, I demonstrate three implicit logics that students learned: (1) dialectical ideologies of volunteer entitlement and recipient debt; (2) forms of justification for the often inferior care provided to 'failed' consumers (patients with Medicaid or uninsured); and (3) specific forms of obligations characterizing the ethical clinician-citizen. I explore the ways these messages reflected the structured relations of both student encounters and the overarching health care system, and examine the strategies faculty supervisors undertook to challenge these messages and relations. Finally, I argue that promoting commitments to social justice in health care should not rely on cultivating altruism, but should instead be pursued through educating new practitioners about the lives of poor people, the causal relationships between poverty and poor health, and attention to the structure of health care and provider–patient interactions. This approach involves shining a critical light on America’s commodified health care system as an arena based in relations of power and inequality.

AB  - Service-learning programs can be funded in several basic ways. Ideally, funds are a line item in the school or district budget, reflecting the fact that service-learning is a part of the mainstream educational delivery system. Many districts choose to fund service-learning as a strategy to accomplish curricular goals, so no additional sources of funding are needed.

AB  - Educators often strive to set high academic standards for their students to achieve and improve upon as they progress through each grade level. Along the educational journey, some educators will also have the objective to improve the moral character and psychological development of their students. Schools today are experiencing the increasing need to incorporate character education into their curriculum as comparable to high academic standards. Within this research study I used a case study methodology to investigate best practices, curriculum, programs, and activities that impact a school’s character education program. I collected data through interviews and document analysis among teachers, administrators, a character education facilitator, and an expert in character research. I then coded and analyzed the data for themes, subthemes, and other topics concerning character education. I examined the participants’ views and insights to initiate, execute, and maintain a character education program. The positive impact of a character education curriculum was evident from the comments of the participants. Leadership, student voice, service learning, and professional development were valued components of a quality character program. The participants also stressed the importance of building relationships with students and allowing them to have a voice in the character education program. Results further indicated that assessment procedures, stakeholders understanding the importance of improving the climate and culture of the school, and input from all school and community stakeholders were required for the character program to flourish. Establishing a character education program can be a valuable asset for today’s schools as it promotes the moral development of students and provides the skills that are helpful in being a productive member of society.

AB  - We tracked resource and service utilizations and first-year college outcomes for the entering first-year class ( n = 1,534) at a traditional 4-year postsecondary institution. We grouped specific resources and services offered by the institution into four general categories (academic services, social resources, recreational resources, and advising sessions). We investigated the interrelation of risk, resource and service utilization, and first-year GPA and retention. We found that utilization of each resource/service category was positively associated with GPA and/or retention. Of particular interest, we tested whether the associations of resource and service utilization and outcomes were moderated by risk. We found that the associations of academic services and advising sessions with GPA were more pronounced for higher-risk students. We discuss the implications of the findings, including how the differential associations of resource and service utilizations and outcomes can affect intervention decisions with high-risk students.

AB  - This article describes how the service-learning project is conducted in an upper-level medical sociology class. The service-learning project provides a learning context for teaching important core concepts in sociology. In the course of researching and designing a pit latrine, students learned about the relationship between socio-economic class and access to public information and assistance. The service-learning experience drew discussions about group processes and network theory as students attacked the problem of planning and pricing a privy. They had to focus on and deal with the dynamics of group decision making. Students rediscovered the rich resources of their own extended family networks: telephone calls to relatives yielded helpful, practical advice and encouragement. Finally, the process of constructing a pit latrine became a learning opportunity. Students discussed the gendering of labor, including mixed gender group expectations about who should perform what types of roles in a work-group setting. Similar social concepts and processes could easily be explored through service-learning projects in other courses besides medical sociology.

AB  - As educators seek methods of instruction that assist in helping to make learning relevant for agricultural education students, service-learning has risen as a desirable technique for meeting prescribed educational objectives. A gap in the agricultural education literature exists, however, in terms of describing whether these learning experiences intrinsically motivate students. As such, this investigation was designed to describe FFA member's level of intrinsic motivation towards service-learning through participation in the 2013 National FFA Days of Service. Deci and Ryan's Self-Determination Theory (SDT) served as the theoretical base for testing FFA members intrinsic motivation through three empirically based constructs−interest, value, and perceived choice. Results from the study found that FFA members did have an interest and valued their service-learning experience; however, they exhibited varied views in terms of their choice to participate. The findings illuminated a congruency when the tenets of service-learning were amalgamated with the axioms of SDT. Therefore, the researcher presented the Intrinsic Service Learning Model in hopes of assisting practitioners of the pedagogy with delivering an intrinsically motivated service-learning experience for students.

AB  - American education's journey has witnessed the rise and fall of various progressive education approaches, including service-learning. In many respects, however, service-learning is still undergoing formation and adoption as a teaching method, specifically in School-Based, Agricultural Education (SBAE). For this reason, the interest existed to understand service-learning's origins and its evolution as a method of instruction. As such, this historical study sought to describe the events and philosophical underpinnings presaging service-learning's emergence as a method of instruction, and how this approach to learning has been incentivized and used in SBAE. Findings and implications from the study revealed that service-learning's deep philosophical roots can be traced to great thinkers, including Aristotle, Plato, Rousseau, Kant, and Dewey. Moreover, the researchers suggest the core principals of service-learning align with delivering SBAE's three-circle model in effective and powerful ways. Moving forward, scholars and practitioners of SBAE should ask themselves, "Is service-learning the teaching method of choice for conflating the components of SBAE's three-circle model such that the whole really is greater than the sum of its parts?"

AB  - As agricultural educators continue to seek methods of instruction to make learning impactful for students, service-learning has emerged as a desirable technique for meeting these educational objectives. A gap in the agricultural education literature exists, however, in terms of describing whether these learning experiences motivate students intrinsically. This investigation sought to describe FFA members' level of intrinsic motivation resulting from participation in a service-learning activity, specifically the 2013 National FFA Days of Service. Deci and Ryan's Self-Determination Theory (SDT) served as the theoretical base for understanding FFA members intrinsic motivation through three empirically based constructs--interest, value, and perceived choice. Results from the study indicate FFA members were interested in and valued their service-learning experience; however, they had varied views in terms of their choice to participate. Findings also indicate a congruency between tenets of service-learning and axioms of SDT. We, therefore, offer the Intrinsic Service Learning Model in hopes of assisting practitioners of this pedagogical technique with delivering an intrinsically motivated service-learning experience for agricultural education students.

AB  - Service-learning's (SL) discourse is written as a story of victory, achievement, and transformation in school-based, agricultural education (SBAE). The resources dedicated to improving both learning and communities through SL can be significant. Little work, however, has been put forth to examine this victory narrative's underlying assumptions and implications. Therefore, the purpose of this historical investigation was to explore how SL was imaged in The Agricultural Education Magazine (The Magazine) from 1929 to 2009. Through the analysis of data, SL's imaging in The Magazine appears to have been positioned through three distinct lenses: (a) societal, (b) pedagogical, and (c) social justice. In societally imaged SL, actors emphasized the importance of shaping young adolescents into productive citizens to meet the demands of their society. Meanwhile, the pedagogical lens emerged in response to calls for improved instructional effectiveness; as a consequence, practitioners and scholars outlined how SL could be used to enhance students' academic achievement. The final lens, social justice, arose as a way to address equity, race, and privilege in agricultural education. Based on these conclusions, we offer implications and recommendations that may help reframe SL to respond to contemporary issues and trends in SBAE.

AB  - Outdoor Education (OE) and Experiential Education (EE) programs are becoming increasingly popular in Victorian schools. This article is derived from findings that emerged through the interpretation of case study data gathered for my doctoral thesis of a three-phased, non-residential, EE program. This interpretation process highlighted five themes, one of which involved the notion of relationships. Phase one of the program involved expeditionary learning bushwalking trips. Phase two included urban learning trips to the Melbourne CBD, while the final phase focused on a two week service learning camp to a regional centre and three more service days in locations in the community near the school. Interpretation of the data pointed to respondents reporting improved relationships with their fellow students, their teachers, both within the program and with teachers later in their schooling, and their own learning. The data was gathered in a case study method and the study itself lies within the interpretive paradigm.

These data along with a Deweyan framework informed the creation of a service-learning class called Journalism for Racial Justice: Amplifying Voices in Local Communities aimed at better aligning the journalism profession with more inclusive democracy. Students explored how their privileges affected reporting, redefined roles of source as relational in collaborative work, and worked to build trust with wary citizens to knit communities together in conversation. It promotes a relational journalism, positioning reporters as within community as opposed to apart.

This research supports many concepts that have been part of the concept of middle schools for over 50 years, including integrated curriculum and experience with the arts. Further brain-based recommendations for middle schools include service learning, social learning, teaching metacognitive skills, and teaching controversial topics.

AB  - Objectives. To evaluate the success of an elective course in Native American culture, health, and service-learning in fostering interest in experiences and careers with the USPHS Indian Health Service (IHS), and in shaping reflective practitioners. Design. Students conducted readings, kept reflective journals, and engaged in discussions with Native American and non-Native American speakers. Students orally presented a Native American health issue and spent their fall break in Chinle, Ariz, providing social and healthcare services to the Dine under the supervision of IHS pharmacists. Opportunities for additional IHS experiences were discussed, as was discerning the Creator's call to a ofessional life of service. Assessment. Thirteen of 15 students who had completed the service- learning course by January 2007 responded to a brief survey indicating that not only were the course objectives met, but the experiences had a lasting impact on professional mindset and career plans. Conclusion. The course had a lasting impact on students' understanding of Native American social and health care issues, and on how they will practice their profession and live their lives.

AB  - Objective. To encourage pharmacy students to elect education and practice opportunities in Native American communities, including careers with the Indian Health Service (IHS). Methods. Students in 2 elective courses were educated on various aspects of contemporary Native American life in urban and reservation environments, including cultural traditions, social and health-related challenges, health access disparities, and cultural approaches to health and wellness. The teachers were Native American leaders and healers primarily from Plains tribes, as well as non-Native American practitioners affiliated with IHS hospitals and tribal health facilities. Students kept reflective journals, and a subset spent 5 days immersed in a rural Navajo community where they lived and worked alongside IHS practitioners and Community Health Representatives. Results. Student engagement with IHS opportunities was tracked for 11 years. Of the 69 pharmacy students who completed the electives, 11 applied for a Junior Commissioned Officer Student Training and Externship Program (Jr. COSTEP) (8 accepted, 6 completed), 43 requested one or more IHS APPEs (43 accepted, 32 completed, 8 in progress), 17 applied for an IHS residency (1 pending, 8 accepted, 5 completed), and 5 became IHS Commissioned Corps officers. Five additional students accepted an IHS or tribal position, with 3 pursuing a USPHS commission. Conclusion. Since the first report on the impact of this elective experience was published, the course continues to meet its primary objective of promoting interest in IHS/tribal education experiences and pharmacy practice careers.

They outline a unit of study in which third grade students learn about notable agents of change. Young learners discover that they can be agents of change right in their own community through a service-learning project. The service-learning project was assessed by observing student participation and collaboration in developing and implementing the plan and by examining individual written reflection at the conclusion of the project. The authors present few of the lessons learned from implementing the unit, as spoken by teachers. (Contains 3 notes.)

AB  - Objectives: Current US healthcare delivery systems do not adequately address healthcare demands. Physicians are integral but rarely emphasize prevention as a primary tool to change health outcomes. Home visitation is an effective method for changing health outcomes in some populations. The Florida International University Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine Green Family Foundation NeighborhoodHELP service-learning program assigns medical students to be members of interprofessional teams that conduct household visits to determine their healthcare needs. Methods: We performed a prospective evaluation of 330 households randomly assigned to one of two groups: visitation from a student team (intervention group) or limited intervention (control group). The program design allowed randomly selected control households to replace intervention-group households that left the program of their own volition. All of the households were surveyed at baseline and after 1 year of participation in the study. Results: After 1 year in the program and after adjustment for confounders, intervention group households proved more likely (P <= 0.05) than control households to have undergone physical examinations, blood pressure monitoring, and cervical cytology screenings. Cholesterol screenings and mammograms were borderline significant (P = 0.05 and P = 0.06, respectively). Conclusions: This study supports the value of home visitation by interprofessional student teams as an effective way to increase the use of preventive health measures. The study underscores the important role interprofessional student teams may play in improving the health of US communities, while students concurrently learn about primary prevention and primary care.

AB  - Cultural diversity training in pharmacy education has evolved from standalone lectures to longitudinal courses, service-learning initiatives, rotation experiences and global health opportunities. Cultural competency frameworks have served as the scaffold for cultural diversity training, yet educators in other health care disciplines have called into question the utility of such frameworks and offered cultural humility as an alternative to foster development and lifelong learning. In order to implement and assess outcomes tied to cultural diversity successfully, this commentary discusses the five elements of culturally responsive teaching that will provide the tools necessary to integrate cultural humility across pharmacy curricula. In addition, we address how to approach faculty development to avoid common maladaptations in pedagogical movements and conclude with addressing the salient objectives to evaluate gains in student, institutional, and societal outcomes.

AB  - This article briefly describes how a fifth-grade class collaborated with a downtown diner for several months and then actually ran the restaurant for four hours. Through the Chatters Cafe, a local high school cafe that serves as a culinary arts training ground for high school students, fifth graders had the opportunity to prepare and serve dinner to their parents. They also had the opportunity to help tsunami victims by donating their earnings to the Red Cross Tsunami Relief Fund. The project worked its way into the curriculum in several ways and it provided a fun learning experience for fifth graders.

AB  - The profusion of human rights atrocities and purported incidents of genocide across the globe in recent decades has increasingly forced multiple and complicated issues associated with combating these violations onto the political agendas of world leaders and institutions. Scholars are united in recognizing the growing importance and need for critical instruction on the complex issues related to human rights and genocide studies to inspire high school students toward a global, democratic citizenship for the 21st century. Therefore, how do educators and student programs prepare students to critically examine these complex questions in a way that encourages global citizenship? This study, conducted during a two-week intensive summer institute on human rights and genocide studies in western New York state, assessed the ability of a human rights and genocide educational institute to foster higher levels of self-efficacy among the participating students and their ability to be "upstanders," rather than bystanders in their daily lives. We argue that the students felt empowered to pursue their short- and long-term goals regarding becoming human rights upstanders through the role models in their lives who influenced them to come to the Institute and the various experiences they had during the Institute's workshops and field trips.

AB  - Work-based learning (WBL) is a key example of the integration of academic and occupational training that is central to career and technical education (CTE) and through which students have the ability to gain high-wage, high-skilled occupational experience while pursuing postsecondary credentials (Bragg, Dresser, & Smith, 2012; Chernus & Fowler 2010; Holzer & Lerman, 2014; Rayborn, 2015). Evidence suggests WBL has notable benefits for students, specifically students of color (Lerman, 2010). WBL reinforces the relevancy and authenticity of the learning experiences for students, engaging learners who prefer applied learning environments (Lerman, 2010). Moreover, WBL has been found to increase students' persistence, graduation, and employment rates, with notable gains for students from underserved racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic backgrounds (Holzer & Lerman, 2014; Kuh, 2008; Lerman, 2010; National Survey of Student Engagement, 2007). This brief provides an overview of WBL, including a broad definition of WBL in postsecondary education settings, the benefits of WBL, and key elements for implementing high-impact, high-quality WBL programs.

AB  - Service learning is an effective academic technique that emphasizes integration of course instruction with outside community service and allows for a more enriched learning experience by promoting critical reflection. With medical students encountering a growing diversity in patients, service learning is essential in linking academic learning with their community experiences. This study was conducted at a local medical school using service learning programs in underserved communities. The purpose of this study was to understand the experience medical students had in a service learning program involved in some underserved communities. This study implemented a phenomenological research design in which semi-structured interviews were used to collect data. Spradley’s Developmental Research Sequence implemented both domain and taxonomic analysis. This study revealed that medical students were able to gain skills in leadership, clinical practice, compassion, and a greater understanding of the social realities of the underserved. Community service, serving communities, student learning and institutional support emerged as themes that contributed to student transformation. The potential of this study would provide insights that may help other medical school service learning programs contribute to developing a sense of lifelong civic engagement.

AB  - In an effort to address the gaps in preparing teacher candidates (TCs) to work with English Language Learners (ELLs), service-learning experiences (SLE) were integrated into two courses within a teacher education program. This exploratory case study sought to explore the outcomes of teacher candidates (TCs) engaged in SLE with diverse students and families, particularly ELLs. Content analysis of students' reflections provided insights of the impact of the SLE. Findings indicate that participating in service-learning with ELLs provides opportunities for TCs to engage in positive interactions that help to address misconceptions about students, families, and communities. TCs also began to confront their fears of working with ELLs and develop relationship-building skills and initial strategies for teaching ELLs.

AB  - Community-based organizations have long benefited from people's generosity and commitment to community. They engage volunteers to meet important human and community needs, or to address critical social issues. Sometimes they provide the service experience for school-based service-learning programs. At the same time, community-based organizations have a lot to gain by using service-learning principles and practices as a core part of their own programming. This guide provides the tips, tools, and techniques necessary to start making a positive difference in many peoples' lives by providing high-quality opportunities for youth to serve and learn. First, the guide introduces the concept of service-learning and how and why it is useful and appropriate in community-based organizations. The whole guide is built on what is known about quality service-learning, based on a major consensus-building process in the field in 2008 (Billig & Weah, 2008). These quality standards are introduced at the beginning of the guide. They are then used throughout as touchpoints for reflecting on the quality and impact of programs through all phases of the service-learning process. Each phase of the process includes a checklist for how each of the standards can be applied to that aspect of service-learning. The guide ends with a collection of available references and resources. In addition, web links to additional references and tools when they are available have been included. (Contains 34 footnotes and a list of 26 references and resources.)

The author says that between school, dance classes, rehearsals and performances, one could probably have little spare time to fundraise for their own dance group, let alone raise money for others. Charity work provides a balance between community service and studio-centered activities such as competition and recital. The first step is to decide what charity one would like to support. The author suggests to form a general opinion on what they want to shop and then do that for a good cause. INSETS: Checkbook Checklist;Fund Alternatives;Where to Give.

AB  - A model is proposed followed by a case study of collaborative project work between student teachers, teachers and English language learners in kindergarten and grade 1. As a model, service learning provides a framework for making explicit linkages between course-based, credit bearing academic content, the identified need of the community school, and the exigencies of preparation for engaging young English language learners in literacy rich instruction and conversation. An array of learning artifacts provides evidence of the impact of service learning on the quality of learning experiences for all participants. (Contains 6 figures.)

AB  - Historically, the mission of Black Studies has been two-fold: scholarship and service. Both the pioneering students and the faculty of Black Studies called for the discipline to produce socially responsible scholar-activists, and studies have proven that the most proficient method of ingraining social responsibility is through service-learning. Therefore, Black Studies must require service-learning in its curriculums. It is argued that Black Studies should also require these service-learning elements because of their long legacy in Black education in general and Black Studies in particular. However, required service-learning courses are rare in departments and programs, a study conducted by the author shows. In order to increase the number of Black Studies units with service-learning elements, this article concludes with a service-learning proposal that programs and departments could use to institute a required service-learning component into their curriculums.

Both the pioneering students and the faculty of Black Studies called for the discipline to produce socially responsible scholar-activists, and studies have proven that the most proficient method of ingraining social responsibility is through service-learning. Therefore, Black Studies must require service-learning in its curriculums. It is argued that Black Studies should also require these service-learning elements because of their long legacy in Black education in general and Black Studies in particular. However, required service-learning courses are rare in departments and programs, a study conducted by the author shows. In order to increase the number of Black Studies units with service-learning elements, this article concludes with a service-learning proposal that programs and departments could use to institute a required service-learning component into their curriculums.

AB  - Although studies conducted on baccalaureate in science nursing (BSN) students indicated that service-learning positively influences transcultural self-efficacy (TSE), there are a dearth of studies on associate of science in nursing (ASN) students in this area. The purpose of this study was to determine (a) if there was a significant increase in the self-reported TSE of ASN students from the time prior to and after exposure to an ASN program requiring service-learning activities, and (b) the extent to which self-reported TSE among ASN students was associated with selected demographics. A convenience sample of 55 third-semester ASN students enrolled in a community health nursing course at a Southeastern United States nursing program participated in the study. A quasi-experimental, one group pre-test post-test survey methodology was utilized. Findings revealed participants' perceptions of TSE significantly increased from pre-test to post-test on all four scales (cognitive, practical, affective, and total score) using Jeffreys (2006) Transcultural Self-Efficacy Test (TSET). The findings concluded that participants who reported yes to being born outside the United States had a significant association with the pre-test cognitive and practical subscale and total score. In addition, participants who reported English was not their primary language had a significant association with the pre-test cognitive and practical subscale and the TSET total score. The Cultural Competence and Confident (CCC) model served as the theoretical framework. As culturally diverse populations within our society continue to evolve, the need to prepare nursing students to provide culturally competent care is a major concern. Insights from this study will help nurse educators in developing and implementing service-learning activities in ASN programs, providing a foundation for cultural competency evolvement.

AB  - In academic settings, community research, and the service that goes along with it, is often not valued as much as other methods of research. The more qualitative and labor intensive nature of applied research often raises concerns about whether pre-tenured faculty can publish the sufficient quantity and quality of work necessary to achieve tenure. This paper describes successful collaborations through a university-based Community Partnership Center with members of community-based organizations in low-income inner-city neighborhoods, social work students, and faculty. Two case examples illustrate the co-authors' involvement with the Center as pre-tenured faculty. The article outlines the challenges and benefits of involvement with an established center for university-community partner- ships. With careful planning and coordination, such centers can be excellent vehicles through which to achieve important mutual benefits for community-based organizations, student learning, and faculty responsibilities in research, teaching and service.

AB  - The author explored the impact of a guide for journal writing on students who travel. Using pilgrimage theology he created a series of prompts and accompanying quotations from the Bible and ancient and contemporary pilgrims to spur attentiveness and feed reflection on sacramental faith in every part of a traveler's story. The guide was tested in both cocurricular and curricular service learning. In subsequent assessment students and faculty affirmed journal writing with the guide for broadening attentiveness, evoking more substantive and personal reflection, and supporting faithful integration ofthe experience, especially the narration ofliminality and sacramental encounters.

AB  - Ideally, the "educational experience" should have two component parts: Education and Experience. Some of the experiences that complement education and from which students learn are provided within the structure and confines of the classroom and laboratory. However, other experiences that can be equally educational and contribute to the intellectual and professional development of horticulture students happen outside of the formal classroom. For years, horticulture and plant science departments across the country have had clubs and teams that emphasize learning by seeing and doing. As the horticulture vocations and student body becomes more diverse, and the industries and sciences evolve, so too should these activities. The Teaching Methods Working Group will host a panel discussion on the use of co-curricular activities as part of the teaching-learning experience of 21st century higher education. Panelists will present and discuss topics including using teams and competitions to supplement classroom learning, studying abroad, service learning, and providing diverse activities for diverse purposes and students. Panelists will present information from their own institutional experience and knowledge base. The discussions will try to resolve questions of the validity and justification of credit and noncredit student activities in the academic environment, especially in times of tightening academic economies. Audience participation and discussion will be encouraged.

AB  - This article describes the third and, primarily, fourth years of a multi-year collaboration between the Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) Lab and the Plainfield, New Jersey schools, to build students' SEL skills to a school-wide level across multiple schools. The first three years were devoted to implementing an evidence-backed, classroom-based SEL curriculum, 'Talking with TJ.' Year 4 focused on expanding the SEL principles in the curriculum to complementary school building activities outside the classroom designed to help create a school-wide culture of SEL, complementing which is provided by a classroom-based SEL curriculum. The conceptual model guiding the program included principles from community/preventive psychology and the SEL movement; and the conceptual model guiding the evaluation was action research. As a result of a collaborative assessment of intervention needs outside the classroom, four concerns and the interventions to address them were identified: Discipline Difficulties/Positive Recognition Program; Lack of Student Empathy/Service Learning Opportunities; Inadequate Building Safety and Cohesiveness/Positive School Climate Initiatives; and Inadequate Student Services/Group Counseling. Within the scope and context of the one-year process described in the study, a formal, quantitative outcome study of this SEL initiative was not viewed as appropriate. Rather, what was viewed as of central importance was to assess, in the subsequent year, the extent of the school's commitment to the program and to the process of action research as a way of meeting ongoing school needs. The article concludes with a discussion of specific lessons learned. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This paper explores dynamics of students' critical consciousness development in the context of a thematically organized service-learning sociology course titled Health, Illness, and Community. The integrated components of the course were designed to cultivate critical consciousness by framing the study of health in terms of social justice issues that were demonstrable across three community partner organization sites. Analyses of writing assignments and qualitative interviews at the end of the semester reveal that student development of critical consciousness was demonstrated through analytic engagement with structural and systemic forces framing health inequities as well as reflexive consideration of the limited extent to which well-meaning efforts and intentions of individuals can significantly impact lasting social change. The combination of these two processes simultaneously cultivated students' ideological commitments to ongoing social justice work and subverted student self-efficacy with regard to the operationalization of those commitments.

AB  - The advantages of learning communities focused on analyzing social issues and educational repercussions in the field are presented in this study. The research examines the contribution of a learning community to enhancing student teachers' responsibility and their social involvement. The assumption was that participating in learning community would further implement student teachers' community social involvement while enhancing responsibility in their field of action. A questionnaire aimed to present the student teachers' attitudes involving all aspects of studying in the learning community and their social activity in the community was conducted. The findings pinpointed that there were positive contributions of the learning communities from a personal aspect such as developing self-learning, and learning about "me," as well as broaden their teaching skills, through methodology for teacher training, and developing reflective thought. These insights can also be implemented in various educational frameworks and during service learning as part of teacher training.

AB  - This review examines recent studies that have addressed outcomes of intergenerational service-learning courses in gerontology. The history of service-learning pedagogy in higher education and its place in today's colleges is also reviewed. Particular attention is given to evaluations of stakeholders: students, older adult participants, agencies and staff, faculty, community residents, colleges, and the community itself. The need for adopting research designs that permit clear conclusions and for utilizing assessments that have psychometrically sound foundations is important in future studies to permit unambiguous comparisons from study to study. The value of the pedagogy for students in particular has been documented over a number of years. Equally important is today's need to assess the impact of the pedagogy on the community.

AB  - The authors explore the challenges inherent in traversing the multiple boundaries between sociology and social work, and the academy and the community, by examining a service learning course on hunger and homelessness taught by two sociology professors and two social workers on the staff of a community service organization. The authors draw on instructional team meetings and correspondence, observation of class sessions, and formal and informal course evaluations to analyze three "moments": the planning process, a pivotal class session, and students' final presentations. They found that both their teaching and students' learning were enriched by disciplinary differences in knowledge claims, the design and utility of qualitative research, and the process of drawing conclusions from, and making arguments using, qualitative data. The authors conclude that experiential learning has value beyond providing students hands-on experiences. It can also provide a laboratory in which students and instructors can explore the similarities and differences between sociology, social work, and other disciplines.

AB  - Employing a grounded theory approach, the purpose of this study was to qualitatively examine the influence of service-learning (SL) on undergraduate kinesiology students' attitudes toward and experiences working with P-12 students with disabilities. Fourteen (9 female, 5 male) kinesiology students enrolled in an adapted physical education class participated in one of three focus group interviews regarding their experiences of working with P-12 students with disabilities. All interview data were analyzed following procedures outlined by Strauss and Corbin (1998). The following five themes represent the participants' experiences and attitudes toward P-12 students with disabilities after their involvement in a SL project: (a) initial reactions, (b) selection of P-12 students, (c) preconceived attitudes, (d) the benefits of SL, and (e) positive experience. All 14 of the participants who volunteered to share their experiences indicated that the SL experience positively affected their attitudes toward individuals with disabilities.

AB  - Service-learning is an educational practice that has been used successfully in many disciplines, and is defined as ‘a credit-bearing, educational experience in which students participate in an organized service activity that meets identified community needs and reflect on the service activity in such a way as to gain further understanding of course content, a broader appreciation of the discipline, and an enhanced sense of civic responsibility’ (Bringle, R. and Hatcher, J., A service-learning curriculum for faculty. Michigan J. Community Service-Learning , 1995, 2, 112–122). This research examines a first-year biological engineering design course that incorporated a service-learning project. Students participated in a survey and in focus groups to explore how well the service-learning project helped them to meet EC 2000 a–k objectives. Results showed that the service-learning project was a useful teaching method for accomplishing the learning objectives set forth by the instructor and by the Accreditation Board of Engineering and Technology. Women and non-white participants in this study generally assessed their learning outcomes to be greater than white males, which could have important implications in the recruitment and retention of such students in engineering.

AB  - Service-oriented e-learning platforms can be considered as a third generation of learning management systems (LMSs). As opposed to the previous generations, consisting of ad hoc solutions and traditional LMS, this new technology contemplates e-learning systems as services that can be integrated into different learning scenarios. This paper shows that the flexibility of these systems allows building personal learning environments and proposes the use of an extended technology acceptance model (TAM) to assess the acceptance and intention to use a third generation of LMS. To fit and validate the service-oriented e-learning platforms acceptance model, structural equation modeling and path analysis have been implemented. The results point out that the intention to use this third-generation LMS is determined by the gadgets and container design, both of which are structural elements of this technology. Finally, it is also shown that previous experience does not determine the use intention of this technology.

AB  - This article examines service learning in the Peace and Justice Studies Program at the University of San Francisco. The authors show that students who complete their two courses--Poverty, Homelessness, and the Urban Underclass as well as Field Experience--make significant contributions to the community service organizations they serve. Not only do their students learn, but the organizations benefit from the knowledge the students bring. Furthermore, through service learning, many of the students develop a long-term commitment to social justice and continue to work for social change years after leaving the university.

AB  - Rose and Wolfe (2000) demonstrated that decision aid design is critical to learning from decision aids, and aids that produce less cognitive load result in superior learning by aid users compared to aids that produce more cognitive load. The current research investigates whether a tax decision aid has differential affects on the knowledge acquisition of accounting students with varying perceived aptitudes for tax and interest in tax as a career. Results indicate that participants with more interest in and perceived aptitude for tax acquire more tax-related knowledge during manual task completion than participants with less perceived aptitude and interest. Similar to prior research, decision aids generally decrease learning relative to unaided environments. When decision aids do not produce a heavy cognitive load, however, participants with less perceived aptitude for and interest in tax learn as much in aided environments as they learn in unaided environments.

AB  - Community engagement curricula and course design can provide substantial experiences for both community members and participating students. Using a case study approach, this research focuses on four steps in this process: initial community relationship forming, engaging in community service, transitioning to civic engagement, and developing a community-based research program. Narrative examples from student course evaluations position these community-based experiences as transformative for multiple parties. Institutional structures are presented as helpful entrees to engagement for students, while noting that community relationships provide contextualized, powerful, and meaningful relationships, supporting recommendations for emerging and existing community engagement programs.

AB  - This article describes the current relationship between management education in Colombia and the efforts of the management program at Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana (UPB) in Medellin to reduce local poverty. The article uses the metaphor of "the bubble" to illustrate how social class, family socialization, and the current UPB management curriculum insulate management students from thinking about and interacting with the poor in Medellin. Based on the authors' experiences, five interventions are described that (a) integrate the issue of poverty more meaningfully throughout the management curriculum and (b) pierce this bubble within which UPB management expect to live their entire professional lives.

AB  - This study draws upon student evaluations across 3 years of service learning (SL) courses at a large, urban, faith-based university identifying issues of greatest concern to students. Analysis of qualitative responses revealed perspectives on the limits, pitfalls, and barriers to successful SL student work in the community replicated over the 3 year timeframe. Over 2,200 written responses were coded and tested for reliability for each of 3 years. The top three comments SL students were most likely to express included: (1) concern about their placement in the community, for example, that sites were not prepared or that further goal-setting, communication and training by the university was necessary; (2) that the university's choice of sites may have been ill considered; and, (3) that there were problems with time and scheduling. Ongoing assessment of students' perspectives on their placement experience identifies practices that can enhance their learning and contributions toward building stronger communities.

AB  - Background: This paper examines how professionalism is fostered to promote 'patient-centred care' in UK healthcare education and identifies challenges reported by educators. It reports a pilot study which introduced 'service-learning' into the dental and physiotherapy curricula as a strategy for promoting pertinent professional values and skills. Content: Undergraduate dental, and pre-registration postgraduate physiotherapy, students experienced service-learning via attendance at non-professional community placements, such as organising social events with homeless people, as part of their programme of study. Pre-placement preparation and post-placement debrief were offered. Evaluation data were obtained through focus groups, questionnaires, and interviews from students, placement providers and academic staff. Although the intervention was generally well received, important limitations emerged revealing new insights into difficulties with this type of learning for students, placement providers and institutions. Conclusion: Service-learning shows potential for enhancing capability to deliver patient-centre care. Lessons learnt from this project may usefully inform curriculum development in healthcare education and open up further avenues for research.

AB  - The proper role of charity and the right way to organize community service are controversial questions. While the arguments often cite tradition, few efforts have been undertaken that relate historical examples of charity to service learning. None systematically examine what high school students have been taught about charity in the past. Exploring how charitable activity has been portrayed in high school American history textbooks can help us understand what has been taught and may help account for our different concepts and attitudes. Beginning with a comparative analysis approach, this study examines stories about different kinds of charitable activity as they were presented to different generations of students. Textbook selection was based on documentation in previous studies and other evidence of their use, with attention to distribution by publication date (1930–1995), author and publisher. Using techniques from grounded theory, findings were linked to information about history, curriculum, charity and volunteering, and service learning. The result is a portrait of charitable activity as students and teachers encountered it, plus a sense of what accounts for it and what its significance has been. A common portrait of organized charitable activity emerged with textbooks of the late 1930s. With variations in detail, its basic outline has changed little. It includes six examples from Reconstruction through the Progressive Era, each of them identified with an individual. The story ends with the coming of the New Deal, and charity's failure to meet the challenges of the Depression. Differences occur from one textbook to another, but few reflect changed perceptions of charity. Instead, examples are called on to illustrate the inclusion of minorities and women, popular support for foreign policy and other themes. The literatures of historical study, education, and nonprofit studies all suggest factors that help account for textbook treatment of charity being limited. These include changes in the ways academic historians approach their craft, developments affecting the publication and adoption of textbooks, and the late emergence of charitable activity as an area of study. Broader social and intellectual factors also appear to contribute, and these warrant further attention.

AB  - Studies that explore issues around online learning have become increasingly common in the educational research literature of late. Most of these focus attention on programmed offerings on the Internet, usually modules or entire courses that are part of an educational institution's attempt to replicate in-person provision online. This thesis examines a very different breed of non-institutional electronic group that organises itself around supporting learners-the ad hoc, organic online learning community (OOLC). Three independent OOLCs made up of three very different groups of learners: US medical students, London cabbies-in-training (who call themselves Knowledge Boys and Girls), and distance learning law students, form the heart of this comparative case-study that seeks both to describe these groups that are created by, governed by, and intended for learners; and to interrogate the concept of learner-benefit. Findings from this study are presented in an unusual way; re-contextualised as part of four partly descriptive, partly interpretive OOLC portraits: one composite profile and three individual profiles that describe each of the individual case study groups. As part of the composite OOLC profile, eight code families and 39 sub-codes from the grounded-theory analysis are described. These together constitute a scheme for classifying interactions that take place in the asynchronous message boards of any and all of the three OOLCs. In addition, three macro-scale practices: Reflective Self Positioning (RSP), Affective Register Interaction, and Expertise Pooling that are difficult to identify using exclusively the asynchronous message postings are described. These practices help provide and understanding of what learners do, in a longer-term, diachronic sense, when they engage with their online communities.

AB  - Purpose: An e-portfolio is a useful tool to increase reflection and awareness in teachers and students. However, benefits of e-portfolio use are weakened by difficulties due to the lack of motivation, the heavy weight of creation and revision of the e-portfolios, the rigid tool structure. The paper aims to answer these emerging issues, showing how to cope with the above-mentioned questions, by proposing a structure for an e-portfolio able to fulfil the users' needs and to be perceived as an extremely usable and motivating tool. Design/methodology/approach: In the paper three types of e-portfolios are described. A brief survey of how the students used them with related data is provided. The research is based upon qualitative (students' posts) and quantitative (log tracement) data. Findings: After five years of experimentation and over 200 e-portfolios analysed, the paper describes lessons learned and suggests some guidelines that might be useful to plan the introduction and the implementation of an e-portfolio in post degree courses and for adult and in-service learning. Originality/value: In the paper some guidelines for designing formative portfolios are shown. These guidelines might be used to design and build feasible e-portfolios in different kinds of courses. The new perspective is about the use of formative e-portfolios in different learning paths. The paper shows how, starting from the same structure, the model is able to fit various needs, proposing technological and pedagogical devices in order to foster reflection and to promote formal and informal recording of learning activities.

AB  - Our aim in this study was to investigate the relationships among a calling orientation, work role fit, psychological meaningfulness and work engagement of teachers in Zambia. A quantitative approach was followed and a cross-sectional survey was used. The sample (n = 150) included 75 basic and 75 secondary school teachers in the Choma district of Zambia. The Work Role Fit Scale, Work-Life Questionnaire, Psychological Meaningfulness Scale, and Work Engagement Scale were administered. Structural equation modelling confirmed a model in which a calling orientation impacted psychological meaningfulness and work engagement significantly. A calling orientation impacted work engagement directly, while such work orientation impacted psychological meaningfulness indirectly via work role fit. The results suggest that it is necessary to address the work orientation and work role fit of teachers in Zambia as pathways to psychological meaningfulness and work engagement. These results have implications for the recruitment, selection, training, and development of teachers in Zambia.

AB  - "Webster needs an extreme makeover," students told Principal Joan Brixey upon her arrival at Daniel Webster Middle School in Waukegan, Illinois, three short years ago. The message came in a student-produced video that highlighted things that needed repair at Webster. Brixey was already a firm believer in the proposition that students need to feel pride in their school to reach their highest potential, and that video was all the impetus she needed to get moving. She organized the students, the staff, and the community to beautify their building--and in so doing, she began the effort to improve student achievement. Webster fosters individual leadership development and collaboration through its teaming structure and by encouraging teachers to pursue leadership opportunities on the building leadership team and its action teams. Support for teaming has taken many forms, including providing adjacent classrooms for team members; common planning time to discuss goal setting, behavior issues, and academic achievement; and time for team leaders to meet every Tuesday to discuss issues that have been raised in team meetings. Among the programs that Webster has identified as fostering connections are the sixth-grade transition program, the advisory program, the student leadership program, the service learning program, peer mediation, advanced mathematics and science classes, and athletics. Another innovative effort to personalize the school experience for students includes the Waukegan Arts Integration Project, which is designed to captivate and motivate all students--especially those who are at risk of failure--in the quest for improved academic achievement and social development. To increase the challenge for all students and with the cooperation of the Illinois Math and Science Academy, Webster is piloting E2K+ for Gifted and Talented, which was designed to help students develop a deeper understanding of specific units of study and encourage them to continue in higher level mathematics and science courses.

AB  - Faculty (n = 55) and student (n = 75) perceptions of service-learning outcomes were evaluated using a questionnaire format. Results indicated that while faculty strongly believe service-learning is important to student academic growth, few actually teach service-learning courses because of time constraints and unfamiliarity with service-learning course models. Comparisons of faculty and student perceptions showed that compared to students, faculty had a stronger perception of the value of service-learning for students. When students were divided into those who had (n = 33) or had not (n = 42) participated in service-learning, faculty and service-learning students' perceptions did not differ, and both rated these experiences more valuable than did non-service-learning students.

AB  - The article focuses on the effort given by the Illinois Parent's and Teacher's Association Plan to understand exceptional children. The exceptional children division of the Illinois Congress and the Office of Public Instruction joined to work and ensured that every local community in Illinois was informed on the needs of exceptional children. Based from observations, it shows that many parents need help and guidance, they are eager for personal counseling, parents should be informed about the school program and its application to their children, and there is a need for a program of public education.

AB  - Background: Persons from high-income countries have multiple opportunities today to participate in ``short-term experiences in global health{''} (STEGHs) in low-resourced countries. STEGHs are organized through religious missions, service learning, medical internships, global health education, and international electives. An issue of increasing concern in STEGHs is ``hands-on{''} participation in clinical procedures by volunteers and students with limited or no medical training. To address these concerns, best practices and ethical standards have been developed. However, not all STEGH organizations adhere to these guidelines, and some actively or tacitly allow unethical and potentially illegal practices. Objectives: This paper considers the legal framework within which STEGHs operate. It assesses whether certain STEGH practices break laws in the US and/or host countries or violate international ``soft{''} legal norms. Two activities of particular concern are: practicing medicine without a license and drug importation and distribution. Conclusions: Many activities undertaken in STEGHs would be illegal if they took place on US soil. In addition, these same activities are often illegal in the host countries where STEGHs operate, although compliance is unevenly enforced. Many STEGH activities violate World Health Organization guidelines for ethical conduct in humanitarian activities. Recommendations: This paper encourages STEGH organizations to end unethical and potentially illegal activities; urges regulatory and non-regulatory stakeholders to alter policies that motivate participation in illegal or unethical STEGH activities; and encourages host countries to enforce their local and national health laws.

AB  - The Building Migratory Bridges (BOMB) program--a collaboration between the Marvel wood School and Audubon Sharon in Connecticut and Conservation Research Education Action (CR EA), a U.S. not-for-profit in Panama--uses nontropical migratory bird research in the United States and Panama to demonstrate how negative environmental impacts in one country can have harmful consequences in others. This article discusses the BOMB program in terms of student-learning and community-service opportunities it presents. It further suggests that more hands-on science programs that analyze root causes of critical global issues are needed if students are to comprehend and tackle world environmental challenges.

AB  - This book explores four interrelated themes: rethinking civic education in light of the diversity of U.S. society; re-examining these notions in an increasingly interconnected global context; re-considering the ways that civic education is researched and practiced; and taking stock of where we are currently through use of an historical understanding of civic education. There is a gap between theory and practice in social studies education: while social studies researchers call for teachers to nurture skills of analysis, decision-making, and participatory citizenship, students in social studies classrooms are often found participating in passive tasks (e.g., quiz and test-taking, worksheet completion, listening to lectures) rather than engaging critically with the curriculum. "Civic Education for Diverse Citizens in Global Times," directed at students, researchers and practitioners of social studies education, seeks to engage this divide by offering a collection of work that puts practice at the center of research and theory. Following a foreword and preface by N. Noddings, and an introduction entitled, Civics and Citizenship in Students' Daily Lives: Toward a Sociocultural Understanding of Civic Knowledge and Engagement by B. C. Rubin and J. M. Giarelli, this book is divided into four parts. Part I, Rethinking Civics and Citizenship in a Diverse Democracy, offers the initial chapters of the book: (1) Reimagining Citizenship Education: Gender, Sexuality, and the Social Studies (M. S. Crocco); (2) Service-Learning as a Strategy to Promote Citizenship Education and Civic Engagement in an Urban Elementary Charter School (B. Chi and T. Howeth); and (3) Gender and Civic Education in the United States (C. L. Hahn). Part II, Rethinking Civics and Citizenship in a Global Context, continues with the next chapters: (4) Connections between Concepts of Democracy, Citizen Engagement, and Schooling for 14-Year-Olds across Countries (W. K. Richardson and J. Torney-Purta); (5) A Primer on Democracy and Education in the Era of Globalization (W. Cahill); and (6) Global Citizenship: Theoretical and Pedagogical Perspectives (E. Davis). Part III, New Approaches to Civic Research and Practice, goes on to present: (7) Teaching Democracy Appreciation (J. R. Hibbing and A. Rosenthal); (8) The Limits of Efficacy: Educating Citizens for a Democratic Society (J. Westheimer and J. Kahne); and (9) Civics and Citizenship in Kids' Daily Lives: Broadening Approaches to Civic Learning, Knowledge, and Engagement (B. C. Rubin). Part IV, Civic Education in a Changing World, concludes the book with: (10) Public Time versus Emergency Time after September 11th: Democracy, Schooling, and the Culture of Fear (H. Giroux); and (11) Looking Back to See Ahead: Some Thoughts on the History of Civic Education in the United States (B. Justice).

AB  - The improvement of basic cultural competency skills and the creation of a greater community-minded spirit among dental students are important parts of dental education. he purpose of our Study was to assess changes in dental students' attitudes and beliefs about community service and changes in Cultural competencies after participation in a two-year program of non-dental community service (Student Community Outreach Program and Education, SCOPE). During 2003-07, two identical twenty-eight-item surveys were administered to SCOPE participants/completers. In the first, students reported on their attitudes after program completion. In the second Students reported retrospectively oil their attitudes prior to starting the program. One hundred twenty-six post- and pre-intervention Surveys were matched and assessed for changes in Student attitudes after program participation. Based on factor analysis. four distinct scales were identified: 1) community service, 2) Cultural competence, 3) communication, and 4) treatment perspective. Over time, statistically significant changes (p<.05) in student attitudes and beliefs were found for scales 1 (p=.017), 2 (p=.001). and 3 (borderline significance, p=.057). Scale 4 showed no significant difference (p=.108). These scales indicate main focus areas to help guide future dentists in acquiring relevant sociocultural competencies and enabling community-minded attitudes. Overall, this study provides support for the addition of a non-dental community, service-learning program into the preclinical curriculum.

AB  - For international service-learning to thrive, it must document student learning outcomes that accrue to participants. The approaches to international service-learning assessment must be compelling to a variety of stakeholders. Recent large-scale projects in study abroad learning outcomes assessment--including the Georgia Learning Outcomes of Students Studying Abroad Research Initiative (GLOSSARI)--offer precedent from which international service-learning assessment programs may draw. This article outlines five promising practices to guide international service-learning assessment activities: (1) focus on outcomes about learning; (2) employ multiple sources and methods for data collection; (3) invest in compiling credible comparison groups to build the case for a causal relationship between international service-learning and learning; (4) acquire data from multiple and diverse institutions and programs to better generalize and also to warrant conclusions about best program practices; and (5) acquire data from large samples of program participants to provide insights into under-represented groups and program sites.

AB  - Motivated by the addition of a curriculum standard for active citizenship into New Jersey's social studies standards a group of educators and researchers set out to integrate an action research curriculum, based on a youth participatory action research (YPAR) model, into social studies classrooms. Adapting YPAR, with its promising blend of critical thinking, civic engagement, and democratization, for use as in the classroom is appealing to those seeking to use education as a means of social change. But activism does not always translate neatly to the classroom; melding multiple purposes into one approach, particularly amidst the current push for standardization and accountability measures, is complex. This analysis considers three challenges to navigate when reshaping YPAR into a curriculum for classroom use - preserving authenticity, conflicting aims, and tensions around authority. Drawing upon qualitative data from the social studies classrooms of two public high schools, this article engages directly with the difficulties inherent in adapting a methodology premised on action, authenticity, and youth empowerment to the adult driven, extrinsically oriented, skills and content-focused world of the classroom. Understanding this shift, and the epistemological tensions underlying it, is essential for those wishing to integrate action research with youth into social studies classrooms.

AB  - Purpose: The "Competencies for the Physician Assistant Profession" identify core competencies that physician assistants (PAs) are expected to acquire and maintain throughout their career (see http://www.nccpa.net/pdfs/Definition%20of%20PA%20Competencies% 203.5%20 for%20Publication.pdf). Two categories of competencies relate to patient care and interpersonal and communication skills and articulate the need for PAs to be effective communicators and patient educators. The value of a health education curriculum for the adolescent population has been recognized since the early 1900s. PA student-designed health promotion presentations aimed at the adolescent population are an innovative educational strategy involving students in community education. Methods: PA student-designed presentations based upon previously identified topics were presented in the community. Students presented topics including Smoking Cessation, The Effects of Drugs and Alcohol, Self-Esteem, and others to adolescents. Community audiences were varied and included alternative high schools and teens within the Department of Youth Corrections facilities. Results: PA students created 17 portable presentations for community adolescents. Two hundred sixty-eight students gave presentations to more than 700 adolescents ranging from 11-22 years of age between the years 2005-2010. Eighty-two percent (646/791) of adolescent participants either strongly agreed or agreed that they learned at least one new piece of information from the presentations.Sixty percent (12/20) of community leaders requested that the PA students return to give additional health promotion presentations. Analysis of comments by PA students revealed that 98% of students found the experience beneficial. Students identified the experience as helping them better understand how to design presentations to meet the needs of their audience, feel more comfortable with adolescents, and gain confidence in communicating. Seventy-five percent stated they would continue to be involved in community education because of the experience. Conclusions: These presentations serve to enrich student professional development, enhance community awareness of the PA profession, and provide educationalinformation to adolescent populations, many of whom are considered at-risk. In addition, this model serves to enhance the service-learning curriculum.

AB  - This article discusses the Community Exploration Project which has three explicit goals, namely to enable students to develop and practice their sociological imagination, to challenge students to discover and understand community efforts to alleviate problems and to encourage students to initiate social change. The project is an excellent tool for exercising students' sociological imaginations. Additional benefits of collaborative, active learning experiences like the Community Exploration Project include creating knowledge-producing students and providing a class free from hierarchy. When instructors let students choose aspects of their education, they are acknowledging that student contributions to class are important and useful. The Community Exploration Project creates a more supportive educational environment and students seek information and develop original work. When students collaborate, the competition between individual students decreases. This project also allows students to think in creative and critical ways because they learn the approaches that different social organizations utilize in order to address social problems. The data collection phase is also beneficial because students gain understanding of the skills necessary for questionnaire construction and interviewing.

AB  - The IT-Adventures program is dedicated to increasing interest in and awareness of information technology among high school students using inquiry-based learning focused on three content areas: cyber defense, game design programming, and robotics. The program combines secondary, post-secondary, and industry partnerships in educational programming, competitive events, and service learning projects targeted at high school students to accomplish its goals. This paper provides details about the IT-Adventures program as well as the capstone event for students--the IT-Olympics. Project assessment findings, such as differences between students who compete in different content areas, and descriptive measures about the participants are also provided. (Contains 7 tables, 3 figures, and 1 footnote.)

AB  - The article discusses the benefits of service learning for English language learner (ELL) students. Service learning can help ELL students integrate into the larger community and student body, something that tends to be unusual as ELL students are segregated in many of their classes. The author describes a project his class did, creating a Spanish/English phrase book for the community. The project helped students become part of the school and work outside their usual peer groups as well as provide all the students with a sense of purpose in their work.

AB  - The article discusses ways on how social and emotional learning (SEL) and art education can improve each other. The author said that service-learning art projects use collaborate-and-create, asset-based methods integrated with SEL instruction. Because SEL skills are made explicit, they can be purposely practiced and reflected on by the students in real time and authenticated by real situations. SEL in art education should not be restricted to service-learning projects, but should be integrated in the traditional art curriculum. Interdisciplinary learning with other school subjects like social studies presents another opportunity.

AB  - In post-conflict and fragile contexts, one central aim of education is to prepare citizens to rebuild society and manage conflict. In this paper, we discuss the ways that citizenship education, students’ civic attitudes, and student civic practices vary across two post-conflict contexts in Africa: Liberia and Rwanda. First, we consider the historical and current complexities of citizenship education in these countries drawing on a post-colonial framework and Osler and Starkey’s three dimensions of citizenship. Next, we discuss survey and interview data from secondary students based on separate multi-level case studies in the respective countries. We note differences and similarities in student conceptions of good citizenship, civic identity, classroom climate, and civic engagement across the two countries, as well as variation by school type and gender. Some notable findings included less active conceptions of citizenship and openness to discussing controversial issues in Rwanda than in Liberia, and less participation in out of school activities among young women than young men. These and other results highlight differing contextual values of development, security, freedom of speech, and civic action and the overall importance of citizenship education in a post-conflict context.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to summarize the benefits of including a service learning project in college classes and focusses on benefits to all stakeholders, including students, community, and faculty. Design/methodology/approach: Using a snowball approach in academic databases as well as a nominal group technique to poll faculty, key topics for service learning across college disciplines are presented. Findings: Findings include a wide range of service learning projects across disciplines. Research limitations/implications: Areas for future research are identified to expand the service learning topic list as well as guide studies on the long-term benefit of service learning for each identified stakeholder. Practical implications: For new faculty or faculty new to service learning, the list of paper ideas is a good first step to identify projects. While not comprehensive, the list serves to stimulate topic ideas and fills a void in the service learning literature. Social implications: Service learning exists to provide real-world learning for students, but the projects provide benefits for community groups, agencies, and organizations. Societal benefits from the student effort are numerous and there are little or no costs to the agencies who participate. Originality/value: The abundance of service learning literature has studied learning across disciplines and has quantitatively and qualitatively presented benefits, but no studies have worked to compile project ideas across major college disciplines. This research addresses this issue and provides the key first step to implement the service learning pedagogy: the topic idea.

AB  - The outcomes of a two-pronged 'real-world' learning project, which aimed to expand the views of pre-service teachers about learning, pedagogy and diversity, will be discussed in this paper. Seventy-two fourth-year and 22 first-year students, enrolled in a Bachelor of Education degree in Queensland, Australia, were engaged in community sites outside of university lectures, and separate from their practicum. Using Butin's conceptual framework for service learning, we show evidence that this approach can enable pre-service teachers to see new realities about the dilemmas and ambiguities of performing as learners and as teachers. We contend that when such 'real-world' experiences have different foci at different times in their four-year degree, pre-service teachers have more opportunities to develop sophisticated understandings of pedagogy in diverse contexts for diverse learners.

AB  - The Hispanic population in and around Richmond, Virginia, USA, has grown rapidly since 2000. The Richmond City Latino Needs Assessment emphasized this growth and also reported concerns regarding healthcare access. Schools of medicine, pharmacy, and nursing at Virginia Commonwealth University have partnered together with community organizations to develop and implement an interprofessional student service learning pilot program to meet community needs and provide an opportunity for enhanced learning. Community events allowed students to work on interprofessional teams to provide healthcare screenings and education to the Hispanic community. The program was evaluated by the use of a community service survey. Results indicated improved perceptions of student comfort with working with diverse patients, working on teams, and patient-centered care, as well as statistically significant improvements in student understanding of healthcare access and barriers, community needs, and social determinants of health. Results suggest that this community-based service-learning interprofessional experience was critical in student learning.

AB  - Background: Many schools of nursing offer international service-learning opportunities. Research on these experiences describes benefits to students, but the importance of building long-term relationships and community health capacity is seldom addressed. Method: The written posttravel reflections of 89 advanced practice nursing students, following brief global experiences over 9 years in developing areas, were analyzed to identify themes and implications for future work. Results: Analysis of student reflections produced four themes and 13 subthemes. Students described accomplishments and challenges. Improvements were noted in clinical skills and linguistic abilities. Challenges included ethical issues of undermining the value of local providers, obstacles to appropriate follow-up care, and disruption of community life. An ongoing project that responds to community needs for education and training was offered as a better means to improving health. Conclusion: Global health service-learning experiences can be beneficial to both students and communities, especially if imbedded in structured academic courses designed to include long-term solidarity with the community and the development of health capacity and ethical nursing practices.

AB  - Compiled to help staff developers, administrators, teachers, and policy makers reexamine current literacy practices and reimagine how they can work with each other and with parents and community members, this collection of 22 previously published articles from various professional journals and one new article offers examples of how educators can revitalize their efforts for teaching middle school and high school students, and form a better understanding of youth cultures and adolescents' everyday lives. Developed as an extension of the International Reading Association's "Adolescent Literacy: A Position Statement," the volume focuses on four commitments the editors believe are critical to achieving results for adolescent literacy learners: literacy access for all students, challenging and supportive instruction, comprehensive and collaborative programs, and reimagining adolescent literacy learning. After an introduction by the editors, essays in section one, "A Commitment to Literacy Access for All Students" are: "Combining Enablement and Engagement to Assist Students Who Do Not Read and Write Well" (Mary F. Roe); "An Effective (and Affordable) Intervention Model for At-Risk High School Readers" (Cynthia Fischer); "Against Marginalization and Criminal Reading Curriculum Standards for African American Adolescents in Low-Level Tracks: A Retrospective of Baldwin's Essay" (Alfred W. Tatum); "What Middle and High School Educators Need to Know About Language Minority Students" (Elizabeth G. Sturtevant); and "A Library for Ophelia" (Marsha M. Sprague and Kara K. Keeling). Essays in section two, "A Commitment to Challenging and Supportive Instruction," are: "Discovering Readers in the Middle Level School: A Few Helpful Clues" (Gay Ivey); "Motivating Secondary School Students to Read Their Textbooks" (Barbara L. McCombs and Mary Lee Barton); "One Teacher's Use of Computers and Technology: A Look Inside a Classroom" (Mary Santerre); "Writing Portfolios: Active vs. Passive"

AB  - Fieldwork is a critical component in geographic education. This study examines the impact on the development of skills across six field courses, over five years, and among students from three institutions. A survey instrument comprised of 46 questions in eight categories serves as the vehicle for primary data collection. Student perceptions are examined in such conceptual skill sets as personal/self-management, cooperation and independence, managing information and data, teamwork, problem solving, and communication fluency. Results demonstrate the value of the field course experience in a number of key factors (including increased geographic knowledge, greater understanding and appreciation of local culture, and gaining a different perspective of skills management) in each of these sets, as well as institutional differences between students. Analysis also shows that a course with a service-learning component has important impacts. Implications for future research are noted.

AB  - This paper describes the successful adaptation of certain components of peer-led team learning (PLTL) as well as service learning principles into our initiative: lab skills seminars (LSS). These seminars were organized for large, second year organic chemistry laboratory courses. Prior to LSS, the only help available for students was traditional office hours conducted by the course coordinator. Such office hours are not sufficient or effective in large courses for numerous reasons, such that laboratory skill seminars were created to fill that gap and also diminish high levels of anxiety associated with complicated laboratories. Seminars were prepared and facilitated by upper year service learning students or volunteers, who had successfully completed the same course. Facilitators and course students mutually benefit significantly from these seminars, and this article will discuss these benefits in greater detail.

AB  - We provide an empirical investigation of leadership characteristics and social justice issues in the context of financial literacy service-learning. Using a unique dataset of student self-ratings, we find that students experience statistically significant increases in 8 of the 10 leadership dimensions and 7 of the 7 social justice issues examined in this study. Leadership dimensions include: persuasion, building community, 'commitment to the growth of people,' stewardship, empathy, awareness, foresight, and listening. Interest in social justice issues include: dignity of the human person, community and the common good, rights and responsibilities, option for the poor, dignity of work, solidarity, and care for God’s creation. The statistically significant increases in these dimensions following the completion of the service-learning suggest positive effects on students’ self-perception of leadership qualities and interests in social justice issues: business school students sense improvement in nurturing growth of employees and colleagues, commitment to serving the need of others, understanding and empathizing with others, ethics, ability to foresee the likely outcome of a situation, and listening intently to others. As a consequence of the financial literacy service-learning, we believe that business students become more prepared toward becoming ethical leaders and citizens with compassion to serve the world for the well-being of all people, rich and poor alike.

AB  - BACKROUND: Historically, US immigration policy, including border enforcement, has served to define national belonging and through this process, has constructed particular groups as undesirable or threatening to the nation. Such political-economic strategies contribute to oppression through gender, ethnic, and class discrimination and economic and political exclusion. This dissertation is based on three studies that collectivity explored these issues as structural determinants of health (SDH) and forms of structural and everyday violence. OBJECTIVES: These studies aimed to (1) examine the relations between immigration related mistreatment and practices of ethno-racial profiling by immigration officials on health of Mexican immigrants of the Arizona border (2) contextualize the structural and everyday violence of such institutional practices through mistreatment narratives and (3) evaluate the impact of an intensive Border Health Service Learning Institute (BHSLI) on public health students' ability to locate such forms of violence and identify the role of public health advocacy. METHODS: Study one and two are a secondary analysis of quantitative and qualitative data drawn from a random household sample of 299 Mexican-origin farmworkers. Study three is a qualitative analysis of 25 BHSLI student reflection journals from 2010-2012. RESULTS: Farmworkers were US permanent residents and citizens, employed in US agriculture for 20 years. Approximately 25% reported immigration related mistreatment, more than 50% were personally victimized and 75% of mistreatment episodes occurred in a community location while residents engaged in routine activities. Immigration mistreatment was associated with a 2.3-increased risk for stress in adjusted models (OR 2.3, CI 1.2, 4.1). After a week at the US-Mexico border, BHSLI students articulated aspects of immigration and economic policy impacting health. Students framed economic and immigration policies as health policy and found the role of public health to convene stakeholders toward multi-institutional policy solutions. CONCLUSION: Immigration related mistreatment and ethno-racial profiling are historically embedded at institutional and individual levels and reproduce inequality overtime. Such institutional practices of discrimination are SDH and forms of structural and everyday violence. Academic public health programs, engaged in service learning strengthen students' abilities to learn and act on such SDH and contribute to campus-community engagement on related ethno-racial health disparities.

AB  - Nearly 250,000 U.S. college students participate in study abroad programs each year. A growing proportion of students are participating in short-term study abroad programs. Despite the large number of students in these programs, there are relatively few articles that describe how to start or manage a short-term, business-related, study abroad program. With this in mind, this article includes three examples of short-term study abroad programs: the summer semester abroad, the study tour, and the service-learning trip. Benefits of short-term study abroad programs are discussed. The article also includes tips for designing and managing the programs. The article is intended as a resource for faculty who are considering taking students abroad. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In this chapter, we discuss two short-term, international service-learning trips where US graduate students, faculty and program advisors (l-O trained management consultants) traveled to developing nations to complete projects in local schools. Drawing from these experiences, we discuss lessons we have learned regarding the challenges and benefits of the trips. Although it may be easier to imagine how people from nursing, construction, or education might serve the disadvantaged, we have found that the skill set of I-O psychologists can be of great benefit to people who need to manage their way out of poverty. I-O psychologists can, for instance, teach job search, interviewing, and supervisory skills. They can help the agencies who serve the poor by providing organizational development, managerial and problem-solving expertise. The skills of researchers and grant writers can be of immense help to those who serve and those who are served. Service learning is of growing interest to I-O psychologists and our hope is that the chapter will be useful as a resource for professionals who would like to start an international service-learning program.

AB  - The fundamental aspects of service-learning can be traced to the work of John Dewey and his belief in the importance of interaction with one's environment during learning (Dewey, 1954). This idea of environmental interaction has been increasingly embraced in the field of communication, specifically through the use of the teaching strategy known as service-learning. Due to the increased use of service-learning in the field of communication it was important to conduct a study not only focusing on how service-learning is applied but particularly on how service-learning is assessed during application. Oster-Aaland, Sellnow, Nelson, & Pearson (2004) indicated that a major area of focus should be on "actual outcomes, outcomes assessment, and student satisfaction with service-learning" (p. 355). Finally, it was important to revisit factors that previous researchers had established as important to the application of service-learning to note any change in perception of importance. The data were collected from a population of 226 communication faculty members utilizing a combination of previously developed survey items from the Service Learning Survey (Oster-Aaland, Sellnow, Nelson, & Pearson, 2004), The Western Region Campus Compact Consortium Faculty Email Questionnaire (Ammon, Furco, Kornfield, & Middaugh, 2002), and original questions by the researcher. The instrument also collected demographic information, as well as information relating to factors established as important in the development of service-learning pedagogy. Respondents reported frequent use of service-learning. The data also revealed that through the use of service-learning faculty place an emphasis on personal and group development over skill development. The participants also indicated that a wide variety of assessment techniques were being utilized in service-learning communication courses. The findings did not provide a great deal of insight into how faculty are using the assessment tools, just that they are being utilized. The findings also indicated that differences existed in the satisfaction levels among communication faculty based on the demographic issues of academic rank, gender, type of institution, and years of service. Additionally, no significant differences were found among faculty based on department size or institution size.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this qualitative phenomenological study was to describe and explain middle school administrators’, teachers’, and coordinators’ observations and knowledge of the effect of service-learning on students’ personal growth, social growth, and civic engagement. Methodology: This phenomenological qualitative study based its findings on in-depth interviews, transcripts, and participant artifacts. Six middle school administrators and eight teachers, and coordinators located in Tulare County, California utilizing service-learning in the 2017-2018 school year, or prior, were interviewed. An interview script, which was developed using the research questions, was used to elicit administrators’, teachers’, and coordinators’ observations and knowledge pertaining to the benefits and drawbacks of service-learning. The participants were digitally recorded and provided with a transcript of the interview to review for accuracy and to add to their responses, should they want to. Triangulation strengthened this study by providing valuable insight through data from interviews, transcripts, and artifacts. Findings: Major findings indicate that service-learning positively affects the personal growth, social growth, academic improvement, and civic engagement and responsibility in middle school students. Conclusions: Several conclusions were drawn based on the major findings, from which a list of implications for actions were created. One implication for action is for all elementary schools to incorporate service-learning into their curriculum, districts can begin using service-learning with younger students for maximum benefits! Recommendations: Recommendations for further research are described in Chapter V, including replicating this study with different populations and perspectives to gain further insight and perceptions to the effects of service-learning.

AB  - School districts across the United States are moving toward tiered models of service delivery such as Positive Behavior Support (PBS) and Response to Intervention (RtI). A common practice in providing support for those initiatives is to develop leadership teams who are facilitated by an education-based coach. With a recent surge in hiring and transitioning of education-based coaches who support PBS and RtI it is increasingly important to understand the perceived characteristics of those coaches who are most effective at providing the social and academic outcomes associated with tiered models of service delivery. This dissertation will use a case study methodology and mixed method analysis to examine the perceived characteristics of effective coaches and the organizations that best support effective coaches.

AB  - This article uses theories of technical communication and archives to advance a pedagogy that includes archival production in the technical communication classroom. By developing and maintaining local classroom archives, students directly engage in valuable processes of appraisal, selection, collaboration, and retention. The anticipated outcomes of this work are the critical practice of making connections, the decentering of the self, the ability to work through noise, and the ability to imagine future users of the archive. The authors conclude that local classroom archives are one new means of meaningful instruction in the technical communication classroom and the local archive concept has great potential for further development.

AB  - Service learning is an experiential learning approach, which intentionally integrates community service with classroom learning, as it provides real-world learning experience for students to gain practical knowledge from hands-on field experience. In order to enhance students' better understanding of course contents and theoretical knowledge, increasing number of academicians are incorporating service learning in their curriculum. However, less attention has been given to the effective integration of technology in this pedagogy. To address this issue, this study imparts a significant contribution in the overall body of knowledge by developing a technology integration framework for service learning programs. Our proposed framework comprises of three main components, i.e. (1) identification of common phases for service learning implementation, which are drawn on Kolb's (1984) experiential learning theory; (2) technology support layer and; (3) stakeholders' involvement patterns in service learning. Design science research methodology was employed for developing our proposed Technology Integration Framework for Service Learning (TIFSL) in this study. Moreover, in order to evaluate our proposed framework, a case study was also conducted, where data was collected through semi-structured interviews and survey based questionnaires. Findings of this study demonstrate that three main components of our proposed framework determine the effective technology integration in service learning. Respondents from case study reflected on their own service learning implementation process and technology utilization throughout their service learning projects, which highlights constrains from current technologies for effective integration in service learning pedagogy.

AB  - An authentic, challenging curriculum engaged middle school students from an urban district in exploratory work related to restoring a small prairie at the school. Integrated science-literacy-arts activities were coupled with a system of thinking skills that helped students view issues from different perspectives. Impassioned guest speakers and an enthusiastic teacher inspired students to build a relationship with the content, express their ideas creatively, interact with each other on student-designed projects, and to assume a leadership stance. Middle school students of all academic levels would benefit from teachers implementing similar subject-integrated, real-world-connected work in their classrooms.

According to the author, the ROS papers of his group work students are about their growth, passion, stamina, and professionalism. The ROS was created to report the actual help of a worker and to analyze the service of an agency and interpret that service to its community. It has become an analytic and teaching tool used in guiding group work students to become effective and reflective practitioners.

AB  - Cultural exchange is privileged in many higher education programs across the globe. The Australian government’s New Colombo Plan refers to a ‘Third Wave’ of globalisation which foregrounds global interrelatedness through developing student capabilities to live, work and contribute to global communities and aims to make the global an ‘everyday’ experience for students. Mobility programs are promoted as the main strategy for fostering global perspectives, contradicting the idea of the global as an everyday experience. This paper unpacks constructs of global citizenship that underpin Australia’s recent international and global engagement policies, and implications for the ‘global’ wave in ‘local’ parochial contexts.

AB  - Objective: This article evaluates Western Washington University's Neighborhoods Engaging with Students project-a comprehensive strategy to decrease disruptive off-campus parties by increasing student integration into and accountability to the neighborhoods in which they live. The intervention includes increasing the number of and Publicity regarding ``party emphasis patrols{''} and collaboration with the city to develop a regulatory mechanism to reduce repeat problematic party calls to the same address. The enforcement components are complemented by campus-based late-night expansion programming, as well as neighborhood engagement strategies including an educational Web site designed to increase students' knowledge of and skills in living safely and legally in the community, service-learning projects in the campus-contiguous neighborhoods, and a neighborhood-based conflict-resolution program. Method: The evaluation comprised data from three public universities in Washington. In addition to the Western Washington University site, a second campus created an opportunity for a ``natural experiment{''} because it adopted a very similar intervention in the same tune frame. creating two intervention sites and one comparison site. Annual, Web-based student surveys in 2005 and 2006 included measures of alcohol consumption, alcohol-related problems, and student perception of alcohol control and prevention activities. Results: Although statistical power with three campuses was limited, results using hierarchical linear modeling showed that the prevalence of heavy episodic drinking was significantly lower at the intervention schools (odds ratio = 0.73; N = 6,150 students). Conclusions: The results Suggest that alcohol control measures can be effective in reducing problematic drinking in college settings. These findings strongly support Conducting a replication with greater power and a more rigorous design. (J. Stud Alcohol Drugs, Supplement No. 16: 21-27, 2009)

AB  - The existing literature has much to offer regarding the adjustment issues of international students. English proficiency and social support appear to be the biggest factors affecting the social, academic, and cultural adjustment of international students. Psychology graduate programs can exacerbate these challenges due to strenuous workload, smaller class sizes, and greater social engagement and clinical application of course material. Through service-learning activities, international students can interact with students or volunteers with diverse interests, engage in and become more familiar with their community, participate in cross-cultural interactions, and provide varied ways of learning and applying course material. The goal of this research was to learn more about the effects of community engagement through community service or service learning on social, cultural, and academic adjustment in international psychology graduate students through qualitative analysis of participants’ experiences. Participants in this study were international students currently enrolled in master’s or doctoral psychology programs, in on-ground campuses in the United States who had participated in volunteer or community service work. Through qualitative narrative semi-structured interviews, five themes were found across the participants’ interviews in relation to their academic, social, cultural adjustment, and community service experiences. Participants identified academic and social barriers to adjustment and ways in which volunteer participation assisted in overcoming challenges. All participants indicated volunteer work was helpful to aspects of their adjustment which suggests integration of volunteer work into graduate programs may be beneficial for international students as well as increased engagement and support from peer mentors and instructors.

AB  - Poverty, along with other factors such as unemployment, work and life stressors, interpersonal violence, and lack of access to high quality health and/or social services all play a role in determining who develops a mental illness and for whom those symptoms persist or worsen. Senior nursing student preparing to enter the field and working in a service learning capacity may be able to influence early recovery and symptom abatement among those most vulnerable to mental illness. A consortium of community stakeholders and researchers collaboratively designed a 10-week mental health promotion project called the Health Advocacy Project (HAP). The project combines case management and system navigation support delivered by trained and highly supervised nursing students to individuals experiencing major depressive disorder (MDD) and/or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In this article, we present the findings of a qualitative fidelity evaluation that examines the effectiveness of nursing students in delivering the health advocacy intervention at the level and with the intensity originally intended. The findings demonstrate how the services of senior nursing students may be optimized to benefit our healthcare system and populations most at risk for developing MDD and PTSD.

AB  - Faculty Perceptions of Domestic Service Learning in Nursing Education Service learning refers to a form of experiential learning meeting students’ academic outcomes and community needs while engaging students in reflective learning. Despite faculty investment of time and energy facilitating these experiences, there is limited research addressing nursing faculty perceptions of service learning. The purpose of this study was to explore nursing faculty perceptions of benefits of and barriers to service learning. The study was grounded in the transtheoretical model of change using a descriptive survey design. Participants were full-time nursing faculty in 18 nationally accredited schools in Georgia. An online survey was produced consisting of Hou’s Web-Based Faculty Service Learning Beliefs Inventory, which measured faculty perceptions of service learning regardless of experience. Survey invitations were sent via email to 327 nursing faculty. Response rate was 26% ( n = 84). Reliability of the instrument was confirmed using Cronbach’s alpha coefficient (.68 to .89). Results of MANOVA indicated no significant differences in perceived benefits and barriers between nursing faculty with and without domestic service learning experience (F = 1.45, p = .23). Nursing faculty perceived multiple benefits in the classroom and community. Barriers included time constraints and lack of consideration in academic advancement. Results of the study may inform future use of service learning in nursing education. Limitations included a low response rate, small sample size, and convenience sampling from a specific geographic area, all of which may limit the generalizability of results. Recommendations included larger samples and research on limiting identified barriers. Final recommendations called for increased support for nursing research and streamlined IRB processes.

AB  - Types of structured experiential learning in the classroom, eg, assignments involving role playing, games, self-assessment strategies, & group decision making, can be threatening to some students. With the goal of encouraging students & reducing some of their self-imposed barriers to class participation, an experiential socialization index (ESI) was developed to assess students' acceptance of both pivotal & peripheral norms of experiential learning. The ESI was administered at the beginning & after the fifth week of a 14-week semester to students in an organizational behavior class (N = 74). After the initial test, Ss were typed in the categories of "playing the game," "rebellion," "creative individualism," & "conformity" in a socialization matrix. Ss identified in "rebellion" (N = 25) were "treated" with personal positive reinforcement. Rebellious students in the treatment group showed higher scores on norm acceptance at the fifth week retesting, & also appreciation of the positive reinforcement comments. By contrast, students who received no special treatment or positive feedback were "annoyed." Implications for the selective use of feedback techniques are discussed. 3 Tables, 3 Figures, 15 References. D. Dunseath.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Exposure to lead-based paint or material has been found to impact children's cognitive and behavioral development at blood lead levels far below current standards. The purpose of the project was to screen for lead in toy items in daycare centers in order to raise awareness of inside environmental lead exposures and minimize lead-based exposures for children. METHODS: Occupational therapy students in a service learning class tested for lead in ten daycare or public centers using the XRF Thermo Scientific Niton XL3t, a method accepted by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). RESULTS: A total of 460 items were tested over a two-month period for an average of 66 toys per setting. Fifty six (56) items tested > 100 ppm, which represented 12% of the entire sample. Items with high lead levels included selected toys constructed with lead-based paint, lead metals, plastics using lead as a color enhancer, and decorative objects. CONCLUSION: While the actual number of lead-based products is small, the cumulative exposure or habitual use may pose an unnecessary risk to children. Indoor exposures occurred for all day care centers regardless of socio-economic levels. Recommendations to minimize exposures are provided.

AB  - Arizona's Serve-America Project is a K-12 community service program funded by the National and Community Service Act of 1990. Through formal school/community agency and youth organization/community agency partnerships, the project is designed to: (1) encourage school-age and out-of-school youth to volunteer their services; (2) increase the number of adult volunteers in Arizona's schools; (3) provide productive, meaningful educational experiences for participants; and (4) emphasize coordination of community agencies. This report describes outcomes achieved by 15 out of the 17 participating projects for 1993. Based on self-reports, programs identified their strengths, some of which include effective student learning components, individualized volunteer service, community involvement, volunteer empowerment, staff commitment, and public recognition. Improvement is needed in the following areas: use of advisory committees; volunteer recruitment; staff reflection; staff/volunteer training; and interagency coordination. It is recommended that evaluators develop clear, operational definitions of terms and work more closely with programs in refining their service learning elements. Two tables and two figures are included. Appendices contain program descriptions, evaluation directions and forms, and demographic data. (Contains 30 references.) (LMI)

AB  - This paper examines the role of higher education in developing global citizens. By internationalizing the curriculum and the campus culture, institutions of higher education are uniquely positioned to positively affect the world. Increasing knowledge and understanding of differences enables people to work more effectively together to solve the world's pressing problems. To promote a global perspective and to ultimately become a transformative experience for students, both curriculum content and pedagogy need to be examined and revised. Other ways that help build global awareness include service learning, study abroad programs, faculty and student exchanges, advocacy actions, the display of global symbols and diversity awareness initiatives. Global citizenship advances human potential and prosperity through the creation of peace and social justice worldwide.

AB  - A sense of place has been an integral part of service-learning since the field's inception; it describes one's attachment to a particular geographic place and is often a precursor to engaging in action to care for localities and their inhabitants. But practicing service-learning in online environments requires reconsidering this core value. Should the field celebrate the "liberation" of service-learning from geographical constraints, as some authors suggest, or reclaim a geographically bounded sense of place as an essential part of service-learning? The authors recommend finding ways to cultivate a virtual sense of geographic place in online learning environments to enhance a critical understanding of physical localities, better prepare service-learners to enter service sites, and deepen connections among participating students. By providing examples of online collaborative mapping and virtual community projects, this paper considers some implications for theorizing sense of place for online and face-to-face service-learning in the digital age.

AB  - This study reports on a case study of a teaching and learning approach aiming to enhance the learning benefits of three parties through the implementation of an academic service project and the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle in a graduate-level marketing course. In this study, the academic service project provides students with real learning experience, and at the same time, reverses their role to be knowledge providers (rather than knowledge recipients) while it also contributes to tourism businesses in the improvement of their marketing strategies. The PDCA cycle yields systematic learning benefits for instructors in taking further action on teaching improvements. The contributions of this study are the development of a teaching and learning method that promotes new opportunities for students to learn and to help others, and to generate learning benefits for businesses and instructors.

AB  - This research project sought to learn how solidarity education is manifested in Chilean Catholic schools, considering the perspectives of school principals, programme directors and pastoral teams. Eleven Chilean schools were studied and the information gathering techniques applied included: a questionnaire, semi-structured individual interviews and group interviews. The grounded theory model was used to analyse the data. The results describe contexts of emerging solidarity education strategies and one perceives a variety of degrees of effort, bi-directional fields of action and traditional attitudes associated with charity. There is an overall sense of solidarity-in-transition, ranging from welfare-oriented action to promotional activities, channelled through training processes. Strengths, weaknesses, challenges and the need for outside support for the schools are highlighted in order to assure effectiveness and sustainability for the programmes. (Contains 4 notes.)

AB  - Service-learning has become a popular pedagogy because of its numerous and far-reaching benefits (e.g. student interest, engagement, and retention). In part, the benefits are a result of the student learning while providing a service that reflects a true need-not simply an exercise. Although service-learning projects have been developed in the areas of Biochemistry and Biology, many do not require reciprocity between the student and those being served. A reciprocal relationship enables a depth in learning as students synthesize and integrate their knowledge while confronting a real-life need. A novel reciprocal service-learning project within a three-semester undergraduate research course in the areas of Biochemistry and Biology is presented. The goal of the project was agreed upon through joint meetings with the partner institution (The Wilds) to develop an in-house competitive ELISA pregnane diol assay. Student progress and achievements were followed through the use of rubrics and progress-meetings with The Wilds. A portfolio provided a visual of progress as it contained both the written assignments as well as the rubric. The article describes a specific reciprocal biochemistry and biology service-learning project and provides recommendations on how to adapt this service-learning design for use in other research courses.

AB  - This survey design study involved preservice special education service providers who were in degree seeking programs in the departments of special education, physical therapy, and occupational therapy. Participants provided views and belief structures on diversity issues identified through a review of literature, including (a) English language issues, (b) ability to have success with diverse groups, (c) service provider roles with diverse populations, and (d) the role of institutions of higher education in preparing service providers to work with diverse populations. One of the groups of participants was part of the Service Learning Mexico Project (SLMP) course and the other was a matched group of on-campus traditional students who did not participate in service learning. Our results suggest differences between the two groups which may link to future practices with students from diverse backgrounds.

AB  - This article provides a description of service learning implemented in an introductory special education course focused on the culture of disability. Collaborating with liaisons from five community service organizations, students provided services to individuals with disabilities in a variety of projects across two semesters. Communication and collaboration at all phases of the project were essential to ensuring that service learning was salient to the organization and meaningful to the students. The students presented a final report about their service-learning project and individually submitted a paper reflecting on their experience. Pre- and post-ratings of students' perspectives of the culture of disability were gathered. Students reported increased knowledge related to course content, and all participants reported satisfaction with the projects. Strategies that proved successful in assisting students accomplish their project goals are discussed. Recommendations for the use of service learning in personnel preparation of future special educators are presented. (Contains 4 tables.)

AB  - In recent years, the idea of "global citizenship" has grown in scholarly circles and developed into a nascent discipline known as global citizenship education. As a general matter, global citizenship education strives to deepen cross-cultural understanding through the study of current transnational issues. This qualitative, interpretivist case study sought to examine and evaluate how students enrolled in a global studies curriculum at an urban New Jersey public high school view their roles and responsibilities in the world today. The study included interviews from an administrator, two global studies teachers, and six students enrolled in the second sequence of a two-year course in the global studies curriculum. The study also included observations and analysis of the course curriculum, syllabus, and student assignments. This study advances four primary findings. First, the need for continued curriculum development and design of global studies related courses and content. Second, the need for pre-service and in-service training for teachers of global studies related courses, including teacher education and professional development programs. Third, the importance of experiential learning, among other forms of pedagogy and instructional practices, in furthering the goals of global citizenship education. Fourth, the need for class projects, international education programs, and other experiential learning opportunities (such as fieldwork, service-learning, or community programs) to cultivate student interest in global citizenship education. Upon reflection, this study also highlights the need for global studies related courses to explore the connection between liberal democratic values and the goals of global citizenship. Through the above findings and literature, this study has proposed an elective course on global citizenship with ten units: 1) Introduction to Global Citizenship; 2) Sustainable Development; 3) Poverty and World Hunger; 4) Global Health Issues; 5) Child Mortality; 6) Peace and Conflict; 7) Human Rights and Gender Equality; 8) Universal Education; 9) Liberal Democratic Governance and Rights; 10) Global Citizenship Action Plan. This study also has underscored the need for more research on global citizenship, global citizenship education in the United States, global studies training and certification programs, experiential learning, and the connection between global citizenship and liberal democratic governance and values.

AB  - This survey investigated the relationship and gap between students' expectations and perceptions of perceived service quality of education, emphasizing the least effective service quality dimension. The study was based on primary data, which turned out to be most significant. Data were collected from 349 of 405 students through a questionnaire (86.1% response rate). The research specified that there existed a gap (7.6% overall gap) between the expectations and perceptions of the students that was an indicator of improvement in quality of education being delivered by applying paired t-tests. Perceived reliability was the most important service quality dimension found in the current study (< 0.001) and tangibility, the fifth dimension of service quality, appears to be insignificant (< 0.778), and was never found negative by any of the past researchers, indicating a null effect of physical structure of the classroom on quality of education. The work attempted to develop an understanding of the comparative assessments of two mindsets of the receivers. The results provide valuable feedback that could be used for identifying and improving weak service quality dimensions among institutes in Pakistan. No such study was carried out before at this level in Pakistan.

Specifically, we describe how two junior policy courses, a senior macro practice course, and a research methods course were revised to include a service learning approach. This article provides a re- view of the literature and focuses on the development of service learning in two social work courses. Results of subsequent research are discussed, indicating service learning provides successful opportunities to engage students in macro social work practice.

AB  - Objectives. To assess a community geriatrics advanced pharmacy practice experience (APPE) that aimed to improve students' attitudes towards older adults and provide a student-directed learning experience. Design. Students provided blood pressure monitoring and medication counseling to older adults living in a low-income residential facility as part of a required 6-week ambulatory care service-learning APPE. Pre-experience and post-experience essays on students' perceptions of the elderly and their intended and actual learning were retrospectively reviewed using a qualitative process to determine whether the course objectives were met. Assessment. Many students initially described older adults in factual terms or using negative descriptors. Most expressed a desire to increase their knowledge of diseases commonly occurring in and drugs commonly prescribed for the elderly or to improve specific skills. Many students initially had difficulty articulating clear and measurable learning objectives and appropriate assessment metrics, which are important components of self-directed learning. The final essays revealed many students learned more about the humanistic aspects of care than they had anticipated. Conclusion. This community-based geriatrics experience improved students' attitudes towards working with older adults and provided practice in developing and assessing their personal learning objectives.

AB  - For reasons that might make an interesting study, audience analysis seems to be the most thoroughly schematized and even technologized of the rhetorical touchstones in technical communication. We suspect that it is the development of formal, detailed schema for analysis that has sustained the dominance of audience in technical communication practice. We lack, however, the same detailed schema for the analysis of some other important factors in technical communication--among them, context. We lack structured criteria for analyzing communication contexts and the ways they influence communication tasks and products. In this chapter, we will examine how teachers can apply case-study methodologies from industry and service learning from academia to strengthen the analysis of context in technical-communication courses.

AB  - Background: Camp programs yield positive and lasting benefits for children. Integrating a summer camp into a nurse course with a service learning design fosters learning beyond the classroom and enhances community engagement. Objective: The purpose of this study is to describe the nursing students' experience and perceived confidence after completing a service learning nursing course. Design: This is a descriptive, qualitative research study that used reflection and a perceived confidence questionnaire. Setting: The study was conducted in a school of nursing and surrounding university campus facilities during the diabetes camp. Participants: The participants (n = 23) were nursing students who enrolled in the nursing course. Methods: As part of the course requirements, students completed an eight item question confidence survey before and after the diabetes camp related to diabetes and camp management, and interpersonal abilities with patients, families, and healthcare professionals. Within 48-72 h after diabetes camp, the students completed the reflection paper. The pre and post Confidence Surveys were analyzed using a t-test and thematic analysis was used to analyze the reflection paper. Results: Overall, perceived confidence levels increased after completing the service learning course (t = -9.91, p = 0.001). Four themes emerged from the qualitative analysis: pre-camp assumptions and fears, growth in confidence, understanding diabetes management in the community, and appreciation for learning beyond the classroom and hospital setting. Conclusions: This service learning course provided nursing students the ability to not only develop diabetes clinical skills and perceived confidence, but also life skills including teamwork, leadership, and conflict resolution.

AB  - The contribution of nonfamily adults to young people's well-being was explored using both a cross-sectional national sample of 614 12- to 17-yearolds and a longitudinal sample of 370 students followed from 6th–8th grades through 10th–12th grades. Both variable- and person-centered analyses were employed. Young people's involvement in volunteering, youth programs, and religious organizations was hypothesized to increase the frequency as well as the quality of their relationships with nonfamily adults. Greater community involvement was related to (a) greater and qualitatively different kinds of engagement with nonfamily adults; (b) higher levels of positive developmental processes of support, empowerment, and boundary setting; (c) lower levels of risk behaviors; and (d) higher levels of thriving. The results suggest the utility of positive youth development theory, research, and applications for predicting and enhancing young people's concurrent and longer-term well-being. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The aging of society is an inescapable trend that some neighborhoods, municipalities, and counties are admitting needs their attention. As the extent of the changes required to become senior friendly, let alone sustainable, are being realized, many communities are experiencing pushback from voters, old-guard city and county staff, and even elected officials. While initially appearing counter-intuitive, if we plan for the aging of society along with four other first-time-ever, equally inescapable trends-peak oil, water scarcity, obesity, and climate change-we come to realize the critical role of the built environment as a common denominator in preparing for a future very different than most of us have anticipated. As such, changes to the built environment that move a community closer to realizing sustainable senior living also contribute to lower energy needs and costs, a smaller carbon footprint, water savings, and an overall healthier population. By focusing on the built environment as the key to sustainable senior living communities, we are able to build more inclusive collaborative work teams, reach out to two underutilized resources in retirees and college and university students, and leverage the planned-for changes in ways that help finance future modifications. Clarified below, these ideas, strategies, and actions are, in the end, described as part of a five-year, ongoing, service learning partnership.

AB  - This paper examines an instructional methodology, service learning, as a method for teaching program development and evaluation in adult day service centers. Adult day service, an emerging practice area, provides an opportunity for students to learn program development while they explore and meet the occupational needs of elders living in the community. Students learn to design and implement day service activities to benefit both the agencies and people they are serving. In this study, 39 students were surveyed before and after a service learning experience to determine if they perceived service learning as effective in increasing knowledge and confidence to develop, implement, and evaluate an adult day services program module. In an evaluation of the service learning project, students reported that their knowledge and confidence increased significantly in assessing organizations and populations, designing and carrying out an activity with well elderly, and creating an evaluation measure. Furthermore, students reported a high level of comfort in working with elderly populations before and after the service learning experience.

AB  - When Adam Fletcher was hired as the student engagement specialist for Washington state's education department 10 years ago, it didn't take him long to realize how difficult his newly created job would prove. Fletcher said no one was talking about the roles of students other than as learners, and they laughed out loud at the proposal of students being partners in school improvement. The landscape faced by Fletcher, who has since become an educational consultant and one of the country's leading advocates for student empowerment through the organization SoundOut, has undergone a transformation as schools and districts have discovered the value in engaging students in more than academics. These students have responded, from taking the lead in educating themselves and their teachers on a variety of topics to becoming activists for school-related issues from teenage suicide to service learning to better nutrition during the school day. This article features some success stories of student involvement and activism.

AB  - Community service is a common component in secular and Catholic high school education as well as in catechetical situations, particularly in confirmation preparation and youth ministry programs. In the catechetical context, the value of community service is affirmed, but the integration of these experiences within sacramental preparation and on-going faith formation is often lacking. Frequently, community service is treated as an appendage rather than an integral aspect of catechesis, which in and of itself, does not often lead to a life-long commitment to love and serve others. Community service has the potential to enhance catechetical formation but methods of integrating service into the catechetical endeavor need to be more fully developed to actualize its potential. This study is a literature review which incorporates the scholarship from diverse sources into a model of Catechetical Service-Learning. The first chapter provides a theology of Christian service using the themes of discipleship, witness, and mission of charity found in the Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults, the Rite of Baptism for Children, and the Rite of Confirmation. The second chapter explains the use of service in catechesis through a review of the Christian service themes in the catechetical directories and other official catechetical documents. The third chapter summarizes the key principles and practices of service-learning from the secular literature that can be applied to catechetical situations. The fourth chapter presents current methods of catechesis and how they incorporate the service component. The results indicate that Christian service is an integral aspect of formation for initiation preparation as well as on-going faith formation. Leaders can faithfully incorporate many of the principles and practices of service-learning into catechetical situations. Likewise, current methods of catechesis can benefit from adopting principles and practices of service-learning. This study shows that incorporating the model of Catechetical Service-Learning into all catechetical situations, but especially confirmation preparation, Catholic school religion classes, and youth ministry programs, has many potential positive implications. Catechetical Service-Learning that is Christocentric, reflective, communal, and transformative is an opportunity to encounter God, deepen one’s faith, and positively impact the greater community.

AB  - The connection between service and character is a natural fit in today's schools. An important fact of school reform in recent years has been the push to connect academics to the "real world." But while there is widespread agreement that educating students to become good citizens is crucial, there are differences on how to make that goal a reality. Many educators, however, are finding that the service-learning and character development approaches go hand in hand. Following an overview, this issue paper first defines and describes character education and service-learning. The paper focuses on how service and character support each other. It discusses conflicting opinions about policy options and policy challenges. It outlines guidelines and strategies for state policymakers who wish to draft legislation about character education and service-learning. (Contains 15 references and 9 resources.) (BT)

The project applied course topics while allowing students to positively channel their anxiety. Students developed and implemented a community-wide effort to collect care packages for U.S. troops deployed to Afghanistan. The article presents the project's evolution, successes, and problems. The pros and cons of service learning through changing a course midsemester are also discussed. This project description may be instructive to readers who are contemplating service learning class projects. It should also be of interest to instructors who sense the need to change a course midsemester. (Contains 2 tables.)

AB  - The authors investigated the antecedents of team task cohesiveness in service learning classroom environments. Focusing on task commitment and task attraction as key dependent variables representing cohesiveness, and task interdependence as the primary independent variable, the authors position three important task action phase processes as mediators in the analyses. Overall, results provide strong support for hypothesized relationships. Task interdependence in student teams significantly influences task cohesiveness through these action phase processes. The authors highlight important implications for faculty who are interested in how to best structure student teams, particularly when course projects incorporate service learning.

AB  - Lowering the student dropout rate in America is one of the most significant challenges facing educators today. This book calls attention to this problem, and offers hope and suggestions on how to resolve it using effective strategies taken from research and personal observations gleaned from successful dropout prevention programs in school settings across America. The book is divided into seven parts. Part 1 identifies the dropout problem, describes the educational and social factors that help create it, describes the types of students who drop out, and explores why they drop out. Part 2 draws on observation and research to identify strategies for dropout prevention, and lists and explores 15 effective strategies for dropout prevention. Part 3 explores early intervention. Part 4 describes four potent strategies for dropout prevention: mentoring, service learning, alternative schooling, and out-of-school enhancement. Part 5 looks into classroom strategies for dropout prevention, such as devoting resources to the professional development of teachers and expanding teaching methods to accommodate a range of learning styles. Part 6 discusses the roles teachers, parents, and other community members can play to prevent student dropout. Part 7 provides a wider, global perspective on the problems of student dropout in other countries. Each chapter concludes with a list of references. (RT)

AB  - Experiential learning can generate significant learning gains to students and deliver development benefits to the community. However, economists have been slow to embrace an experiential learning pedagogy where students experience events and integrate these events with their understanding of theory. When economists have employed experiential teaching techniques, it has been linked to a single course. A local economy centre (LEC) represents a new type of experiential learning opportunity that is scalable and replicable, and can mutually benefit students and the community. A LEC provides experiential learning outside of a course experience in a way that allows for a responsive relationship with the community and development of deep learning over a multiple year cycle. In our paper we begin with a discussion of what experiential learning is and the benefits to students and the community. We then describe the specifics of a LEC as a form of experiential learning where students collect and interpret economic data and conditions that are specific to a local community. We conclude with a discussion of how to adopt such a programme at other institutions.

AB  - Service-learning is a pedagogical approach that integrates students' classroom instruction with community experience. This article discusses qualitative results from a national survey examining service-learning in Council on Social Work Education--accredited baccalaureate programs. Almost 80% of the 202 program respondents required service-learning. They reported that benefits of incorporating service-learning in the BSW curriculum include assisting students in building community connections, applying theory and skills, socializing to the social work profession, and increasing self-awareness and exposure to diverse populations. Cited challenges include securing agency sites, time, and logistics. Findings support existing research suggesting that service-learning may benefit social work undergraduate education.

AB  - International service learning experiences are considered influential in their ability to prompt disorientation and worldview transformation. Outcome gains of international service learning have been previously researched; however, little is known about how narrative constructions of disorientation and transformation are storied from these experiences. Autobiographical student video narratives (N=37) of international service learning experiences underwent a mixed methods analysis with qualitative examination primary and quantitative examination secondary to identify the presence of disorientation and transformation content in the context of literary elements (affect, plot structure, and literary theme) within the narratives. There were meaningful differences between and among narratives according to the presence of disorientation and transformation content and the utilization of literary elements to create a coherent narrative. These findings support the importance of examining disorientation and transformation content as significant components of transformative learning experiences that deserve further exploration in their own right, particularly as they become part of an integrated personal narrative of a transformative learning experience. Further research is still needed to more conclusively define the psychological and cognitive process that delineates the link between experience and worldview transformation.

AB  - This article describes a model of participatory action research and service-learning conducted with urban, high school African American, West Indian/Caribbean, and Puerto Rican/Latino youth and adult facilitators, in a nonclassroom setting, in a mid-sized northeastern city. Youth Participatory Action Research (YPAR) integrates critical theory, research paradigms that incorporate positionality, interactive ethnographic methods, and dialogic approaches to service-learning. It provides a context for examining questions related to instructional methods, reciprocal learning, information as service, and the nature and practice of service-learning as reproducing or transforming traditional structures of power and positionality. This case example, though it reflects work done with high school students, has implications for the ways both secondary and higher education can change to ensure service-learning programs that utilize research for social transformation.

We must do more than prepare them for their roles as community members and future employees; we must show them in what way they are prepared, as well as how and why to maintain community connections. This paper details the creation of a pilot course and its revision into a repeatedly offered 200-level English class intended to close the gap between students and the wider business and civic community.

AB  - This qualitative case study examined the experiences of three Latina students in a higher education service-learning program. A review of service-learning literature found limited research dedicated to understanding the qualitatively different experiences of students of color operating in historically and predominantly white higher education institutions’ service-learning programs. Though the diversity benefits of service-learning are documented, research is inconclusive on whether service-learning program culture adequately meets the needs of all racially/ethnically diverse students. The study utilized student interviews and classroom observation to build understanding of the unique experiences of three Latina students participating in a service-learning course taught by a Latina instructor at a large public Minority Serving Institution (MSI) in the southwestern United States. Results of this study revealed that all three Latina students had overall positive experiences in the service-learning course; these experiences included an inclusive classroom environment, feeling encouraged to share personal experiences on issues of oppression and power, and gaining an overall sense of agency and empowerment for engaging in the community. The professor’s race/ethnicity was important to the Latina study participants who felt that her proud Latina identity made her more relatable and a positive role model of a strong, civically engaged Latina woman in a white male-dominated world. Factors that were found to influence disengagement from service-learning in this study include lack of awareness, scheduling conflicts, socioeconomic status, age, nationality, and exposure to community engagement growing up. Study participants agreed that, most often, issues of race and equity were brought up in the course by individual students sharing personal stories in connection with the course content. This study suggests that service-learning courses in which students of color enjoy positive experiences are also reflective of culturally responsive classrooms that value the unique experiences of racially/ethnically diverse students. The results of this study provide a model for culturally responsive service-learning design and offer recommendations for future studies on the differentiated experiences of racially/ethnically diverse students based on the identity of the course instructor and level of cultural responsiveness being implemented in the classroom.

AB  - This paper describes how an occupational therapy program used service-learning to integrate the learning objectives for mental health and research curriculum content. The service-learning program assisted participants diagnosed with mental illness to achieve success in higher education and/or related goals and served as a clinical program within a research curriculum for entry-level graduate occupational therapy students. The occupational therapy students served as mentors for the participants. The purpose of the program for the occupational therapy students was to teach research skills, clinical skills, and increase comfort in working with the mental health population. Seventy-eight occupational therapy students participated in the program over four academic years. A case example of a student/participant mentoring relationship is provided. Results indicated that the occupational therapy students gained comfort with the population and competence in their clinical and research skills.

AB  - Objective. To determine if the service-learning components used at a convenience sample of schools and colleges of pharmacy meet the intent of the 2001 AACP Professional Affairs Committee (PAC) report. Methods. An online questionnaire was used to survey faculty members or staff involved with service-learning education at their school of pharmacy. Questions addressed aspects of service-learning including types of activities used, duration of student involvement with community partners, and association of learning objectives with service-learning activities. Results. The majority (85.3%) of respondents reported their institution used service-learning. Activities reported as part of service-learning ranged from working at health fairs to involvement with pharmacy school recruitment. More than half (64.3%) of service-learning activities involved long-term interactions with one community partner, and 74.1% of respondents indicated there was always an opportunity for student reflection on the service-learning activity. Conclusion. There is increasing though inconsistent application of PAC guidelines regarding service-learning.

AB  - Acquiring clinical experiences for students is a major challenge for nurse educators. One of the most difficult areas in which to secure clinical experiences is pediatric nursing; yet, nurse educators have a responsibility to create innovative strategies to assure that students have experience with pediatric clients. The purpose of this paper is to describe Girl Scout Badge Day (GSBD), a teaching strategy rooted in service learning. The strategy incorporates the three essential elements that distinguish service learning from other learning: experiential learning, reflection, and reciprocal learning. During this clinical experience, students provide health promotion education to scouts who subsequently earn badge requirements. Students are provided experiential learning as they implement the role of the teacher and reflect on the core values of nursing. In this paper, the specifics of implementing GSBD are presented and lessons learned are discussed. Benefits for students, scouts, troop leaders, and faculty are identified and improvements are suggested. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Authentic service learning in city schools helps students work toward important change in their own communities. Students are able to face and address issues that have an immediate impact on their neighbors and themselves. Two examples from Chicago neighborhoods illustrate how powerful the concept is: Students worked with a community organization to conduct a neighborhood canvassing project to promote an affordable housing ordinance that would create more housing opportunities for community members. Across town, students mobilized to educate residents about financial literacy and the resources and the support that were available to families that were at risk of losing their homes to foreclosure. Through such work, the students became actors in society, many for the first time. It was a powerful transformation. Service learning in an urban context is intimate. It is about responding to issues in the immediate community with an eye toward building the common good. Students can and should share in that common good. This article discusses how service-learning experiences enhance students' education when properly facilitated in a city classroom.

AB  - The increase in diverse populations with unique, culturally specific needs, along with the lack of diverse healthcare providers to deliver culturally competent care, has escalated the need for non-diverse practitioners to gain the knowledge, skills, and attitudes to deliver culturally competent care. Culturally competent care cannot be offered to patients unless nurses understand how cultural values, attitudes, and beliefs impact patients’ response to care. Nurses must develop cultural competence to accurately access, develop, and implement effective nursing interventions. The purpose of this exploratory, quasi-experimental, pretest-posttest study was to explore the impact of an intercultural service learning experience (domestic or international) on pre-licensure nursing students’ perceived development of transcultural self-efficacy. A convenience sample of senior semester nursing students enrolled in a private, faith-based, baccalaureate degree nursing program in the Midwest United States completed the Transcultural Self-Efficacy Tool (TSET), Cultural Competence Clinical Evaluation Tool-Student Version (CCCET-SV), and reflective journals. All students were immersed in an intercultural service learning experience. Eighteen students traveled domestically and 38 traveled internationally. The data revealed that there was not a statistical difference in TSET scores based on location of the intercultural experience. However, there was a statistically significant difference from pretest to posttest for perceived Cognitive, Practical, and Affective dimensions of transcultural self-efficacy, in change scores (pretest to posttest), and pretest to posttest for pre-licensure BSN students’ perceived clinical competence behaviors (culturally sensitive and professionally appropriate attitudes, values, and beliefs) following an intercultural service learning experience.

AB  - Service learning is recognized as a valuable pedagogy involving experiential learning, reflection, and reciprocal learning. Students develop critical thinking and social awareness by using the crucial activity of reflecting upon their experiential learning with community partners. The purpose of this paper is to demystify the process of reflection by identifying best practices to enhance reflection and offering suggestions for grading. By understanding ``the what{''} and ``the how{''} of reflection, educators can implement service learning experiences designed to include the essential component of reflection. Strategies for facilitating meaningful reflection are described including descriptions of what students should reflect upon and how to initiate reflection through writing, reading, doing, and telling. Grading rubrics are suggested to facilitate evaluation of student reflection. When properly implemented, service learning encourages students to be good citizens of the world. By using best practices associated with reflection, students can be challenged to think critically about the world and how their service can achieve community goals. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - To fulfill the Journal’s vision and fit its mission, JME (Journal of Management Education) encourages contributions that respond to important issues in management education regarding content or curriculum, processes of teaching and learning in management, the development of students as leaders and managers, and the contexts in which management education takes place. JME has long played a role in helping determine the content of management education, and the special issues listed above identify some of the more recent advances. In addition, questions regarding the connections between teaching and learning have also long been explored in the Journal’s pages. Indeed one major achievement that JME can be proud of is the legitimization of experiential learning in management education, including active learning, action-based learning, problem-based learning, project-based learning, and service learning, to name but some of the terms currently popular in our pages.

AB  - This book offers a six-step process for eliciting broader community involvement with schools in order to improve students' educational environment. The need for changing traditional practices is discussed in chapter 1, which describes various ways to ensure equity and access while also rebuilding public confidence and support for schools. Chapter 2 examines a structure for community involvement that begins with new understandings and commitments on the part of governing boards. It identifies six components that can serve as a guide for action plans to move from confrontation to collaboration. These six components are: (1) enhancement of K-12 curriculum; (2) expanded use of community facilities; (3) additional learning opportunities for youth; (4) lifelong learning for adults; (5) delivery and coordination of community services; and (6) community involvement in decision making. The third chapter reviews specific programs that describe the community's new role and involvement in schools, including volunteer programs, school-community partnerships, community service learning, school-to-work programs, and full-service schools. Chapter 4 evaluates specific programs that describe the school's new role and involvement in the community, including supplemental academic, enrichment, and recreation programs for children and adults. The fifth chapter presents school leaders with the call to action necessary for successful school-community involvement in the future. It offers guidelines for strategies to implement enhanced school-community relations and some specific applications. (Contains an annotated bibliography and 25 references.) (LMI)

AB  - Reviews the book, Doctors serving people: Restoring humanism to medicine through student community service by Edward J. Eckenfels (see record [rid]2008-02040-000[/rid]). Many in medical education feel that a core value has been lost over the last four decades. That value is true altruism. Doctors Serving People: Restoring Humanism to Medicine Through Student Community Service is a story of community service learning at Rush Medical School in Chicago that captures the essence of the altruistic impulse that made most of us want to become physicians. The Rush Community Service Initiatives Program (RCSIP) was designed as an elective community service learning (CSL) experience whose goal is to capture the desire to give to those less fortunate. It clearly shows that through RCSIP and other similar programs, those of us devoted to educating physicians who maintain a sense of being in a giving profession can maintain that sense of altruism. The author does a good job of building the foundation of explaining why the program exists, how it developed, and what it has accomplished. However, it is not until Chapter 9, the next to last chapter, that he unveils the true heart of the program. This is where the program and its effect on the South Chicago community come to life; it is here that the reader begins to feel that we all should be immersed in our communities.

AB  - The primary theme that emerges from this symposium is that teaching heterodox economics effectively becomes an exercise in creating a structure that facilitates sophisticated critical thinking via discovery-based learning. This can be done with carefully designed exercises or assignments that contrast mainstream and heterodox models, service learning experiences that ground students in real-world experiences, or the construction of course, curriculum and textbook designs that juxtapose mainstream and heterodox theories and ideas in sophisticated ways. We outline the major contributions of this symposium to the literature on teaching heterodox economics. Those summaries are followed by descriptions of some approaches we use in our own courses that promote sophisticated critical thinking in a multi-paradigmatic, discovery-based setting. The final section of the paper concludes and suggests future directions for research into heterodox teaching and pedagogy.

AB  - Service-learning partnerships between nursing programs and health care settings in vulnerable communities may be challenging to initiate, but can offer multiple benefits for students, faculty, and the community served. The aim of this qualitative descriptive study was to explore the benefits and challenges of establishing a service learning partnership between a university nursing program and an isolated community of internally-displaced persons in Medellin, Colombia. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with 10 nursing professors and nine students who participated in the service-learning partnership. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Main benefits identified were: learning about the social determinants of health, development of compassion, appreciation for the community nursing role, professional growth and development, community engagement and increased access to care for community members. Challenges related to the service-learning experience included feelings of moral distress, lack of value for community nursing, and conflict with traditional biomedical approaches to care. Several threats to program sustainability were also identified. Professors and students offered several recommendations for program improvement, including interdisciplinary collaboration, documentation and dissemination of the service-learning experience, increased community autonomy and capacity for self-care, and curricular changes to enhance recognition of the importance of community nursing.

AB  - This article reports on a longitudinal study of a two-semester middle school environmental learning course that departs from traditional Mexican expository pedagogies through the incorporation of experiential and service learning approaches. In the short term, course participants acquired a heightened awareness of environmental issues, augmented their environmental perceptions and consciousness, and complemented all this with environmentally responsible behaviours. Two years after completing the experiential course, students retained pro-environmental attitudes and behaviours and unexpectedly exhibited an expanded role in intergenerational learning. The research adds to the handful of studies in this cross-disciplinary field through qualitative methodologies that refine our understanding of the outcomes of experiential environmental learning.

AB  - Abstract: Although some point to the large effects of schooling on civic engagement (usually measured in terms of volunteering and participation in civic organizations) and social cohesion (usually measured in terms of social networks and relationship quality), the effects of schooling on social outcomes have not been estimated with the same rigor as the effects of schooling on labor-market outcomes, such as earnings. In particular, previous research has failed to consider (i) the many potential and often unobserved confounding factors (“endowments”) influencing both schooling and social outcomes, including family upbringing, innate characteristics, and personality, and (ii) the ways in which schooling pushes individuals in multiple directions simultaneously, including toward greater social engagement, but also toward more independent and market-driven pursuits. Using samples of unrelated persons, ordinary siblings, and identical twins, this study explores the effects of schooling on measures of civic engagement and social relationships, as well as labor-force earnings and labor-force participation. The siblings models reveal a more complex picture than typically suggested by standard individual estimates. On one hand, the results reveal a robust positive effect of schooling on earnings: well-schooled persons work more and earn more, albeit not as much as associations without control for endowments suggest. On the other hand, the results reveal more tenuous and occasionally negative effects of schooling on social outcomes. The effects of schooling on volunteering and membership in civic organizations, for example, disappear almost entirely with control for endowments. Also, within-identical-twins models reverse the positive effects of schooling on reports of support from friends, family, and coworkers. These results may reflect the tension schooling creates between market and non-market commitments, as well as between independence and interpersonal reliability. Schooling may, indeed, induce some pro-social behaviors, but schooling allows individuals choices of whether to pursue more personal interests as well.

AB  - Service-learning (SL) is a pedagogical approach in which students are assigned a course-related project in a not-for-profit organization, and are tasked to apply course content to execute the project. While the benefits are multifarious, only recently have supply chain management (SCM) courses adapted this innovative teaching methodology. The present article aims to popularize this pedagogical concept by providing a detailed overview of the background, development, implementation, and success of an SL project in an undergraduate SCM course; this serves as a "how to" guide for instructors interested in implementing the approach. Compelling evidence for the value of SL is provided by data assessing the students' learning experiences, and benefits for participating organizations are demonstrated. Caveats and challenges are noted, and ensuing best practices for SL are presented.

AB  - I compare students in two different data analysis courses: one course included a community-based learning (CBL) component and one did not. I find that students who chose to take the CBL course were more likely to have less mathematical and statistical background (as measured by the number of college-level mathematics and statistics courses and self-reporting), were more interested in community service, and wanted a statistics course that aligned closely with their career goals and aspirations. In comparison, students in the more traditional course had stronger mathematical and statistical skills, were more interested in a traditional course where they learned the methods from a variety of ``case-studies,{''} and had less time for and interest in a community project. The results of the comparison suggest that there is a place for both CBL and traditional courses and that students tend to appropriately self-select into the course that meets their needs. CBL courses may also be a good place to draw in students who might otherwise not choose to take a data analysis course in college.

AB  - The use of family support interventions to address the needs of at-risk families and children has proliferated over the last 2 decades. In particular, family support has been used to strengthen involvement of parents in their child's academic life as a means of preventing academic failure and other problem behaviors. This article presents empirical data from a field-based study of one leading family support model, Families and Schools Together (FAST), based on over 400 families served over a 4-year period. Child participants showed statistically significant declines in behavior problems, and their families showed improved adaptability and cohesion. Observations about program operations and the differential results for subgroups of children are also presented, along with the study limitations.

AB  - The opportunities school–community partnerships pose for students’ learning continue to generate the attention of educational stakeholders. Children learn through a variety of social and educational contexts, and the goals for student academic success are best achieved through the cooperation and support of schools, families, and communities. The purpose of this article is to examine several instructional approaches that use diverse contexts to facilitate students’ meaningful learning of academic subject matter: authentic instruction, problem-based learning, and service learning. Building upon the premise of a community of learners, school–community partnerships within each of these approaches are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - My paper elaborates on Putnam's (2000) assertion that working class voluntary associations serve as "schools for democracy" by developing the civic capacity of their members. Drawing on original survey and qualitative data gathered from Latino immigrant parents who belong to a Los Angeles labor union, I will discuss how labor union participation, within the context of a revitalized labor movement, relates to parents' civic engagement in their children's schools. Regression analysis of survey data reveals that labor union participation is positively associated with political forms of school-based civic engagement, namely involvement in school decision-making meetings and school improvement efforts. Meanwhile, qualitative data show how labor union participation provides Latino immigrant parents with confidence and problem-solving, advocacy, and organizing skills that enable them to act upon their interests and concerns within the school context. Findings suggest that labor union participation contributes to the political incorporation of Latino immigrant parents and helps them overcome barriers to civic engagement. ..PAT.-Unpublished Manuscript [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Conference Papers -- American Sociological Association is the property of American Sociological Association and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

AB  - Nursing faculty are confronted with the need to design community learning activities with vulnerable populations to prepare students for nursing practice. The creation of sustainable academic-community partnerships with agencies providing care to underserved populations meets this challenge. This article describes the development and implementation of a foot care clinic in a homeless shelter, created through a model of curricular integration, faculty engagement, and a long-term academic-community partnership. A transformative pedagogical approach based on service-learning was used to facilitate student understanding of social justice through activities that promote citizenship, develop advocacy skills, and increase knowledge and skills related to the role of the public health nurse in the community. The process of designing and developing a community clinical learning activity and the essential components for sustainability are discussed. Student outcomes are addressed. Recommendations for implementing a foot care clinic within an academic-community partnership are outlined.

AB  - What drives differences across countries in levels of civic engagement? Both the United States and Japan have been described as having high levels of civic engagement, but a variety of measures show that the type of involvement that is most common varies. Americans join and contribute to national political groups, but membership in PTAs and volunteer firefighting units is low and declining. Japanese participate at a much lower level in national advocacy organizations, but they join local neighborhood associations at very high rates, participate extensively in PTAs, and volunteer to clean up neighborhood parks. This article seeks to unravel why Japanese have such high rates of local civic engagement by examining how parents and volunteers have mobilized to maintain high rates of walking to and from school during a period in which walk-to-school rates have plummeted in the United States. The higher rate of Japanese local engagement in this area, I argue, is motivated by housing markets that limit residential mobility to much lower levels than in the United States. High cost of residential “exit” in Japan drives citizens to exercise “voice” to maintain the safety and walkability of their neighborhoods.

AB  - There is a case to be made for the integration of the Project Based Service Learning (PBSL) process and the design and construction of educational facilities. A growing body of research supports the notion that the formulaic educational system of the last hundred years may no longer serve the learning styles of new and future generations. Their cognitive processes have been transformed by technology, which encompasses much of their lives. Global realities are rapidly changing as people compete for limited resources with developing countries. In this context, service learning is a teaching and learning strategy that integrates meaningful community service with instruction and reflection to enrich the learning experience and teach civic responsibility. As such, PBSL has become a prime teaching and learning strategy in the educator's pedagogical toolbox, quite simply because it works. In this article, the authors argue that Project Based Service Learning offers students a unique opportunity to succeed in a technologically driven learning environment.

AB  - Purpose – This paper aims to present the implications of discussing the economic concepts relevant to student projects within the international program Students in Free Enterprise (SIFE) and to discuss them as a teaching strategy that provides a simple but effective way to break the hegemony of market fundamentalism.Design/methodology/approach – The paper proposes using opportunities provided by the SIFE program to start the teaching of economics from a novel perspective: start with whatever project the students propose to undertake and support the students in examining the relevant economic concepts, strictly following SIFE's own assessment criterion: "Considering the relevant economic, social and environmental factors, which SIFE team most effectively empowered people in need by applying business and economic concepts and an entrepreneurial approach to improve their quality of life and standard of living?".Findings – Asking which economic concepts are relevant to a particular project that effectively empowers people in need sidesteps the discussion of restrictive assumptions presented as principles of economics. Asking this question facilitates the introduction of those elements of heterodox traditions that are relevant to the projects in question.Originality/value – The paper investigates implications of a radical shift in perspective to one grounded in a project of interest to students and one focusing on economic concepts that are relevant to the project. This shift allows students and their teachers to break the hegemony of economic principles in so far as the reality of the students' project is already beyond these restrictive assumptions.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to describe a series of techniques for teaching students about groups. Vygotsky’s social constructivism is used as a theoretical framework to understand the ways that students acquire knowledge about groups. After a brief discussion of this framework, we turn to a discussion of five specific pedagogical techniques for teaching small group and teamwork principles. These techniques include (a) carefully assigning group membership, (b) using a grading structure that incorporates individual, group, and peer evaluation assessment, (c) testing students individually and in groups, (d) asking students to write two papers that require an analysis and synthesis of both readings and observations, and (e) requiring a comprehensive service learning project from students that requires their collaboration for successful completion. The last portion of the article describes the challenges of using each of these techniques and the typical results of their application. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The Introduction to Sustainability course at the University of Iowa seeks to educate the aware, informed and action-oriented sustainable citizen. A phenomenographic analysis and retrospective pretest were utilized to determine how students formed conceptions of sustainability as a result of completing the course. The study indicated that student conceptions of sustainability can be characterized by the ``aware, informed and action-oriented{''} spectrum. In written reflections following service-learning experiences, students provided ample examples of ``awareness moments{''} where they expressed a first encounter with a wicked problem. In these same reflections, students provided examples of being able to move beyond awareness toward an action-orientation. Many students that were called to action through a service-learning experience expressed hesitation regarding their level of knowledge regarding certain issues. But, many students with this hesitation decided their next action step would be to become more informed. Therefore, even when confronted by a sustainability issue or dilemma that students felt were beyond their knowledge level, they many times expressed an action pathway to become more informed. By challenging student thought processes and exposing the immediate need for global change, the Introduction to Sustainability course empowered students to become aware, informed, and action-oriented sustainable citizens.

AB  - We present the results of a literature review of studies on teaching strategies for moral education in secondary schools (1995-2003). The majority of the studies focus on the "what" and "why", i.e. the objectives, of curriculum-oriented moral education. Attention to the instructional formats for enhancing the prosocial and moral development of students (the "how") is relatively sparse. Most studies on teaching strategies for moral education recommend a problem-based approach to instruction whereby students work in small groups. This approach gives room for dialogue and interaction between students, which is considered to be crucial for their moral and prosocial development. Other studies discuss more specific teaching methods, such as drama and service learning. We conclude that the theoretical discourses on moral education are not reflected on the practice of curriculum-oriented moral education and its effects on students' learning outcomes. We recommend that future research on curriculum-oriented moral education includes the subject areas encompassing moral issues and the social differences between students. (Contains 10 notes.)

AB  - This supplement contains five unit summaries on service learning that were developed during the 1996 summer institutes conducted by the Social Science Education Consortium (SSEC) for teams of middle school teachers selected from the western United States. Each unit summary in the supplement has been developed to correspond in style to unit summaries provided in SSEC's publication, "Service Learning in the Middle School Curriculum: A Resource Book," which was developed from SSEC's National Science Foundation funded project on service learning. The units selected for this supplement represent a variety of topics areas and curriculum enhancements: (1) "ACHES (Adolescent and Community Health Education Squad)"; (2) "Earth Inc."; (3) "Student Action for the Environment (SAFE Project)"; (4) "Trash Bashers"; and (5) "Where's Waldport?" The supplement notes that the units include more language arts and mathematics involvement than the units in the original book. In addition, the supplement also presents other ideas linking language arts and service: (1) "Biographies"; (2) "Novels for Young People"; (3) "Poetry"; (4) "Reading to Younger Children"; (5) "Research Papers"; and (6) "Writing/Speaking." The supplement concludes with a list of current resources on service learning published since SSEC's original book was completed in 1996. (BT)

AB  - This staff development handbook is intended to help teachers and other professionals prepare, design, and lead staff development programs for middle school educators interested in augmenting their curriculums with service. Designed to be used as a comprehensive guide to planning and delivering staff development training, the book suggests a thorough outline and numerous training strategies for planning and conducting service learning training at the middle school level. The book is written for teachers who desire to introduce and train colleagues in the service learning methodology. The book assumes that the would-be trainers have:(1) experience in planning and developing curriculum-based service projects in their own classrooms and schools and (2) little or no experience in creating and conducting staff development training. Based on these two assumptions, the book does not provide extensive background "on" service learning but rather focuses on preparing, designing, and leading staff development training "in" service learning.

AB  - Service-learning has been shown to have benefits for both students and faculty, however, it is quite rare in the mathematics classroom. At Concordia University Irvine we have established a relationship with the Village of Hope--a local non-profit organization designed to help homeless families transition to a self-sufficient status via temporary housing and training programs. We provide tutoring for the elementary-aged children at the Village of Hope as a service-learning component of our non-major mathematics courses. This article provides details on: connections to classroom learning; reflective written and oral components with rubrics; benefits for the student, faculty member, and university; and challenges and considerations, on and off campus, required in setting up such an opportunity. Supplementary materials are available for this article. Go to the publisher's online edition of "PRIMUS" to view the supplemental file. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - This study discusses my attempt to improve educational experiences of fifth-grade students living in public housing. Through reconstruction of my thought processes while teaching and learning with students, the context of social justice-oriented teaching and classroom complexity is revealed. A narrative portrayal emerges demonstrating the impact our theorizing together had on our growth, outlook, and learning in an effort to make substantive change in the community. Although this curriculum was not explicitly grounded in a service learning framework, the processes, activities, and results of the classroom simplify the potential and possibilities of a justice and service oriented elementary classroom. Reflections of classroom occurrences and struggles I engaged in privately and with students are conveyed through vignettes of the change-focused, integrated curriculum based on students' priority concerns--particularly the attempt to replace their dilapidated school. The role of theorizing with students and curriculum realizing democratic principles in a poor neighborhood is depicted.

In this article we discuss the way internships and service projects are conducted in a child and family development program at a Midwestern urban university. We also offer student and site supervisor evaluations of these experiences and discuss three specific projects that had many benefits for all those involved.

With the election of 2016 coming in the fall, it provides rich opportunities for discussions, classroom lessons, and community service opportunities for students and teachers alike.

AB  - Pharmacists are interdisciplinary health providers involved in the psychosocial dynamics of pharmaceutical care. Pharmacy students can best learn these dynamics when educators integrate the scientific and interpersonal aspects of care. This paper illustrates how social workers can partner with pharmacy faculty members to strengthen the psychosocial and interpersonal content of the pharmacy curriculum. Service-learning is a promising vehicle for engaging pharmacy students. Students' reflections indicated that they believed this service-learning course developed their understanding of the social issues that influence their provision of health care. Pharmacy students value experiential learning, reflection activities, and group discussion that enable a supportive and nonjudgmental exploration of stereotypes. These pharmacy students developed their empathy and professional commitment, which will benefit the public. They incorporated a sense of social responsibility into their profession through team visits to residents of a federally subsidized housing facility. Through in-class evaluations and pretests and posttests, the students expressed their changing attitudes toward a group of people who represented a population of future patients. There is educational benefit from integrating a strong commitment to science with a strong sense of civic responsibility.

AB  - The key to expansion of service-learning at the K-12 level is the development of education programs that effectively prepare teachers in the pedagogy and practice of service and civic engagement. While many countries around the world are experimenting with various approaches, Singapore has initiated a program that mandates service-learning as an integral part of their preparation of teachers' values, skills, and knowledge. Using a variety of approaches and courses, especially a required class in group endeavors in service-learning, preservice teachers spend up to 9 months developing and implementing a service-learning project with schools and community organizations. Quantitative and qualitative studies reveal that the effort is having a positive effect with preservice teachers, enriching their civic attitudes and ability to carry out group service learning projects.

AB  - Service Learning (SL) is a pedagogy aimed at combining academic studies and volunteer community action. The advantages of SL are numerous and are discussed elsewhere. The article points to some of the less studied aspects of service learning programs: the price that students pay for their volunteer service in the community. The discussion will be based on experiences of students in a Community Interpreting course in an Israeli University, where bilingual students volunteer as interpreters in public institutions and NGOs. In their reflective reports from 2008 - 2011, the students reveal problems encountered in marketing their cultural capital, facing bureaucracy, coping with difficult emotional situations and cultural differences, and handling ethical dilemmas. The study will conclude with possible explanations for these negative effects, and offer suggestions of ways for the organizers of the volunteer work - be they faculty, volunteer coordinators or NGOs, to help volunteers give more and pay less. Adapted from the source document.

Linked to the theme of knowledge construction, diffusion, and transformation, this article outlines a curricular approach that encourages a broader understanding of societal issues. Questions of reflective practice and program implementation will also be addressed.

AB  - In this article, we turn the tripartite responsibility of teaching, scholarship, and service inside out. Rather than considering service to be a poor stepchild to scholarship and teaching, we reason that service as engaged scholarship should be the centerpiece of academic life, especially in an applied discipline like parks, recreation, and tourism. We reason further that improving engaged service should be the driving force behind good teaching, student learning, and scholarship. Finally, we reason that impact factor, a term commonly limited to citations in scholarly journals, should be expanded to include positive differences made on the ground in professional practice as well as scholarly presentations and publications that display the value of the scholarship of engagement and the scholarship on teaching and learning.

AB  - Hypothesizing that metaphoric portrayals of students as consumers/customers should cause consternation, this paper constitutes a pragmatic examination of metaphor and focuses on how the choice of metaphors implicates policies and practices. It begins by tracing the philosophical development of the description of students as consumers/customers, and explains its antithetical nature with relation to the service-learning initiative. The paper suggests that several alternative metaphoric possibilities and invigoration of participatory learning may reduce the pernicious implications of the student-as-customer metaphor, through such practices as enriching the metaphoric repertoire surrounding education and broadening the vision of students by recognizing their roles in service-learning.

AB  - Service-learning places students and educational institutions in direct contact with surrounding communities, teaches them greater appreciation for persons of different social privileges, and helps them to recognize the necessity of social intervention in distributing the benefits of democracy. Service-learning is inherently democratizing by combating the separation of higher education from its beneficiaries, and by avoiding the social stratification that new technologies can bring. Including a service component in education can offset the individualistic focus of technologized learning and encourages students to take responsibility for how they and their classmates learn.

AB  - This essay places service-learning within the liberal arts tradition of empowering others to help themselves. Such a contextualization departs from visions of the student as consumer or customer and education as a means to gain economic advantage in a competitive market. Attention then turns to how even well-intentioned service-learning projects might be co-opted in ways that foster community dependence on the services offered. Recommendations are included for a version of service-learning that navigates between political indoctrination and value-free objectivity. (Contains 54 references.) (Author/RS)

AB  - This essay addresses how to cope with several potential barriers to implementing effective service-learning projects. The discussion builds on experiences of developing and refining service-learning in upper-division communication courses. Difficulties arise in three areas: the institutional and physical setting, student attitudes, and community partners. Challenges in the setting include coping with rural environments with few community resources and with centralized vs. diffused administration of service-learning programs. Student attitudinal issues include reinforcement of existing prejudices, persistent elitism, and misplaced measures of the value of service-learning. Community partner factors address selecting appropriate tasks for student volunteers and dealing with the strains that service-learning places on organizational infrastructure. The paper concludes by reflecting on the most effective ways to integrate service-learning with active civic engagement. Paradoxically, the goal of service-learning may be to render itself unnecessary by developing the social structures to redress social injustice.

AB  - This chapter will explore Ontario secondary school students' reflections of their distant and direct interactions with service recipients during the completion of mandatory community involvement hours. In September 1999, the Government of Ontario instituted this community involvement requirement—whereby all secondary school students must complete 40 hours of community involvement in order to graduate—in an effort to 'encourage students to develop awareness and understanding of civic responsibility and the role they can play in supporting and strengthening their communities.' However, while Ontario's community involvement requirement is a mandatory program for all secondary school students, procedures for its completion are loosely regulated by the Ministry of Education. Students are provided the autonomy to choose where, when and how they will complete their community involvement hours. Furthermore, these activities are performed outside of school hours and without teacher supervision. In this context, students across the province participate in a wide and diverse range of community involvement activities, the selection of which is largely dependent on the personal contexts and desires of the server. Furthermore, unlike many service-learning programs in the United States, Ontario's community involvement requirement allots no avenue for formal preparation or structured reflection in a classroom setting. When students reach their minimum hours, they simply fill out their school board's prescribed completion form and provide verifying signatures from on-location supervisors. Given these parameters, students' differential access to time, resources and social networks may markedly influence the types of community involvement activities in which they participate, and therefore, the extent of their interaction with service recipients.

AB  - Based on the assumption that all young people and their communities would benefit from students' active participation in community endeavours, some Canadian provinces and US states have included community involvement activities graduation requirement. Debates continue over whether students should be "forced" to volunteer. Ontario's 40-hour community involvement requirement is an interesting case study because of the level of autonomy it affords to students, who are free to choose how they will complete their community involvement hours. By contrast, most U.S. programs use a "service-learning" model, which focuses on furthering students' understanding of social problems through community-based and classroom learning opportunities. A study involving 50 current and recently graduated Ontario secondary school students from widely divergent socio-economic settings found that, while students may donate equal amounts time, they do not have equal access to meaningful community involvement placements. Socio-economic status influences the time, resources and social networks available to students, and therefore the types of community involvement open to them. (Contains 8 endnotes)

AB  - As noted by Kolb's (1984) experiential learning theory, adults learn best through experiences. Typically delivered in a traditional, face-to-face classroom setting, service-learning integrates the knowledge learned in the classroom with real-world experience and community service. E-service-learning, service-learning delivered in part or entirely online, is uniquely positioned to provide adult students in online programs with access to service-learning opportunities that might not be as available to them in traditional settings. Although e-service-learning can increase access to service-learning opportunities for adult students in online programs, it is unclear if there are differences in experiences and learning outcomes attainment for students who participate in online service compared to those who participate in service on-site. This study utilized a cross-sectional, concurrent, mixed-methods design to examine the experiences of adult students (n = 112) who participated in either on-site or online service. Of the six learning outcome measures examined, a one-way ANOVA revealed a statistically significant difference in learning outcome attainment in civic responsibility. Students who participated in on-site service reported higher learning outcome attainment in civic responsibility than did their online peers. An analysis of the qualitative data showed that students in online and on-site service shared similar experiences. The quantitative and qualitative data established that participants in this study had similar service experiences regardless of online or on-site delivery.

AB  - Service learning projects serve as a valuable tool for applying course concepts in a way to benefit both the students and community. However, they often require a significant amount of additional effort beyond that required of assigning conventional homework problems. When the projects take place in an online course setting, the level of complexity subsequently increases. Valuing the overall contribution of such projects, in light of their additional instructor and course costs, can be difficult. Such valuations are further complicated with the measures being subjective. In 1992, Drs. Robert Kaplan and David Norton published an article in Harvard Business Review detailing a model for measuring the effect of multiple perspectives, both financial and subjective, on business performance (Kaplan & Norton, 1992). The Balanced Scorecard approach provides both an internal (process based) and external (outcomes based) standpoint to evaluating an organization utilizing four perspectives: (1) Learning and Growth, (2) Business Process, (3) Customer and (4) Financial (Kaplan & Norton, 1996). With its thorough approach to evaluating objective and subjective measures of business performance, the model serves as a potential framework for use in the educational setting. In this article, the author developed and applied a modified version of Kaplan and Norton's Balanced Scorecard model to evaluate the value generated by a service learning project in an online course.

AB  - This paper describes the implementation and evaluation of a new pediatric pharmacotherapy elective course. Unique aspects of this course included a significant service-learning component (minimum of 20 hours at a child-focused site), active-learning strategies, and absence of formal written examinations. Primary goals of the course were to limit traditional lectures and focus on student-centered discussion. Weekly preparatory assignments, journal writing, journal club, and student presentations were included. The course was highly rated by students, particularly in learning processes used and course format (mean scores >4/5). Students indicated they were encouraged toward active participation and challenged to think critically. Implementation of an elective pediatric pharmacotherapy course with significant active- and service-based learning components fosters student learning and civic responsibility and provides positive benefits to the community.

AB  - The bottom line in academics feeling uncomfortable about regarding students as customers is the impression that from a marketing view 'the customer is always right'. While Australian universities have not yet undergone a 'customer care revolution', it is important that educators and educational managers better understand how a marketing perspective can assist them to operate effectively within a market environment. Good service provision does not necessarily mean 'doing everything the customer wants' so much as bringing the expectations of the service provider and the customer closely into line. As an important first step towards doing so, educators and educational managers would do well to devote more attention to ascertaining just what the expectations of their customers are. The literature on professional services marketing distinguishes the professional service in question from the manner in which it is marketed. To be taken seriously in ongoing policy debates regarding the transformation of higher education academics might do well to develop a greater professionalisation as educators in addition to that as subject experts.

AB  - In the three decades since Title IX guaranteed equal opportunity for the sexes in educational athletic programs, women's involvement in high school and college sports has increased dramatically. Still, women lag behind men in participation rates, and more girls than boys drop out of sports during adolescence. Here, Scott and Derry describe "Women IN Their Bodies," a college-level interdisciplinary Women's Studies seminar that integrates traditional classroom techniques and experiential learning sessions to educate students about the ways in which bodily objectification and the social construction of femininity interfere with women's participation in sports and other activities that are beneficial for their physical learning objectives.

AB  - In service learning, students learn skills and apply their knowledge while addressing an identified community need. Service learning is especially powerful in special education as students with disabilities are allowed the opportunity to give, instead of receive, help and support, and therefore gain independence and self-esteem. This article outlines the steps involved in implementing a service learning project within a special education classroom.

AB  - Pedagogical and scholarly discussions of the process of usability tend to focus more on methods than on practices, or specific, tactical performances of and adjustments to these methods. Yet such practices shape students' learning and determine the success of their usability efforts. A teacher research study tracking students' understanding and enactment of usability and user-centered design over the course of a service-learning project illustrates the importance of practice-level struggles—and the thoughtful preparation for and facilitation of these struggles—to the development of students' flexible intelligence (metis) and rhetorical translation skills.

This integrated approach links three core curriculum courses directly to the community and social policy through service-learning projects. At the same time, it reinforces the social work commitment to social justice by fostering student advocacy, interest, and involvement in macro and social policy issues while developing macro-level practice skills and increasing civic engagement. Course content with a sample student project, implementation issues, and implications for social work education are addressed with this curriculum model.

AB  - Maria Montessori understood that, innately, children feel connected to humanity, and recognized that children appreciate opportunities to serve others. This is an important connection that parents and teachers need to continue to nourish in students, providing opportunities for those meaningful connections. But what if, in addition to feeling good through providing service to others, a school's service project could be integrated with the curriculum, bringing in experts to encourage writing, dancing, science experiments, art, and, possibly, careers? That is just what happened when Wilmington Montessori School partnered with Power Up Gambia's education program. Power Up Gambia is a nonprofit organization founded by Kathryn Cunningham, a premed student who volunteered in a hospital in the Gambia in 2006 and was appalled by the consequences of the hospital's lack of power. Cunningham returned home to Pennsylvania and founded Power Up Gambia to provide solar panels to the hospital. When the Power Up Gambia project was first presented to Wilmington Montessori, there was an immediate connection. Linda Zankowsky, Wilmington Montessori's head of school, said, "We recognized early on that Power Up Gambia's education program could provide a wonderful enrichment to our cultural curriculum for our 6-9- and 9-12-year-old classes for the year--they were focusing on the continent of Africa. Within the Power Up Gambia program, the cultural curriculum was completely represented, including the continent study of Africa, the arts, and sciences." Zankowsky also appreciated the education program's value to her school.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the difference in the ageism beliefs, including the antilocution, discrimination, and avoidance factors, of nursing students who experience community service learning activities with healthy older adults verses community service learning activities with only ill or disabled older adults. In this research, an active older adult was defined as a person who can compete in vigorous athletic events. It was not known if there was a significant difference in ageism beliefs between nursing students in the State of Utah who participated in a community service learning activity of interacting with active older adults who can compete in vigorous athletic events at the Huntsman World Senior Games (HWSG) and those students who interacted with only ill or disabled older adults. This quantitative research examined this difference based on Kolb’s Theory of Experiential Learning which postulates that learning happens as a person experiences the world. A link to the Fraboni Scale of Ageism (FSA) and demographic data was sent via email to students from three schools of nursing of which 170 students responded. The results showed significantly higher levels of ageism in the discrimination factor of the FSA for those students who participated in the games (M = 16.36, SD = 2.99) than for those who did not (M = 15.40, SD = 2.69), t(168) = 2.17, p = .03. Women had lower ageism scores (M = 51.30, SD = 0.04) than men ( M = 56.81, SD = 7.92), t(168) = –3.38, p = .001. No significant differences between community service groups were found for total FSA, antilocution, or avoidance (p > .05).

AB  - In 2000, Oral Health in America: A Report of the Surgeon General identified disparities in oral health and access to care for vulnerable populations, including children. The report identified a declining dental school applicant pool, shortages of dental school faculties, and an overcrowded curriculum as dental education factors affecting disparities. Dental school applications are up, but the dentist/population ratio is projected to decline, and the shortage of dental faculty has worsened-limiting dental students' experiences with children. Current Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA) standards do not include essential curriculum required to care for children. We recommend that CODA revisions to predoctoral and postdoctoral programs include care of infants, characteristics of children that distinguish them from adults, mandatory service learning experiences, emphasis upon social responsibility for all dentists, and use of objective standardized clinical examinations (OSCEs). Additionally, we recommend prioritization of limited pediatric dental resources to young children with disease and older children with complex dental requirements or special health care needs. Critical dental education goals for children should be developed through a special American Dental Education Association task force. Only the dental education community can assure that the dental workforce is better trained to care for children.

AB  - This paper discusses the effects of the type of project undertaken for a community practice course on preservice teachers' conceptualization of service learning. The goal of the projects is to enable participants to engage with service practice in a reflective manner. Through the examination of the reflective logs kept by students using Butin's framework and by comparing the themes that emerged, it was found that differences in the experiences of students, which reflected the project content and the characteristics of the children being served, created different learning outcomes for each group of students.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To achieve high participation rates and a representative sample, active parent consent procedures require a significant investment of study resources. The purpose of this article is to describe processes and outcomes of utilizing active parent consent procedures with sixth-grade students from urban, ethnically diverse, economically disadvantaged K-8 public schools involved in an evaluation of a middle school service-learning program. METHODS: As part of the evaluation of the Lead Peace-Plus service-learning program, active parent consent was obtained for participation in school-based health surveys conducted with sixth graders in 3 schools. To achieve acceptable rates of parent permission, we employed multiple procedures including regular communication with school staff, incentives for involved schools and teachers, a multipronged approach for reaching parents, and direct encouragement of students to return forms through repeated classroom visits, individual and classroom incentives. We used Fisher's exact tests to compare selected characteristics among students whose parents weren't reached, those whose parents refused, and those whose parents consented to survey participation. RESULTS: We achieved a parent response rate of 94.6% among sixth-grade students. No significant differences in student gender, race/ethnicity, school, or free/reduced lunch status were identified across parent consent status groups. Rates of absenteeism were significantly higher (p = .03) among students whose parents weren't reached compared to other groups. CONCLUSIONS: Employing a multifaceted active parent consent campaign can result in high rates of parental response with limited sampling bias among an urban, ethnically diverse and economically disadvantaged group of middle school students.

AB  - In teaching beginning students for over 20 years, we have found that the beginning clinical year provides the foundation for developing students' critical thinking skills. The paradigm shift in education from a training mode to an educative mode enables students to become active versus passive learners. We believe that critical thinking is a major component of the nursing curriculum and that the development of critical thinking should start with beginning nursing students. Students at this level provide faculty with an ideal opportunity to foster the development of critical thinking skills. The purpose of this chapter is to provide a discussion of active teaching/learning strategies for helping students develop critical thinking in both the classroom and the clinical setting. Some strategies include Socratic questioning, clinical journal writing, service learning activities, peer review activities, and a playful activity called dressing up nursing diagnoses to learn the nursing process.

AB  - This article profiles librarian Clara Chu, associate professor in the University of California at Los Angeles's (UCLA) Department of Information Studies. "What can I, as a multilingual Peruvian-born Chinese Canadian and U.S. resident, offer to library and information research?" asks Chu. The answer: "I can challenge those who look at people through a single ethnic or racial lens." Having helped her relatives navigate bureaucracies in their new country and language, she learned at age ten that accurate information is vital for a cultural minority's survival and success. Now Chu asks her students to understand the full meaning of their ethical duty to serve all members of their community. A course she introduced on "Ethics, Diversity, and Change in the Information Professions" includes service-learning opportunities with underserved communities. This helps students understand the importance of community collaboration and outreach.

AB  - Barack Obama has been president only four months, but already his name is cropping up on schools, other buildings and avenues across the country. The most recent example is in St. Paul, where the school board voted Tuesday night to change the name of Webster Magnet Elementary, which had honored Daniel Webster, to Barack and Michelle Obama Service Learning Elementary. The push to change the name came from the school's third graders and was backed by other pupils, parents and some members of the staff. But most of the staff and some local residents opposed it, questioning the aptness of naming the school for someone still in office.

AB  - This study examined the outcomes of an innovative first-year programme that incorporated both macro-focused field training and service learning into the curriculum. The findings among fifty-six students show that, even though they ascribed greater importance to social work values at the end of the school year than they had at the beginning, their interest and perceived competence in both micro and macro practice decreased. So did their estimation of the congruence between social work and social action. The decline in their estimation of the congruence and in their perceived competence to engage in macro-level practice emerged as significant predictors of the students' interest in engaging in macro-level practice. Implications for social work education are discussed.

AB  - With help from a grant from the Corporation for National Service, service learning was infused into four classes of a graduate gerontology course, Aging Well. Thirty-one students were paired with 31 older adults for a period of up to twenty hours. The impact on the emotional and social wellness of the older adults was assessed through student journals, electronic e-mail reflection, and the administration of a survey to older adults. A quantitative assessment of the older adults was attempted using the Life Satisfaction in the Elderly Scale and the Geriatric Depression Scale. Analysis indicated that the service provided to the older adult had a positive impact on their emotional and social wellness.

AB  - School-based interventions for young people with emotional/mental health problems are often provided by external practitioners and their relationship with host schools is a key influence on implementation. Poor integration within school systems, schools’ tendency to define interventions around pupils’ behaviour and teachers’ control over access, may undermine therapeutic relationships. This study examines how one school-based intervention—Bounceback—addressed these challenges. Methods comprised interviews with programme staff, school staff and service users. Bounceback sought to develop therapeutic relationships through creating a safe, welcoming place and maximising pupils’ choice about how they engaged with it. To ensure Bounceback was delivered as intended, staff developed five conditions which schools were asked to meet: adhering to referral criteria, ensuring that attendance was voluntary, appropriate completion of referral forms, mechanisms for contacting pupils and private accommodation to maintain confidentiality. Pupils reported high levels of acceptability and described relationships of trust with Bounceback staff. Although pupils had choice about most aspects of Bounceback, teachers controlled access to it, partly in order to manage demand. The study highlights the need for external agencies to communicate their aims and needs clearly to schools and the importance of peripatetic practitioners being well integrated within their parent organisations.

AB  - Service-learning, one of the most common forms of experiential education, has been heralded as a way to connect the classroom with the broader community while eschewing positivist methods of teaching, and cultivating civic engagement in students. But what is being lost in the movement to institutionalize service-learning? In a time of radical inequality, educators may unwittingly reproduce the status quo through their emphasis on charity-oriented service-learning. This chapter argues that justice-oriented approaches that spur social activism are needed. With specific focus on how service-learning is framed in dietetics education in the United States, we posit that dietetics educators must reclaim service-learning as a critical tool that provides a platform to engage students in examining questions of equity, diversity, and social justice relevant to health, wellness, and the food and nutrition profession.

The SERVE Program is a community service learning program sponsored jointly by Ignatius University's philosophy and theology departments. Through a mixed methods research design, the authors found that Ignatius University students participating in the SERVE Program demonstrated statistically significant increases in their expected political voice in comparison with peers in a control group. Qualitative interviews with SERVE participants revealed that the program increased students' awareness of political and social issues; heightened their commitment to philanthropy; fostered their interest in pursuing socially responsible work; and strengthened their commitment to working for social change.

AB  - Background/Context: Over the past two decades, more than 200 studies have been published on the effects of community service learning on university students. However, the majority of these studies have focused on the effects of such programming on White and affluent college students, and few have considered whether there are differential effects for participants depending on their racial and ethnic backgrounds. This study considered these differential effects in both the academic and experiential components of such programming. Participants: This study compared the experiences of 244 White students and 118 students of color participating in a community service learning program at Beacon University (a pseudonym) during the 2008-2009 academic year. Intervention: The Social Action Program is a community service learning program sponsored by Beacon University's philosophy department that seeks to educate participating students about social injustice. The academic component of the program is a year long course that includes interdisciplinary readings from the humanities and social sciences as well as weekly lectures and a discussion section. Participating students also spend 10 hours each week for the entire academic year at one of approximately 50 different service placements focused on antipoverty efforts. Research Design: Mixed-methods research design involving quantitative analyses (analysis of covariance) of pre-post surveys and qualitative analyses of hour-long semistructured interviews. Results: Students of color participating in the community service learning program characterized the academic component of the program as offering a weaker sense of community than did their White classmates, and many expressed a reluctance to engage in race discussions with their classmates or to respond to perspectives they perceived as nave, inaccurate, or offensive. Conclusions: Even university courses and programming explicitly designed to disrupt White privilege can inadvertently be normed to serve the interests, experiences, and learning goals of White students. Such reification of White privilege comes with a significant cost; the learning of all students is diminished when diverse perspectives are not fully represented or heard.

AB  - This article examines the benefits of a student run free clinic (SRFC) as a service learning experience for students in medicine, pharmacy, occupational therapy, physical therapy and physician assistant programs. We hypothesized that students who participate in an interprofessional service learning course and volunteer at a SRFC would demonstrate significant increases in perceptions and attitudes for working in interprofessional health care teams and clinical reasoning skills compared to students who did not participate. Three assessments were administered to an experimental and control group of pre-clinical students from medical, occupational therapy, physical therapy, pharmacy and physician assistant programs before and after participation in an interprofessional service-learning course and volunteering at the SRFC. The tools were the Interdisciplinary Education Perception Scale (IEPS), Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale (RIPLS) and the Self-Assessment of Clinical Reflection and Reasoning (SACRR). Students who completed the course had improvements in interprofessional perceptions and attitudes (p = 0.03) and perceptions of clinical reasoning skills when compared to the control group (p = 0.002). This study is novel as it examined students’ perceptions of interprofessional attitudes and clinical reasoning following participation in an interprofessional service-learning course and participation in a SRFC.

AB  - In 1995, the Health Professions Schools in Service to the Nation (HPSISN) program was launched under the auspices of the Pew Health Professions Commission as a national demonstration of an innovative Form of community-based education called service-learning, The foundation of service-learning is a balanced partnership between communities and health professions schools and a balance between serving the community and meeting defined learning objectives. This article offers a definition of service-learning and an outline of its core concepts; it also describes how service - learning differs from traditional clinical education in the health professions. Further, the author discusses how service-learning programs may benefit students, faculty, communities, higher education institutions, and the relationships among all these stakeholders. The article concludes with brief descriptions of recommended resources for integrating service-learning into the medical school curriculum.

AB  - This study identified the meanings six middle school teachers constructed around community service-learning that might guide its philosophy and practices. Starting with a belief that community service-learning has the potential to be an empowering pedagogy, the researcher addressed teachers' perceptions of teaching and learning, service-learning as defined within the school's context, and contrasted teachers' purposes for service-learning with their students' perceptions of their service experiences. On a pilot survey, six teachers from two middle schools responded that their students "made most of the decisions" about their service-learning projects. Data came from observations in classrooms and service sites as well as teacher interviews and from one adult project advisor. Information was organized as five case studies of service-learning projects. After their completion, participating students were surveyed and/or interviewed about their perceptions of service-learning. Teachers in the study perceived and practiced service-learning, based on the school's concept of community service-learning, teachers' personal and professional values, and the quality of teacher preparation around CSL as a pedagogy. Flexible, student-centered schools that provided teachers with autonomy around curriculum development accommodated CSL more easily than inflexible school programs mandating service-learning. Teachers who elected to practice service-learning often experienced community service in their personal lives, and their beliefs about student learning generally involved extending the curriculum into communities. Teachers' understandings of service-learning as a pedagogy also shaped the quality of their CSL practices in terms of identifying community needs and structured reflection. The purposes for service-learning identified by teachers as significant to their practices were connecting CSL to academic instruction, promoting affective learning, and implementing a problem-posing curriculum centered around community issues. When teachers' understandings of how community service-learning supported the psychological, social, and academic needs of students, their practices became enriching learning experiences. In this study, service-learning was only marginally perceived by teachers and students as an empowering pedagogy. Community service-learning became more empowering experiences for teachers and students when they engaged in decision-making activities and when their projects were based on community needs mutually identified by students and community members.

AB  - National educational standards call for an increased focus on meaningful teaching and learning that is developmentally appropriate and helps all students reach levels of proficiency not only in basic skills but in higher order thinking skills and real-world application of skills. Among the recommendations for including real-world experiences in the community into students' education is service-learning. Service-learning uses community service experiences as an integral element of the teaching and learning process. The paucity of research and mixed findings on academic outcomes from K–12 service-learning led to an examination of the opportunity-to-learn conditions and practices in 271 middle-level schools in 16 states involved in documenting school improvement efforts in order to find out by whom and how service-learning was implemented. A secondary analysis was conducted of data from 2,164 core classroom teachers who participated in the High Performance Learning Communities Assessment during 1997–1998. Demographic information from 132,822 students in grades 6–8 were used to describe the socio-demographic characteristics of the schools where these teachers taught. Descriptive and correlational statistics were run to determine if relationships were evident between teachers' background and experience, attitudes toward educational practices, and classroom instructional practices. Multivariate statistics, including MANOVA and discriminant function analysis, were used to compute group differences in teachers' background and experience and use of the strategies of service-learning and standards-based instruction. Correlations and analysis of variance were computed to examine differences in which schools involved which students in service-learning. Findings suggested virtually no relationship between teachers' background and experience, attitudes toward educational practices, and classroom instructional practices. Although nearly all the teachers endorsed the strategies of service-learning, they were not implemented frequently. Discriminant function analysis revealed that teachers' professional knowledge of national and state curriculum standards and adolescent development predicted their use of service-learning strategies. The strategies of service-learning were also associated with more frequent implementation of standards-based practices for higher order thinking in literacy and numeracy. Correlational analyses indicated that students' background characteristics and their schools' urbancity were associated with opportunities to learn through service-learning.

AB  - Service-learning presents exciting new ways for students to enhance their learning. Educators and scholars agree that service-learning is connected to self-efficacy, which affects student performance. This research tests the development of self-efficacy in students enrolled in service-learning and traditional sections of a first-year engineering course. Using a previously developed metric, the Engineering Skills Assessment (ESA), students enrolled in service learning (SL) and "traditional" (non-SL) sections quantified self-efficacy on 11 skills previously deemed important for engineering. Student responses were compared between SL and non-SL students at the beginning and end of the semester. Analysis of the collected data using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) grouped self-efficacy ratings for the 11 skills into three meaningful constructs: (1) Job-related skills (2) Interpersonal skills and (3) Life skills. Mean self-efficacy scores were significantly better at the end of the course for non-SL students in all areas and for SL students in four of the 11 skills and two of the three constructs. Self-efficacy growth was significantly higher for non-SL students, which may be due to the Dunning-Kruger effect. However, similar percentages of both populations selfreported that their skills were improved at the end of the semester due to the class. This research also supports the use of the ESA as a reliable psychometric tool to evaluate student self-efficacy and its relationship to service-learning.

AB  - This article addresses the effect of a nursing care center on student learning. Associate degree nursing students spend clinical days at a nursing care center that was created in collaboration with an inner-city clinic serving individuals who are uninsured and underinsured. The nursing students learn cultural sensitivity, teaching strategies, and interdisciplinary skills. The service-learning experience benefits the nursing students, the nursing department of the college, the patients who visit the nursing care center, the clinic, and the community. This article describes the development of the nursing care center, examples of teaching-learning opportunities, and evidence of student learning. This successful collaboration between a community college and an inner-city clinic can be replicated by other nursing programs.

AB  - The concept of "non-disposable assignments" (NDAs), including those referred to as "renewable assignments," has grown in popularity in recent years in select education circles, particularly alongside an enthusiastic push toward open pedagogy. Unfortunately, little organized literature exists to effectively define, implement, and empirically evaluate what is ultimately an age-old though infrequently applied practice of assigning students a learning activity that provides impact or value outside the traditional student--teacher dyad. In contrast to the often-detested "disposable assignment," NDAs can be defined by their openness and, accordingly, their ability to reach others, even beyond classroom boundaries. It is this very characteristic that likely underlies anecdotal reports of NDAs' success at promoting student excitement, engagement, productivity, and achievement. In this report, we briefly review supporting rationale and guides for the implementation and innovative applications of these utilities of open pedagogical practice. Further, we provide a framework for conceptualizing NDAs wherein the openness of assignments can be viewed to influence others across three key dimensions: time, space, and impact/value, or "gravity." This model is further exemplified through a succinct review of representative NDAs applied at our own institution. Based on this framework, we endeavor to promote a launching ground for empirical research focused on effective practices and learning outcomes for NDAs and, accordingly, support for open pedagogy. Together, the current model and research strategy presents a path for future integration of NDAs in the individual instructor's open-education toolkit to benefit innovation in the classroom for students and humankind.

AB  - An innovative curriculum designed to foster the development of social responsibility among pre-adolescent children was introduced at a rural Zambian primary school. The curriculum invoked Child-to-Child principles focusing on health education, advancing a synthesis of Western psychological theories and African cultural traditions. The teacher sought to democratize the educational process through cooperative learning in mixed-gender, mixed-social-class, and mixed-ability study groups. Learners engaged in community service activities and contributed to the nurturant care of younger children. Young adults interviewed seventeen years after completing the program recalled their experience and reflected on how it had promoted their personal agency, cooperative disposition, and civic responsibility in early adulthood.

AB  - Service-learning is promoted widely by professional organizations (NCSS, 2001), but often with little reflection on the nature of meaningful student participation and the impact of teacher leadership styles. The authors studied mixed-age "small school" advisory groups involved in service-learning at one elementary school; observational, interview, and focus group data were collected. They present three case studies that represent various leadership typologies of elementary service-learning: "The Catalyst," "The Synthesizer," and "The Commander." The authors then map these leaders' priorities onto a Youth Adult Partnership (YAP) continuum to suggest how student voice, a common component of successful service-learning, might occur in the elementary years.

AB  - Service-learning can be a meaningful and effective tool for integrating death education into counselor preparation. The authors describe the design, implementation, reflection process, and evaluation of a service-learning based support program for grieving families and offer suggestions for death educators interested in service-learning as pedagogy. Their evaluation indicated that students who took a graduate-level group counseling course with a service-learning component exhibited lower distress in death-related clinical situations than students who took the course without the service component. Service-learning is closely aligned with death education aims and can be used to enhance counselor preparation program curricular alignment with relevant accreditation standards.

AB  - This study investigated the effectiveness of class learning of service leadership in the Global Youth Leadership Programme (GYLP) using qualitative evaluation, which is the first qualitative evaluation study conducted for noncredit- bearing service leadership education in Hong Kong. Students reported their perception of class learning through three descriptors and one metaphor. Findings based on 47 students’ reflection showed that 93.29% of the descriptors and 91.30% of the metaphors used by the students were positive. Together with other quantitative evaluation findings, this study suggests that service leadership education in the GYLP is effective to promote participating students’ personal growth and service leadership development.

AB  - Issue: RFUMS health care students desire meaningful community contact before they are professionally licensed. Embedded in a course, Service Learning provided that contact, taught about surrounding communities in terms of health, access, and care disparities, and has ensured students experience in interprofessional teams since 2004. Being assigned to service learning projects within pre-established interprofessional teams resulted in experiences that were more relevant and meaningful to some than to others. Method: In 2015-2016, RFUMS modified its Service Learning component, hiring a full time Community Engagement Specialist and affording better communication and education with community partners at service learning sites. Students self-select projects, leading to more engaged, relevant opportunities. Through program design, the integrity of the interprofessional experience is preserved. Observations/Outcomes: 100% of first-year students at RFUMS provide service to surrounding communities through interprofessional teams. Individual students tailor their experiences around personal interest and professional relevancy. Better communication and relationship with community partners enhances the number and types of experiences available to students. Conclusion: Providing individual choice for students and an employee dedicated to relationship management with community partners elevates this pre-practice educational opportunity. Students are interested in repeating the experience even after completing the academic requirement.

AB  - The coordination of service learning experiences can play an important role in the leadership development of allied health professionals. Potential allied health professionals can benefit from participation in service learning and co-curricular activities that relate to their curriculum. Peer mentorship can be utilized to facilitate student engagement in co-curricular activities that can assist in the development of leadership skills, technical skills, and other skills required for their profession. The purpose of this article is to identify a leadership model that can be utilized through student organizations in allied health profession education. One model that can be used to facilitate leadership among graduate students is the Social Change Model of Leadership Development. The model encompasses seven domains which include consciousness of self, congruence, commitment, collaboration, common purpose, controversy, and citizenship. This model was used as a framework to facilitate student teamwork and participation within the community.

AB  - Service learning in the form of student experiences outside the classroom has become more important in many sociology departments with the resurgent interest in public sociology. More importantly, service learning is a technique where critical pedagogy can be introduced into the sociology curriculum. Critical thinking as a component of service learning can enable student questioning of social structural constraints and promote a greater understanding of Mills' sociological imagination. Because of the greater interest in service learning and its application in sociology course, it becomes appropriate to examine what we have learned from it. The purpose of this roundtable is to examine the experiences of faculty who utilize service learning in their courses. Furthermore,we will examine how the service learning format enables us to draw lessons about power, inequality, and social change. We are interested in assessing the impact of service learning and critical pedagogy on student attitudes about the causes and solutions to social problems. We are also interested in exploring how service learning can promote civic engagement and advocacy among students. Our roundtable will address: the various ways in which service learning is defined and how it affects the learning experience; the various ways in which service learning is incorporated into sociology courses; techniques that faculty found most effective in utilizing critical pedagogy in their service learning courses; and how we can promote civic engagement and advocacy among our studeints in their service learning projects.

AB  - The values of a social justice pedagogy in teacher education are assumed to be firmly established in South African higher education. This article discusses how serviced learning (SL) can provide practical experience of caring and serve the promotion of the ideals of social justice in two initial teacher education programmes. However, an analysis of data in this case study shows that, although SL practice has served as a platform for social justice and for care as two basic educational values, participants were not yet able to verbalize and theorize these values. They were also not able to embed these values in their reflection about service as an inherent component of education. With data from different role players in a number of SL projects, we show that the students' discourse of what it means to be a caring teacher in a just society has not yet been developed despite the successful practical experience. It was found that, although the students had been building a practice 'platform' for service, they had not yet been able to articulate the conceptual intersect of care and social justice clearly. With this epistemological notion in mind, two main themes from the data analysis are discussed: 1) How SL shifted student learning from ideas 'about' service to implemented service, and 2) how the practical experience promoted reciprocity in interinstitutional and inter-generational communities of practice.

AB  - Students in four upper division Sociology of the Family courses (N=198) participated in a Service Learning assignment for one semester. Students completed 10 hours of service at local non-profit organizations that provided services to families. Students were asked to volunteer with organizations whose mission covered concepts in class (e.g. poverty, children, elderly, abuse, or immigration). The goal of the service learning assignment was to help students make connections with concepts covered in class and "real life" situations. At the end of the semester students were asked to answer twelve questions about their experience. The questions asked students to evaluate the experience and to discuss the challenges and successes of service learning.

AB  - Business schools today must implement teaching approaches that develop graduates who are ethical, socially responsible, and globally aware. One approach to achieving this goal is to implement mission consistent curriculum. The authors describe the process of developing a service learning project administered in a business communications course at a small liberal arts college. The process included creating learning goals, identifying target markets, developing project ideas, planning the project, implementing a fundraising event, and measuring learning outcomes. By completing the project, students developed their communication and teamwork skills and became more globally and socially aware.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to explore the potential effectiveness of service learning as a pedagogical technique for providing substance abuse education to human services/social work students. Using a quasi-experimental design, the authors assigned 38 human services undergraduate students to experimental and comparison groups on the basis of their availability to attend a service-learning project in substance abuse. The service learning consisted of a 30-min educational presentation followed by a visit to a residential substance abuse treatment facility for women. Results indicated that service learning in substance abuse had a positive effect on the general knowledge, perceptions, and attitudes of human services students toward substance-dependent mothers and their children. The findings from this exploratory study support future research in this area.

AB  - This article focuses on service learning. Service learning is a form of experiential education where learning occurs through a cycle of action and reflection as students work with others to achieve real objectives for the community and deeper understanding and skills for themselves. To students who performed this service learning, inequities were apparent. Service learning develops their perspective of the world and challenges the assumptions they may have made about people who are economically and socially different from themselves.

AB  - Service learning offers opportunities for both educational institutions and community. To demonstrate the possibilities this pedagogy can offer, this article discusses a service learning experience partnering students with a hospice agency. Using mixed methodology, impact on students, patients and staff are examined. Results indicate that students improved their attitudes toward the elderly, death, and dying, and believed the experience caused personal and professional growth. Interviews with patients highlighted the importance of relationships and recognition, and staff identified benefits to students, patients, and agency. We conclude that service learning is best perceived in a light of reciprocity and that this method of engagement offers opportunities for educators and practitioners. Finally, some tips are given for practitioners interested in developing such collaborations.

AB  - The rapid increase in the use of service learning raises important public policy questions about who is being served and whether partner agencies have the capacity to meet student demand for community‐based experiences. This article uses a large sample of nonprofit organizations and a comparative framework to examine the characteristics of partner agencies and the scope and nature of college student community involvement. Multivariate analysis tests these factors on a community agency's ability to engage more students, particularly service learners. The findings are generally optimistic about agency willingness to involve students, suggesting widespread community benefits from their involvement. While organizational size and capacity predict current student engagement, an agency's past experience with students and its perceptions of student benefits have the greatest impact on its willingness to take on future students.

AB  - Service learning is a teaching method used by business faculty to link the learning goals and objectives of an academic course with meaningful community service. Although service learning has been advanced in business education in the United States and other Western countries, little has been reported on its use outside the Western context. In this article, the authors describe an experience with the introduction and implementation of a service-learning project in a Master of Business Administration (MBA) program in south China. Preliminary feedback shows that students, faculty, and community partners have reported numerous benefits from the service-learning experience similar to those reported in the Western context.

AB  - This paper will present preliminary conclusions on the use of service learning in introductory international relations classes both to increase student engagement in the material and to foster greater understanding of the North-South Divide. Many students involved in introductory level classes do not have a high interest in the material being taught and do not continue to explore class material beyond the semester-long class. Current pedagogical research shows that active learning methods increase student engagement in the material, lead to higher academic achievement in classes, and foster more lifelong interest in the material being taught. I apply this lesson by offering students in my introductory International Politics class an option to engage in service with Catholic Charities Refugee Services in lieu of a research paper. Anecdotally, students choosing the service learning option in the past have performed better in the class and have developed a greater appreciation of the economic and political problems facing other states than they possessed prior to engaging in the service project. In the fall of 2005, I will introduce a pre/post engagement instrument that will be administered to all my international politics students. This instrument will allow me to compare engagement and awareness between students choosing service learning and traditional research as well as student engagement before and after completing a service project. ..PAT.-Conference Proceeding [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Conference Papers -- International Studies Association is the property of International Studies Association and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

AB  - Education for a democratic society has been a powerful, long-standing rationale for the entire public school curriculum. But the idea has special relevance for social studies education. This study examined the extent to which notions of democratic citizenship developed in the personal theory of teaching held by one preservice social studies teacher during a student teaching semester. The research posed the question of whether this beginning teacher's incorporation of service learning into his curriculum would serve as a catalyst to help him develop ideas about the role of social studies and what it means to educate for democratic citizenship. Though he believed service-learning was his most powerful and effective teaching during the semester, this student teacher mostly failed to connect what he learned from service-learning to his developing rationale for social studies. The results raise questions about the possibilities for democratic projects in teacher education and the supports needed to facilitate such work.

KW  - EXPERIENTIAL learning
AB  - In this article, I describe a service-learning project for an introductory psychology course. Thirty-two of 36 general psychology students chose service learning over an optional research project, and most students (over 80%) evaluated the experience favorably in terms of its impact on their learning and commitment to service. The discussion focuses on recommendations about issues ranging from the logistics of developing and managing a service-learning course to concerns inherent in placing students in community agencies.

Student learning outcomes common to both service learning and social work education are examined, and the research-based literature on service learning in social work is analyzed. Service-learning practice issues in social work education are described: creating learning activities distinct from those required in field practica, managing conflicts of interest among students employed in the field, minimizing professional ethics violations, and assisting students who observe unprofessional practice behaviors. Recommendations for planning, implementing, and evaluating service-learning projects in social work education are provided to strengthen scholarship in this area.

AB  - Background and Purpose. Higher education has recently experienced a growing movement to utilize community partnerships to strengthen and further its traditional missions of education, research, and service. The partnerships developing between educational institutions and communities lead to health care programs that meet identified community health care needs while providing opportunities for valuable practical experience for students. The purpose of this article is to describe the development, implementation, and evaluation of a service learning project with older adults within a physical therapist education curriculum. Project Description. Pairs of students meet weekly for 10 weeks in the homes of older adult volunteers identified by various individuals and community agencies. Students administer a battery of functional tests to screen for balance deficits and fall risk, including cognition deficits and depression, which are correlated with falls. Older adults who are identified as at high risk for falls are referred to professionals in the community for further evaluation and intervention. Project Evaluation. Formal student and volunteer feedback over a 5-year period demonstrated multiple benefits of the project. Older adults benefited from the fall prevention program while enjoying social interaction. Student learning was enhanced, and there was improved perception of and commitment to serving older adults.

This article describes the creation, implementation, and evaluation of service learning activities in an elective Library Automation course. Course goals include preparing students for real-world challenges by implementing service learning projects to enforce skills development such as critical thinking and problem solving, within the larger framework of project management and systems analysis. Through their participation in the course, students partner with libraries to complete real-world projects. Assignments and course activities reinforce fundamental lessons in managing servers, systems, technologies, and related policies and processes. Issues and challenges related to recruiting and sustaining relationships with partners, working effectively in teams, and managing complex digitization projects are discussed.

AB  - Female, Black, Latino and Native American students are underrepresented in the STEM pipeline. Finding ways to increase underrepresented populations in STEM fields continues to be a major initiative in education. Many underrepresented student groups express a strong orientation toward service and community engagement. Informal Science Education (ISE) can be structured to include community engagement and to engage learners' interest and enhance their understanding of the theory and practice of science. Service learning is a strategy that can be used within an ISE pedagogy to highlight how engineering acts as a community engaged vocation. This report describes a service learning project that exposed underrepresented high school aged students to engineering via a community service activity in which students built irrigation equipment for use in a community garden. The objective of the project was to use the context of service learning to motivate high school students to consider STEM majors. To describe the impact of informal science education through service learning, a qualitative study was also conducted. Three themes emerged: experiential learning (learning while doing), broadening perspective and identity as performance. Lessons learned and strategies for improving the service learning design are also discussed.

AB  - Service learning (SL) is a form of community-centered experiential education that places emerging health professionals in community-generated service projects and provides structured opportunities for reflection on the broader social, economic, and political contexts of health. We describe the elements and impact of five distinct week-long intensive SL courses focused on the context of urban, rural, border, and indigenous health contexts. Students involved in these SL courses demonstrated a commitment to community-engaged scholarship and practice in both their student and professional lives. SL is directly in line with the core public health value of social justice and serves as a venue to strengthen community–campus partnerships in addressing health disparities through sustained collaboration and action in vulnerable communities.

AB  - Background and Purpose. Service learning is becoming a popular means of broadening the scope of physical therapy education beyond the classroom. The purpose of this article is to focus on the opportunity for advocacy within the scope of a small service project.Subjects. 'Thirty-eight professional physical therapist students in a geriatric course participated in a service-learning project. One year after completing the course, students were invited to complete a project survey. Twenty-six of the 38 students (68%) completed and returned surveys.Methods. For the project, students identified an older adult on which to perform a fall risk assessment. After completing the assessment, students orally explained their findings to the person and then wrote a letter to the person's physician describing the fall risk and recommendations, acting as a patient/client advocate. Surveys were distributed to all students 1 year after they completed the course to determine student perceptions of the value of the assignment.Results. Twenty-four of the 26 respondents (92%) rated the experience as valuable for both the older adult and the student. Twenty-three of the 26 respondents (88%) reported that the assignment allowed them to act as a patient/client advocate.Discussion and Conclusion. Overall, students valued the experience. Advocacy is an area of focus for the profession in meeting the goals of the American Physical Therapy Association (APIA) for the Vision Statement 2020 and the 2006 Education Strategic Plan. This small-scale advocacy project offers an example of how to provide students with an opportunity to experience advocacy at an individual level.

AB  - Researchers have described service learning as an ideal way to integrate experiential education into coursework while meeting community needs and imbuing students with civic responsibility. They have advocated service learning in business as a method to implement course concepts and increase student understanding of the external environment. In this article, the author briefly summarizes institutional and program characteristics that are associated with successful service-learning programs. She reviews research publications related to service-learning implementations in business. The author found that the fields of information systems, management, and marketing have more service-learning applications tied to course-earning objectives than have the fields of accounting and finance. Further, she suggests that service learning may fit best in business courses where skilled interaction with users is a key learning goal.

AB  - Service-learning pedagogy that supports community involvement values and promotes leadership development offers more effectiveness and efficiency for management educators interested in incorporating real-world learning into their courses than traditional internships and cooperative education (P. C. Godfrey & E. T. Grasso, 2000). In this article, the authors argue for service learning as means of integrating real-world learning into curricula. They describe 2 longitudinal examples in an economics course and a management course from 2001 to 2004. Beyond qualitative data from student reflective journals, essays, and anonymous comments, the authors present quantitative evidence of significant differences that support arguments in favor of service learning.

AB  - This paper reviews how service learning pedagogy is being used by one program to 1) increase the visibility of and advocacy for school health education and the coordinated school health program (CSHP) and 2) meet the needs of students in its master's level professional preparation programs. Three benefits to employing service learning are emerging: practice, relevance, and internalization of health education competencies; student and school district 'buy in' of CSHP; and the building of an infrastructure for cooperation and collaboration. Overcoming challenges and barriers to using service learning is also discussed.

Students conduct screening tests, present health promotion or safety education projects, develop pediatric-related handouts for the parents and staff, perform assessments of growth and development, identify and research pediatric health issues, and learn the fine art of communicating with preschool children. Head Start schools as clinical sites provide students with ample opportunities to blend nursing theory with application while introducing them to another area of the population. Students, faculty, and Head Start staff agree that this collaboration accomplishes the goals of both organizations.

AB  - Service learning has the potential to increase student learning, assist communities, and provide faculty members with one focus area that brings teaching, service, scholarship, and practice together. As nursing programs revise curricula to include community based service learning opportunities, the impact of these projects on material and human resources must be assessed. Planning can increase the probability of adequate resources, faculty productivity, and student learning. When planning service learning activities, addressing the following questions will assist in evaluating projects: Is there a the match between academic mission and community needs? What commitment will be made to the community? Will the project promote faculty productivity? Will it offer students superior learning opportunities? What resources will the project require?

Data were collected from 398 students who have experienced services provided by the faculties and staff in international programs of higher education institutions in Thailand. The model examination result was statistically acceptable in terms of reliability and validity. The strongest dimension of service quality that affects student satisfaction is responsiveness, followed by empathy and facility, accordingly. This research highlights important dimensions of service quality that, if improved in higher education institutions, would enhance student satisfaction.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Community-based service-learning opportunities could support residents' acquisition of Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) competencies, but this concept has not been tested, and such programs are difficult to find. The objective of this work was to assess the value and the ACGME competency relevance of a service-learning program for residents that could be easily replicated nationally.Methods: Forty-one family medicine residents from three training programs participated in the Stanford Youth Diabetes Coaches Program at six high schools in California and Georgia serving minority students of low socioeconomic status. Residents completed online surveys to provide qualitative feedback and assess the program's impact on their acquisition of residency program competencies and self-management support proficiencies, including prior use and planned use of action plans-a key self-management support strategy.Results: Ninety-five percent of residents indicated that the program was a valuable experience that contributed to acquisition of residency program competencies, including interpersonal and communication skills and communication with teens. Compared with baseline, significantly more residents reported intention to use action plans with patients following participation. Themes from qualitative feedback included: valuing the overall experience, increasing opportunities to practice teaching, enhancing their ability to communicate with adolescents, contributing to the health of the community, recognizing the potential of action plans, and increasing intent to use action plans.Conclusions: This pilot demonstrated that a brief service-learning program can enhance standard residency curriculum by encouraging acquisition of ACGME competencies and promoting utilization of self-management support in clinical practice.

AB  - The article discusses the book "Service-Learning Across Cultures: Promise and Achievement," edited by Humphrey Tonkin. The culmination of a three-year, three-part study funded by the Ford Foundation, this volume tells what happens when service-learning, a combination of service to the community and formal academic study takes on the added dimension of another culture and another part of the world. The study charts the development of international service-learning, describes its effects on students, agencies, and institutions, and tries to gauge its impact on the common good through promoting such intangibles as compassion, understanding, and civic-mindedness.

AB  - Developing good citizens is an historic role for higher education (Sullivan & Rosin, 2008) and the emergence of service-learning as a pedagogical strategy has heightened attention to the intentional educational objectives to be addressed in higher education. This article examines the role of service-learning in developing philanthropic values and behaviors in students that can influence their postgraduate years through careers, civic activities, and family life. Unlike other forms of community-based education (e.g., cooperative education, internship), service-learning extends beyond “serving to learn,” to “learning to serve” (see Chang, this issue) through being involved in community activities (e.g., advocacy, community organizing, volunteering). Two of the explicit dimensions of preparing civic-minded graduates are increasing knowledge of the nonprofit sector and volunteer opportunities and increasing commitment to be involved in the community, both of which can be achieved through service-learning (Steinberg, Hatcher, & Bringle, 2011).

AB  - In recent years, the normative approach to teaching negotiation (i.e., using a combination of lectures, case discussions, and simulation exercises) has been under scrutiny Calls for change stem from the need to increase the "real-world" applicability of our courses. The author presents service-learning as a potential pedagogical solution. In doing so, she addresses the fit between service-learning and recent calls for change in teaching negotiation; discusses issues related to student learning, course design, and faculty member involvement; and provides sample reflections from past servicelearning negotiation students.

AB  - Dental hygienists should be aware of the concept of service-learning and how it can enhance dental hygiene education. A look at national documents and other relevant historical literature will be reviewed, in addition to more recent books and articles to define service-learning. Although perceived as a new teaching strategy, service-learning has its roots in experiential education. Several definitions of service-learning have emerged, which take into consideration the reciprocal needs of the student and community, bridging academic theory with community service, and instilling civic responsibility through a reflective component. Considering the advantages and disadvantages, service-learning seems to be a good methodology for dental hygiene education. Recommendations include the expansion of the ADA Accreditation Standards to include service-learning, and incorporation of an operational definition of community-based oral health programs, as well as the term service-learning in its Definition of Terms.

AB  - National curriculum standards call for meaningful teaching and learning that are developmentally appropriate and that help all students reach proficiency not only in basic skills but also in higher order thinking skills and real-world application of skills. Service-learning (SL) is among recommendations from educators for including real-world experiences into students' education. The paucity of research and mixed findings on academic outcomes from K--12 SL led the author to examine opportunity-to-learn conditions and practices of 2,164 teachers in 271 middle schools involved in school improvement. The author analyzed teacher reports to determine (a) attitudes and beliefs toward SL; (b) extent to which teachers implemented SL; and (c) relationships between teachers' attitudes and beliefs, SL, and standards-based instructional practices. Although teachers believed that SL was essential for effective education, most teachers used SL infrequently. One-way multivariate analysis of variance revealed that teachers who implemented SL regularly used standards-based instructional practices more often than did their colleagues. Implications for preservice and inservice teachers are discussed.

KW  - eppi-reviewer
AB  - Service-learning has been gaining traction in Singapore, with many educational institutions integrating it into their curriculum. In the National Institute of Education (NIE), the Group Endeavours in Service-Learning (GESL) is an experiential learning opportunity for all student teachers (STs) to collaborate with the community to address local needs. GESL endeavours to build character, and develop positive values and social-emotional competencies. Hence the purpose of this study is to explore how GESL enhances pre-service teacher education in relation to teacher training. Eleven GESL groups were selected, with 12 members from each group randomly recruited to participate in the focus group interviews. A?total of 15 focus group interviews were held. The interview data was transcribed, coded and presented in themes by using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Overall, there seemed to be a?greater level of self-awareness?and understanding of the community needs. Participants reported getting to know themselves better, in terms of their strengths and weaknesses and how they can contribute to the community. There was also enhancement of collaboration, communication and people-management?skills. These findings suggest that GESL may be an effective channel to imbue attributes that NIE?has identified as important for teaching professionals.

AB  - Service-learning is a wide-spread educational strategy in K-16 education. Currently 64% of all public schools and 83% of public high schools have community service. Educators and legislators see service learning as a way to improve the community and invigorate the classroom, respond to needs in the community, build self esteem, and develop higher-order thinking skills. Researchers have proclaimed the many benefits of service-learning in terms of student empowerment. The term "service-learning" was first defined in the National and Community Service Act of 1990 as a method under which students or participants learn and develop through active participation in thoughtfully organized service. Service-learning, also called community-based learning, is often confused with community service and volunteerism. Service-learning has an extraordinary potential to engage young people in experiences involving explorations of community and self, critical thinking, democratic activities, and the pursuit of a more just and humane world. Service-learning is a learning strategy in which students have leadership roles in thoughtfully organized service experiences that meet real needs in the community.

AB  - This paper discusses the implementation of an intergenerational service-learning (IS-L) project by Western Michigan University's Gerontology Program. Two classes of students, one graduate and one undergraduate, taking introductory gerontology courses were brought together to complete IS-L projects of their own designs. Students were placed in teams. Key project components included: negotiation with community partners to construct a viable one-semester project, collaboration on a team, and analysis of the team development process. A Critical Incident Questionnaire was used to collect data on student perceptions of project and class progress. While challenging, most students found the intergenerational service-learning projects and team format valuable and rewarding.

AB  - Major changes are taking place within the health care system that have important implications for health professions education in geriatrics. The forces driving these changes are also affecting academic settings, where trends supporting the development of community–academic partnerships, service-learning models, and interdisciplinary education are all evident. These trends have major implications for health professions educators working to develop academic programs to prepare students for future practice with older adults. This article explores the impacts of these changes, in particular, on the design of interdisciplinary or collaborative education programming, including the following dimensions: assessment and definition of the problem, emphasis on functioning and quality of life, professional identity, changing roles of faculty and students, and institutional-organizational implications. General recommendations on how to respond to the challenges represented in these trends are also explored. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Service-learning (SL) is one educational methodology that provides students opportunities to practice and refine affective, cognitive and psychomotor skills in a community-based setting. Purpose: The aims of this study were: 1) to investigate the impact of SL on physical therapy (PT) students' attitudes and perceived clinical competence when working with older adults, and 2) to evaluate the difference between perceptions of students who developed and implemented the SL activity vs those who implemented only. Methods: Eighty PT students, (from two consecutive cohorts) enrolled in a first-year geriatrics course, participated in this study. The first cohort designed and implemented the SL activities, while the second cohort only implemented these activities. Student self-perceived anxiety, confidence, knowledge and skills were assessed by pre- and post-SL surveys using a 5-point Likert-like scale. Results: Both cohorts reported similar anxiety and confidence levels pre-SL. For both cohorts, with the exception of one item, all responses to anxiety items significantly decreased from pre- to post-SL. All students' confidence levels for assessing and mitigating fall risk in older adults increased post-SL (p < 0.01). Moreover, students in cohort 1, who designed and delivered SL activities, expressed self-perceived improvement in their ability to interpret results of evaluations, to determine type and severity of balance impairments, and to serve a geriatric population (p < 0.05) compared to students in cohort 2 who only implemented the activities. Conclusion: Embedding SL into a geriatrics course decreased self-perceived anxiety and improved student confidence regarding working with older adults. Also, empowering students to be actively involved in the design and implementation of SL increased self-perceived ability in interpreting results from assessments.

AB  - Service-Learning is recognized as a valuable pedagogy involving experiential learning, reflection, and reciprocal learning. Reflection is a critical component because it assists students to develop critical thinking and social awareness as they reflect upon th eir experiential learning with community partners. Although th ere is a proliferation of literature about service--learning, upon closer examination, it is apparent that some authors do not place emphasis on reflection when reporting on service--learning projects. This begs the question, "W h e re is the reflection?" The purpose of this article is to provide an overview and describe misrepresentations and exemplars of service-learning. After providing an overview of service-learning, examples of how service--learning is misrepresented in the literature are discussed. Exemplars of service--learning are also cited. Calling attention to how service--learning is reported in the literature will increase awareness about the need to critically evaluate articles fo r evidence of reflection.

AB  - A LITERATURE REVIEW identified various kinds of altruism, including altruism devoted to social change and a charitable form of altruism, along with the concept that it is possible for these types to occur independently or simultaneously. A study was conducted with university students in a Deaf studies program to determine the effect of a service-learning experience on the development of altruistic behaviors. Students in a course titled `Social Services in the Deaf Community' responded to a questionnaire measuring their attitudes toward serving the community before and after they participated in an off-campus experience volunteering with organizations that served or could serve the Deaf community. The results medicated significant changes in students' attitudes regarding their ability to make a difference in society and strongly suggest a positive correlation between service-learning experiences and development of 'civic responsibility' altruistic behaviors among Deaf studies students volunteering in the community.

AB  - The pedagogy of Service-Learning is a new addition to the field of Deaf Studies. As a new and non-traditional course, the implementation of a Deaf Studies Service-Learning course is a challenging task. One challenge is to develop several multi-directional relationships between the faculty member, students, deaf consumers, and community partners from deaf-related rehabilitation agencies. Another issue is addressing the major challenges identified in the Service-Learning literature. Utilizing recommendations made by an experienced faculty member, these challenges are surmountable. This combination of in-class and out-of-class pedagogy enriches Deaf Studies students' learning experience serving the deaf consumers in "real world" settings.

AB  - This article describes service-learning as an experiential educational methodology by which people learn and develop through active participation in thoughtfully organized service experiences. Service-learning is separate and distinct from either community service, volunteerism, fieldwork, or internships. Community service and volunteerism are primarily focused on the service provided and the benefits to the recipients of that service. Internships and field work are primarily focused on the learning acquired by the student. Service-learning, however, has an equally weighted focus between the benefits of the service to the recipient and the benefits of learning for the student. The benefits of service-learning are outlined and examples of service-learning projects are presented in this article. Last, the author's use of service learning in health education courses is described and the reader is encouraged to incorporate service-learning in his or her courses and curriculum.

AB  - Although studies suggest that service-learning is positive for students, findings reported are primarily qualitative. A convenience sample of 306 senior-level nursing students completed the Service-Learning Self-Evaluation Tool (SLSET) pre- and post-service-learning experience over a six-year span. The constructs measured were leadership skills and social justice. Paired t-tests were calculated. Statistically significant differences were noted between pre- and post-service-learning experience, with students rating themselves higher on leadership and social justice items after the experience. Cronbach's alpha for leadership and social justice were greater than 0.80. Service-learning as an educational methodology that combines community service with academic learning objectives is a viable strategy for facilitating leadership skills and increased awareness of social justice issues in nursing students.

AB  - Service-learning is implemented as a learning strategy in all levels of education. However, there is little evidence to support its efficacy and influence on student learners and those served, due in part to broad operational definitions and the dearth of empirical evidence. The current trend of including service-learning in the nursing curriculum falls short of evidence-based practice, a valuable pillar in nursing education. The purpose of this systematic review is to review the research that has been conducted on service-learning and to investigate outcomes on nursing students. Suggestions for future research include the development and use of standardized operational definitions. Concepts of interest for measurement and research instruments have been identified.

AB  - Service-learning, which combines academic study with community service, is becoming increasingly popular throughout the world. It is ideally suited to achieving both the personal and academic goals of students and the broader goals of civic responsibility and social justice. This paper describes the design of a local service-learning program the author implemented at a university in Hong Kong. Based on survey data collected from 93 university student participants in the program, it illustrates the impact of service-learning on student outcomes. Results show that the majority of the students benefitted as follows: (1) By developing personal autonomy through real world experiences, students develop a recognition of and faith in their potential. It enhances self-assurance, assumption of new responsibilities, and achievement of individual growth. (2) Students move toward becoming responsible citizens and agents of social change. By learning to care for deprived groups in the community, they are assuming meaningful roles and responding to real issues in ways that have a long-lasting impact on their own lives. Recommendations, based on the shortcomings we have witnessed and the changes we have implemented, are also made. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objectives: to demonstrate that Service-Learning (S-L) improved the acquisition of knowledge and instrumental skills in students enrolled in the Nurses Aid Technician's programme against traditional methods of teaching and to determine what the students' perception were regarding personal growth as it relates to S-L methodology. Material y methods: a quasi-experimental study on 48 students enrolled at the Vocational Professional SOLC NOU School (Barcelona) during the 2007/2008 academic year. Studied variables included: type of teaching/learning methods (independent variable): S-L methodology (experimental group) and traditional methods (control group). Dependent variables: acquired theoretical knowledge and instrumental skills, both through S-L and traditional teaching methods, contribution as perceived by the S-L student for the development of key skills and for his or her personal growth. Descriptive statistics indexes were calculated and non parametric tests used for bivariate analysis. Results: 44 students were assessed. In the experimental group the mean classification score for acquired learning was 7,27 (CI 95%: 7,24-8,20) and 7,91 (CI 95%: 7,53-8,29) for acquired instrumental skills. In the control group (traditional methodology) the mean classification score for acquired knowledge by means of the S-L method was 6,75 (CI 95%: 6,12-7,38) and 7,44 (CI 95%: 7,10-7,78) for acquired instrumental skills. No students regard S-L methodology as having contributed 'nothing to little' to the development of their key capacities. S-L contributed to the personal growth of the students in 98% of students. Conclusions: even though the results have not been statistically significant, the scores were higher with the S-L method, for the acquisition of know-ledge as well as for the acquisition of instrumental skills. The S-L 'let's take care of our elderly' has made a very positive contribution to the development of the pupils' key capacities and their personal capacities.

Requirements for successful SL are seen as adequate preparation for the experience, monitoring and support during the program, and a period to assimilate and analyze what was learned after the program is completed. The contributions of SL experience to a student's career are described: acquiring professional work experience, opening doors to new job opportunities, and providing a new source of recommendations. Addresses of organizations providing information and support for SL programs are given. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The community can be a wonderful classroom for students and faculty to explore the real-world application of the content of almost any class in an academic unit's curriculum. It is also the means by which those in the community can be connected to the classroom to resolve a noteworthy problem. When properly designed, a course taught via service-learning can provide learning experiences that transcend the more controlled learning environment of the classroom or lab on one's campus. After reading this article, faculty members should be able to accurately define service-learning, comprehend 10 key principles of service-learning, and develop a course that has equal emphasis on both “service” and “learning” that when properly designed according to the literature will provide a robust and meaningful learning experience for students, faculty, and community partners.

AB  - THE CONCEPT of recentering the Deaf community in interpreter education stems from the recent discussion of program evolution away from stakeholders and into academia highlighted by Monikowski and Peterson (2005). The University of North Florida, in the initial stages of developing a B.S. degree and M.Ed. concentration in ASL/English Interpreting, responded by developing stand-alone courses in service-learning, with hopes of prioritizing the needs of the Deaf community in curriculum development. The program was implemented in fall 2007, and the first co- hort of students completed its second course in service-learning in fall 2008. Elements of the new program that indicate its progress toward recentering include an overview of service-learning as pedagogy in action, the distinction of service-learning from practicum and internship, implementation of the new courses, and the merging of the program's strategic plan with the university's commitment to community-based transformational learning.

AB  - To investigate the effect of an interprofessional service-learning course on health professions students' self-assessment of Interprofessional Education Collaborative (IPEC) competencies. Design. The semester-long elective course consisted of two components: a service component where students provided patient care in an interprofessional student-run free clinic and bi-weekly workshops in which students reflected on their experiences and discussed roles, team dynamics, communication skills, and challenges with underserved patient populations. Assessment. All fifteen students enrolled in the course completed a validated 42-question survey in a retrospective post-then-pre design. The survey instrument assessed IPEC competencies in four domains: Values and Ethics, Roles and Responsibilities, Interprofessional Communication, and Teams and Teamwork. Students' self-assessment of IPEC competencies significantly improved in all four domains after completion of the course. Conclusion. Completing an interprofessional service-learning course had a positive effect on students' self-assessment of interprofessional competencies, suggesting service-learning is an effective pedagogical platform for interprofessional education.

AB  - Given the emphasis on community engagement in higher education, academic departments need to become more involved in the community. This paper discusses a number of outreach activities undertaken by the chemistry department at Rhodes University, South Africa. The activities range from service learning to community engagement with teachers and school students in partnership with other interested parties. Teachers who attended workshops reported that their subject knowledge and confidence had increased and they were subsequently doing more practical work in lessons. Practical chemistry demonstrations and workshops afforded opportunities for school students to observe or perform chemical experiments and interact with university students. Undergraduate students directly benefitted from involvement in community engagement through the development and implementation of credit-bearing service learning.

AB  - This paper describes a service-learning course in Chemistry Honours at Rhodes University in South Africa. Students visit two schools in different settings, where they present a lecture-demonstration, entitled `A Pollutant's Tale', and two hands-on experiments to school learners. The students are assessed on their learnings as seen through their own reflections on the activities in reflective journals. The reflections from 27 students over four years of the course were analysed to investigate to what extent the educational goals of the course were being met. Six broad themes emerged from student reflections: (1) social awareness; (2) civic responsibility; (3) challenging beliefs; (4) enhanced understanding of science communication and demonstration skills; (5) personal growth; and, (6) evaluating the service-learning experience. In our discussion of these themes, we suggest that through service-learning, students have learnt to do things differently in Chemistry: they have learnt about society beyond the laboratory and beyond their previous life-experiences. Importantly, the students have undergone personal development and picked up critical skills which they will need when traversing life and its challenges - such as, working with and learning from diverse groups of people, teamwork and learning to cope in stressful situations. The paper will be of particular interest to those who are involved in chemistry teaching in both schools and higher education institutions, as well as those interested in service-learning as a pedagogical tool, community and civic engagement and the development of transferable skills in chemistry students.

AB  - Beginning with Freud's Beyond the Pleasure Principle, I trace the structure of the traumatic neurosis within literary and psychoanalytic theories of trauma and suggest the evolution of consciousness results in bodily performances of play and myth. Since Freud performs the tension that exists between the life and death drives not only by playing with the play of his grandson but also in multiple references to Aristophanes' myth, I read very closely Plato's Symposium, where the conversations about Eros engender questions we continue to ask about how love is a drive for human relationships. I consider the neuro-psychoanalytic work of Jaak Panksepp as he charts the affective neuroscience of play, suggesting we are wired for joy. In the context of the 21st century where the great frontiers of brain-mapping and social networking technologies are rediscovering how language most significantly rewrites the human being, I address some of the early trends in how the increasingly dominant "flickering signifier" (N. Katherine Hayles) currently revamps communication systems. Web 2.0 technologies emphasizing "emergence" create new life forms as writing machines now also write us into being. New technological conditions create challenges and opportunities for pedagogical practices where students ask "What does literature do?" in ways that allow for no easy dialogue with the answers from the past. As somewhat of a case study, I consider the writing and biography of the physician-turned-novelist Walker Percy, together with Charles Sanders Peirce, for making meaning in post-modern times and I read Percy's The Thanatos Syndrome in dialogue with Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents. My dissertation concludes with a multimedia storytelling performance—a palimpsest—of the Percy family, the breech of the levees, and my students' own engagement with service learning, six months after Hurricane Katrina. From all layers beyond both the disciplinary and "ground-zero" fields of trauma, play becomes significant for performance of any story that emerges when there is a breech of consciousness that is experienced as a result of trauma.

AB  - Multicultural education represents a tool for positive utilization of cultural differences in the overall educational process. In this process, classrooms and schools become models of democracy and equality among people in society. In order to achieve such results, a large number of factors is required, starting with the teaching cadres that will act in accordance with the following rules: • Put the student in the focus, i.e. in the center of the overall teaching/learning process; • Promote human rights and show respect for cultural differences; • Behold that all students are able to learn and study; • Accept and recognize students as such and permanently show interest to perfect them upon past grounds and advance them towards the future, by aiming at new experiences for students as part of the multicultural society in which the school operates. • Analyze critically the pressure and relationship between good sense and racism, gender inequality, discrimination and other negative manifestations such as isolation of youngsters and old people in the multicultural society. • Criticize the society for the benefit of social rights and equality. • Take part in common social attempts to create a real democratic society. The educational cadres, in many parts of the world, during the past decades has been struggling with the great challenge of the systematization of students in classrooms, and in this way the preparation of the ground for multicultural instruction based on the diverse composition of classes. Every teaching field can be processed in such a way to picture and reflect upon the real social situation, namely upon the existing differences among students who are offered the service, seeing them as a constitutional part of the country's and world's population. The abilities for efficient functioning of different cultural elements are issues that need to be addressed properly. In order for the students to function efficiently and as a whole in a democratic society, they have to learn about differences and injustices which occur at certain times and under given circumstances. Otherwise, our society will not be able to overcome these differences and injustices.

AB  - A primary teaching function calls for facilitating learning by matching student needs and content with effective learning experiences. In many cases, students' most meaningful learning experiences are community based and involve their addressing real-world problems or performing a service for others. In some cases, communities consist of groups of people who are separated by large distances or periods of time. An example arises in the situation of currently deployed U.S. service men and women serving overseas. Educators can provide support for the troops overseas and support existing technology education course objectives through effective and exciting experiences that incorporate service-learning. In this article, the authors thoroughly describe service-learning and describe an activity in which one technology education program engaged the community and provided support to the troops overseas--to the significant benefit of all involved.

AB  - Teacher in-service learning about education reforms like NGSS often begin with professional development (PD) as a foundational component (Supovitz & Turner, 2000). Teacher Leaders, who are early implementers of education reform, are positioned to play a contributing role to the design of PD. As early implementers of reforms, Teacher Leaders are responsible for interpreting the purposes of reform, enacting reforms with fidelity to meet those intended goals, and are positioned to share their expertise with others. However, Teacher Leader knowledge is rarely accessed as a resource for the design of professional development programs. This study is unique in that I analyze the knowledge Teacher Leaders, who are positioned as developers of PD, bring to the design of PD around science education reform. I use the extended interconnected model of professional growth (Clarke & Hollingsworth, 2002; Coenders & Terlouw, 2015) to analyze the knowledge pathways Teacher Leaders’ access as PD developers. I found that Teacher Leaders accessed knowledge pathways that cycled through their personal domain, domain of practice and domain of consequence. Additionally the findings indicated when Teacher Leaders did not have access to these knowledge domains they were unwilling to continue with PD design. These findings point to how Teacher Leaders prioritize their classroom experience to ground PD design and use their perceptions of student learning outcomes as an indicator of the success of the reform. Because professional development (PD) is viewed as an important resource for influencing teachers’ knowledge and beliefs around the implementation of education reform efforts (Garet, et al., 2001; Suppovitz & Turner, 2000), I offer that Teacher Leaders, who are early implementers of reform measures, can contribute to the professional development system. The second part of this dissertation documents the instantiation of the knowledge of Teacher Leaders, who are positioned as designers and facilitators of PD. I examine the extent to which Teacher Leader knowledge is instantiated into specific resources and tasks during PD specifically for the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). The findings indicate that Teacher Leaders’ knowledge is instantiated in tasks that promote and facilitate alignment of Teacher Leader goals for NGSS science practices-based instruction, which are framed around student learning outcomes. I offer a number of ways in which these findings can help educators and PD developers to better structure activities that present an alternative vision for science education that also provides the needed resources to shape how classroom tasks are designed and managed in ways that attend to and build on the practical knowledge of Teacher Leaders. The third part of this dissertation addresses the role Teacher Leaders play in this reform context with respect to their contributions to the professional development system. Based on the analyses of the Teacher Leaders in this study, I claim Teacher Leaders are essential contributors to the professional development system that extends beyond their typical role of participant. I argue that Teacher Leaders bring special expertise to the role of designers and facilitators of PD programs, and to the role of ambassadors for professional learning communities in a reform context. Because Teacher Leaders have a broader influence on the professional development system as pictured here, the Teacher Leaders in this study represent an essential piece of the reform puzzle.

AB  - This paper was motivated by the authors' personal experience with assigning community service to students in business and society courses. The paper identifies reasons why teachers use community service, and discusses various strategies and resources available for those seeking to implement this practice in their own courses. A central theme of the business and society course is a careful consideration of the implications of a market-based economy for society. This paper discusses a teaching technique that addresses such problems directly: student volunteerism through class-sponsored community service projects. The topics in this paper discussed are: service learning about business and society; background literature and methods; types of community service projects; benefits of service learning projects; and how to implement service learning approaches.

AB  - The South Asian diaspora and its impact on the lives of dispersed communities is a complex phenomenon finding expression in a range of issues and debates. However, the nature and scale of the challenges and issues vary in each case and context, and even over generations. These issues become more sensitive and poignant when underpinned by cultural and belief systems. This paper debates the impact of dominant discourses and values on schooling choices and the related concerns to explore issues linked to girls’ education among Pakistani diaspora in England, drawing on relevant literature and the evidence from a recent study of single-sex schooling. It argues that multiple emotional, social, cultural, historical, political, economic and other affiliations influence the patterns of behaviour and the terms of civic engagement in the adopted country leading to a struggle over meanings and competing positions over values and practices that are fluid and dynamic.

AB  - This study documented the learning outcomes of preservice teachers who participated in a service-learning program for professional development on understanding the academic and social needs of students attending urban schools in a low-income northern California community. Eight preservice teachers participated for periods from 1 to 2 years. Pretests and posttests, designed to measure end-of-the-year academic growth in mathematics and reading competence, were administered to 102 sixth graders to compare achievement outcomes between the intervention group and their comparable sixth grade peers. All eight preservice teachers engaged in personal and pedagogical generative work, leading to transformative educational consciousness and practices, while making statistically significant academic differences for their students.

AB  - The benefits of service-learning are numerous, and some are hard to come by any other way. Service-learning projects help teachers and students come together in new ways, demonstrate how language skills can help accomplish real-life tasks, and engage students in a way that spurs them to learn more thoroughly and quickly. The lessons can last a lifetime and make a real difference to the students and those they help. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - In an effort to teach students the basic knowledge of research methods and the realities of conducting research in the context of agencies in the community, faculty developed and implemented a service learning model for teaching research and program evaluation to foundation-year MSW students. A year-long foundation course was designed in which one instructor taught a research methods course (scientific methods in social work) and an evaluation course (evaluation in social work) consecutively with the same group of students. The primary focus of these courses was on student group research projects with agencies in the community. This design was developed to deepen students' learning of research by (1) promoting continuity in instruction, (2) removing redundancies in content between two research courses, and (3) extending the time needed for rigorous program evaluation projects with community agencies. The strengths and challenges in implementation are discussed.

AB  - Service learning is an important component of nursing education. However, the impact of these activities on the development of prelicensure nurses can vary. The concepts of volunteerism, community engagement and social responsibility are inherent to nursing values but may not be translated to students in an academic setting. Therefore, the ability of new nurses to care for vulnerable community-based populations may be limited. A mixed methods survey of first year nursing students report the impact recent service learning activities and educational experiences has on their planned nursing practice. Students acknowledged personal and professional perceived value to promoting health in community-based populations. Participants reported that quality service learning activities increase the future integration of community service in careers and professional development. Additionally, nursing students stated that they developed a stronger desire to promote community-based health through continued engagement efforts outside of the classroom setting. These insights offer useful information for nursing educators as they seek innovative methods of curriculum delivery.

AB  - Community service-learning reflects an "ecological" approach to educational reform. It embodies the theories and philosophies of experiential and developmental learning in the context of addressing community needs. The rationale for community service-learning programs is the psychological, social, and intellectual development of youth and to provide a forum for positive school-community interaction. Planning, implementing, and integrating community service-learning programs challenge many of the assumptions and perceptions of schooling, notably the relationships of teachers with their work, colleagues, students and the community, and the measurement and definition of learning. These notions are presented within the broader process of educational change. Teacher culture, in terms of flexibility, autonomy, collaboration, participation in decision-making, and collegiality, are discussed as critical elements for adopting and sustaining educational innovations. Community service-learning changes the traditional framework for viewing the educational enterprise by creating a "learning community" of teachers, students, family members and citizens.

AB  - For most physical education teacher education (PETE) programs, the constraints surrounding the undergraduate curriculum (e.g., number of credit hours, dual content certificates such as health and physical education, content knowledge) limit PETE programs to offering only one course in adapted physical education (APE) with the expectation that this training is sufficient to prepare highly qualified teachers to teach students with disabilities in general and adapted physical education. The inclusion of service learning (SL) methods in the APE curriculum is one approach to facilitating the successful preparation of preservice teachers to teach students with disabilities by increasing their opportunity to connect information learned in their program to the “real world.” Assessment strategies used in the APE course must tap into this naturalistic setting of the SL experience and ensure preservice students are prepared to assume the duties of a future professional. This article discusses how an APE course used a video-editing SL project to document student learning and performance in the Adapted Physical Education National Standards and prepare future general PETE students to teach students with disabilities.

AB  - Educators and schools have a responsibility to ensure that young people become engaged and knowledgeable citizens. A recent report on high school civics education nationwide, "The State of Civics Education," finds a wide variation in state requirements and levels of youth engagement. Only nine states and the District of Columbia require one year of U.S. government or civics at the high school level, and state civics curricula are light on building skills and agency for civic engagement. Few states provide service learning opportunities or engage students in relevant project-based learning. Nationwide, students score very low on the Advanced Placement (AP) U.S. government exam. States with the highest rate of youth civic engagement tend to prioritize civics courses and AP U.S. government in their curricula. While most states require only a half year of civics education, two (Colorado and Idaho) have designed detailed curricula that are taught throughout yearlong courses, and one (Idaho) focuses on introducing civics education into its early grades. Non-profits that support civics education include General Citizen, a nonprofit that works in many states, teaches what it calls "action civics" to more than 30,000 middle school and high school students, providing schools with detailed curricula and giving students opportunities for real-world engagement as they work to solve community problems. Teaching Tolerance, an initiative through the Southern Poverty Law Center, provides free materials to emphasize social justice in existing school curricula.

AB  - Although the global call for environmental education is persistent, on a local or regional level, this call can be confronted by educational policies that drive environmental education out of the curriculum. This paper reports on a qualitative case study of the factors contributing to the sustainability of three teacher-driven integrated curriculum programs (ICPs). Four key factors were identified: financial self-sufficiency and physical isolation (program separation); and visibility of teachers in the school and support from a broad network of allies (political connection). This paper suggests that ICPs can be further supported by fostering pedagogical kinships and expanding counter-praxis discourse. The paper also highlights the importance of 'ground-up' programs in sustaining environmental education in periods of educational conservatism.

AB  - In 1999-2000, a field study of eight North Carolina schools was conducted; four senior project schools and four control schools were selected. Researchers identified four treatment schools that had institutionalized senior projects for at least 4 years, with all seniors participating in senior projects and with all the program components (research paper, product, portfolio, presentation) in place. Control schools were selected to match each senior project school based on staff size, size of student body, percent of students in the federal free lunch program, percent of minority students enrolled at the school, overall performance in the state testing program, and urbanicity. A variety of measures, including focus groups, writing assessments, achievement test scores, and surveys, were used to examine possible differences between senior project and control schools.

AB  - The concurrent conditions of deafness and blindness present a set of unique needs within a community that highly values independence and autonomy. This project assesses the service-learning initiative in a post-secondary Interpreter Education Program (IEP) in which students learn via civic engagement with the Deaf-Blind community to employ concepts and skills acquired from coursework. In 2005, several years after implementing service-learning in the Interpreting for Individuals Who Are Deaf-Blind course, the program assessed project efficacy through reflective journal analysis and stakeholder interviews. Results indicated dominant themes around Deaf-Blind consumer empowerment, personal attitudes, coping strategies, and application of experiences to specific topics addressed in class. Outcomes of this assessment are being used to revise the course so as to align objectives more closely with needs of students and community entities that serve persons who are Deaf-Blind.

AB  - This article explores the value systems which inform assessment practices in higher education, specifically how particular forms of knowledge valued in the curriculum shape and constrain assessment practices. The data for this article is drawn from two courses which participated in a service learning research and development project at the University of Cape Town. Drawing on Pierre Bourdieu and Basil Bernstein, the article argues that the location of these courseswithin the field of higher education and a particular kind of institution, faculty and departmentshapes their assessment systems, practices and outcomes in certain ways. What is valued in this field (Bourdieu) is a form of knowledge production which requires students `to step out of the particularities'. This form of knowledge operates as a regulative discourse, constituting what counts as legitimate. Using the assessment system as a `window', this article explores how these service learning courses constitute and are constituted by the regulative discourse of the field. While the constraints of the field are powerful, this project offers some hopeful signs of forms of curriculum, pedagogy and assessment that, at the very least, name and challenge these underlying value systems.

AB  - There has been much interest in an alternative form of learning activities, collectively known as service learning, within the field of psychology. These educational experiences typically involve some volunteer service that students perform, as individuals or in groups, for their immediate or surrounding communities. Service learning is a twofold process: performing significant acts by which one learns of the importance of community service, while applying course material to the service experience as a teaching methodology (Wilson, 1998). Psychology courses, such as Learning and Cognition, can be an ideal context in which students involve themselves in service learning. As students of psychology know, fundamental learning processes and classic learning theories are at the heart of such a course. The experience of service learning gave students a much deeper and more direct understanding of the principles of learning and behavior. Students in PSYC 3403 Learning and Cognition were required to participate in a service learning project. Upon completion of the project, the students filled out a survey to evaluate the service learning experience. The survey results showed that the students' perception of the project was positive. The student qualitative responses were consistent in mentioning the value of seeing learning theories in action in "real-life" and in the value of serving one's community. Service learning is a powerful tool that reinforces classroom lessons and teaches life lessons. Students were impressed by the opportunity to see theory in action and also deeply affected by the needs of the community that they encountered.

AB  - Service learning is an educational experience that involves an organized service activity with structured reflection to guide students' learning. This embeds teaching and learning in a social context larger than a classroom. The author designed the service learning project to apply empirically tested service learning principles to the mastering of classic learning theories in a Learning and Cognition course. Students filled out a 15 question survey to evaluate the service learning project after they completed their service hours and reflection paper. Results showed that their perception of the project was positive. The hands-on, practical application of academic knowledge really made an impact on students. Students believe that service learning helped them gain a better understanding of classroom material, and helped them grow as citizens of their local community, and for many of them, in their faith. Many student comments connected their service learning experience with the structured reflection assignment of the paper. Service learning can help promote knowledge of human cultures, intellectual and practical skills, personal and social responsibility, and integrative and applied learning. As Psychology faculty, we are in a great position to leverage the power of service learning for our students, ourselves, and our communities.

AB  - A qualitative case study was designed to investigate The Responsive Classroom® (RC) and its effect on school culture and service learning. Two elementary schools within the same district participated. School A implemented the RC approach to teaching and learning, while School B did not. Surveys, interviews, and an examination of district and service learning programs at School A provided a triangulation of data used to examine the impact of RC practices in an elementary school. Responses from eight teachers at School A and five teachers at School B were tabulated, analyzed, and compared. Results revealed positive responses from both schools. Teachers at School A replied that the RC approach did impact school culture and service learning. While most responses were positive, one participant at School A was non-committal regarding some questions during the interview stage and was not sure if the school was an RC school. Responses at School B were also positive. Teachers felt the classroom or school influenced school culture and service learning. The amount of service learning at School B remained unclear due to the 20% to 40% response rate to most service learning questions in the “not applicable” column. Documents from the district and service learning programs at School A were related to RC or research on developing school culture and service learning. This study provided information regarding RC's positive influence on school culture and service learning from a teacher's perspective.

AB  - A constant desire of the American public is the reform and improvement of educational practice. Service-learning is one such reform that recently has caught the attention of educators, politicians, and the general public. Its advocates suggest it as a way to make public education more responsive to the needs of students and as a way to strengthen democratic institutional and participatory practice. It is also, however, in need of conceptual clarification. Until service-learning is understood at its most basic, foundational level, it may well travel the path that other reforms have and never reach its full potential. The purpose of this study is to clarify the service-learning concept so that its practice will be successful. As a study that provides conceptual clarity, it is necessarily philosophical in method. This philosophical analysis relies heavily on the work of both progressive philosophers of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries as well as contemporary service-learning scholars to provide the foundational guidance needed to understand service-learning and, therefore, its practice as a democratic, educational reform. The author first traces the conceptual history of service-learning, tying it to the thought of progressive philosophers such as John Dewey, William James, William Kilpatrick, and Paul Hanna. He then brings the service-learning idea through the twentieth century and in doing so indicates when and how the current conceptual confusion has developed. The subsequent chapters attempt to clarify those concepts that drive service-learning practice. Those concepts are service, experiential education, and reflection. The conceptual framework developed from the analysis of each of these notions then is used to determine the appropriate aims of service-learning education. Finally, service-learning is “placed” in the context of democratic educational practice as a way to determine its viability as an educational reform and to suggest further research endeavors that might test the conceptual understanding embraced by this study. Ultimately, this project provides a foundation upon which future service-learning practice can be based and current service-learning practice can be constructively critiqued.

AB  - Service-learning has been defined as a teaching and learning approach that integrates community service with academic study to enrich learning, teach civic responsibility, and strengthen communities. The effective application of this strategy often requires student participation beyond the safety of the classroom in a wide variety of environments containing different potential safety issues. It is important to determine potential challenges that service-learning presents to safety and prescribe effective measures that reduce risk and enhance the service-learning experience. This study sought to identify safety issues arising in the field to determine the unique nature of safety with regards to service-learning in an effort to promote responsible application. In this study, six service-learning practitioners participated in a qualitative panel discussion of their experiences related to safety in service-learning. The study identified 12 themes emerging from an analysis of the panel's experiences essential to safe practice. The themes were communication, preplanning, project familiarity, project appropriateness, student conduct, service impact, student ownership, adult supervision, community partner, administration, parental consent, and transportation. The study concluded with recommendations for further study, including a recommendation to develop a practical theory or model of safe service-learning practice.

AB  - Community Service Learning (CSL) is, potentially, the most powerful and far-reaching educational reform movement in recent memory. Yet, that potential has yet to be realized. One major reason for CSL's limited success is found in its runaway conceptual confusion: in becoming everything to everyone, CSL has lost its philosophical bearings and, not surprisingly, its practical value. This study attempts to restore CSL's philosophical bearings, arguing that there are particular understandings of its components that imply particular kinds of educational practices. In this philosophical clarification lies the hope that CSL can meet its immense potential as a transformative school and community practice. This book is a must-have for teachers, school administrators, educational scholars, and students who have an interest in making schools a vital community resource.

AB  - A context-relevant curriculum is responsive to educational and societal demands. Nurse practitioner (NP) faculty members are challenged to prepare practitioners to provide high-quality compassionate care to diverse populations. Changes in the health care environment, a limited number of clinical sites and preceptors, and competition for access to clinical sites necessitate creative solutions and curriculum development. Service learning, as a curricular strategy, facilitated NP students to achieve academic course goals, appreciate the NP role working with underserved populations, and translate classroom knowledge to the clinical environment.

AB  - Students face many challenges, in particular morbid emphasis on academic excellence has created much competition and stress in students. It has been estimated that around one-fifth of secondary school students have different forms of mental disorders and in a three-year longitudinal study, it was found that: the prevalence rates of internet addiction in Secondary 1, Secondary 2 and Secondary 3 students were 26.4%, 26.6% and 22.5%, respectively. In the same; study, suicidal ideation in junior secondary school students was found In more than one-tenth of the students. At the same time, there were more than two-tenth of students showing signs of self-harm and suicidal behavior in junior secondary years. Besides, the number of adolescents experiencing economic; disadvantage has increased, while family solidarity has dropped in recent years. In this book, we will describe examples from Hong Kong on how to promote social responsibilities, service learning and leadership in students in order to promote a positive holistic development.

AB  - This chapter investigates the effectiveness of class learning of service leadership in the Global Youth Leadership Programme (GYLP) using qualitative evaluation, which is the first qualitative evaluation study conducted for non-credit-bearing service leadership education in Hong Kong. Students reported their perception of class learning through three descriptors and one metaphor. Findings based on 47 students' reflection showed that 93.29% of the descriptors and 91.30% of the metaphors used by the students were positive. Together with other quantitative evaluation findings, this study suggests that service leadership education in the GYLP is effective to promote participating students' personal growth and service leadership development.

AB  - Successful engineering students should possess competence in both technical and professional traits such as creativity and leadership. This paper investigates how an engineering service learning module with a focus on leadership can affect engineering students' confidence level for technical and professional traits. This leadership module was offered as part of our first-year course that aims to expose freshmen to general engineering principles. The research question in this paper addresses what is the effect, if any, of an engineering service learning module on (1) the confidence levels of women and men as it relates to eleven National Academy of Engineering (NAE) and ABET engineering traits and (2) their confidence in and perceptions of leadership. Data were collected via two surveys administered at the beginning and end of the module. One hundred and thirteen students returned both NAE-ABET surveys and fifty-two returned both leadership surveys. A two-tailed Student's t-test with equal variance was utilized with a confidence level of both 95% and 90% to test for statistical significance. The results showed leadership module students increased in confidence in all NAE-ABET and leadership skills, while students not in the module increased less or decreased in confidence in most NAE-ABET skills. Women in our leadership module increased their confidence on all NAE-ABET skills, while other women experienced no significant increase in confidence level. Within the leadership module, women's confidence increased more than men's confidence in all but four NAE-ABET traits. The statistical trends of students' survey responses and qualitative analysis of the comments show no negative impact on their confidence in technical and professional skills when compared with students in the more technical modules. Moreover, qualitative responses from women indicate overwhelming appreciation for the experience and skills gained from the leadership module, as well as increased confidence for women as engineers.

AB  - The PACERS Small Schools Cooperative is an association of 29 small public schools in 25 communities in rural Alabama whose goal is to keep schools open by making visible their viability. To that end, the schools of the cooperative develop appropriate curricular and extracurricular opportunities for schools and students that involve the people in the community; they develop these curricula "in house" using their own teachers and their own interactive technology; they promote active learning in the schools, and by extension create active communities; and they generate information and research. They have made connections between schools and communities in order to forge long-term partnerships that produce public outcomes. Active learning, place-based learning, public outcomes, and"consequential learning" have enabled young people to know that they can make a difference and be recognized in their communities as people who make a difference. Cooperative achievements include finding a lot of partners and funders, starting over 50 school-based enterprises through the "Alabama Real" program, and being invited and funded by the Alabama Legislature to implement all of Alabama's mandated courses online as well as develop remediation courses. The PACERS experience shows what happens when people come together to build upon their own strengths, use their own resources, make their work public, and intend to change the way things are. (TD)

AB  - This article describes Heart to Heart Art, an after-school program developed for homeless children and youth at the YWCA in Spokane, Washington. Pre-service teacher candidates from a local university create meaningful activities that engage homeless students in visual art, music, drama, cooking, and community service. Heart to Heart Art was created to offer a nurturing, supportive climate for all students. The creation of art can foster a sense of belonging, success, and creativity, as long as students have the freedom to follow their own inspirations and develop original designs. Quality after-school programs can provide hope for homeless students, families, and schools. They can offer structured activities for youth, providing positive interactions with healthy adults who can serve as role models. Children can develop positive relationships with peers and adults and become engaged in meaningful activities during the after school hours. The Heart to Heart program offers a sanctuary for homeless children, providing an anchor of stability in an otherwise unstable life.

AB  - School libraries are untapped resources for fieldwork by preservice teachers. Many school librarians have expertise in pedagogy and standards-based curriculum development, both for information literacy and for technology integration. By forging partnerships with teacher-preparation programs, school librarians can provide fieldwork sites rich in technology while helping pre-service teachers understand how school libraries support student learning. Service-learning opportunities in school libraries also open the door for future collaboration between school librarians and researchers. More pragmatically, pre-service teachers can provide additional support and knowledge for ambitious technology programming in school libraries. For these reasons, faculty at the University of Wyoming began conversations with school librarians about the feasibility of pre-service teachers volunteering in authentic settings to gain technology-integration skills. Because pre-service teachers in a technology-integration course were beginning their degree programs, they were not at a point where they could assume primary instructor responsibilities. Since stakeholders wanted pre-service teachers to be actively involved in lesson implementation, they focused on informal, after-school programs. To examine feasibility, test curricular ideas, and explore available resources, university faculty volunteered in after-school clubs during one semester. This article discusses the program's challenges and successes from both the library and teacher education perspective. Overall, despite the challenges, the article concludes that school librarians, teacher education faculty, and pre-service teachers found the service-learning opportunity valuable. Exposure to technology integration in authentic contexts helped pre-service teachers learn the multiple roles of school librarians as well as the literacies associated with effective integration (Asselin 2000; Hunt and Luetkehans 2013). Volunteers also provided valuable support during school programs, allowed librarians to focus more specifically on their curricular responsibilities, and provided valuable reviews of technology and curricular materials.

AB  - Background: Health professions education recognizes the value of students' engagement in community service, exemplified by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education's adoption in 2007 of a standard requiring service learning opportunities to be available for medical students. Description: At our institution, a community service office was established in 1993 to provide students information about volunteer community service opportunities. Evaluation: Since 1993, more than 150,000 service hours have been performed by students in the community. There has been a clear increase in medical student participation. We have found that medical school community service participation is positively associated with better academic performance and can influence residency selection and participation in service following graduation. Conclusions: With the increased need to develop service opportunities for students, institutions will be required to establish infrastructures to support this. We offer recommendations to others interested in a creating a similar office or program for students.

AB  - Reviews the book, Leadership Development Through Service Learning edited by Wendy Wagner and Jennifer M. Pigza (see record [rid]2016-34752-000[/rid]). This volume of New Directions for Student Leadership makes two assumptions. The first is that service learning, when done right, easily translates itself to a leadership development experience. The other is that any service-learning endeavor that is not oriented toward social justice is unfair to both sides and is perhaps even unethical. According to the reviewer, independently, service learning and leadership are useful tools to enhance student performance and outcomes. If one is inclined to integrate social justice into the mix, then these articles will provide strong theoretical and moral support as well as specific suggestion and examples.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although health disparities are commonly addressed in preclinical didactic curricula, direct patient care activities with affected communities are more limited. PURPOSE: To address this problem, health professional students designed a preclinical service-learning curriculum on hepatitis B viral (HBV) infection, a major health disparity affecting the Asian/Pacific Islander (API) population, integrating lectures, skills training, and direct patient care at student-run clinics. SETTING: An urban health professions campus. METHODS: Medical and other health professional students at University of California, San Francisco, organized a preclinical didactic and experiential elective, and established two monthly clinics offering HBV screening, vaccination, and education to the community. RESULTS: Between 2004 and 2009, 477 students enrolled in the student-led HBV curriculum. Since the clinics' inception in 2007, 804 patients have been screened for chronic HBV; 87% were API immigrants, 63% had limited English proficiency, and 46% were uninsured. Serologically, 10% were found to be chronic HBV carriers, 44% were susceptible to HBV, and 46% were immune. DISCUSSION: Our student-led didactic and experiential elective can serve as an interprofessional curricular model for learning about specific health disparities while providing important services to the local community.

AB  - Student-run clinics (SRCs) are widespread, but studies on their educational impact are limited. We surveyed preclinical medical, nursing, and pharmacy students about their experiences in a hepatitis B elective which provided opportunities to they could volunteer at hepatitis B screening and vaccination SRCs. Student responses revealed positive perceptions of the volunteer experience. Benefits included interacting with patients, developing clinical skills, providing service to disadvantaged populations, and collaborating with health professional peers. Students who participated in clinic reported enhanced skills compared to those who did not attend. SRCs play a valuable role in instilling positive attitudes and improving skills.

AB  - This study reports the multistage development of the Community Service Attitudes Scale (CSAS), an instrument for measuring college students' attitudes about community service. The CSAS was developed based on Schwartz's helping behavior model. Scores on the scales of the CSAS yielded strong reliability evidence (coefficient alphas ranging from .72 to .93). Principal components analysis yielded results consistent with the Schwartz model. In addition, the CSAS scale scores were positively correlated with gender, college major, community service experience, and intentions to engage in community service. The CSAS will be useful to researchers for conducting further research on the effects of service learning and community service experiences for students.

AB  - Over the past several decades, there has been an increased focus on health promotion as opposed to individual health determinants and disease prevention. Given the association between health and academic success, health promotion is a vastly overlooked lever for establishing effective K-12 schools. Student, organizational, and community well-being are intricately linked, and thus, focusing on any one of these alone will not eliminate achievement gaps and health disparities. We assert that university-community collaboration is instrumental in promoting student and family well-being. Moreover, employing an ecological systems lens to inform partnership and health promotion practices facilitates collective action and magnifies results. In this article, we describe the philosophical and theoretical orientations that guide our teaching, service, and scholarship. We explain how a university undergraduate course that utilizes service-learning has leveraged theory to build university-community collaboration. Using illustrative examples of several service-learning projects, we show how an ecological systems orientation has enhanced the course; supported a systemic approach to health promotion in schools and communities; and facilitated strategic, mutual, and sustained partnerships. We conclude by highlighting the implications of an ecological approach to university-community collaboration, including organizational capacity building, implementation of evidence-based practices, and the need to enhance preservice teacher education.

AB  - Purpose: To quantify self-reported changes in student professional behaviours and skills after a 10-week community-based experience. Method: Twenty-eight physiotherapy students (22 women, 6 men; mean age 21.9 years, SD 2.9) were each matched with a young person with Down syndrome, who was randomly allocated to an intervention or control group. The intervention group completed a 10-week, twice a week progressive resistance training (PRT) programme. The control group completed a 10-week, once a week social programme. Before and after the experience, the students completed a self-reported assessment of their skills in prescribing and supervising PRT, professional behaviours, confidence and the likelihood they would work with people with intellectual disability in the future. Between-group differences were analysed using analysis of covariance with baseline measures as covariate. Results: There were between-group differences for 7 items rating skills implementing PRT, in favour of the intervention group, but not for any other outcome. Across both groups, students self-reported positive changes in their professional behaviours, confidence and the likelihood they would work with people with intellectual disability after the programme. Conclusions: A 10-week community-based experience produced changes in physiotherapy student professional behaviours. Students who completed the exercise programme self-reported an improvement in their professional skills relating to PRT.

AB  - This study applied self-determination theory to youth purpose development among Korean college students. It examined the effects of students’ intrinsic motivation for volunteering and informative feedback from significant others on three dimensions of life purpose: confidence in purpose, commitment to purpose and social contribution. The study also tested whether informative feedback influenced the relationship of intrinsic motivation and life purpose development. Participants were 110 Korean college students taking a one-semester service-learning class. The results showed that informative feedback positively affected commitment to purpose and social contribution, especially for students who had low intrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation and feedback both positively predicted students’ confidence in purpose. To positively influence students’ life purpose development, these results suggest the importance of providing college students with intrinsically motivated experiences plus informative feedback that supports their competence during service work.

AB  - There has been a substantial increase in the number of aging-related educational programs in the United States over the last two decades. Many of these programs utilize an experiential-learning approach, such as intergenerational service-learning, to train gerontology students to work effectively with older adults. This paper presents a model of training called the Bridge program, which is based in experiential learning and incorporates some of the broader goals of service-learning. Launched in 2003, the Bridge program involves graduate students residing in a retirement community for at least one academic year. The main goals of the program include: educating the students and the public about the aging process, recruiting future gerontologists, providing research opportunities for the Bridge students, and contributing to the retirement community. Evaluation of the program reveals several critical issues for successful implementation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, the Gulf Coast faced the difficulty of rebuilding and trying to reignite commerce. This service learning project was aimed at assisting in the renewal of the area while getting students involved in a charitable learning exercise. The project focused on students from a graduate marketing course developing a promotions strategy. The campaign "Shop to Rebuild" was a temporary Web site that acted as a portal, or "one-stop" shop, for people wanting to help the businesses damaged by the hurricane. The service learning project for the graduate marketing course gave students a first-hand. Look at what is involved in promoting a Web site on a very tight budget. The class was small-only eight students-so essentially the class acted as one team to design and implement a plan to promote the site. Students in the promotion class quickly learned that promotion is not a matter of "if we build it, they will come." After writing and distributing a news release, students followed up with media directly, but were faced with the cruel reality of rejection. Media attention to the site was a disappointment, but most students agreed that the project was worthwhile and a great learning experience. The interaction between students and business owners in New Orleans was a lesson in itself for the students.

AB  - This article describes a senior capstone, Neighborhoods and Health, which used community-based research (CBR) as its primary pedagogy. Students in the course drew upon multiple research methods and forms of data to provide our partner, the Urban Farming Institute of Boston, with an array of research products in support of the revitalization of a historic farm in the Boston neighborhood of Mattapan. Based on pre- and posttest assessment and analysis of students' reflections in their journals, we identify how a multimethods approach-combined with a commitment to producing usable research products-simultaneously contributed to students' research methods proficiency and their understanding of complex social processes. For both sociology departments and interdisciplinary majors that draw on sociological perspectives, CBR offers a compelling means of providing seniors with meaningful capstone experiences while adding capacity to the important work of community-based organizations.

AB  - Objective. To assess the impact of pharmacy students teaching a diabetes self-management education (DSME) class on their competence and confidence in providing diabetes education. Design. Pharmacy students enrolled in a service-learning elective first observed pharmacy faculty members teaching a DSME class and then 4 weeks later organized and taught a DSME class to a different group of patients at a student-run free medical clinic. Assessment. Student performance as assessed by faculty members using a rubric was above average, with a mean score of 3.3 on a 4.0 scale. Overall, student confidence after teaching the group DSME class was significantly higher than before teaching the class. Conclusion. Organizing and teaching a DSME class improved third-year pharmacy students' confidence and diabetes knowledge and skills, as well as provided a valuable service to patients at a free medical clinic.

AB  - Recent efforts to improve civic education have focused on improving students' knowledge and engagement by increasing their exposure to history and civics content, implementing better state standards, improving teacher education, and instituting more service learning requirements. This dissertation argues that we must look beyond knowledge acquisition and behavioral indicators of engagement, broadening our attention to the thought processes necessary for democratic citizenship—that is, "democratic thinking." This study begins to identify and describe the cognitive components underlying problem solving and decision-making in a democracy, and sheds light on the range between novice and more sophisticated thought processes. In an initial study using products of democratic thinking to uncover its components, I analyzed the work of political theorists and found four salient features of their thinking—(1) key democratic concepts and conceptual tensions, (2) formative knowledge, (3) public reason, and (4) deliberative decision-making. In a second study, I looked at democratic thinking in action, focusing on formative knowledge, or knowledge in use. Using the think aloud method, I analyzed the thought processes of eight political scientists' and eight high school students' as they grappled with the issue of bipartisanship in U.S. politics. I found that members of both groups had existing theories that they employed when expressing their views. These ideas influenced the way both scholars and students reasoned with new information. Far from being tabula rasa, students had working concepts and theories that played a central role in their thinking. However, compared to political scientists, students often employed superficial understanding of democratic concepts, lacking relevant knowledge that might enhance their understanding. Not surprisingly, sophisticated thinkers had more knowledge, but, more importantly, they used their knowledge to construct, support, and elaborate ideas and issues; to scrutinize and evaluate information; and to challenge others' assertions and arguments. These findings have implications for curriculum specialists, teachers, and teacher educators. Social studies curriculum and instruction should provide opportunities for students to use their knowledge to reason about civic issues. Teacher education courses should focus on helping teachers develop research-based goals and instructional techniques that will equip students to use knowledge and information effectively.

AB  - In this chapter, the goal is to consider 'best practices' towards preparing school psychologists to engage in these sorts of 'pro social justice' actions. Of course, the very notion that social justice is something that can and should be taught in graduate education and professional development activities is contested. This chapter is organized around two primary theme areas: 'foundations' and 'implementation'. In the 'foundations' section, the context from which teaching for social justice is being practiced is explored. In the 'implementation' section, drawing from both the school psychology literature and literature from related fields, several models and perspectives on implementing social justice education are provided. The chapter closes with a case example from the author's own experience utilizing service learning as an outlet for teaching for social justice.

AB  - This think piece examines the role of community in educational reform. The paper maintains that while many scholars, business people, and politicians have advocated the creation of a community covenant--a mutually beneficial relationship between schools and their communities--such programs have never really taken hold. The paper advocates that as the reform movement develops in the 1990s, it is time to consider actively engaging students in the community. Such thinking may provide the philosophy and programs necessary to change dramatically the way schooling is done in the United States and reconnect parents, business people, and community agencies with schools for great benefit. The paper argues that in doing so, confidence can again be restored in public schools. (EH)

AB  - This chapter examines qualitative studies on career education programs, tutoring, school-to-work programs, and experiential-learning programs that provide insight into the process of service-learning in the schools and community. Studies highlighted in this chapter are based on detailed, in-depth observations of programs. The duration of the studies is usually greater than 3 mo, and in some cases encompasses up to 3 yrs of work. Reference to qualitative study indicates that information was acquired primarily through participant observation, interview, review of documents, or any discovery method other than paper-and-pencil tests. The chapter concludes with an examination of a study on exemplary practices in service-learning programs. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This Digest describes how, by connecting service, social studies, and citizenship, civic educators have the potential to begin the new millennium by initiating a "Century of the Caring Citizen". Effective methods for bring about the caring citizen are to allow students to learn and develop through active participation in thoughtfully organized experiences that meet actual community needs; to integrate service into students' academic curriculum and provide structured time for thinking, talking, or writing about the service activity; to provide students with opportunities to use newly acquired skills and knowledge in real-life situations in their own communities; and to enhance what is taught in schools by extending learning into the community and help foster the development of a sense of caring for others. Research indicates that well-conceptualized, well-administered service programs produce positive changes in students, including increased social and personal responsibility, more favorable attitudes toward adults, growth in moral and ego development, and increased self-esteem. For social studies teachers to effectively implement service-learning, they should be involved in service activities in their pre-service training by participating in classrooms where service learning projects are taking place. Existing guidelines on service-learning describe the important components of high-quality programs: (1) provide choice and challenge to students; (2) connect schools and communities in positive ways that meet real needs; and (3) engage in ongoing program assessment and evaluation. Concludes with a list of 12 references. (JH)

Porfilio and Heather Hickman (see record [rid]2011-11271-000[/rid]). This book provides more than a dozen examples of how service learning is being used to change students and society, making students aware of the causes of social injustice and instilling in them a sense of purpose to use education as a tool for creating a different world. Beautifully and thoughtfully presented, the book shows that the history of the progressive education movement has been reinvigorated with a new group of young educators and researchers who strive to remind us that inequities in power, wealth, access, and opportunity are still very much alive and to ensure that we haven’t forgotten the wisdom of Freire, Giroux, Shor, Foucault, Habermas, Borda, and Gramsci.

AB  - A real-life experience is a "moving force" that can be part of the elementary social studies curriculum. This article discusses an experiential learning about India and describes how the author integrates the arts and service learning in his third grade classroom. It also describes class activities that enhance social studies curriculum and engage students in real-life, meaningful experiences that connect them to living cultures, social issues, and enduring humanitarian values. As the author begins an interdisciplinary unit of study on India each year, he witnesses the dramatic transformation of his third graders from learners to activists. His work in the social studies relies on engagement with real people and hands-on experiences with Indian culture, thus providing authentic voices from India for his students to hear. In promoting the social studies, the author endeavors to provide his students with opportunities to listen, learn, and respond. (Contains 12 notes.)

AB  - This paper describes the process of developing a revising service-learning component in an undergraduate psychology and family consumer science course through a reflective process of continual modification. Service-learning can be an effective pedagogical tool if it involves reflection, but facilitating student reflection can be challenging. Reflection upon student learning drove continual modification of the service-learning component over the course of five semesters. Lessons learned from this process, illustrated by excerpts from student course evaluations and reflection papers, are outlined and related suggestions for teachers and researchers interested in service-learning are included.

AB  - With the focus on test scores and accountability, the issues of student growth, leadership and civic responsibility often are overlooked. While achievement is important, leadership and responsibility issues are among those most sought by employers. Some of the most recognized studies, such as "A Nation At Risk" support and encourage what are sometimes termed the "soft skills." The Service Learning model, not only encourages the development of the soft skills, it actively engages students the curricular content of the class while using leadership and teaming skills to serve their greater community.

AB  - Urban environmental education programs afford opportunities for youth to learn about environmental issues and take action to improve urban environments. Moreover, these programs may promote positive youth development for those that participate. Many programs and organizations strive to engage youth in environmental education and community service. The Student Conservation Association school year program combines service learning with an environmental justice curriculum. For this study, 16 students were recruited. In order to understand youth experience and outcomes in this program, the methodology used included semi-structured interviews, surveys, photovoice, and participant observations. Results showed a deeper understanding of environmental justice issues from pre- to post-program. Participating youth also exhibited changes self-efficacy, self-determination, sense of community, and future orientation during the program, and in post-program results. Students who completed the school year program developed new perspectives on themselves, their community, and their future.

AB  - Objectives Academic service learning (ASL) provides the venue for dental hygiene education to take oral healthcare services directly into communities while at the same time promoting professional responsibility within the student bodies. The purpose of this study was to quantitatively examine the change in pre-existing attitudes and behaviours of dental hygiene students following the incorporation of ASL activities throughout a five-semester dental hygiene curriculum. Methods Seventy-seven first-year dental hygiene students who participated in ASL from the graduating classes of 2008-2010 participated in the study. A survey instrument developed by Shiarella, based on Schwartz's Helping Behaviors Model, was used to assess students' attitudes towards community service. Additionally, questions were developed using Shinnamon's Methods and Strategies for Assessing Service- Learning in the Health Professions. Results Internal estimates of reliability for scales ( Cronbach's α) were all >0.8. The results revealed statistically significant improvements over time in enhanced learning ( P = 0.0001), self-awareness ( P = 0.0001), sense of volunteerism ( P = 0.013), impact on career choices ( P = 0.001) and decrease in personal costs ( P = 0.0001). There were no significant changes in other subscales over time. Further investigating these domains revealed minimal to no changes in attributes of service learning. Conclusion Service learning integrated into the dental hygiene curriculum can enhance learning and improve students' self-awareness, sense of volunteerism, career choices and perception of personal costs. In concert with the literature on ASL, these experiences throughout the curriculum have potential for increasing students' awareness of community need and their roles as oral health professionals.

AB  - Public education in Detroit has long been derided for its abysmal outcomes—low graduation rates, inadequate facilities, dreadful dropout rates, and so on. Complicated by a contentious relationship between the traditional public school system and the rise of charter schools, some would argue that innovative educational reform In Detroit is only a dream. Nonetheless, this chapter highlights two charter schools that have designed innovative educational experiences grounded in high academic standards and community-service learning. In a special issue of Time (October, 5, 2009), Detroit was described as being on life support. This description of Detroit is due to the variety of challenges that have the 11th largest city in America in a financial hole that leaves the city government $300 million short. In spite of the large portion of media attention that has focused on the challenges facing the automobile industry, the ongoing legal troubles of former mayor Kwame Kilpatrick, and a public school system that suffers from improper management, many children in Detroit are obtaining a quality education. Be it public schools, charter schools, or private schools, the educational landscape in Detroit is replete with examples of schools that embody the 'yes we can' motto espoused in the title of this book. As such, it is the intention of this chapter to explore the innovative practices of two public charter schools who are not only innovative in their approach to education, but connect academic excellence and community engagement—Detroit Service Learning Academy (DSLA) and Detroit Edison Public School Academy (DEPSA).

We introduced a dental team into a student-faculty collaborative clinic that serves a low-income Latino population. Documentation of oral exam findings rose from 11.88% to 50.50% in the year following integration of dental students into the clinic.

AB  - The evolving system of health care delivery, emphasizing prevention and early intervention, presents challenges to schools that educate health care professionals. Nursing faculty in a rural mid-Atlantic state initiated a service-learning project, relating education and service through primary care in the surrounding community. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the project outcomes. The 45 students involved in the project responded to Beliefs Related to Professional Nursing Competencies, a quantitative measure (Cronbach's alpha = .84), based on the Pew Health Commission's 'Competencies Needed by Practitioners for 2005,' and to a second measure, Qualitative Questions for Students in Service Learning. Results of quantitative analysis revealed subjects' acceptance of the competencies as nursing responsibilities. Qualitative analysis revealed that students were involved in increasing consumer access to community-based primary care; curricula relating learning to existing problems and rewarding critical thinking was evident; and students were receiving preparation for a health care environment that will rely on their ability to respond to its changing needs.

AB  - An explanatory mixed-methods design was used to evaluate a service-learning model on academic learning, personal and interpersonal development, and community-engagement for 59 service-learning students. A repeated-method ANOVA demonstrates that students improve their academic learning and participation in service but reduce their interests in social institutions, local politics, and communication with community recipients from the beginning to the end of the semester. In addition, a 2 (placement site) x 3 (placement activity) MANOVA indicates that community recipients evaluate tutors' attitudes and skills more favorably than social-recreational leaders. Content analyses of student reflections explain the mixed quantitative findings and show how the "value added" from participating in service-learning leads to students' interpersonal and personal development.

AB  - A triangulation mixed-methods design was used to demonstrate that cultural-based service-learners in a high diversity condition (N = 51) increased more from the beginning to the end of the semester in their social justice awareness and academic engagement skills than did cultural-based service-learners in a low diversity condition (N = 33). Cultural-based service-learners showed positive changes over the semester in problem-solving skills, awareness of racial privilege and blatant racial issues, ethnic identity, and racial attitudes, regardless of whether they were exposed to high or low diversity content. Cultural-based service-learners acquired culture competence as they moved through 5 stages of racial identity development before, during, and after service. Implications for developing culturally based service-learning courses are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Over the past several years, the number of academic- and cultural-based service-learning courses has increased in higher education (Marxen, 2003). Academic- and cultural-based service-learning are pedagogical approaches that connect academic learning with community service by providing students with opportunities to learn about social disparities associated with diverse communities (Boyle-Baise, 2005; Waldstein & Reiher, 2001). Cultural-based service-learning (CBSL) also known as multicultural service-learning intentionally integrates race- or diversity-related content with service experiences through which students examine their personal bias, gain a better understanding of diversity, and critically analyze the perceived realities of social injustices that affect the community (Baldwin, Buchanan, & Rudisill, 2007; Boyle-Baise, 2005; Waldstein & Reiher, 2001). The few studies that have been conducted on CBSL suggest that service experiences in diverse schools and community settings contribute to the development of students' multicultural skills (Boyle-Baise, 2002a; O'Grady, 2000; Root, Callahan, & Sepanski, 2001; Wade, 2000). The present study offers a comparative evaluation of cultural-based and academic-based service-learning. The purpose of this study is to measure differences in personal and interpersonal development and community engagement between cultural- and academic-based service-learners with quantitative and qualitative methods.

AB  - A comparative analysis was conducted on student attitudes and skills among student interns, academic-based service-learners, and cultural-based service-learners. Students did not differ in scores at the beginning of the semester, but by the end of the term student interns had higher multicultural awareness and intercultural relationship scores and lower racial and civic attitude scores than did cultural-based service-learners. Field supervisors also appraised student interns as having a better ability to develop relationships with professionals at placement sites than service-learners. The consistency of data from field supervisors and students suggest that the alignment between the course content and the service activity is associated with student development and learning.

AB  - In Illinois school districts, a service-learning mentoring program is being used to increase student retention and achievement by providing student-led social support for high school freshmen, as well as opportunities for student development, civic engagement and academic success. The National Dropout Prevention center/Network (NDPC/N) recommends service-learning as an effective strategy for increasing students' self-esteem, promoting social development via opportunities to work in teams and collaborate with others, and developing their sense of responsibility. Mentoring is also highly recommended strategy. In 2007, the Illinois Lieutenant Governor's Office provided an opportunity to apply for the K-12 School-Based Learn and Serve Grant. This grant aims to address the need to enhance the freshman transition experience in its districts. This article discusses the planning, implementation, and the operation of the service-learning program in Illinois for 2007-2010. (Contains 5 endnotes.)

AB  - Background Experiential learning through service provides opportunities to nurture and practice empathy. Of growing concern, studies showed significantly decreased empathy scores as students progress through medical school. Additionally, peer-to-peer learning provides an effective way for students to learn. Constructing Care Collaboration (CCC) is a student initiated, structured-service-learning-program that promotes the development of empathy and peer-to-peer teaching. CCC is conducted in cycles of 6 sessions. This is a mixed methods study that explores the effectiveness of CCC as a service learning platform in developing student participants' empathy, social and cultural competencies, communication skills and peer-to-peer teaching skills, ultimately aiming to promote a culture of serving the underprivileged. Methods The study comprised of a self-administered quantitative questionnaire and qualitative interviews. Both evaluated if CCC participation developed volunteers' social-awareness, cultural competency, communication, confidence and motivation to teach their peers. Results Quantitative data were collated from 38 completed student volunteers' questionnaires. Volunteers generally agreed CCC improved social-awareness and cultural competency. It increased confidence of participants in approaching migrant-workers, communicating with people from different social backgrounds, and promoted a culture of peer-to-peer teaching. Thematic analysis of 17 interviews was conducted. Themes identified include: increased empathy towards migrant-workers, improved communication skills, and identifying benefits and challenges in peer-to-peer teaching. Conclusion From the quantitative and qualitative information gathered, CCC has been shown to be effective in nurturing participants' self-reported empathy, cultural competence, communication skills and improved attitude towards peer-to-peer teaching. Given its effectiveness, CCC can be adopted as a model for structured service-learning.

AB  - Abstract Many secondary schools address diversity as an aspect of citizenship education. This paper examines how secondary teachers' understandings and practices concerning teaching about diversity are related to school contextual factors, such as student composition and educational track. Semi-structured interviews with 17 teachers at three schools revealed that teachers' understandings and practices regarding diversity are related to their perceptions of the needs and capabilities of their student population. However, teachers rarely addressed diversity in terms of deep-rooted issues, such as inequality and power relations. The paper concludes with implications for teachers and schools and provides suggestions for future research. Highlights • Teachers' diversity-related practices are largely influenced by the school context. • Teachers' diversity-related understandings are less strongly dependent on the school context. • Teachers' understandings and practices are related to their perceptions of the students. • Teachers rarely addressed deep-rooted issues such as inequality and power relations. • Implications for teachers and schools are discussed.

AB  - In this chapter, the author discusses the mentorship role that she established with her students. In her midlevel psychology course, her students learn about psychological changes that occur in girls as they progress through adolescence (with an emphasis on socially constructed gender-typed influences from early adolescence to early adulthood). Her students work directly with adolescent girls in a variety of local middle schools, while applying classroom-based scientific and theoretical knowledge of adolescent development to the service-learning setting. In this setting, both her students and the middle school girls learn and grow from these activities and mentorship. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Action Process Teaching, an outgrowth of more than a decade of teaching methods used in a course in "The Psychodynamics of Family Relations" at Columbia's Teachers Coll in NY, is discussed relative to its effectiveness in student learning. The hypothesis that if the dynamics of familial relations are understood, it should be possible to perceive analogous dynamics at work in other relationships is the basis of the course. An underlying assumption, that this can be achieved through a reexperiencing of some significant events in the personal histories of the students, suggested the basically experimental & dynamic methods of using group discussion, role playing & video-taping of significant events in the family life cycle of the students. Class session vignettes are presented to show how these methods were effective in letting the students learn through experience &, particularly, through the use of video-tape for its impact & reinforcement of learning.

AB  - In an effort to infuse gerontological content throughout a BSW curriculum, the College of Mount St. Joseph developed community partnerships with agencies that serve older adults. These partnerships led to specific "out-of-class" assignments in a macro social work practice class using a service-learning approach. The development and implementation of those assignments in the agency settings are described using Polvika's Conceptual Model for Community Interagency Collaboration. The successful outcomes are described in terms of the community partnership, services and benefits provided, and the degree of satisfaction by the agencies, students, and faculty with this pedagogical method.

AB  - Strategies for developing and putting into practice an experiential aging-rich learning curriculum for baccalaureate social work students are presented. Specific service learning opportunities required of students in class assignments are discussed. Included in these are projects involving micro social work practice skills with cognitively impaired older adults and macro skills used in completing a retirement center’s wellness program assessment and an adult day care program’s marketing/community outreach plan. The critical component of reflection for both service learning and field practica is analyzed. A continuing need for faculty to network in both the aging and social work communities is explored as a technique for enhancing experiential learning opportunities for students.

AB  - Previous research suggested that for counselors-in-training to become culturally competent they must be given opportunities to become aware that they are racial beings. Training programs are expected to assist White counselors with learning about their identity and how it affects the counseling relationship. They need to be taught about diverse racial/ethnic populations and their worldviews. This study used a case study approach, to investigate the types of multicultural information that White female counselors-in-training bring with them to the practicum course as they begin counseling real clients. The impact that exposure to multicultural information has on their racial identity development over the course of a 16-week semester was also explored. Four White, female counselors-in-training participated in the current study. This research investigated the participants' behavior as they engaged in experiential learning activities, completed self-reflection journals, and participated in discussions. They were expected to integrate multicultural content into counseling sessions with clients that were racially different from them. Participant behaviors were documented via interviews and fieldnotes. Change was determined based on characteristics associated with the Helms' model of White racial identity development. Participants initially displayed limited knowledge related to racial dialogues, racial identity development, and culturally appropriate interventions. During the semester their knowledge about racial identity changed. Participants openly discussed their thoughts about race related material. Participants also had to resolve any emotional discord they experienced because of addressing race related content. Participants began to display an ability to integrate culturally sensitive content during counseling sessions with clients that were racially different from them. Participants began to acknowledge that they are racial beings. They also tried to determine ways to continue to experience growth in this area. Results of the study supported previous research that suggested formal exposure to race related material in training environments promoted cultural competence. This research confirmed that if White counselors-in-training become comfortable discussing race related material in interracial counseling sessions, their racially different clients will share more information. This research expanded knowledge on the types of interventions that need to be in place to promote change in the affective and cognitive domains for future counselors.

AB  - In this article, participatory geographic information systems GIS (PGIS) is explored and established as a powerful platform for geographic education. PGIS pedagogy can help educators meet diverse learning objectives pertaining to: (1) local knowledge and place-based thinking; (2) community engagement; (3) field mapping with geospatial technologies; (4) mixed-methods research; and (5) fostering of critical reflexivity in students. The discussion is supported with insights from multiple student-facilitated PGIS projects organized in rural Tanzania. There also is a thorough discussion of the challenges and caveats associated with involving students in PGIS projects, and a call for new research for assessing and advancing PGIS pedagogy.

AB  - Spiritual intelligence--using a multisensory approach to access one's inner knowledge to solve global problems--can be an integrating theme to engage gifted students in building global awareness in the classroom. This article introduces individuals providing training in higher consciousness and presents examples of strategies to further develop the spiritual intelligence of gifted students, such as exploring existential questions, service-learning, and moral dilemmas. A residential program for secondary gifted students provides an example of engaging the spiritual intelligence of gifted students to build global awareness.

AB  - This article will share the intellectual journey E. Paul Torrance and I traveled in 2001, in which we explored psychology, science and ancient wisdom and traditions, including Native American and indigenous traditions, to establish a foundation for spiritual intelligence. This section will be followed by ways to develop and nurture spiritual intelligence in the classroom, focusing on service learning with student examples; a section on seven ways to develop or raise spiritual intelligence; a section examining efforts initiated and developed in business to develop spiritual intelligence; and servant leadership that incorporates much of what E. Paul Torrance and I called spiritual intelligence: "The capacity to use a multi-sensory approach, including intuition, meditation and visualization, to tap inner knowledge to solve problems of a global nature."

AB  - Using reading and writing to learn, inquire, construct, and examine ideas across the curriculum is central to an integrated curriculum. Too many middle school students do not view writing as a communication process that permeates the curriculum, nor reading as an active, constructivist process whereby various perspectives can be examined and debated. Noting that the challenge in developing integrated curricula is for teachers to relinquish ownership of content areas in order to create a whole curriculum, this book examines the issues inherent in creating an integrated curriculum in the middle school setting. The three parts, each with its own introduction, deal with the "whys" and "whats" of integrative learning, the specifics of such learning, and the building blocks of integrative learning. The articles in the book are: (1) "An Integrated Curriculum Supports Young Adolescent Development" (Edward Brazee); (2) "Myths, Politics, and Meaning in Curriculum Integration" (James Beane); (3) "Facilitating Curriculum Integration: The Principal's Role" (Norm Higgs and others); (4) "Teachers and Students Taking Charge of Curricular Change" (C. Victoria Faircloth); (5) "The Human Element: Teaming" (Timothy Hillmer); (6) "Thinking, Wondering, and Imagining: An Authentic Research Process in Action" (Janice V. Kristo and Betty Robinson); (7) "Student and Teacher Co-Created Integrated Curriculum" (P. Elizabeth Pate and others); (8) "Using Literature to Inquire and Learn" (Yvonne Siu-Runyan); (9) "Helping Students Construct Big Understandings" (Debbie Powell and Dick Needham); (10) "Service Learning and Middle School Students: The Perfect Fit" (Elaine Andrus); and (11) "Selected Resources for Designing, Implementing, and Assessing Integrated Curriculum at the Middle Level" (Barbara L. Whinery and John H. Swain). Most of the articles contain references. (HTH)

AB  - Scholarship on service-learning and experiential learning increasingly demonstrates benefits for student access and success, but evidence is still needed of the impact of these strategies on sustainable development of communities and their infrastructure. This case study examines a university Police and Society course that partners with four police departments to use both experiential learning and service-learning in the form of ride-alongs, simulation trainings, and written and physical examinations, as well as hosting a police-community relations event. Focus groups of students and officers reveal how service-learning and experiential learning build capacity for police-community relations. Orienting students toward officer procedures, requirements, and culture creates a learning opportunity for both students and departments, while police-community relations activities humanize officers and build public understanding and trust.

AB  - This guide is designed to take teachers through a step-by-step process for developing an integrated, standards-based curriculum that focuses on the stories, history, folkways, and agrarian traditions of the local community. Such a place-based curriculum helps students to become culturally literate, makes learning relevant and engaging, draws on the knowledge and understanding of community elders, and reconnects the community to its traditions and history. Part 1 presents a systematic eight-step process for developing and implementing a schoolwide cultural literacy curriculum focused on the history and cultural heritage of the local community. The first step describes a comprehensive 10-stage process for creating and implementing local, standards-based cultural literacy units. Although this first step can stand alone as an effective tool for developing place-based curricula, the remaining steps help to produce a sustainable community-based program. These steps are: identifying a community coordinator, preparing students, preparing elders and community participants, having community members share their stories and knowledge with students, incorporating community service learning, a culminating celebration, and assessment. Part 2 includes a complete sample unit for the fall season and an outline for a winter unit. Throughout the guide are local history activities from around Vermont and from rural California, Alabama, Alaska, and Montana. Appendices present a local history "starter kit," forms, rubrics, checklists, and a glossary. (SV)

AB  - The National Student Service-Learning and Community Service Survey was conducted in spring 1999 to determine the percentage of public K-12 schools that incorporate service learning into their course curriculum. Some of the findings of the study are the following: (1) 64 percent of public schools, including 83 percent of high schools, had students participating in community service activities recognized by or arranged through the school; (2) 57 percent of public schools organized community service activities for their students; (3) 32 percent organized service learning as part of their curriculum, including almost half of high schools; (4) schools with service learning tended to have grade-wide service learning, service learning in individual courses, or discipline-wide service learning; (5) 83 percent of schools with service learning offered some type of support to teachers interested in integrated service learning into the curriculum, with most providing support for service-learning training; and (6) most schools with service learning cited strengthening relationships among students, the school, and the community as key reasons for practicing service learning.

AB  - For students considering careers in the housing industry, moving beyond stereotypical views of low-income individuals is essential to ensuring fair housing opportunities. Using qualitative data from two reflective writing assignments, this research examines changes in the perception of public housing residents and the demonstration of intercultural competence among 69 undergraduate students completing a service-learning project in an affordable housing policy and management course. The majority of students entered the course with stereotypical views of public housing residents. A reflection writing assignment after the service-learning project provided evidence of intercultural competence through an empathetic, informed frame of reference shift. However, a small number of students held firmly to negative, ethnocentric attitudes. This finding suggests that the service-learning project affected students in different ways. More research is needed to understand the differential outcomes related to intercultural competence development and service-learning.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore the perceived impact of an interprofessional education (IPE) program for health sciences students on two culturally diverse, underserved communities. A community resilience/capacity framework, consisting of catalysts (primarily the creation of awareness) and capital components: human (workforce development), social (networking and empowerment) and economic (volunteer labor and money spent by the program), provided the conceptual underpinnings for the study. Focus groups with stakeholders in two communities, one rural and one metropolitan, were audio-recorded, transcribed and analyzed by categorizing data according to each capital component. In addition to the concepts contained in the capacity framework a new category, informational capital (data specific to the community) emerged during the analysis. We suggest that by acting as a catalyst a community based interprofessional program can affect components of community resilience/capacity, primarily human, social, and informational capital. Using the community resilience/capacity framework facilitated exploration of the perceived impact of an educational program on one rural and one urban underserved community beyond assessing student outcomes or number of clients served.

AB  - At the present time, a great number of American schools and certainly the majority of American sport teams are not taking on the responsibility of teaching young women and men the value of cooperation, democratic citizenship, and critical thinking. Because of this, critical educators have begun advocating for a movement in the education system called critical pedagogy, in which it has been theorized that schools can become sites for social transformation and emancipation (McLaren, 2003). There is a similar movement in physical education teacher education programs (Fernandez-Balboa, 1997; Cushion, Armour, & Jones, 2003), but no such actions have been taken in the sport arena. As a result of this dearth, this paper puts forth a model of “athletic praxis” which promotes social transformation through sport. The model for “athletic praxis” is based on the data from an empirical study that was designed to explore the spaces and perceived barriers identified by intercollegiate coaches of women's teams when it comes to the issue of addressing social difference and justice with their athletes. The data was subsequently infused with a model called cultural studies as praxis (Wright, 2002) that currently exists in the education field. “Athletic praxis” consists of three components: theoretical preparation, service learning for social justice, and structured reflection. It is argued in this dissertation that, by incorporating the components of “athletic praxis” into the sport setting, female athletes could develop a heightened sense of civic responsibility during their collegiate career. In this way, sport has the ability to play a key role in an individual's education toward democratic citizenship. Integrating these principles into sport could result in large groups of young women who feel a sense of responsibility to their surrounding community and who see themselves as potential agents of social change. As such, the athletic arena could become another means of working toward social justice in our society.

Found that: (1) preservice teachers should perform service-learning projects prior to other education courses; (2) participation in service-learning projects improved performance on a measure of learning theories and developmental theories; and (3) earlier student involvement in service-learning resulted in more practical applications of theory.

AB  - Background: Service-learning is a pedagogical practice which requires students to learn through engaged service-based community activities. Service-learning requires students become active members in their community. Through this practice student influence their communities, putting their knowledge to use. As a method of instruction, service-learning emphasizes both the service and the learning goals in such a way that both occur and are enriched by each other. This approach helps students realize the importance of learning and the meaning behind curricular choices. Focus of discussion: The current paper discusses the power of service-learning as a transformative educational practice. Many believe that service-learning empowers students to do their best work. Students can affect their communities in unimaginable ways. Through the integration of quality service-learning practices, teachers and students realize the importance of being active citizens. Comments: Students make significant impacts on their communities by participating in service-learning programs. Such programs transform curriculum, realigning learning with experience and empowerment. Yet, such programs are not merely community service; the practice connects the classrooms and curriculum to community needs. Conclusion: From the experience of the author as a practicing service-learning professional and facilitator, information is provided which can assist teachers at all levels of education to initiate service-learning as a pedagogical practice. In this way teachers can become stronger facilitators of students' learning and stewardship.

AB  - In this chapter the author argues that community based learning is essential to multicultural teacher education. When it is guided carefully, such learning can provide the experiential basis for constructing a view of children and their families that recognizes their strengths, and that situates community problems within a larger network of power relations. This view affirms the worth of diverse communities and cultures, and directs us toward challenging institutional discrimination in schools and local communities. This chapter gives in depth discussion of the relationship between service learning, community based learning, and conceptions of power. It also explores culturally relevant teaching, the importance of recognizing community strengths and resources and the political and economic context of multicultural education.

AB  - International service learning is shaped by complex and shifting relationships between different actors with different, sometimes conflicting interests. Especially in Latin America, practice, pedagogy, and politics are intimately entangled, which means that field-oriented pedagogy cannot be neatly separated from its professional and political context. This makes it particularly important to consider the role of students and educators in reinforcing or altering hegemonic relations of power. Service learning projects are often incorporated into existing structures of engagement, but by developing new relationships and ways of speaking in invented spaces, such pedagogy may serve to further insurgent planning practices.

AB  - This article addresses a number of the theoretical and practical issues raised by using personal development planning (PDP) to enhance employability. It briefly discusses the background, rationale and evidence for PDP. It also considers the problems associated with policy implementation: the practicalities of embedding personal development planning into programmes of study, and the problems of curriculum fragmentation, student attitudes and integration with student services. This discussion is followed by the description and evaluation of an innovative third-year social science module designed to tackle these challenges. Finally, the authors provide some recommendations for the further development of PDP in higher education.

AB  - Teachers in elementary schools have increasingly been required to follow pacing guides, given directives on what curriculum to use, and are provided standardized assessments to measure student learning. Curricula used by elementary teachers rarely address the environmental degradation plaguing the planet. School gardens have been used for over a century by educators as a place to promote students learning about the environment, science, and health. However, few studies have been conducted exploring the ways teachers have been influenced by teaching within school gardens. The purpose of this phenomenological study was to better understand the role of school gardens as a learning place, while exploring the lived experiences of teachers' interactions and experiences within school gardens and ways place-based education influenced teachers' pedagogical approaches and curriculum decisions. The four participants who took part in this study were all elementary school teachers at a Central California school. The guiding research question was stated as: How do school gardens function as learning places? Phenomenological methodology was used to explore the shared experiences teachers had with utilizing the school garden as a learning place. From analysis of interviews, classroom and garden observations, and supplemental curricula used by participants, three themes emerged illuminating ways participants' pedagogy and curriculum decisions had been influenced. Interactions and experiences with school gardens inspired participants to integrate project-based learning and interdisciplinary supplemental curriculum into their lessons. Place-based learning helped to build relationships, and the importance of teachers integrating emotional connections in their instructional practices. By teaching content disciplines using interdisciplinary curricula with lessons taught in the school garden, participants were able to integrate project-based learning activities that increased student responsibilities in the learning process and provided service learning opportunities. Conclusions drawn from the findings were that direct interactions and experiences with elements of place-based learning in a school garden influenced the ways in which participants perceived the purpose of their pedagogical approaches and curriculum decisions. Literature supported these findings and reinforced the influence of lessons in school gardens promoting environmental and health education. Connected with the results of this study, implications for practice and recommendations for future research are also presented.

AB  - As part of the 'face' a university projects to the world, student service staff play a key role in constructing an institution's external identity. Yet, there have been few studies of who are the general staff providing these services, and how they define their role within their institutions. Although there have been several excellent studies about the (often difficult) relationship between academic and general staff, and the attitudes of general staff in relation to their customers, these studies have generally considered general staff as a single grouping. This article unpacks the term 'general staff', considering a particular occupational cluster within the loosely grouped classification of 'general'. Drawing on focus groups and interviews, it considers the understanding of the nature of the 'customer', and of a range of working relationships, from the perspective of a group of general staff based in a student and academic service office. It also advances the analysis of the 'customer' in higher education by considering the concept of student and academic service staff as both serving customers, and as the internal customers of academic and other general staff.

AB  - International social work (ISW) has gained traction across the USA with a number of schools taking the lead in promoting the values of social work through exchange programs, service learning, and volunteerism. The internalization of campus through the proactive action of institutions to incorporate global perspectives into teaching, learning, and research in order to build intercultural competence among students, faculty, and staff has received little attention. This paper assesses the level of interest of social work students at a large urban university in the southwestern USA in embracing ISW and how they conceptualized their learning needs. Using a self-administered web-based survey offered to a total of 1,500 social work students with 18% respondent rate, the research determined through a chi-square test that students in Bachelor of Social Work, Master of Social Work, and PhD programs had a significant difference in preferences in areas of interests (χ2 = 153,p ≤ 0.000). Overall, students demonstrated interest in direct practice (74.3%) and community and administrative practice (16.6%). Students also differed in their level of interest in participating in international exchange programs (χ2 = 9.6,p = 0.047). Discussions address specific and unique interests categorized broadly as ‘globalized social worker,’ ‘humanitarian social worker,’ and ‘policy social worker,’ each of which requires specific skillsets and advanced behavior skills.

AB  - The article highlights the implementation of a Smaller Learning Community (SLC) program, dubbed as Mustang Advisory Program (MAP), at Kingwood High School in Kingwood, Texas during the 2001-2002 school year. A primary goal of the SLC is to promote goal setting. The MAP adviser reviews progress reports with students every three weeks and assists students with setting and reaching goals. In addition, service learning and citizenship is a large part of the MAP program. From the benefits of MAP experienced by both students and teachers, it is concluded that SLC lays the groundwork for a powerful and revolutionary program within the school.

AB  - The role of nurse as teacher plays a significant part in maintaining wellness of clients. Students must build professional confidence in their ability to teach health care content. Students learn content, skills and attitude so they can teach content, skills and impact clients' health. Nursing literature supports service learning as an effective means of preparing students for active, professional community roles. This mixed method quasi-experimental study examined whether or not nursing students experienced increased self efficacy related to client teaching following participation in a service learning teaching activity. Quantitative research questions explored potential relationship of increased content knowledge and increased awareness of service learning as a means of learning after participants completed a service learning teaching activity. Participants scored significantly higher on post-content assessment then on pre-content assessment (t = -4.268, df = 41, p = 0.000). Participants scored higher on the post-service learning survey than on the pre-service learning survey (t = -2.148, df = 41, p = 0.041). Qualitative research explored possible increase in student effectiveness in client teaching after participating in a service learning teaching activity. Attitude, content, knowledge and skills were identified as qualitative themes. When principles of nursing education are combined with service learning nursing students are better prepared to teach as nurses in a community setting. Longitudinal research studies are needed to explore the effectiveness of service learning when introduced at the beginning of a nursing curriculum when students have multiple opportunities to experience self efficacy related to skills needed in a community setting.

Participants scored significantly higher on post-content assessment then on pre-content assessment (t = -4.268, df = 41, p = 0.000). Participants scored higher on the post-service learning survey than on the pre-service learning survey (t = -2.148, df = 41, p = 0.041). Qualitative research explored possible increase in student effectiveness in client teaching after participating in a service learning teaching activity. Attitude, content, knowledge and skills were identified as qualitative themes. When principles of nursing education are combined with service learning nursing students are better prepared to teach as nurses in a community setting. Longitudinal research studies are needed to explore the effectiveness of service learning when introduced at the beginning of a nursing curriculum when students have multiple opportunities to experience self efficacy related to skills needed in a community setting.

AB  - This study focuses the status of service-learning incorporated into the secondary engineering and technology classroom in the State of Indiana. Post-secondary engineering service-learning programs have been found to increase student interest in engineering to attract females into engineering (Coyle, Jamieson, & Oakes, 2005). Engineering, Design, and Development (EDD) is the capstone class of Project Lead The Way (PLTW) curriculum taught in many schools across Indiana, in which students design and develop a project that addresses an open-ended engineering problem. Of all the courses offered in the PLTW curriculum, this has the greatest potential for students to engage in a service-learning project, because the open-ended engineering problem could be used to help the community. A Likert-type survey was sent to the 62 secondary technology education teachers in Indiana who were certified to teach EDD during the 2011-2012 school year to identify the frequency at which the core components of service-learning, as identified by the National Service-Learning Clearinghouse (2006), were being implemented in the EDD curriculum. Fifteen teachers completed the survey by the end of the 2011-2012 academic calendar. Four of the 15 EDD teachers (27%) reported that a majority of their students' projects addressed a need in the community, and therefore were considered to be service-learning projects. The percentage of projects that were called service-learning projects by the respondents appeared to have a direct relationship with the total number of students enrolled in the PLTW program, and an inverse relationship with the number of years the teacher had been teaching technology education. Upon further study, only 2 of these EDD teachers (13%) were guiding students to collaborate with their community partner frequently enough to have an experience indicative of high quality service-learning according to the National Service-Learning Clearinghouse.

AB  - The increasing diversity of the U.S. population requires a culturally sensitive health care workforce. This article discusses the planning, implementation, and evaluation of an international clinical experience designed to promote cultural awareness and enhance the clinical skills of nurse practitioner students. The experience was unique in that the program addressed the immediate health care needs of a rural Honduran population while also collaborating with a local capacity building project. Continuity of care was addressed by including professionals from the local health care system when providing care in the schools and clinics. Student and faculty advocacy for building a local hospital supported the community's ability to meet its own health care needs. Student, faculty, and community partner evaluations indicated that the program was effective in developing student clinical practice skills while meeting the needs of the international community.

AB  - Now, more than ever, nurses are practicing in settings in which cultural competence and teamwork are essential to providing quality care. The expectation that nurses provide effective care across varied population groups highlights the need for attainment of cultural competency by baccalaureate nursing graduates. Nursing programs must develop strategies to address this educational need. In this article, the authors share their experiences in the development of an international interdisciplinary course that combined academic service learning with cultural immersion to promote the development of cultural competence and collaboration among students. By developing an interdisciplinary course that is of interest to a wide range of students, faculty can be successful in providing an opportunity for students with varied career paths to be better prepared to live and work in the world's global community.

AB  - At its essence, service-learning is a pedagogical practice that links meaningful community service with course objectives. Service-learning is a credit-bearing, educational experience in which students participate in organized service activities that meet identified community needs and reflect on the service activity in such a way as to gain further understanding of course content, a broader appreciation of the discipline, and an enhanced sense of civic responsibility. Communication is both the product of and the component of effective service-learning. This Proceedings from the Service-Learning strand at the National Communication Association's 2001 Summer Conference contains the following sections: Essential Facts (Overview); FAQ (7 Questions); and Guiding Principles and Recommendations. It contains a summary of presentations of the Service Learning Strand--"Developing Service Learning Assignments and Activities" (Michael Smith), "Developing Mutually Beneficial Relationships with Community Partners" (Kimberly M. Cuny), "Providing Opportunities for Structured Student Reflection" (Shelly Hinck), and "Assessing Project Outcomes for Students and the Community" (Shirlee Levin). (NKA)

AB  - Educators, researchers, and policy makers have advocated student involvement for some time as an essential aspect of meaningful learning. In the past twenty years engineering educators have implemented several means of better engaging their undergraduate students, including active and cooperative learning, learning communities, service learning, cooperative education, inquiry and problem-based learning, and team projects. This paper focuses on classroom-based pedagogies of engagement, particularly cooperative and problem-based learning. It includes a brief history, theoretical roots, research support, summary of practices, and suggestions for redesigning engineering classes and programs to include more student engagement. The paper also lays out the research ahead for advancing pedagogies aimed at more fully enhancing students' involvement in their learning.

The purpose of this paper is to assess an American Government course's ability to affect young people's perceptions of power in the political system and their role as citizens through the use of service-learning. The analysis includes qualitative data collected from students as well as from the community organization involved. Additionally, the results of a quasi-experiment conducted during one semester are presented. The results raise interesting questions not only about service-learning and its impact but also about how we should assess such programs. (Contains 3 notes.)

AB  - Current research (i.e., Lawrence-Brown, 2004; Searfoss, Readence, & Mallette, 2001) shows that the number of students with disabilities served within inclusive settings is increasing and general and special educators' roles are shifting. Research also shows that collaboration in teams provides ways for teachers to implement the necessary support for students with disabilities in general education classes (e.g., Weiss & Lloyd, 2003; Zigmond & Matta, 2004). Due to the current increase in the number of inclusive settings, a co-teaching service delivery model and a non co-teaching model were investigated to describe features that account for their perceived effectiveness in this qualitative practitioner research study. The purposes of this study were to identify the features of non co-teaching and co-teaching service delivery models and to examine the relationship between collaboration and reading instruction. This study sought to answer four research questions: (1) How does one team use a non co-teaching service delivery model, as compared to how another team uses co-teaching with special educators to implement reading instruction? (2) How do middle school content area teachers within teams implement reading instruction for students with disabilities? (3) How does a middle school content area teacher co-teach with a special educator? (4) What are the roles and responsibilities of special and general educators involved in co-teaching and non co-teaching teams to provide reading instruction in the content areas? Four seventh-grade content area teachers from a non co-teaching team and three content area teachers from a co-teaching team participated in the questionnaire, focus groups, classroom observations, and follow-up focus groups. Within the co-teaching team, two of the content area teachers (one general educator and one special educator) co-taught a class. A content area teacher from the non co-teaching team and the special educator from the co-teaching team also participated in individual interviews. Data analysis indicated that the way the teachers implemented collaboration and reading instruction was determined by perceptions of characteristics of collaboration, instructional modifications for students with disabilities, and educators' roles. The findings implicate that implementation techniques were based on individual teachers' perceptions about collaboration, which determined the instructional modifications they provided and defined their activities.

AB  - Faculty in post-secondary educational institutions is directly involved in designing, implementing and directing coursework components. The degree of the coursework’s impact on student learning can be attributed in part to these instructional gatekeepers. Extensive research indicates that service-learning tenets incorporated into curriculum have enhanced student learning experiences. Nevertheless, faculty inclusion of service-learning curricular components in higher education remains marginal. The purpose of this research was to study post-secondary faculty perceptions, motivations, and concerns from three local institutions of higher education regarding the phenomena that attracts or deters faculty from participating in service-learning pedagogy. This study concludes that more than one third of faculty who do not incorporate Service-learning has no knowledge of the pedagogy or do not know how to implement service-learning project effectively. Others are reluctant to implement service-learning because of the perception that it is not relevant to their coursework or that logistical issues are overwhelming. Those who do service-learning state that while concerns exist; the benefits to all constituents far surpass any pedagogical hindrances. A Spearman rho test for analysis of the demographics of gender, rank, and tenure was performed for variances in faculty perceptions. By employing a mixed method approach, the researcher attempted to pragmatically study the problem through multiple lenses. An electronic survey was conducted and distributed to 2710 post-secondary teaching faculty in Monroe County, NY. Open-ended survey questions, focus groups, and interviews were designed to gather data from phenomenological experiences. These multiple research methods were interactive and humanistic in nature.

AB  - When students with disabilities are isolated socially and physically, their self-confidence and engagement may be low. Encouraging leadership and service in students who are often overlooked for these roles enhances peer relations, engagement, and self-confidence. Principles and strategies for fostering leadership and service are described. (Contains 2 figures.)

AB  - This paper provides a foundation for understanding the conditions that facilitate transformative learning within education systems, with a view to encouraging and improving civic education for democracy. We explore definitions of transformative learning and examine the interconnections between processes of social change and transformative learning. Methods of teaching transformatively include service-learning, experiential education, and arts-based approaches. Finally, we give examples of ways in which transformative learning practices can be implemented into school curricula and/or degree programs.

AB  - A county agency and a social work research class partnered to conduct a state-mandated needs assessment of older gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered people (GLBT). A survey design with purposive sampling of GLBT people over 60 yielded 38 participants. Findings included that the Internet was a viable means to reach this population and student awareness increased. Areas of greatest unmet need were GLBT-oriented/friendly legal advice, social events, grief and loss counseling, social workers, and assisted living. Some participants perceived existing senior services as unfriendly or hostile to GLBT persons. Recommendations include continued use of service-learning research and expanded needs assessment efforts.

AB  - The traditional method for the delivery of didactic instruction and patient care in dental schools has come under fire from a number of sources over the past several years. The American Dental Education Association and others have outlined numerous issues impeding the swift progression of student learning through the dental curriculum. Declining state revenues allotted to dental education, the increasing shortage of dental faculty, and the management of student learning in an already overcrowded dental school curriculum have led to the investigation of strategies that address solutions to these and other shortcomings in the current milieu of dental education. To address these deficiencies, strategies for change have been suggested. This article describes the development, implementation, and assessment of a new dental school that addresses these and other challenges to the education of today's dental student, thus creating the Arizona Model. Following seven years of operation, outcomes analysis at the Arizona School of Dentistry & Oral Health has shown positive trends in controlling educational costs, a shift to a modular curriculum, increasing student clinical experiences, and, consistent with the mission of the school, producing dentists who are well prepared for dental public health service.

AB  - We describe six hallmarks of high quality service-learning and explain how these considerations guided the development of a Transitional Coaching Program (TCP) during the first three years of implementation. We have demonstrated that the TCP is acceptable, feasible, and sustainable. Improvements have been seen in the degree of impact on learning objectives, but statistically significant change has not yet been achieved. This project highlights the importance of looking beyond satisfaction and engaging in rigorous assessment of learning objectives and ongoing quality improvement through attention to best practices and evidence-based, continuous quality improvement.

AB  - This study reports the outcomes of undergraduate students completing a pilot Interdisciplinary Intensive Course Abroad (IICA) with a service learning component. The IICA model is comprised of a three-part sequence of study that includes a seven-week course on campus, followed by three weeks of study abroad, and a summative seven-week course back on campus. The additional summative component gives students the opportunity to bring together their newly acquired knowledge and skills, and to reflect on how to integrate these experiences in their future. The sequence integrates discipline-specific content studies with foreign language classes, and grounds them with a study abroad experience. A mixed-method design was used to measure students' development of language skills, understanding of multicultural education concepts, and intercultural skills. Primary data sources were pre/post-assessments, student field notes and reflections, and a post-course survey. Results indicated that students gained confidence in their Spanish skills and were likely to enroll in further Spanish courses, their ability to define multicultural education concepts increased, and service learning, homestays abroad, and their time in an indigenous reservation contributed to development of intercultural skills.

AB  - Early childhood caries (ECC) is the most communicable and preventable disease process in children younger than 5 years. Instead of moving in the direction epidemiologists would like to see, incidence rates of ECC are moving upward from the targeted 11%, as outlined by Healthy People 2010. The nursing profession can address risk factors, treatment options, and the need to increase awareness of the transmission of ECC along with prevention efforts. Efforts made by nursing students in a service-learning project to increase awareness of ECC are outlined. In addition, intervention strategies disseminated by advanced nurse practitioners and nurse educators to augment these efforts are summarized. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

They explain the nature and purpose of CSL, note gaps in the present curriculum which CSL aims to fill and highlight elements of CSL that are highly pertinent to Association of American Medical Colleges, Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education and Liaison Committee on Medical Education guidelines for undergraduate and graduate medical education. They also discuss barriers to the integration of CSL into the medical school curriculum and detail ways to overcome the logistic and fiscal challenges involved in making this highly effective and rewarding educational experience available to students of medicine.

AB  - Methods. The authors designed a survey instrument to examine the effect of involvement in a student-run free clinic project (SRFCP) on medical student self-reported attitudes toward the underserved and interest in primary care. From 2001-2010, first- and second-year medical students in an introductory service-learning elective course rated each of 15 statements on a seven-point Likert scale pre/post survey. Wilcoxon's signed rank test was performed on all matched pairs and an intent-to-treat analysis included unmatched pairs. Results. The response rate was 97.9%, with 914 of 934 students enrolled participating. Significant increases were seen in each of the 15 items in matched pre/post survey pairs, N=433 (47.4%), or with an intent-to-treat analysis, N=914 (p <= .002 for all). Conclusions. This study found that medical student involvement in a SRFCP improved student knowledge, skills, attitudes and self-efficacy with the underserved, interest in work with the underserved after graduation, and interest in primary care.

AB  - The field of counseling psychology continues to see a perpetual underutilization of mental health resources by many cultural groups, including international populations. Underutilization of services is due, in part, to psychologists’ deficiency in cultural and international competency. International education—an experiential learning technique that involves cultural contact—has been proposed as an alternative method for training students to work effectively cross-culturally. The current article examines the effects of service learning embedded in a study abroad diversity course in Singapore. The course was designed for graduate counseling psychology students as an experiential vehicle for developing cultural competency and awareness of social justice issues through direct contact with diverse groups. Qualitative data are reviewed, and implications for training, such as integration of cross-cultural and social justice issues in counseling training programs, are discussed.

AB  - This document describes a strategy for increasing student leadership and creativity skills through the creation of cartoons. Creating cartoons engages students in divergent thinking and cognitive processes, such as perception, recall, and mental processing. When students create cartoons focused on a particular topic, they are making connections to their already developed schema by representing the idea or concept in a unique way. The cartoons presented in this report were created by an education professor, graduate students, preservice teachers, and third grade students. Many of the cartoons focus on the seven leadership skills articulated in Steven Covey's "Leader in Me" program. These skills include be proactive; begin with the end in mind; put first things first; think win-win; seek first to understand, then to be understood; and synergize. The seventh leadership habit, which Covey calls sharpen the saw, promotes self-care and health. Supplementary leadership concepts are presented in additional cartoons with the following themes: active development of leadership skills, leaders are creative problem solvers, schools need to promote creativity and problem-solving, leaders should make good decisions, service learning promotes leadership, parents and communities can help, leaders need to be able to express themselves well, the vision of a leader, leaders care about others, persistence in the face of challenges, and confidence is a leadership trait. The Appendix contains 213 full-color leadership-themed cartoons, many of which employ humor, wordplay, and other creative strategies.

AB  - Historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) have a long-standing history of engaging the African-American community. In most instances, these institutions are located in predominantly African-American communities. This article intends to offer a discussion of a pedagogical approach used at an HBCU, located in a large mid-Atlantic city. The purpose of this macro-assignment was an effort designed to prepare BSW students for macro-practice with communities through participation in service-learning projects that involved community engagement with urban communities. Outcomes reflect that students have a vested interest in working with underserved communities, which exemplifies the School of Social Work’s mission; said mission is to fully prepare urban social work leaders who are committed to the alleviation of human suffering, social justice, and the improvement of the quality of life for diverse urban populations.

AB  - This qualitative study examines the School-to-Work system development process that Tacoma School District is attempting to design and implement with a federal Urban Rural Opportunities Grant (UROG) and a state School-to-Work grant. It takes a look at how students, teachers and principals K-12 view the concept of School-to-Work and what current best practices are available in their schools. Because School-to-Work systems must contain three core elements: school-based learning, work-based learning, and connecting activities, we started this study at the elementary level observing and interviewing students, teachers and principals. Elementary schools focus activities on career awareness, middle schools focus on career exploration and service learning, and high schools focus activities on career-development. I found in the observations and interviews that implementing a School-to-Work system was very difficult to accomplish without the support from the community and administration. However, as I described in the narrative of this study, those schools where School-to-Work activities were meaningful, rigorous and relevant, students, teachers and principals found the School-to-Work concept to very beneficial to all students.

AB  - We present a road map for providing course-embedded service-learning team projects as opportunities for undergraduates to practice as service leaders in Asia and beyond. Basic foundations are that projects address authentic problems or needs, partner organization representatives (PORs) indicate availability for ongoing consultation, students receive a complete orientation to service leadership, and project themes align with course curricula. Infrastructure and support involves a bridge of interinstitutional commitment and trust, initial site visits, in-class project consultations, helping teams to form and to elect conveners, providing service leadership reporting templates, and requiring project reports as graded coursework assignments. Potential road blocks include diversion from genuine service needs, POR/data unavailability, free riders, and failure to connect the project to course content. A bridge of student commitment leads to four other ingredients for successful project experiences: a sense of progress toward making a difference, constructive student-POR learning relationships, distributed leadership and initiative-taking, and applying course material to gain insight, guide actions, and frame recommendations. Besides attaining course-level goals, desired outcomes are that students and PORs perceive that the project has delivered good service, and that students can explain their practices and development as service leaders. We present three qualitative case illustrations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The transfer of learning outcomes of Master's programs for teachers is not self-evident. In this study, 18 teachers who recently graduated and their supervisors were interviewed on the transfer of leadership competences developed during their Master's program and on how the organizational transfer climate of the school supported or hindered this transfer. In schools with high levels of transfer, strategic partnerships between Master's-level teachers and formal leaders were observed, which facilitated a two-way process in which the application of new competences led to changes in the workplace. Therefore, the Master's program contributed to both professional development and school improvement. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fundraising traditionally involves selling. This paper explores the merits of selling technology services provided by a technology oriented student club to members of a campus community. This club activity puts into practice learning theories presented in the literature. Beyond fundraising, this activity yields many additional benefits to the students and the institution. Student benefits include an active learning experience, intellectual synthesis joining theory and applications, and practical work experience. Institution benefits include student retention, technology repair services for the campus community and increased learning by the students involved. This fundraising activity gives participating students real-world experience that merits inclusion on their resumes and practice applying recently learned classroom knowledge in a realistic business setting.

An experiential learning section involved students in survey research, participant observation at a religious service, the writing of an autobiography, learning sociological concepts through reading fiction, working with census data, role playing, class experiments, exposure to carefully selected films, guest lecturers, & weekend use of a SIMSOC simulation; two control sections relied on more traditional lecture/discussion methodologies. Two types of student evaluations showed no significant difference between the experiential class & the two control sections. Subsequent enrollment in departmental courses, however, was greater for students in the experiential section. 4 Tables, Appendix. HA.

AB  - This paper argues that the history of sociology is inherently a socially and politically engaged discipline, focused on analyzing and addressing social problems. Given the recent history of service learning and community-based learning as pedagogies that eminated from student and faculty and institutional engagements with social problems, the paper continues to discuss how service learning and the study of social problems are a perfect fit and service or community-based learning can be used as an efective pedagogy for encouraging students to embrace both the anaytical and the practical importance of a sociological imagination.

AB  - Social workers and attorneys both interact with persons from diverse backgrounds every day, yet although interpersonal skills are an essential focus of social work education, these skills are not addressed in legal education. Interdisciplinary courses in which social workers and lawyers learn interpersonal skills together and have an opportunity to practice them through service learning opportunities are a way to remedy a gap in legal education. The authors describe a project recently piloted at a large midwestern university in which law and graduate social work students participated in an interdisciplinary course with a service learning component requiring students to work together on cases. As one component of the clinic’s assessment, all students were pre- and posttested via an interpersonal skills survey. The law students showed statistically significant improvement in interpersonal skills at the end of the course. The results indicate a need for increased support for interdisciplinary education, specifically partnerships between the professions of law and social work.

AB  - This study examines participation in community service among a sample of 16,232 sophomores in 938 U.S. public, Catholic, and private independent high schools in 1990. Using data from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88), we investigate whether disparities in participation exist and to what extent these disparities reflect social, psychological, and educational differences among the students. The analysis is grounded in a social-psychological model focused on explaining participation among adolescents. We employ a multilevel analytic technique, the Hierarchical Generalized Linear Model (HGLM). According to our estimates, early socialization, track placement, personal and peer values, patterns in the use of discretionary time, and attending a private school strongly influence participation, while psychological attributes are less salient.

AB  - Issue: Student-run clinics are inter-professional community service-learning initiatives where students plan and deliver clinical and health services, with the assistance of licensed healthcare professionals. Student-run clinics provide opportunities for inter-professional education (IPE) and community service learning (CSL), thereby increasing social accountability. Cytology students participated in a women's health clinic, a new service to the UAMS 12th Street Health and Wellness Center where patients were offered free pelvic exams, pap tests, breast exams, urinalysis, and low complexity infectious disease testing. Method: A qualitative study was designed to evaluate student perceptions of community service learning opportunities utilizing inter-professional teams and social accountability. Participants were students in the cytotechnology professional program. Pre and post surveys were completed for data collection. Outcomes: Student's perceptions indicated an increase in analytical skills through the inter-professional teams. Additional findings also include that the CSL and IPE learning environments encouraged socially accountable practice. Conclusion: Collaborative practice settings such as student-run clinics have been identified as a key component for providing effective, socially accountable, patient-centered care. Community service learning combined with inter-professional education serves as a valuable tool and creative approach in the delivery of education that aims to foster socially accountable practice in the health professions.

AB  - One hundred teacher candidates enrolled in a mandatory course on service learning were surveyed pre- and post-course to determine their civic attitudes and willingness to take the service learning course. Quantitative analysis indicated significant growth in civic attitudes in all students, and this growth was not differentially affected by the students' willingness to take the course. Qualitative data were analyzed to determine the underpinnings for students' perceptions, and recommendations about the wisdom of making such courses mandatory in teacher preparation programs are provided.

AB  - This qualitative study examined the experiences and perceptions of five Connecticut school districts' administrators and teachers who participated in service-learning initiatives under the authority of a Learn and Serve America K-12 School-Based Programs grant for 2009 to 2012. The theoretical framework coupled with the research questions served to reveal the (a) structural, pedagogical, and curricular components within service-learning programs that contribute to civic responsibility and academic learning among students, (b) descriptions of the implementation experiences that teachers and administrators have had within their school districts, and (c) the ways by which the teachers and administrators have promoted service-learning initiatives as pedagogy in a 21st century program design. The value found as a result of the study serves to identify, for school leaders, the strengths, challenges, and opportunities associated with the structure, implementation, and institutionalization of service-learning as pedagogy within the school districts.

AB  - This volume illuminates the most pressing challenges faced by urban schools, teachers, teacher candidates, and teacher training programs and offers a range of insights and possibilities for urban teacher education and teaching. Covering issues spanning the broadly theoretical to the urgently practical, it goes beyond the traditional discourses in teacher education to focus on diversity, social justice, democratic schooling, and community building. What emerges is an emphatic message of hope for those committed to the ongoing project of improving urban teacher education and working in urban settings. Contributors from Canada, the United States, and the Caribbean bring rich and divergent knowledges, perspectives, and cultural experiences to their discussion of the three central themes around which the book is organized: (1) the conceptual framing of key issues in urban schooling; (2) pre-service teacher preparation for urban transformation; and (3) culturally relevant pedagogy and advocacy in urban settings. This book is intended for all students, practitioners, and researchers involved in urban education. It is appropriate as a text for student teaching and field experience seminars, and for courses dealing with social issues, educational policy, curriculum development, and multicultural teacher education. Following a foreword (P. C. Murrell, Jr.), a preface (R. P. Solomon), and an introduction (D. N. R. Sekayi), the book divides into the following three parts and 13 chapters. Part I, Theoretical and Conceptual Framing of Urban Schooling, contains an introduction and the following chapters: (1) Using Representation to Conceptualize a Social Justice Approach to Urban Teacher Preparation (S. James-Wilson); (2) Developing Educational Collectives and Networks: Moving Beyond the Boundaries of "Community" in Urban Education (B. J. Daniel); and (3) Gender, Power, and Accountability in Urban Teacher Education: Tensions of Women Working with Women (L. Weiner). Part II, Pre-Service Teacher Preparation for Urban Transformation, offers an introduction to the section and the next chapters in the book: (4) Pre-Service Teachers as Border-Crossers: Linking Urban Schools and Communities through Service Learning (R. P. Solomon, R. K. Manoukian, and J. Clarke); (5) Moving Beyond Institutional Boundaries in Inner-City Teacher Education (H. Smaller); (6) Thinking Outside the Box: Fostering Racial & Ethnic Discourses in Urban Teacher Education (P. A. Young); (7) Critical Pedagogy and Authoritarian Culture: Challenges of Jamaican Migrant Teachers in American Urban Schools (C. H. Gentles); and (8) Confronting Post-Colonial Legacies through Pre-Service Teacher Education: The Case of Jamaica (H. Evans and J. Tucker). Part III, Culturally Relevant Pedagogy and Advocacy in Urban Settings, provides an introduction and concludes the book with the remaining chapters: (9) Student Resistance to Culturally Irrelevant Curriculum and Pedagogy: The Role of Critical Consciousness (D. N. R. Sekayi); (10) Integrating Computer-Facilitated Learning in Urban Schools: The Challenges to a Pre-Service Teacher (R. Minott-Bent); (11) The Literary Voices of Urban Adolescents: Multi-Factor Influences on Textual Interpretations (W. Brooks); (12) The Politics of Advocacy, Strategies for Change: Diversity and Social Justice Pedagogy in Urban Schools (R. P. Solomon, A. M. A. Allen, and A. Campbell); and (13) The Confluence of Teacher Education and Inner-City Activism: A Reciprocal Possibility (C. Reid).

WIN -- WIN seeks to increase elementary school children's awareness of the natural world, foster appreciation of wildlife, & conserve natural resources. Co-managed & funded by the Denver Zoo, the Colorado Division of Wildlife, & the Great Outdoors Colorado Trust Fund, WIN -- WIN provides in-class lessons, field site visits to areas within the city & in the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains, a family night at each participating school, & community leadership project service-learning activities. It was decided that a participatory approach to evaluation would be better able to consider the needs & concerns of a program with so many participants & stakeholders. Thus, a panel of 21 representatives selected from the various stakeholder groups developed the evaluation plan, deciding on the specif.

AB  - Part of a series on safe, drug-free, and effective schools, this monograph discusses developing school and community partnerships to assist students with behavior problems. It begins by offering a general description of the student with challenging behaviors and the determination of the students placement in the least restrictive environment. Levels of intervention are reviewed. The monograph then highlights several effective school-community partnerships designed to meet the many challenging and complex needs of students with behavior problems and their families. These include Aggression Replacement Training and the Buddy System; family/home community partnerships, including family groups and resource centers; and partnerships with the greater community, including the Discover 15 Space Shuttle Project, vocational programs, and service project days. The following chapter discusses two partnership program models: service learning and project based learning. The final chapters discuss designing curricula to meet community expectations and three essential components of all good school-community partnerships: high-quality leadership and dedicated personnel, a well-developed purpose and plan for the program, strong community partnerships, and a strong sense that positive and enduring changes can occur in the students served by the program.

AB  - This paper is about memory, the elusive process of remembering and of an encounter between a researcher and a participant who after five years reunited to remember. The object under study is a high school social justice curriculum with a central focus on the development of social action projects. Grounded in Pitt and Britzman's work on difficult knowledge, this paper asks: What do 10th grade students who spent four years attending a school committed to the Freirian principles of political engagement remember about their high school experience? Past and recent interviews are woven together to surface three emergent lines of thinking: the failure to secure knowledge as unitary and in agreement; education as deferred in time; and research as relational dilemmas and unconscious desire. The aim is to complicate teaching and learning by illuminating its difficulties and unseating our reliance on evidentiary accountability, production and outcome. Throughout, the positionality of the researcher is discussed, particularly as unconscious desire for social justice, as lovely knowledge, becomes transferred through one participant, Sadie.

AB  - This discussion paper examines the lack of clarity surrounding the term service learning in the library and information science (LIS) literature, which frequently conflates service learning with other types of experiential learning. We suggest that the lack of distinction between service learning and other types of experiential learning confuses the practice of service-learning courses in LIS education. We attempt to mitigate this confusion by clarifying the term service learning. We believe that a clear understanding of service learning's unique purposes and characteristics can help LIS educators maximize the benefits of service-learning courses and improve students' educational experiences.

AB  - There is a recent rise in demand for international rotations in medical school, during which U.S. schools send medical students to another country for an immersive educational experience, but there is little research surrounding the characteristics, ethics, and institutional support for these types of rotations. This study examines the types of international rotations that exist in medical education in the United States and its territories as key avenues for international service-learning (ISL) by investigating the key characteristics of international rotations and the structural and programmatic features necessary to support such rotations; the barriers and facilitators to the advancement of ISL from the perspectives of stakeholders within medical education who design and implement international rotations (i.e., faculty, staff, administrators); broader contextual factors that might influence a medical school’s decision to include ISL in its medical program; and whether relationships exist between components within a medical school or institutional environment and the inclusion of international service-learning components performed during international rotations.This study utilizes a mixed methods design with an exploratory approach. Quantitative data were collected through a survey that was sent to all 185 MD- and DO-granting medical schools in the United States and its territories that had full accreditation status as of July 2018, which had a response rate of 31%. Qualitative data were then collected through 15 interviews with international rotation coordinators that had also responded to the survey. Inductive and interpretive methods were used to analyze data.Key findings from this study provide highly contextualized guidance to scholars and practitioners interested in the transformative potential of service-learning, or any other reform effort in medical education, and the organizational components necessary to sustain such efforts. Results in this study demonstrate the variety of ways in which international rotations are designed and implemented across medical schools. Design aspects of international rotations depend greatly on safety considerations, components required for academic credit, student considerations such as level of experience, and the agency or motivation of the international rotation coordinator to include certain components as part of international rotations, such as pre-departure orientation or post-travel debrief and reflection. Formal structures and processes are shown to help support international rotations, integrate international rotations more formally into medical school curricula, and strengthen partnerships with community host sites. Issues of funding and timing a student could perform an international rotation during the four-year program were most influential to student participation as well as to design decisions regarding planning and implementation of international rotations.Barriers to planning and implementing international rotations include cost and safety challenges as well as challenges to meet student expectations during the design of international rotations. Other barriers included challenges to integrating international rotations into broader medical school curricula, such as finding faculty or school leaders to support international rotations. Elements that helped facilitate international rotations included high student interest, convenient opportunities to develop community partnerships, and international rotation coordinators’ personal experiences and motivation, such as passion or personal mission to inspire students or promote health equity. Broader contextual and environmental aspects that could drive or deter a medical school’s participation in international rotations included the various perceived benefits and disadvantages associated with international rotations and additional contextual factors within and surrounding medical schools held great influence in a medical school’s decision to engage in international rotations. Factors that drove medical schools to participate in international rotations included student demand, addressing changing workforce demands, and broader environmental drivers, while factors that deterred a medical school’s participation were related to a lack of structures or processes in place or the length of time a medical school had been open. Aspects within a medical program were found to influence the inclusion of international service-learning components in international rotations, such as a medical school’s mission, length of time international rotations had been offered at a medical program, presence of sites in lower-income countries, and whether international rotation coordinators held joint appointments or affiliations with other offices.

AB  - This mixed-methods experimental study examined the effect of service learning in a distance education technical writing course. Quantitative analysis of data found evidence for a positive relationship between participation in service learning and technical writing learning outcomes. Additionally, qualitative analysis suggests that service learning in online technical writing courses helps students to make connections to the "real world," encourages students to connect with their audience(s) and develop a sense of purpose for writing tasks, connects students to future employment, and develops deep learning with course materials. It is hypothesized that these factors support the development of learning outcomes in distance education students.

AB  - High schools throughout the country posit leadership as one of the characteristics they develop while students are with them. All too often though, this leadership development is limited to those in title positions of leadership or is only accomplished through informal training mechanisms. The challenge for educators is to develop leadership that can critically address community problems, a challenge that is made more difficult in a broader social environment that is becoming politically, economically, and racially more polarized. This action research study investigated how high school students understand transformative leadership as one way to address this problem. Using a hermeneutic orientation, this qualitative study investigated high school students’ (N = 8) understanding of transformative leadership. Situated within a leadership class open to any 11th or 12th grader, participants engaged with a community-based, service-learning project as a method to enact their leadership in a meaningful way. The use of Catholic Social Teaching as a way to frame the service-learning project allowed for a direct connection with the school’s Catholic identity and mission. Data sources included reflection journals, interviews, focus groups, and a researcher observation journal. Findings from the study suggest that high school students understand and enact transformative leadership through participation in a service-learning project. Participants understood transformative leadership to different extents, indicating that transformative leadership develops in different stages. These results, along with implications for future research, are discussed.

AB  - This study represents a contribution to the process of clarifying the philosophical and theoretical foundations of community service learning. The three main concepts of community, service, and learning were explored in order to help clarify their meaning. This examination focused on the philosophical work of John Dewey because Dewey's ideas are widely identified in the community service learning literature as a foundation for the approach. In order to provide further clarification of Dewey's ideas on the three concepts and test their meanings in practice, a historical case study was undertaken of the work of Elsie Ripley Clapp in two rural school systems during the 1920's and 1930's. Dewey's ideas on community, service, and learning emphasize the interrelated nature of the concepts and highlight the importance of communication, relationships, ethics, and guided experience, among other considerations. In particular, Dewey's concept of cooperative social inquiry seems to provide a useful and structured way of thinking about community service learning. The study of Clapp's work provided insights into the practical implications of Dewey's concepts, and revealed areas of convergence and divergence with Dewey's ideas as Clapp applied them in the real-world situations she faced. The results of the study were used to develop new definitions of the concepts of community, service, and learning as they relate to the overall approach of community service learning. Some implications of these new ways of thinking about community, service, and learning for present-day community service learning practice are described. The implications of the cooperative social inquiry model are discussed as well.

AB  - International Journal of Paediatric Dentistry 2012; 22: 451458 Background. Dental sealants are an effective treatment for the prevention and management of caries. Objective. To determine the retention of sealants placed in a rural setting in Mexico as part of an international service-learning (ISL) programme and to determine associations between dental sealants retention and caries diagnosis at the time of sealant placement. Methods. Children aged 615 were examined for dental caries, received sealants by dental students as part of an ISL programme, and were re-examined 4, 2, or 1 years after placement to assess sealant survival. Sealants were placed on permanent sound surfaces and enamel caries lesions {[}International Caries Assessment and Detection System (ICDAS) criteria]. Sealant survival was explored using CochranMantelHaenszel tests and multivariate prediction models. Results. 219 (46%) of 478 (mean age = 10.53 SD = 5.11) children who had received sealants returned for a recall examination (mean age = 10.89 SD = 3.11). After 14 years, 96.4% to 60.6% of the sealants placed on sound teeth had survived, and for sealants placed on surfaces with enamel caries lesions (ICDAS 13), 94.2% to 55.6% had survived. Differences were not statistically significant. Conclusions. Sealants had survival rates comparable to those previously reported in the literature. Sealants placed on sound and enamel caries lesions had similar survival rates.

AB  - The article presents abstracts on communication. Reforms in engineering education has caused a shift from the traditional stand-alone course in technical communication for engineering students toward communication training integrated in courses and design projects that allows students to develop four layers of competence. Assessment of communication competence in these formats is constrained by their characteristics with regard to student motivation, individual and group work and situated learning. This article offers a retrospective case study of a service learning project in a technical writing class. Embrace of professionalism via service learning raises as many issues as the resistance to professionalism that is more commonly documented. The study focuses on the relationship between information pooling and interactions as well as on the role of technology in group process.

AB  - This newsletter focuses on the importance of reading and writing skills in all educational and career pathways. It includes a variety of strategies for integrating reading and writing skills across the curriculum--in academic, career/technical and fine arts courses--in ways that improve student achievement in reading and writing and in the content area. This issue asserts that if students cannot read and write for learning, they will struggle with--and potentially fail--the courses needed to graduate from high school and enter postsecondary education and careers. Many schools in the "High Schools That Work" ("HSTW") network have implemented wall-to-wall literacy programs to strengthen reading and writing for learning in every academic and career/technical (CT) classroom. Other schools have designed programs to target the reading and/or writing weaknesses of particular groups of students. These schools know that literacy for learning is every teacher's responsibility in preparing students for success in a knowledge-based economy. Articles in this issue include: (1) Literacy Initiative Pays Off in Higher Achievement; (2) Focusing on Fun in a Schoolwide Literacy Campaign; (3) Training Helps Career/Technical Instructors Promote Literacy; (4) Urban School Takes Action to Promote Literacy; (5) All Teachers Take Responsibility for Increasing Literacy; (6) International Project Builds Literacy at Suburban School; (7) Teachers Increase Reading and Writing in All Classrooms; (8) Computer Students Gain Confidence through Inspirational Reading; (9) Focused Writing: Moving Beyond Spell Checker; (10) Students Select Favorite Formats for Reports; (11) Writing Program Raises Achievement on Graduation Test; (12) Portfolios Encourage Students to Upgrade Skills and Activities; (13) Preparing Teachers to Build Students' Reading, Writing and Learning Skills; and (14) School Increases Reading Skills for Job Success. [This newsletter of "best practices" in implementing the "High Schools That Work" ("HSTW"), "Making Middle Grades Work" ("MMGW") and "Technology Centers That Work" ("TCTW") school improvement models is based on presentations at the 22nd Annual "HSTW" Staff Development Conference in Nashville, Tennessee, in July 2008.]

AB  - A significant theme in the literature on rural education is the extreme interdependence between rural schools and rural communities. Belief in this interdependence has led to a number of initiatives focused on strengthening both student learning and the local community's economic and social resources. Most of these initiatives involve some degree of formal or informal collaboration between schools and community residents. The Southwest Educational Development Laboratory (SEDL) has developed a process for supporting collaborative work between schools and communities, the Collaborative Action Team process, and is exploring ways in which this process can be applied to rural communities. This literature review informs SEDL's work with rural communities regarding collaborative processes and provides an overview for other educators interested in the topic. The review describes the links between rural locales and rural schools; major issues facing both rural communities and schools; strategies that have been tried to address these issues, with particular attention to integrated school improvement-community development approaches; and the role of collaboration in such integrated approaches, highlighting characteristics and concerns particular to rural settings that should be addressed by a collaborative process such as SEDL's.

AB  - This is the first of a series of issue papers that discuss ways in which rural communities and schools can work together to guarantee their students the best education possible. By working together, rural schools and communities can not only improve education, but revitalize the entire community. The Southwest Educational Development Laboratory is helping to establish partnerships in its region through the Rural Development Collaborative Action Team project (RD-CAT) which links school and community development using two strategies. These strategies include building local capacity to work in school and community teams through the CAT process and working with these local teams to plan and carry out activities such as service learning and entrepreneurial training that link school instructional programs and community development projects. CAT's three-dimensional approach employs team building, team planning, and momentum generation. Service learning and entrepreneurial activities teach students valuable skills, connect students to their community, and provide useful services to the community. The RD-CAT in Balmorhea, Texas, illustrates what can happen when the school and community join forces. Sixteen programs have been planned or started, including a successful school-based rural health clinic and a school-based community weather station used for science classes. Accomplishments of other school-community programs in Alabama, Idaho, Minnesota, Nebraska, and North Carolina are briefly described. (CDS)

AB  - In this article, we--a former high school language arts instructor and former K-3 gifted resource teacher--reflect on critical experiences with students that, although unique in scope, are bound together through a common concern: How can teachers provide meaningful writing experiences for talented young writers? We advocate for the use of high-end learning theory in developing the talent of young writers, especially as related to the provision of authentic, real-world writing experiences.

The gap year has been in practice in Europe but is gaining popularity in the U.S. partly due to the suggestion of parents. The article presents statistics from the Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study by the U.S. Department of Education.

AB  - The Girls' Resiliency Program is a youth empowerment program for girls in a rural, economically depressed area of West Virginia. Girls develop leadership skills by participating in board meetings, discussion groups, recreational events, song writing and poetry workshops, action research, and school and community service projects. Evaluation research conducted during summer and fall 2000 focused on girls' experiences with the action research summer projects and personal relations girls experienced in the program. Two staff members were participant observers in the application process, training sessions, working meetings of the girls' action research teams, and a meeting of the applied communications class, and they interviewed the nine girls who participated in the summer research project. Findings indicate that the girls learned the importance of persistence, hard work, and responsibility and the joy of work that is personally rewarding. They also learned a lot about the problems they studied and how that knowledge could be helpful to them individually and to the broader community. The adults learned that a major factor in program success was the close, respectful personal relationships among the participating girls and women. Forming such relationships between women and girls was not always easy. It required a delicate balance between coaching that pushes too hard, and coaching that coddles too much, demanding too little of individuals who learn to perform to lower expectations. (TD)

AB  - Students need real-world experience. Industry needs graduating students entering the workforce to be skilled in relevant subject matter, critical thinking, and communication skills. Community-based nonprofit organizations, as well as small businesses, need help in building organizational capacity. Instructors also benefit from periodic observation of organizational work in the instructor's area of teaching. A service-learning course that is focused on capacity building is a means to reach all of these goals. This article presents a roadmap for teaching a service-learning course in information security risk assessment. Students work in teams on a term-long project conducting an on-site risk assessment, making security recommendations, and producing and presenting a final security risk report to an organization's management. Teaching tips are offered on course planning, launch, materials, and execution.

AB  - This empirical research project investigated the nature of service-learning outcomes in two studies. Service-learning can be defined as the 'service to the community and academic learning' (Eyler & Giles, 1999). Given the lack of empirical information on the topic, this study explored the relationship between various factors in a service-learning experience and service-learning outcomes. The first study analyzed outcomes of Education students (n = 123) in a total of twelve sections of a service-learning class (EDTE 400). The goal of this evaluation study was to determine if social and emotional learning (SEL) outcomes occurred in students participating in a service-learning project. The second study used an intervention in a comparative research design (additional reflective or didactic activity) with Psychology students (n = 23) participating in an after school program for emotionally and academically challenged middle school students. The goal of this small pilot intervention study was to investigate the influence of reflection on student outcomes. For both studies, a third hypothesis was also tested to see whether more reflective students had greater outcome gains than less reflective students. Results from the studies indicate that students do seem to gain SEL outcomes after participating in a service-learning experience. Different amounts of reflection, when encouraged by different intervention activities, did not seem to create differential service-learning growth outcomes. However, additional possible connections between reflection and outcomes emerged that warrant future study. Findings suggest that different types of reflection might be linked to different service-learning experiences and outcomes. These results helped to detail the type of relationship that exists between reflection occurring during a service-learning experience and service-learning outcomes.

AB  - This report details findings from visits to 15 small schools associated with Human Scale Education. These schools are all different, reflecting the priorities of their founders. But there are features common to all of them--parental involvement, democratic processes, environmentally sustainable values, spiritual values, links with the local community, an emphasis in co-operation rather than competition, and mixed age learning. The characteristic that links them all is smallness, and it is their small size that makes possible the close relationships fundamental to good learning. By good learning, the schools mean learning in a holistic sense, encompassing the development of the creative, emotional, physical, moral, and intellectual potential of each person. Contact information, grade levels and number of students taught, and a brief history are given for each school. Educational philosophy, school-community relationships, educational practices, and grading systems are described, as well as the extent to which the national curriculum and SATs are used. Environmental education and activities, service learning, experiential activities, and exposure to the world of work are extensive. The governing structure of the school, the extent of student participation in decision making, and financing arrangements are described. Advantages of being small and specific problems encountered are also discussed. (TD)

AB  - The study reported uses a qualitative design to investigate the benefits of service-learning through the eyes of the preservice teachers who participated in it. The study focuses on how preservice teachers compare and contrast teaching and learning in the formal classroom during student teaching and teaching and learning in service-learning. Based on the results of the analysis procedures, the authors present four differences between the regular classroom and the service-learning environment that preservice teachers consistently mentioned as having affected their professional development. These are: (1) working with a group of students from different grade levels; (2) having a low teacher-student ratio; (3) teaching in an after-school program; and (4) working with a team of teachers. In conclusion, this study supports the view that service-learning can provide preservice teachers a rich context to build and extend their knowledge of teaching. The voices within the reflections of preservice teachers engaged in service-learning provide insights into how a service-learning experience impacted their knowledge about teaching and student learning and development.

Through ethnographic interviews, the perspectives of school students and their teacher about the social value of service-learning were qualitatively analysed. This case study of service-learning as a pedagogy of engagement represents education through technologies of citizenship - that is, discourses and programs of service-learning that promote participatory education. Students, the future actors of society, are acquiring important civic qualities not simply through theoretical teaching within the confines of the classroom but also, and more importantly, through experiential programs of immersion that involve them in a direct and personal way with their communities.

AB  - The public education system in America has long been criticized for its inability to prepare students for success as adults. While some engage in a narrative of blame, others ask what can be done to solve this problem. This dissertation examines a narrative crisis in the 21st century classroom through the lens of Neil Postman, a 20th century media ecologist whose fears about television may finally be realized with the advent of the personal digital device and its impact on the educational sphere. First the past narratives that guided the American school system will be traced from colonial America through present day. Then Postman’s work will be examined in its historical moment to provide context from which current educational narratives and initiatives will then be examined. Current educational trends, including technology and STEM based learning, career-focused learning, personalized learning, and using schools as public service facilities will be examined through his lens. Finally, using Postman’s philosophies as a guide, service learning, the Waldorf School model, and reconnection to a humanities narrative that includes the media ecology studies Postman called for in the 1980s will be examined as a way to balance the existing narratives guiding learning in American public schools.

AB  - Service learning allows students to learn more about their classroom instruction through involvement with their local community. It is both a service given to the community, as well as a practical way for students to reflect on what they have been studying in class. The author of this article explains a service learning project which will be very amendable to, and meaningful for, middle and high school classes in the social science areas. It focuses on an ongoing project involving the author's own classes in sociology, and includes information on how this project can be duplicated, with a focus on several potential and fruitful topics that students can explore.

In 1993, the third Circuit Court of Appeals quashed a lawsuit claiming a school's mandatory public-service requirement violated the 1st and 13th amendments. The most recent case was pursued against a New York district whose modest public-service requirement supposedly forced students into involuntary servitude. The court found no violations of constitutional rights. (MLH)

AB  - This brief is the second in the Youth Helping America Series, a series of reports based on data from the Youth Volunteering and Civic Engagement Survey, a national survey of 3,178 American youth between the ages of 12 and 18 that was conducted by the Corporation for National and Community Service in 2005 in collaboration with the U.S. Census Bureau and the nonprofit coalition Independent Sector. The survey collected information on teen volunteering habits, experiences with school-based service-learning, and other forms of civic engagement. While the first brief in the Youth Helping America Series focused on youth volunteering and social institutions, this brief focuses on participation in school-based service--learning opportunities made available or required by schools--among middle school and high school aged youth. Particular attention is paid to the extent to which youth participate in service-learning courses, which integrate school-based service opportunities into the academic curriculum such as those programs supported by Learn and Serve America. By approaching school-based service from the perspectives of youth, it is possible to identify: (1) who among youth participate in school-based service; (2) their perceptions of what they accomplished in the experience; and (3) the relationship between this school-based service and their attitudes and behaviors toward other forms of civic engagement. According to the survey, 38 percent of youth--or an estimated 10.6 million students nationwide--report current or past participation in community service as part of a school activity or requirement. Of these students, 74 percent, or approximately 7.8 million, are either currently enrolled or were enrolled within the previous year in a course that contains a service component, while 26 percent participated in such a course at some time in the past. High school students are more likely than middle school students to have participated in at least one school-based service experience. Of all school-based service experiences, more than three-quarters (77 percent) take place as part of a course that contains one or more of the generally accepted elements of high-quality service-learning. These elements include: (1) Planning the service activity (36 percent of all courses); (2) Participating in regular service for a semester or longer (36 percent of all courses); and (3) Writing or reflecting on the service experience in class (51 percent of all courses). The results of this analysis indicate that those youth who do participate in school-based service also are more highly engaged. (Contains 17 charts and 3 figures.)

AB  - Background. A service-learning (SL) elective offered to final-year pharmacy students was introduced in 2007. The elective demonstrated a holistic approach to creating opportunities for future pharmacists to understand the current needs and future challenges of the burden of disease in developing countries such as South Africa and to foresee their key roles in health promotion. Methods. The 2007 Sasol National Festival of Science and Technology (SciFest) was chosen as the ideal platform to implement this elective. Evaluation of the elective was carried out in association with the Academic Development Centre using a web-based software tool known as the ADC evaluation assistant (ADCEA). The ADCEA consisted of a 'question bank' from which the course facilitators selected nine ranked closed questions as well as two open-ended questions. Results. SciFest participation, in the course of the service-learning elective, was acknowledged by students to have prepared them as responsible citizens to undertake health promotion in the public sector healthcare system. Conclusion. Students' experiences of the learning opportunities provided in the SciFest elective highlight the strengths of this SL programme. The SL elective provided a unique and relevant opportunity to address the health promotion needs of the South African community and potentially enhance human capacity to deliver health promotion in South Africa.

AB  - Objectives To investigate the effects of a service-learning based health promotion elective on knowledge of HIV & AIDS and ways to prevent them. Method A computer-based quiz, an information poster, an interactive board game and a take-home information leaflet on HIV/AIDS were developed by final year pharmacy students under supervision, as part of an exhibit during the 2009 National Festival of Science and Technology (SciFest) held in Grahamstown, South Africa. Predominantly school learners took part in the quiz and other educational activities. Results The majority (53.1%) of the 179 junior quiz participants were male learners and the majority (63.6%) of the 253 senior quiz participants were female learners. Results of the pre-intervention scores demonstrate fair knowledge of HIV/AIDS with 64.5% and 71.3% for the junior and senior school participants, respectively. Educational interventions resulted in improvement in the number of correct answers to some of the questions. The results showed significant gender differences for the pre- and post-intervention mean percentage scores among the junior quiz participants and only in the pre-intervention scores of the senior quiz participants. Conclusion The health promotion elective was successful in raising awareness of HIV/AIDS but continuous, concerted health promotion activities and advocacy by all health care professionals is needed to address the prevention of HIV/AIDS.

AB  - A marked increase in the chronic non-communicable diseases such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus in the South African population is in concert with global trends. A health promotion activity carried out by pharmacy students for school learners during the Sasol National Festival of Science and Technology (SciFest) in South Africa was used as a service-learning opportunity. Pilot tested quizzes on hypertension and diabetes were used to determine the level of knowledge of attendees before and after taking the computer based quiz. Posters, information leaflets and interactive models on these two conditions were also used to reach out to the larger population. Of the 203 participants for the hypertension quiz, 169 completed both the pre- and post-intervention quizzes. Similarly, 86 of the 104 participants for the diabetes quiz, completed both the pre- and post-intervention quizzes. The results show that the post-intervention quiz resulted in a significant increase in the scores from 78.2 to 85.6 % in the case of Hypertension while a marginal increase from 94.2 to 95.5 % was obtained in the case of diabetes. The knowledge of the SciFest attendees with regard to both conditions is above average and improved further after the educational intervention. Health promotion activities which include interactive educational methods and culturally appropriate materials carried out by pharmacy students during service-learning courses are important for improving the awareness on the prevention of these chronic health conditions. Heath promotion service-learning courses can assist in addressing the health care gaps which arise because of a lack of co-ordinated efforts between NGO's and local Government to address the prevention and management of non-communicable diseases such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus.

AB  - In this article the author described a graduate cognition that followed a service-learning format. The author integrated research and service into the course by having students test 9 older (72-96 yrs of age) and 9 younger (20-32 yrs of age) adults on 6 within-subject experiments. This article describes the course and experiments as well as discusses logistics in teaching such a course. Service outcomes were an assessment kit constructed for the staff of the assisted living community partner and, for the older volunteers, a memory book of their autobiographical memories with photos of themselves and the students. Both students and older residents reported benefits from participation. The authors discuss evaluations using this format as opposed to other formats.

AB  - Service-learning is a curriculum-based form of community service that integrates classroom instruction and reflection with hands-on service experiences. While the number of schools organizing service-learning activities has not yet surpassed the large percentage of K-12 institutions that simply offer or organize community service, the pedagogy has experienced a surge in popularity over the past decade and is becoming an increasingly prevalent practice in public school classrooms. As of February 2004, over 10 percent of all K-12 public school students and 28 percent of all K-12 public institutions are involved in some type of service-learning, affecting approximately 4.7 million K-12 students in 23,000 public schools. This fact sheet offers a glimpse at the state of service-learning in public education today. (Contains 10 endnotes.)

AB  - This content analysis explored how Civics and Government textbooks and the Virginia Standards of Learning for Civics and Government courses reflect citizenship outcomes, specifically deconstructing the unique needs of marginalized students. The coding frame was constructed by using themes and categories from previous literature, specifically highlighting Kahne and Westheimer's (2003) three Cs (Commitment, Connection, Capacity) framework. The findings support previous literature, which suggest that civics textbooks and state standards emphasize individual rights and a philosophy of liberalism, but deemphasize civic ideals of collectivism and a classical republicanism philosophy based on deliberation and community action. Furthermore, the findings illuminate the lack of content that provides authentic examples for marginalized students in the narrative of American democracy.

AB  - The article analyzes the standards and ideological and material impact of community-based service learning programs for minority language students. The author outlines the five content standards of programs including "Communication," "Cultures," and "Communities." The author argues that the Communities standard cannot be met solely within the classroom, as it requires evidence of so-called real world language practice, creating the need for service learning programs. It is also noted that service learning programs for minority language communities are linked to the administrative goal of meeting national standards for language skills. The author also explores the Medical Spanish for Heritage Learners project at the University of Texas-Pan American.

AB  - Cultural competence is not limited to ethnicity, religion, or race but is inclusive of vulnerable groups, such as the homeless. The complex health and social issues related to homelessness requires educational instruction that supports students' ability to address and care for the multidimensional elements that surround this group. Exposure to homeless populations provides nursing students with increased awareness of the issues related to health disparities, while promoting introspective reflection on one's values and beliefs. To increase student exposure to working with homeless clients, a service-learning project using a critical social theory (CST) lens was offered at a homeless center. The students' response that clients were ``just like{''} them, coupled with ambiguity regarding the complex social-economic-political issues surrounding the homeless, may indicate a need for further education regarding cultural understanding, sensitivity, and vulnerability. This project demonstrates the need for learning experiences that support advocacy and social responsibility for vulnerable groups.

AB  - To support the work of service-learning and community engagement (SLCE) being done in a high-quality, sustainable way, ("Combining Service and Learning: A Resource Book for Community and Public Service"), Kendall offered three Principles of Good Practice: (1) integrating service-learning programs into the central mission and goals of the schools and agencies where they are based; (2) establishing a balance of power between educational and community partners; and (3) wedding reflection to experience. Stanlick and Sell state that they are still grappling with Kendall's recommendations, notably establishing a balance of power in partnerships. They raise some thought provoking questions and provide answers for: (1) How do we establish a balance of power in genuine, life-giving ways- ways that support the self-actualization and growth of all stakeholders? (2) How do we ensure that partnerships are flexible, inclusive, and encouraging of the growth of everyone involved? (3) How do we avoid the pitfalls of dysfunctional helping when power is unbalanced and community partners are diminished or paralyzed by the social and economic privilege of the academy? (4) In what ways can we build a culture of humility and reciprocity to bring about a balanced power dynamic?

AB  - This dissertation examines the experience to 12 postsecondary education faculty and administrators during and after a faculty development seminar on service-learning pedagogy. The seminar, entitled "Connecting Service Experience with Classroom Instruction: Theory and Practice in Service-Learning Curriculum Design," was developed to (a) stimulate faculty interest in connecting student public service with academic study and (b) to provide participants with the knowledge and resources necessary to design courses that implement this pedagogy. Data were gathered from participants' seminar learning plans and assessments, through interviews conducted more than one year following the seminar, and through follow-up reports. The study is intended both to build upon and elaborate research on instructional improvement efforts related to service-learning pedagogy, and on faculty development initiatives generally. There were two sets of questions. One set attempted to learn whether the seminar met its goals. The second set of questions sought to identify variables related to how well these goals were achieved by different individuals. The study found that in the aggregate the seminar's goals were largely met. Analysis of participants' responses suggests that three, related sets of factors--in those that participated, in the seminar, and in the participants' institutions--were important to this success. Participant factors: (1) motivation to learn about service-learning; (2) concrete goals related to service-learning curriculum design and instruction; (3) perceptions that connecting study and service will be supported by administrators and colleagues; (4) roles that enable them to undertake seminar-related work, and buffer them from budgetary and promotional pressures. Seminar factors: (1) practical, action orientation; (2) intensive and interactive process; (3) presentation of relevant foundational knowledge and theories; (4) presentation of effective, varied models with opportunity to reflect on their application to participants' roles and institutional context; (5) opportunities to learn, practice and reflect upon specific service-learning pedagogies. Participant institution factors: (1) financial stability; (2) support for student volunteer service; (3) support for teaching generally and study-service connections specifically. Further research is needed to confirm these factors as variables in successful faculty development strategies related to service-learning, and to instructional improvement generally, and to better understand their relationships.

AB  - This history of service learning traces the work of 33 advocates, scholars, and practitioners since the early 1960s. Chapter 1 defines service learning and identifies a representative and influential group of "service learning pioneers." Chapter 2, titled "Early Connections Between Service and Education," by Seth S. Pollack, offers a conceptual framework for service learning. Chapter 3 draws on the pioneers' accounts of formative, personal experiences which led them toward service learning. In Chapter 4 the pioneers' first professional service-learning roles and the contexts for them are described, and chapter 5 follows the pioneers as they target postsecondary education as being at the right time and place to combine service and learning. Chapters 6 and 7 describe the variety of service-learning practices developed and established by the pioneers, emphasizing, respectively, student and community development. Chapter 8 recalls efforts of the struggles to maintain, sustain, and institutionalize service learning. In chapter 9 the pioneers identify and assess the outcomes of their work and note the challenges and supports they encountered. Chapter 10 offers recommendations for those concerned with current and future service-learning policies and practice. Appendices provide a list of service-learning practice opportunities and an historical service learning time line, prepared by Robert Sigmon. (Contains 92 references.) (DB)

AB  - I propose an approach to service-learning that encourages and enables students to engage with human rights and social justice in ways that are democratic and effective. I describe a teaching process in which civic action can be critically reflected on not just to promote engagement and build knowledge but ultimately to encourage and equip students with the commitment and ability to undertake this work as engaged citizens after graduation. This democratic approach to service-learning closes the divide between critical thinking and social action, helping to develop students who are aware of the world's problems and more committed to solving them.

AB  - Strategies to institutionalize service-learning are well documented (Furco 1996; Holland, 2000). Using Kecskes (2009) Community-Engaged Department Rubric we evaluated service-learning institutionalization within a school at a metropolitan campus. As a result, we propose adding an additional dimension, social return on investment. This added dimension helps academic leaders to understand the benefits, for a variety of stakeholders, of investing in service-learning and more broadly in campus-community partnerships. Implications and recommendations are offered to replicate this analysis.

AB  - For over 30 years, Foxfire has been developing an approach to learning that is learner-centered and community-focused. Foxfire's initial success resulted from a successful student-produced magazine in a rural Georgia high school. Attempts to duplicate this success often overlooked the key ingredients, student choice and academic integrity, that made it work. Foxfire's investigation into the process that gave rise to its success led to the identification of 11 "core practices" that enabled the replication of the Foxfire experience. The realization that teachers would have to rethink their existing ideas to implement the core practices led Foxfire to shift its organizational emphasis from working directly with students to working with teachers. Section 1 of this book devotes a chapter to each core practice, providing an in-depth discussion of how each is interpreted by Foxfire, the research and theory that support it, how teachers can get started, and how they can develop their implementation of each practice. Section 2 presents eight examples of how teachers successfully implemented the core practices in their classrooms. The stories demonstrate four points: that teachers made a conscious decision to change, that they took the risk to begin implementing changes, that the teachers' use of the core practices was based on their personal interpretations of them, and that they refined their practices as they continued at their own pace.

AB  - The intent of this paper is to describe the development of a freshman year course within a learning community and with a service learning component. Furthermore, it attempts to understand how participation in such a course may influence students' learning experiences and perceptions about community service. The study consisted of a pre- and post-questionnaire that was administered to 25 freshmen enrolled in the course. Results indicate that that a freshman year course within a learning community and with a service learning component can be an important aspect of students' academic, and social adjustment while it fosters community engagement at the same time.

AB  - States through a constellation of religious, private, and government programs. It explores how this larger impulse, which includes “service trips,” service–learning courses, and postgraduate programs like the Peace Corps, became a normative and ubiquitous opportunity for middle class, and consequently largely white, Americans. This study weaves together multiple programs, and a rich array of ideas and events such as social gospel concerns, pacifism, William James’ arguments for a “moral alternative to war,” gender and class anxieties, Great Depression and Cold War–specific exigencies, the Catholic Lay Apostolate, 1960s student activism, and the War on Poverty. The dissertation further demonstrates the religious roots of this phenomenon, as seen through Protestant and Catholic programs in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. Further, it shows that this paradigm of volunteer has always been twofold in its aim; it has focused both on the growth and education of the volunteer as they served others. It also shows that impulse has always been a limited agent for large–scale social change. Service programs were by their nature short–term projects meant to expose and educate volunteers to more entrenched social problems. Finally, while adult organizers often made service opportunities a possibility, it was the desire of many young women and men to “do more” with their time and abilities outside of traditional educational or professional options was the engine that truly drove and grew this movement.

AB  - Science teacher education has traditionally presented science as a body of knowledge to be mastered, along with the methods that may be used to help learners to master this body of knowledge. With pressure mounting on higher education institutions to engage more actively with communities, avenues have opened up to facilitate the development of teacher education courses that incorporate education for the empowerment of communities. This paper reports on two cases of socially responsible biology courses which enable students to interact with their communities. The two cases were applied in two biology education modules, using education for sustainable development (ESD) as a concept to define the content and activities incorporated in the above-mentioned modules. The first case incorporates ESD in a method module where students are required to develop an environmental policy for a school in collaboration with the school. The second case incorporates ESD in a biology education research module where students are required to direct their research activities in such a way that their research contributes to communities living healthier and more sustainable lives. By incorporating this approach in science education courses, the opportunity arises to promote personal growth and social responsibility through science learning. While developing their knowledge and skills pertaining to science education, they are able to reflect on their roles as educators in a broader community and in particular their roles of agents of change in that community.

AB  - This article discusses an application of the Lewinian/Kolb experiential learning model in the context of undergraduate participation in the Missouri Community Action Poverty Simulation (CAPS) program. CAPS is designed to simulate common, everyday experiences among people living in poverty as participants take on the roles of family members working to make ends meet. The creators of CAPS emphasize that "CAPS is not a game" but "a unique tool that community action agencies are able to use to educate everyone, from policy makers to community leaders, about the day to day realities of life with a shortage of money and an abundance of stress." The authors facilitated the CAPS program with two large groups of undergraduate students enrolled in sociology, gerontology, and psychology courses at a medium-sized private college in south-central Pennsylvania. The analysis examines the experiential learning outcomes of the students as they reflect on their participation in the simulation. Following participation in CAPS, the students demonstrated an increased awareness of the material conditions of everyday life among families living in poverty. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Educational institutions exist to impart information, mores, and self-worth to the persons who pass through their system. Generally, both public and private motives are imbedded within a curriculum, making it necessary for schools to provide diverse civic training and advance increasingly precise personal goals, respectively. The former is often measured by a student's social development—specifically, that of his or her value in the labor pool and sense of civic responsibility. In contrast, private (an individual's) goals are often guided by one's economic and political improvement. In developed nations, school-related academic literature is extensive; however, few have analyzed the ways in which schools in lesser-developed nations manage these competing goals. As an exploratory case study, this research examines the ways in which one school in Ecuador, a lesser-developed nation, reconciles such public and private interests. This study accomplished this by interviewing students, questioning their identification with several school-identified social and civic goals. Various ways in which students routinely interact with their community were also analyzed to measure their social consciousness and sense of citizenship, as conceptualized by the school's institutional mission and curricular definitions. Findings show that students' understanding of the instructional goals parallel those stated by the school. Students expressed personal examples of social and civic development, but these notions were generally associated with personal interest rather than participatory responsibility. The social justice orientation of citizenship (as expressed by the critical consciousness and social justice goal of the school) was acknowledged, but with limited detail. Overall, data indicate that the site school influences civic identity via its academic coursework, service—learning engagements, and various nonclass activities. Several descriptions of civic responsibility and social-minded action were present, but examining to what degree or effect was difficult to ascertain given the overlapping descriptions provided by students. The relatively small number of student participants in this study also precludes any speculative association regarding the efficacy of the instructional program as a larger initiative; specific relationships between identity development and curricular goals can be made, but the overall efficiency of the model to do so en masse is unknown.

AB  - This project promoted students' understanding of the importance of diversity of communities and cultures, and educated them on the challenges faced by children who are undergoing cancer treatments. To provide students with a situated learning experience that encouraged them to develop creative design solutions, the authors created a service-learning activity that required industrial technology students to apply design principles and procedures to design and develop toys to be given to pediatric patients at a local children's hospital. This project bridged disciplinary with civic engagement. Students were required to address course competencies through the design of toy prototypes as well as the unique needs of their pediatric audience.

AB  - This assessment explored community partners' perceptions of service learning in a required communication course. Semi-structured interviews revealed that community partners believed that students were providing needed and valuable service, students were learning about the community, and students were learning through their application of course skills in an applied context. However, community partners also felt that students were unaware of or did not care what they should be learning, that faculty contact was rare or nonexistent, and that community feedback opportunities were rare and undervalued by faculty. Results suggest specific improvements necessary in service learning assignment design.

AB  - This book examines and illustrates the process of transforming school-to-work into real learning for real work. In chapter 1, guidelines are presented for designing project-based learning programs that are both academically rigorous and grounded in community and workplace realities, and the attempts of three very different high schools to develop project-based school-to-work programs are described. Chapter 2 focuses on programs bridging the gap between classroom learning and community life. Learning experiences and opportunities that are now being created by school-to-work programs, including work-based education programs, internships, senior projects, field studies, and career exploration programs, are described in chapter 3. Chapter 4 (Margaret Vickers) explores ways of building students' understanding of science through work-based learning, and chapter 5 (Robert C. Riordan) profiles four schools where humanities instruction is being provided through work-based learning. Chapter 6 discusses the following topics related to designing relevant school-to-work programs and focusing on the big picture of high school reform: new approaches to professional development; reintegration of vocational education into the life of comprehensive high schools; changes in the roles teachers, businesses, and community partners play in education; and changes in how schools award credits for graduation. Actual examples from the field are cited throughout the book. (MN)

AB  - Valley Park Middle School (VPMS) in Valley Park, MO, has the unique designation of being a not-so-secret gem in St. Louis County. The middle school shares its campus with the elementary and high school, creating opportunities to collaborate and work together to build a school district that not only shines academically, but also focuses on developing character in students at every level of schooling. Parents, community, and school board members are proud of the fact that students get the best of what a small private school has to offer. In 2003, VPMS was randomly selected to participate in a federal grant program (Missouri Show Me CharacterPlus Implementation Study) designed to develop strong character education programs in schools to help improve climate and academics. For the past 13 years, VPMS has lived up to the challenge and has become a model for other schools to emulate. This article describes how VPMS has faced and managed new challenges and initiatives as they continue to find ways to emphasize and include character education into all programs within the school culture.

AB  - In California, and elsewhere, faculty are being encouraged to create "service learning opportunities" for their students, such as having social work students volunteer at a local soup kitchen, or having environmental studies students reforest the local watershed. While these endeavors have obvious social value, their education value suffers if students are unable to make connections between their projects and their academic work. Environmental studies programs are notorious for such disconnected activities. Tree planting is a classic example of a service learning project with little actual learning. Reforesting a degraded riparian corridor is a worthwhile pursuit and it connects people to a place, but what are students "learning" academically when they are planting trees? Well, if one frames it correctly, they can learn quite a lot. This essay describes the author's efforts to keep the scholarship in a local restoration project by connecting history and restoration ecology. The author says that their efforts are a great service to many members of the watershed ecosystem and his students engage in a unique learning opportunity as they wrestle with the many facets of "restoring nature." (Contains 8 notes.)

AB  - With this project, we seek to add historical and philosophical depth to the theoretical foundations for critical service learning and offer a philosophical framework that allows for a critical pedagogy of place. Lewis Mumford's Regional Survey is offered as a means to augment Deweyan democratic education. Regional Survey positions students out in their regions both as a way to learn about, participate in, and to learn to care about it. By placing students in the community through critical service learning, the potential is great to create a necessary critical pedagogy of place, leading to individual and community transformation.

In this article, the authors draw from their experience in a senior-level, interdisciplinary service-learning course called Literacy and Community to demonstrate that the moments of conflict generated by service-learning pedagogy are as, or even more, rich with learning potential as are the oft-promised outcomes. Ultimately, they contend that "excellence" in service-learning-based writing courses, and the scholarship that investigates them, require that one retains a consciousness of discord that accompanies service-learning, lest it become another streamlined, institutionally sanctioned pedagogical technique that tidily positions students to produce a certain kind of written product or to occupy a prescribed identity.

AB  - To counteract disempowerment frequently experienced in education, in 2001 the authors initiated a "Problem Solution Project" (PSP) in the second year a two-year urban certification and Master's program. The PSP, designed to promote empowerment of first-year urban teachers and their students, involves both service learning. In 2004, the authors began implementing a PSP in the program's first year, to enable preservice teachers to experience civically engaged learning using a studentcentered, participatory approach. The purposes were to: (a) encourage preservice teachers' own active practice and participation in identifying problems and forging solutions and (b) model how they might conduct a PSP in their own classrooms the following year. This article describes five years of implementing first-year problem solution projects. (Contains 3 tables.)

AB  - Too often teachers and students doubt their own abilities to forge collective work and dynamic critical learning in the midst of education reform practices that limit their opportunities to do so. This doubt can be heightened for elementary school teachers or even their students who are led to believe that they are not capable of engaging critically with their education and their world. The Problem-Solution Project erases this doubt through merging service-learning, critical pedagogy, and constructivism. This approach to teaching and learning is designed to empower teachers and students while they meet curriculum standards and actively contribute to the transformation of their world. Unique to this collection are the reported experiences of teacher educators who implement Problem-Solution Projects in their courses; preservice teachers’ reflections on cohort-driven Problem-Solution Projects; and first-year and veteran teachers stories featuring Problem-Solution Projects initiated by their PK-5 students. Features include: Describes how Problem-Solution Projects advance service-learning and critical pedagogy; Discussion of how Problem-Solution Projects build on curriculum standards but resists standardization of implementation and repressive education reforms; First-hand accounts of teachers implementing Problem-Solution Projects; Detailed description of the steps and outcomes of doing Problem-Solution Projects with preservice teachers, inservice teachers, and elementary students; and Examples of Problem-Solution Projects across courses, subjects, disciplines, and contexts. Readers will find worthwhile the theoretical connections and the practical applications. Service-learning, urban education, multicultural education and teacher education, teacher preparation practitioners will find this text beneficial. The main audience: teacher educators across disciplines, pre- and in-service teachers working in elementary (PK-5) settings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This chapter introduces the reader to service-learning, summarizes the research supporting service-learning experiences for students, highlights the role service-learning plays in curriculum development for gifted learners, and shares teachers' experiences with implementing service-learning in schools and classrooms. Although a growing body of research exists on the benefits of service-learning for students, a paucity of studies have addressed the impact of service-learning on gifted students. Because the components of service-learning are strongly tied to many of the best practices articulated within the gifted education literature, service-learning has great potential to inform curriculum development and modification for the gifted and requires further consideration.

AB  - The public service mission of public administration programs invites rethinking the exclusive focus on federal court decisions in administrative law courses. In spring 2015, we worked together in a course on the legal environment for public administration. The course included elements of the standard administrative law syllabus as well as a service component. The class worked with a city on a project that required the class to gather information about civil liability, policing, and racial inequality. A service project allows deeper learning while upending expectations of education as absorbing material presented to students. We argue service projects can be part of administrative law courses.

AB  - To meet the health needs of communities today, health professionals need to be trained in working with persons from various cultural backgrounds, practicing disease prevention and health promotion in community-based settings, and working in teams with other professionals. The article focuses on interdisciplinary teaming for education and practice. In this model, medical and nursing students partner with communities to plan and deliver health promotion education programs and activities. Four service learning projects providing collaborative teaming opportunities as part of the Health Professions Schools in Service to the Nation Program are described. Interdisciplinary service learning has benefits for the community, students, and faculty and will prepare nurses and physicians to have a positive impact on care through future interdisciplinary collaboration in community-based settings.

AB  - In an unusual cross-cultural endeavor, American and Russian students engaged in service learning as part of an organizational communication class in which they applied their skills to assist non-profit organizations. American students worked with a nursing home to plan a public relations event and the Russian students gave a party for children at an orphanage in Tomsk, Russia. Students worked in teams and accomplished assigned responsibilities. Both groups produced a public relations event and each contacted the press seeking news coverage. The Americans surveyed stakeholders about the effectiveness of the organization's ability to communicate with its constituents. The Russians went about their project differently (they participated in the course online).

AB  - Shelter medicine is a rapidly developing field of great importance, and shelters themselves provide abundant training opportunities for veterinary medical students. Students trained in shelter medicine have opportunities to practice zoonotic and species-specific infectious disease control, behavioral evaluation and management, primary care, animal welfare, ethics, and public policy issues. A range of sheltering systems now exists, from brick-and-mortar facilities to networks of foster homes with no centralized facility. Exposure to a single shelter setting may not allow students to understand the full range of sheltering systems that exist; a community-classroom approach introduces students to a diverse array of sheltering systems while providing practical experience. This article presents the details and results of a series of 2-week elective clinical rotations with a focus on field and service learning in animal shelters. The overall aim was to provide opportunities that familiarized students with sheltering systems and delivered primary-care training. Other priorities included increasing awareness of public health concerns and equipping students to evaluate shelters on design, operating protocols, infectious disease control, animal enrichment, and community outreach. Students were required to participate in rounds and complete a project that addressed a need recognized by them during the rotation. This article includes costs associated with the rotation, a blueprint for how the rotation was carried out at our institution, and details of shelters visited and animals treated, including a breakdown of treatments provided. Also discussed are the student projects and student feedback on this valuable clinical experience.

AB  - This article describes the Community Grant Writing Project (CGWP), a flexible service-learning framework designed for use in writing-intensive courses. The CGWP incorporates best-practice recommendations from the service-learning literature and addresses recent challenges identified for successful service-learning partnerships. In the CGWP, students combine direct service hours with a local nonprofit organization with assistance in writing grants to support specific initiatives at the organization. In the process of writing grants, students apply academic research and writing skills in a real-world context. In a first-year seminar, the CGWP has demonstrated its value for meeting student learning objectives and community partner needs. The article concludes with suggestions based on student and community partner feedback for implementing the project in writing-intensive courses.

AB  - This dissertation studies a service learning model based on the work of Thomas Deans as a possible way to implement ecocomposition as defined by Sidney I. Dobrin and Christian R. Weisser. Writing-intensive service learning projects, which doubled as needed writing for community sites and graded classroom assignments, were designed and coupled with reflective writing to enable students' exploration of their dynamic, reciprocal relationships with environment and writing holistically. Through qualitative case studies, I provide multiple perspectives from myself, a co-researcher, and student research participants. I report this data in narrative form in order to explore not just the ideas presented in the data, but also how that data is situated ecologically. The data chronicled a variety of experiences with service learning, teaching, and qualitative research. The exploration of interconnectedness to environment through service learning resulted in positive writing experiences for some of the student research participants as perceived by them and the researchers. The data indicating less positive writing experiences is analyzed in consideration of the subsequently published scholarship in service learning, ecocomposition, and related theory and pedagogy. Possible solutions are proposed to the problems indicated in the form of refinements to the service learning model. Ultimately, this dissertation proposes that a service learning model designed to implement ecocomposition can cultivate motivation to explore the multifaceted interconnections to one's environment, confidence to write in complex rhetorical situations, and interconnectedness to environment that informs traditionally academic work.

AB  - Law enforcement officials realize that reaching young people and encouraging them to lead productive adult lives must start at the earliest ages of adolescence. Recognizing the strong volunteer movement in the United States, law enforcement must also develop effective crime prevention programs that involve juveniles. The GREAT (Gang Resistance, Education, and Training) mentoring program has been implemented by many law enforcement agencies throughout the United States. The focus of this program is on the use of experienced, trained, and certified police officers in public schools to provide classroom instruction. The goal of the program is to instill necessary life skills, a sense of competency and usefulness, and personal empowerment to help young people avoid violence and criminal activity. Some public school systems require students to engage in service learning or community service activities as a prerequisite for high school graduation. The author concludes combining law enforcement volunteerism, mentoring, and community service graduation requirements has great potential with young people. 5 endnotes

AB  - In 1835, Alexis de Tocqueville warned that America's casual and transient communal bonds could eventually lead to the isolation of its citizens, threatening the foundations of American democratic society. Observers of contemporary society have concluded that individualism, autonomy, and self-reliance have triumphed over civic commitment and responsibility, and are perpetuated by our school systems. Students experience a lack of connection not only between classroom learning and their personal lives, but also between classroom learning and public issues. This explanatory and descriptive case study examined how 18 students enrolled in a diverse, urban Catholic high school became (re)connected to their communities through mandatory participation in a four-year service-learning program. In addition, this study aimed to discover whether the adolescents' involvement in these service activities simultaneously empower and motivate them to think critically about their world and to work for social change. To accomplish this task, analyses of archival school records and policies, semi-structured interviews with student participants, faculty, and administration, and student participants' reflection papers were guided by social capital theory, and framed within Paulo Freire's concept of conscientização . Analyses targeted specifically the characteristics of the experiences of the student participants, the structure and processes of the high school's service program, and the outcomes from students' participation. Four conclusions were drawn from the study: (1) direct service to numerous, diverse service recipient populations enables students to reconnect to former, to establish new, and to develop existing social networks; (2) mandatory service informs students' critical awareness by exposing them to different realities, although it is unlikely that students will achieve critical consciousness if substantive reflection activities are limited; (3) service programs can decrease civic apathy by exposing students to the phenomenon of community service and to meaningful, adult roles that are available to them; and, (4) service programs offer a viable and enjoyable means to integrate adolescents into civic life and to build healthy identities.

AB  - This article presents the findings from a study on the impact of concurrent service-learning pedagogical training and service-learning engagement on pre-service teachers' perceptions of teaching and inclination toward using service-learning. Findings reveal that experiential activities in which pre-service teachers can engage in real classrooms in real capacities can open their eyes to realities of teaching, bolster their confidence, inform them about good/bad practices, and remind them that students are key to a conducive learning environment. Findings were not attributed explicitly to prospective teachers' participation in service-learning, however.

AB  - This study aimed to determine if preinternship teacher education students' participation in service-learning activities in K-12 classrooms would significantly affect their sense of teacher efficacy. A secondary question was whether 1 type of service-learning activity (e.g., whole class instruction) would impact teacher efficacy more than another (e.g., small group tutoring). We found that preinternship service-learners in both types of service-learning activity increased significantly in teacher efficacy. However, neither type of service-learning activity was superior to the other. The discussion focuses on the factors shared between the two service-learning designs that might mediate a positive mastery experience. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Palestinian youth face developmental, cultural, and political barriers that impede them from fully engaging in civic life. Non-traditional, youth-centred pedagogies of engagement, like community-based service-learning, have shown their potential to motivate marginalised populations and provide space and roles for them to form individual identities while developing civic skills. Using data collected through focus-group interviews, this article considers the impact on West Bank youth who participated in an NGO's community-based service-learning leadership programme. Six themed findings are discussed, and the author suggests that non-school-based service-learning may have a central role to play in the civic-identity development of Palestine's most populous group of citizens.

AB  - A primary purpose of public education is to ensure that all citizens have the knowledge, skills, and dispositions to participate in a democracy. Service learning is a democratic, constructivist, instructional strategy that connects academic learning with community needs. This phenomenological study described: (a) how youth, their educators, and community partners who experience service learning perceive its effects on themselves, their schools, and their community lives and (b) how professional-development opportunities need to be structured in order to encourage high quality civics education instruction. The problem this study addressed was how to solve youth civic and political disengagement. This study relied heavily upon in-depth interviews of nine middle school students, six middle school educators, and one community partner from a rural community in the northeastern United States. In addition, participant journals and grant documents were reviewed. Rubin and Rubin's guidelines and Tesh's eight step coding process were used to analyze each transcript, journal, and document. Results showed that service learning promoted the application of academic content, motivated students, appealed to various learning styles, built relationships, encouraged collaboration, and provided leadership opportunities. By better understanding the benefits and challenges of service learning projects as described by participants, this study could facilitate positive social change and improvements to current civic education instruction, including higher quality service-learning projects. By working collaboratively, youth, educators, and community partners can address the problem of youth disengagement from civic and political life, thus ensuring the continuation of a healthy democracy.

AB  - Improved student achievement requires the distribution of leadership beyond one individual. Given their daily connection to students, leadership opportunities distributed to classroom teachers are key to school improvement. Complicating the development of classroom teacher leaders are attrition rates and low teacher efficacy among novice educators. Service-learning and servant leadership offer complementary pedagogical and philosophical approaches to shift the role of classroom teachers and address efficacy concerns. This study utilised a pre-/post-test, quasi-experimental research design to determine to what extent changes would occur over time in pre-service educators’ teacher sense of efficacy and sense of servant leadership from participating in service-learning.

AB  - Phenomenon: In the United States, the Affordable Care Act has increased the need for community-centered pedagogy for medical education such as service-learning, wherein students connect academic curriculum and reflections to address a community need. Yet heterogeneity among service-learning programs suggests the need for a framework to understand variations among service-learning programs in medical education. Approach: A qualitative systematic review of literature on service-learning and medical education was conducted for the period between 1998 and 2012. A two-stage inclusion criteria process resulted in articles (n = 32) on service-learning and Doctor of Medicine or Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine being included for both coding and analysis. Focused and selective coding were employed to identify recurring themes and subthemes from the literature. Findings: The findings of the qualitative thematic analysis of service-learning variation in medical education identified a total of seven themes with subthemes. The themes identified from the analysis were (a) geographic location and setting, (b) program design, (c) funding, (d) participation, (e) program implementation, (f) assessment, and (g) student outcomes. Insights: This systematic review of literature confirmed the existence of program heterogeneity among service-learning program in medical education. However, the findings of this study provide key insights into the nature of service-learning in medical education building a framework for which to organize differences among service-learning programs. A list of recommendations for future areas of inquiry is provided to guide future research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The author describes how the Understanding by Design (backwards planning) lesson plan format was used by his preservice K-12 students to develop service-learning lesson plans. Preservice teachers in a multicultural education course were given an assignment to develop service-learning lesson plans using the Understanding by Design planning process. The students were urged to develop lesson plans emphasizing content application, collaboration, reflection, and impact. Student products illustrated themes of culture, diversity, and general service initiatives. A rubric was used to evaluate seven performance categories within three levels of impact indicators. Outcomes suggest that the use of overarching understandings and essential questions (Wiggins & McTighe, 1998) contribute to the development of lessons that connect content to community.

AB  - Background: Medical school is arduous and participating in optional service-learning activities may compete with the required curriculum. The student-run SHARING Clinics at the University of Nebraska are managed by a Board of students who commit to extensive voluntary participation. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine whether optional service-learning participation resulted in compromised medical school grades. Methods: Of 908 students who matriculated between 1999 and 2006, 87 served on the SHARING Board. A 2 x 2 repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare the grade point averages of Board members and non-members before and after participating on the Board. Results: The grades for SHARING Board members and non-members were not statistically different. The study had sufficient statistical power to detect even a small effect size. Conclusions: Concern about compromised academic performance appears to be an invalid reason to avoid service-learning participation. The benefits of participation appear to outweigh the costs.

AB  - The Adult Health And Development (AHeAD) program at Middle Tennessee State trains students to apply academic knowledge to improve the well being of older adults through service learning by combining community service with planning, goal setting, and immediate self and group evaluation. Opportunities for generations to relate on a one-to-one basis help reduce intergenerational stereotypes and prejudice. AHeAD is intended to adequately prepare graduates to serve the elderly by incorporating service and learning and enhancing their self-evaluation and critical thinking skills. AHeAD is a forum for building partnerships with the community to help meet community needs and to prepare students through a multi-disciplinary, intergenerational approach.

AB  - The term "environmental education" refers to the practice of educating the general population—either by formal or non-formal academic methodology—about the nature of the environment, environmental degradation, and the impact of various human behaviors on the environment. Environmental education responds to a growing public awareness of the rapidly deteriorating state of the environment and the belief that an informed public will make informed lifestyle decisions giving due consideration to the environmental impact of their behavior. The international community has long recognized the economic and social value of environmental education. Various instruments of international law encourage States to develop national environmental education policies and integrate formal and non-formal programs into existing public education schemes. While the policy recommendations of the international community with regard to environmental education have been adopted by States with varying levels of success, four countries in particular—Australia, Brazil, India and the Netherlands—provide outstanding examples of superior policy development in this field. The United States unfortunately lacks the same degree of progressive policy development concerning the institutionalization of environmental education within the framework of public education. In the absence of a superseding national policy, state officials remain responsible for the development of environmental education in state public schools. As a result, the level of environmental education received by American students is inconsistent and wholly dependent upon the state of residence. Failure to receive a basic level of environmental education leaves many American students unprepared for the globalized and "green" economy of the future. This Article analyzes the environmental education policies adopted by foreign jurisdictions as well as recent policy developments in California and Maryland, and builds upon the lessons learned from previous models to propose a framework for policy development of a national environmental education mandate in the United States.

AB  - Democratic problem-solving necessitates an active and informed citizenry, but existing research on service-learning has shed little light on the relationship between pedagogical practices and civic competence outcomes. This study developed and tested a model to represent that relationship and identified pedagogical catalysts of civic competence using five years of survey data from over 10,000 students in approximately 700 courses. The results strongly substantiate the proposed model, with knowledge, skills, attitudes, and actions as epistemological components of civic competence. Most importantly for the social justice aims of service-learning, the study found that diversity significantly enhances all civic competence outcomes. Finally, the results demonstrated that service must be thoroughly integrated into a course through the syllabus and community partnership to maximize civic competence. These findings and the new Critical Pedagogy Model of Civic Competence through Service-Learning provide direction for faculty development and future research related to cultivating competent citizens through service-learning.

AB  - Background: Interest in global health is rapidly increasing amongst US medical students. Many students aspire to incorporate global health into their future careers, while others seek international opportunities to better prepare themselves for domestic practice. US medical schools have begun responding to this burgeoning interest with varying intensity and through a number of different strategies. Conclusions: Three important themes involved include: increasing the academic rigor of programming, fostering sustainable site partnerships, and encouraging mentorship and reflection for the students involved. Finally, the growing practice of service learning might also play a helpful role in integrating these themes into expanding global health programs.

AB  - This study investigated moderator strategies relevant to the development of online professional learning communities and the ability of an online professional learning community to implement and sustain concepts learned during online learning events. A pre-study explored the role of the moderator and barriers related to developing an online community of learners. The major study explored school team engagement in online learning and implementation of lessons learned during the ePD event. Multiple survey instruments were used in this mixed methods research design to collect data about moderator strategies, concept implementation, influences on technology use, barriers to technology use, and demographic data. Administrator and teacher results were evaluated based on Kirkpatrick's Evaluation Method; reaction, learning, behavior, and evaluation. Participants reported engaging in the learning event for the purpose of improving personal knowledge of the topic of shared leadership. Limited change in behavior was noted due to many of the concepts taught during the learning event being currently in place in the school environment as noted during survey completion. The learning event timeline coincided with state mandated assessments resulting in a fragmented focus on the concepts covered by participating school team members. School teams relied predominately on summative data to evaluate learning success resulting in limited data to substantiate results. The activities of the moderators, administrators, and teachers resulted in the development of an online professional learning community however implementation of concepts learned were not sustained due to factors beyond the design of the learning event. Opportunities for future research on the topic of online professional learning communities may include an evaluation of moderator experience with facilitating online learning. A research study focused solely on moderator activity might enhance participant learning. Furthermore, a study of the topics for online learning that have shown the most affect on student learning would be helpful for future online learning developers. In addition, a study that reveals the most effective time of year to offer professional development would be helpful. Time seemed to be the most common factor for all administrators and teachers when considering participation in future learning events. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

An example is provided of a service-learning class where middle school students received comprehensive guidance curriculum instruction and then taught a similar curriculum to elementary school students. Results from a phenomenological evaluation describe yielded five major themes pertinent to middle school student development and demonstrate comprehensive guidance program goal achievement: personal awareness, social skills, learning skills, career interests and character education. The themes were personal awareness, social skills, learning skills, career interests, and character education. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The purpose of this qualitative study was twofold: (a) to investigate how a service-learning class assisted in achieving the goals of a comprehensive guidance and development program in a junior high school, and (b) to examine the effects of a service-learning class on junior high school students. Thirty students who had been in the service-learning class participated in semistructured interviews. Parents and teachers were also interviewed to cross-validate student perceptions. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed to identify core meanings. Using phenomenological analysis, eight major themes were identified: personal awareness, social skills development, learning skills, career interests, character education, application of class, class satisfaction, and program administration. Each of the eight themes also had several sub-themes. Currently, there is a paucity of research regarding counselors using service-learning as a method to assist in achieving comprehensive guidance program goals. This study found that service-learning is an effective method of comprehensive guidance program delivery and is beneficial to students. Limitations of the study are described and ideas for future research are presented.

The purpose of the qualitative study was to test John Dewey's educational philosophy that true learning comes through experiences which are educative. The learning objective being measured was multicultural awareness. Students enrolled in two sections of COUN 3100: Counseling and Human Services were participants in the study. One section, the experimental group, participated in a service-learning project (N = 15) and the second section, the control group, participated in a cultural engagement project (N = 12). Students' multicultural awareness was assessed through a pretest and posttest using the Miville-Guzman Universality-Diversity Scale which measures universality-diversity orientation. The assessment was administered in order to determine changes in multicultural awareness as a result of participating in the service-learning project (experimental group) or cultural engagement project (control group). Results of the study indicated no significant changes in students' scores between the pretest and posttest for the service-learning section or the cultural engagement section. Furthermore, students' changes in scores from the pretest to the posttest in the service-learning experimental group section were, on average, the same as students' changes in scores in the cultural engagement control group section. The purpose of the qualitative inquiry of this study was to try to understand the learning, with respect to both content and process, which took place as a result of participating in a service-learning project or cultural engagement project. Students' descriptions of their participation in a service-learning project fell into distinct categories. Two of the categories included what students had learned (learning objectives and diversity awareness). A third category consisted of course experiences and service-learning experiences. A fourth category included aspects of the learning process which occurred through their service-learning experiences. Students' descriptions of participating in a cultural engagement project clearly revealed a process of learning about diversity issues. Four phases emerged from the students' accounts. Each phase built on the previous phase, thus resulting in a developmental process. The phases which emerged were (1) exposure to diversity issues, (2) conflict with diversity issues, (3) resolution of diversity conflict, and (4) outcomes of learning about diversity. Both methods of instruction (service-learning and cultural engagement) supported Dewey's educational philosophy that learning occurs through experiences which are educative. Furthermore, both projects met the course objective of teaching multicultural awareness. The organization of data for the service-learning course fell into distinct categories. However, the organization of the data for the cultural engagement section revealed a learning process. Students participating in a service-learning project seemed to acquire multiple, general learning outcomes. Whereas, students in the cultural engagement section discussed one major learning outcome: diversity awareness. While students in the service-learning section described the locus of learning as taking place at the service-learning site and through interactions with the individuals at their sites, students in the cultural engagement class described reflection, through writing and discussion, as essential for processing their experiences. While the quantitative study failed to uncover any evidence that students' gained multicultural awareness through their experiences, the qualitative inquiry revealed that students did acquire multicultural awareness.

AB  - The State of Texas has more than 19,000 individuals who lack the physical or mental ability to provide for their need for shelter, financial management, or physical care. These individuals have been designated as wards of the court and placed under guardianship. Texas probate courts appoint individuals known as court visitors to make annual visits to wards of the court to assess their well-being under guardianship. Although the 10 statutory probate courts have court visitor programs, many county courts do not. This article describes the details of a service-learning experience using an online distance educational program to train undergraduate nursing students in a mental health course to become court visitors. This information may be useful to others looking for nontraditional clinical experiences and service-learning opportunities for undergraduate nursing students.

AB  - During the last several years, researchers have been garnering evidence concerning the benefits of service-learning, and urging its inclusion in the curricular mainstream. This study presents evidence that college students manifest long-lasting, if modest, academic benefits from participating in service-learning. The academic records of 477 students who completed an Introductory Child Development lecture course with or without a service-learning requirement were examined, to compare grades earned by the "service-learning" and the "non-service-learning" students in four kinds of upper division courses. Results of ANOVAS yielded differences in student performance consistently favoring the "service-learning" students, although they failed to reach conventional levels of statistical significance. Directions for future research as well as concerns about the more widespread infusion of service-learning are discussed.

AB  - What causes students to leave school? According to Azzam (2007), over 47% of students in the United States who drop out of school reported they did so because school was boring and irrelevant to their life situation. What can schools and teachers do to encourage students to stay in school? One possible solution may be to look at experiential learning processes and civic competencies, which help people perform in the workplace and adult life. Service-learning is a rich pedagogy that can make students excited about learning and in the process, enhance their grades ("Growing to Greatness," 2007). It provides a vehicle for students to connect with their communities, address problems, and by doing so, to become a part of the solution. Quality service-learning teaches students problem-solving, critical thinking, decision making, public speaking, teamwork, and how to interact with communities that are different from their own cultural membership (Basttistoni and Longo, 2007). A service-learning project designed to encourage skill development is described. (Contains 2 tables.)

AB  - Feminist scholars/teachers face a distinctive challenge: how to see to it that both the content of our courses & the pedagogies that we employ include, empower, & value women. Involving students in community-based research projects, as a teaching strategy in social research methods courses, serves this critical purpose. Community-based research emphasizes collaboration, critical analysis, social action, & the democratization of knowledge. Hence, it engages students with feminist challenges to conventional thinking about how & why we do research in the social sciences, the role of the researcher, how best to study human behavior & social life, & power & control in the research process. At the same time, the experiential, "connected" nature of community-based research makes it an effective feminist pedagogy that engages & empowers students who might otherwise find research methods intimidating & irrelevant. I include examples of community-based research projects as well as strategies for incorporating this form of service-learning into research methods courses.

NICEL sponsors several programs to bring law- related education to at-risk adolescents. In 1972, NICEL launched its first Street Law program to send law students into high schools, juvenile and adult correctional institutions, and community settings to teach practical law; 38 law schools now offer this program. Other activities sponsored by NICEL include conflict management training, mock trials, law-related education for disabled students, and international programs.

Qualitative focus groups with 76 participants who participated in a 4-hour Street Retreat. After the semi-structured immersion, students' awareness of privilege, perceptions of people in poverty, and stereotype projections began to shift toward a state of critical consciousness. The reinforcement of "us v. them" discourses are also explored.

AB  - Adolescent substance use remains a major health and safety problem. A multitude of prevention approaches has been employed to reduce the impact and incidence of substance use among youth. Considerable progress has been made over the past thirty years in identifying effective prevention approaches. The dilemma for administrators and policy planners is to determine what types of adolescent drug use prevention programs to implement, given the contingent nature of evidence regarding program effectiveness. While research on the distinctions between drug prevention programs is abundant, most of the prevention programs have been developed and tested in school settings. Research has also been conducted with community settings, but there is comparatively little evidence on the consequences of intervention-differing attributes for community program outcomes. This study analyzes community-based prevention research findings from a variety of studies and integrates those results into a meta-analysis in order to identify critical ingredients of effective programming. It focuses on two basic questions: (a) Does the evidence indicate that community-based intervention programs are capable of preventing, delaying, or reducing drug use by adolescents? If so, (b) is the variation in effectiveness related to the characteristics and settings of the intervention programs? Overall, the findings provide evidence of a modest benefit of program participation for the average youth. The findings show that 'comprehensive' and 'school-community' programs are more effective than 'community only' programs in influencing youth drug use. These three community-based program categories are then compared to school-based program evaluations. The results suggest that intervention characteristics, such as program focus and setting, influence program performance as measured in terms of drug use outcomes. The programs with a broader focus delivered in multiple settings ('comprehensive' and 'school-community') appear to outperform narrower-focused programs delivered in a single setting ('community only' and 'school only') on major drug use outcomes.

AB  - The extent to which nursing students are educationally prepared to lead health policy initiatives is inextricably linked to their political identity. Knowing and showing oneself to be a politic person in interactions with others is a dynamic social process that the authors propose can be facilitated by innovative, community-based service learning partnerships. A partnership between an elected city councilman and Registered Nurses in a baccalaureate-level professional issues course demonstrates how service learning can create a context for students' political socialization. In a pilot study, systematic qualitative research techniques were used to analyze the partners' reflections about their relationship. Findings suggest that students' political identities were developed through involvement in the community. Working on issues of mutual interest also raised policy makers' and nurses' consciousness of the value both groups contribute to addressing problems in urban communities.

AB  - This article illustrates our understanding, as a student team, of the challenges that conventional approaches can have when structuring joint student-community partnerships. Through the use of the metaphor "stuck in cement", we wish to draw a distinction between viewing service learning through a results-focused lens with a sense of a clearly defined path rather than construction of partnerships. This paper will explore two main questions: Are we, as students who conduct service learning projects, stuck in a single-frame mindset? If so, how do we break free? These questions are explored through the combination of lived experience and post-field reflection. We have developed our thoughts within the context of previous work regarding approaches to international service learning projects, the challenges that are often faced, and the mindsets of those involved. This reflection, presented primarily from the perspective of student participants, is offered as an example of how our group challenged the notions of success and externally designed and implemented systems, with the hope that the example may inform future efforts of this type.

AB  - ; This article explores the attitude of business management students toward community service and service-learning. Community service is changing the way that corporate America views the connection between profits and social responsibility. Anecdotal evidence indicates that community service is viewed by many managers as an opportunity to satisfy multiple goals, including corporate social responsibility, team building, and employee skill acquisition. Similarly, service-learning is changing the way that professors view the connection between classroom pedagogy and learning. Service-learning activities present an opportunity to reinforce classroom content while providing a valued service to the community. Professors are finding that service-learning enhances problem-solving skills, builds student skill levels, and fosters social responsibility. This article addresses one area of faculty reluctance, namely their belief that students will not be committed to and responsible in carrying out the assigned project, because they do not value it.

AB  - One goal of elementary education is to help children develop the skills, knowledge, and values associated with citizenship. However, there is little consensus about what these goals really mean: various schools, and various programs within any school, may promote different notions of "good citizenship." Peer conflict mediation, like service learning, creates active roles for young people to help them develop capacities for democratic citizenship (such as critical reasoning and shared decision making). This study examines the notions of citizenship embodied in the contrasting ways one peer mediation model was implemented in six different elementary schools in the same urban school district. This program was designed to foster leadership among diverse young people, to develop students' capacities to be responsible citizens by giving them tangible responsibility, specifically the power to initiate and carry out peer conflict management activities. In practice, as the programs developed, some schools did not share power with any of their student mediators, and other schools shared power only with the kinds of children already seen as "good" students. All of the programs emphasized the development of nonviolent community norms-a necessary but not sufficient condition for democracy. A few programs began to engage students in critical reasoning and/or in taking the initiative in influencing the management of problems at their schools, thus broadening the space for democratic learning. These case studies help to clarify what our visions of citizenship (education) may look and sound like in actual practice so that we can deliberate about the choices thus highlighted.

AB  - Students with disabilities are a growing population in post-secondary institutions, yet present poorer academic outcomes compared to students without disabilities. The current study examined university students' own perceptions and experiences with disability support services (SDS) including how helpful they found the accommodations they were granted, how regularly they visited SDS and the purpose of their visits, in what ways SDS had been useful, and their recommendations for improving SDS. We also examined the relationship between the number of visits to SDS and grade point average (GPA). The findings indicated that students visited SDS an average of 4.7 times a semester for a variety of reasons but primarily to establish their accommodations. There was a significant relationship between number of visits to SDS and GPA. Results indicated that services provided through SDS were not fully utilized and students highlighted a number of areas for improvement. With increased awareness and accessibility of these services, students with disabilities in university settings may have improved academic outcomes.

AB  - A dramatic increase in engineering student participation during the last decade indicates heightened student and faculty interest in engineering service experiences. The first step towards understanding why students are drawn to such opportunities is to examine how students perceive engineering service experiences as an important source of learning technical and professional skills involved in the engineering disciplines. The following study investigates how students compare their service experience with their traditional coursework experience as a source of learning professional and technical skills in engineering. Students' perception of where they learned professional and technical knowledge or skills provides an insight into the potential impact service-based interventions creates. This study compares service experiences with traditional coursework-based learning to examine the impact of service on students' perception of learning sources. Students participating in an eclectic and large variety of engineering service experiences were surveyed. Engineering students on average identified that 45% of what they have learned about technical skills and 62% of what they have learned about professional skills was gained through their engineering service experience. Female students credited service experiences as their source of both professional and technical skills significantly higher than male students, and were consistent across academic years. Engineering students' perceive service-based learning experiences, relative to their traditional course-based learning, to significantly impact what they know about technical and professional engineering outcomes.

AB  - This article informs that the learning potential of hands-on, experience-based projects is enormous--as the increased use of service learning and internship programs attests. A bit less involved but equally promising is the learning afforded by projects that give students opportunities to do work for clients. Educators Tara Lopez and Renee Gravois have used client-based projects in a wide range of marketing and advertising courses. They offer five principles, drawn from their experience, that can do much to make these projects workable for faculty, valuable learning experiences for students, and of significant benefit to the clients.

AB  - This paper presents a case study that examines an internship as service learning and participating students' perceptions of their learning in two learning environments. The internship experience in this situation is first examined to ascertain that it qualifies as service learning. At the conclusion of this service learning internship experience, participating students were asked to reflect on their learning in a service learning experience compared to their learning in traditional classroom learning experiences. Students' reflections are examined for evidence linking their perceptions regarding their learning to multiple theories of learning. Findings indicate that (a) the particular intern- ship examined qualifies as service learning; (b) participating students feel they learn more in a hands-on service learning situation than in a traditional classroom learning situation; (c) participating students feel that classroom learning is an important pre- and/or co-requisite to service learning; (d) multiple theories of learning are supported via a service learning experience thus offering more paths to learning to a broader, more diverse scope of learners; and (e) a service learning experience may open the way to a transformative learning experience while, at the same time, supporting the community and the LIS profession.

AB  - This report reviews service learning activities performed by student teachers in the American Indian Reservation Project in their placement communities across the Navajo Nation. Parameters for this required, academic assignment included the selection of activities independent of their schools' academic or extracurricular programs; completion of activities with supporting Navajo community members; and adherence to the 'three R's:' realistic tasks serving the community, a strong reflective component, and reciprocal exchange between equals. Many varying service-learning projects were performed. The student teachers' insightful written reports described important outcomes in terms of new knowledge acquired, a deeper appreciation for the circumstances of others' lives, and greater acceptance in their placement communities. Knowledge of the community and its people, including their backgrounds, beliefs, traditions, and values, contributes to the creation of a classroom context in which teachers can more effectively serve their elementary and secondary pupils.

AB  - Implementing service-learning programs in schools for our gifted may help nurture the development of more highly moral people. Service-learning, a method by which students learn and develop through curriculum integration and active participation in thoughtfully organized service experiences that address needs in their community, has three levels: community service, community exploration, and community action. Community action, most appropriate for gifted youth, involves a high degree of service that produces a broad community impact and the highest degree of learning. This article discusses case studies of four gifted, middle-grade students who participated in community action service-learning projects that positively impacted both the community and the students. Could service-learning be helpful in creating more people like Thoreau and Gandhi by developing co-cognitive traits in gifted youth? (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In the paper "Demographic and personnel service delivery data: Implications for including students with disabilities in Italian Schools" Giangreco, Doyle and Suter (2012) invited Italian colleagues to compare data they found through a study in 16 schools in five Italian regions relative to the demographics of the schools and to the school service delivery, paying particular attention to the comparison between Italy and the United States. In four different contributions (available to us at the time of writing), some Italian colleagues have further expanded the debate by providing additional data and points of view (Di Nuovo, 2012; D'Alessio, 2013; Ianes, Zambotti, & Demo, 2013; Zanobini, 2013). In the present paper, considerations are provided about some questions that Giangreco, Doyle and Suter have raised at the end of their article.

AB  - Though increasing numbers of students spend time studying abroad, there has been little discussion regarding the needs of study-abroad students as a distinct user group. The little research that has been done in this area focuses on support for study-abroad students as information users. This article expands the conversation to consider the librarian's role in supporting study-abroad students as producers of valuable information, particularly as study-abroad programs expand to nontraditional locations and focus on project-based and service-learning activities of direct benefit to their host communities. A model for creating digital libraries that supports the work of study-abroad programs in Monteverde, Costa Rica, is presented. Through multi-institutional collaboration, use of graduate student interns, and digital library technology, information produced by study-abroad programs of relevance to both local communities and future researchers is now accessible. Options for wider future support for study-abroad students as information producers are considered.

AB  - Background: The University of New England (UNE), Australia decided to develop innovative placement opportunities for its increasing numbers of nursing students. Extensive community and stakeholder consultation determined that a community centre in rural New South Wales was the welcomed site of the student-led clinic because it fit the goals of the project—to increase access to health care services in an underserved area while providing service learning for students. Methods: Supported by a grant from Health Workforce Australia and in partnership with several community organisations, UNE established a student-led clinic in a disadvantaged community using an engaged scholarship approach which joins academic service learning with community based action research. The clinic was managed and run by the students, who were supervised by university staff and worked in collaboration with residents and local health and community services. Results: Local families, many of whom were Indigenous Australians, received increased access to culturally appropriate health services. In the first year, the clinic increased from a one day per week to a three day per week service and offered over 1000 occasions of care and involved 1500 additional community members in health promotion activities. This has led to improved health outcomes for the community and cost savings to the health service estimated to be $430,000. The students learned from members of the community and community members learned from the students, in a collaborative process. Community members benefited from access to drop in help that was self-determined. Conclusions: The model of developing student-led community health and wellbeing clinics in underserved communities not only fulfils the local, State Government, Federal Government and international health reform agenda but it also represents good value for money. It offers free health services in a disadvantaged community, thereby improving overall health and wellbeing. The student-led clinic is an invaluable and sustainable link between students, health care professionals, community based organisations, the university, and the community. The community benefits from the clinic by learning to self-manage health and wellbeing issues. The benefits for students are that they gain practical experience in an interdisciplinary setting and through exposure to a community with unique and severe needs.

AB  - Students may be predisposed to benefit from mandatory service-learning programs based on their gender and upon whether their parents serve as models of helping. The role of each of these variables was examined in a survey of 86 seventh grade students who were required to complete a service project during the school year. Results demonstrated that girls felt more positively about the specific program and were more likely to intend to help in the future than boys. Students with parental helping models were also more likely to intend to help in the future. Girls with parental models were more likely to have altruistic self-images than girls without parental models whereas the presence of parental helping models had no effect on boys' altruistic self-image. These results are discussed with regard to socialization of prosocial behavior in both boys and girls. (RKC)

AB  - Reflection is a key component of service learning, but research shows that in order to maximize learning, the reflection must be of high quality. This paper compares the affordances of three different models of written reflection in engendering students' higher-order thought processes. Student reflections were compared across axes of guided versus free response, dialogic versus expressive reflection, and public versus private reflection. Results indicate that guided reflection yields more response than free reflection does. Dialogic and guided reflections both yield more integration of knowledge from service learning activities within a larger context. Results for public reflection versus private were mixed. Ethical considerations for public reflection are also discussed.

AB  - Sleep problems are more prevalent and severe among children with intellectual disabilities and autism compared to typically developing children. Training parents in behavioural approaches to manage sleep problems is advocated. However, delivering such interventions via groups is novel. This article reports the findings from a preliminary evaluation of a group-delivered intervention routinely delivered by a Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service Learning Disability team in England. For this purpose, parents (n = 23) of children with intellectual disabilities were recruited. The Children’s Sleep Habits Questionnaire, Parents’ Sense of Competence Scale and parent-set goals captured outcomes at pre-intervention, post-intervention and 3- and 6-month follow-up. Intervention delivery costs were collected. Take-up was high (86%), and no parent dropped out. Statistically significant improvements in night wakings, parent-set goals and parents’ sense of efficacy were observed. The estimated mean cost of delivering each intervention was British (GBP) £1570. Findings suggest the intervention is a low-cost, acceptable service warranting further evaluation.

AB  - Structural inequalities in American public education are inextricably tied to deep-seated patterns of racial and economic segregation. Children in poor neighborhoods are less likely to have the household resources, neighborhood institutions, or school amenities necessary for a good, challenging education. In response, a growing number of organizations have launched initiatives to simultaneously revitalize neighborhoods and improve public education, emphasizing youth participation as an essential component in their efforts. We draw upon ethnographic data from two such organizations to examine their practice of place-based critical pedagogy in community development. We focus on how they engage marginalized, "hard-to-reach" youth via (1) experiential learning, to counter high-stakes testing models and cultivate a sense of ownership in the local community, and (2) empowered deliberative action, in contextualized ways. The tensions embedded in these organizations' complex efforts have implications for other groups of marginalized youth engaged in community development, especially in their attempts to help students gain concrete outcomes in community development and achieve long-term sustainability.

AB  - This article describes how a college social service learning centre at a Catholic university created an opportunity for researchers, college students and elementary school teachers to learn about meaning in life together, through a social service learning program in Taiwan. The participants' involvement benefitted their learning, indicating that the meaning in life perceived by the younger generation has changed in response to the context of an evolving Chinese culture, and that participants constrained their callings by developing realistic plans consisting of goals emphasised in traditional Chinese culture. Challenges were identified: specifically, the participants' callings did not directly reflect the lessons that they learned through involvement in the program, and implementing the service program as a one-time activity limited its effect on the participants' ability to find meaning in life. Future development of the service program was discussed, based on the lessons learned through this action research.

AB  - This action research encompasses both descriptive and prescriptive treatment of the process and outcomes of an international and interdisciplinary volunteer service learning project. The project was held in a Junior High School in Suniteyou, Xilingol League in Inner Mongolia. The descriptive, qualitative aspect captures the reflections and thoughts of volunteer-service students. Sample participants include two teachers and fourteen students (five from the department of English, and nine from Information Management) from Aletheia University. It is found that service learning provides benefits to both service providers and service receivers. The target student population benefited from improved motivation and enhanced educational resources. Simultaneously, volunteer students (service providers) received numerous benefits, such as (1) mutually beneficial interaction with students from other departments, in conjunction with help from the teachers; (2) positive spillover effects from the service receiver students' learning enthusiasm; (3) expanded knowledge base through an active and effective task-based project (4) in conjunction with guided reflection, the project promoted positive attitudes, critical thinking and self-growth (5) experience that fosters professionalism; (6) happiness through accomplishing goals and helping others. The researchers also observed a number of problems during the service and the interdisciplinary cooperation. Even though the results showed that service provider students' learning effectiveness developed after participating the interdisciplinary cooperation; the study also discusses the interdisciplinary cooperation on students' impact and how interdisciplinary cooperation helped the volunteer students. Finally, this study provides many prescriptive observations for improvement. It is hoped that this study will promote the practice of offering service-learning opportunities in higher education to influence and encourage students to become active participants in society.

AB  - This paper presents findings from a qualitative study of ten students who engaged in experiential learning of evaluation. A grounded theory approach was used to understand what and how students learn about evaluation through these opportunities. This study is important because there is strong support for practical experiences in teaching evaluation and documented success of the strategy in other fields, yet little empirical research on experiential learning specific to evaluation exists (Trevisan, 2004). Findings suggest that students develop technical skills, soft skills, and learn about evaluation context via practical experiences. In addition, practical experiences help students gain confidence and refine their ideas about who they are as evaluators. Peer learning provides an important source of support for students, and mentorship is also important, although a tricky balance exists between providing enough support and providing sufficient room for autonomy.

AB  - An important motivation for research in natural hazards is to reduce threats posed by natural disasters to at-risk communities. Yet, we rarely teach students how research may be used to reduce disaster risk in practice. The motivation for this study is to test the potential of service learning to impart students with both the scientific background and the skills necessary to navigate the real-world constraints of Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR). We present results from a service learning class taught jointly at Stanford University and Syiah Kuala University, Banda Aceh in the winter quarter of 2016 in collaboration with the Indonesian Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries. To reduce the potential bias implicit to a service learning approach, we modify the typical setup of service learning classes by collaborating not only with a service partner, but also with a local academic institution that we will refer to as our community partner. Our results suggest that the inclusion of a community partner may elevate the learning component of the class, as indicated by student self-assessments, but the class fell short of meeting the expectations of our service partner, the Indonesian Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries. We speculate that one quarter is not sufficient time to build an intellectual partnership with two international partners and to design a joint service project that is sufficiently developed to be actionable. In the future, we plan to extend the class over several quarters.

AB  - This chapter explains that service-learning is an integral part of nursing education, including community health nursing. The authors describe various community health nursing clinical experiences including health screenings, wellness clinics, patient education, and health education for a variety of community agencies and groups. They report that the nature of working with individuals and groups in care settings often challenge the students' personal belief systems. Common faculty and student challenges in these settings (e.g., culture shock, fear, ethnocentrism, cultural imposition, withdrawal, and the students' desire to rescue needy clients) are explored, as well as strategies that may prepare students for such encounters and challenges.

AB  - In this chapter, the author describes a critical focus of elementary teacher education programming is assisting preservice teachers to use literature and provide access to books as a cornerstone of reading development. In August 2007, Abramson Science and Technology Charter School opened in New Orleans-East, serving one of the areas most impacted by Hurricane Katrina. Housed in temporary buildings and run on generators until late fall 2007, the school had no library. This chapter highlights service, teaching and research efforts to establish classroom libraries at Abramson in a reciprocal and mutually beneficial service-learning project. The goal was two-fold: establish adequate, culturally sensitive classroom libraries, while involving education majors' opportunities to apply knowledge of quality literature in collecting and selecting books best suited for individual classrooms. Due to wide-spread support and generosity, 8,665 books were delivered to Abramson. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The past five years have seen a surge of popularity in sociology courses that deal with work, drawing students from a variety of majors & backgrounds & including many experiences as paid & volunteer workers. Drawing on Kolb's model of learning, techniques for incorporating student work experiences into the classroom activities of a sociology of work course are offered. The main disadvantage of an experiential approach is that the student worker may take his or her own job as an exemplar of the entire labor force without learning much from other students nor gaining a context for this experience. The techniques developed here are designed to overcome this disadvantage while incorporating the diversity of student work experience. The principal techniques discussed are the work inventory & related exercises, discussions of work depreciation, ethnographic analysis, games, & role playing.

AB  - Collaboration is crucial to success for citizens, workers and leaders in the multi-cultural, interdependent world of the 21st century. Many see service learning as a vehicle for promoting a collaborative mindset and skills, and are investing millions in proliferating these opportunities. And yet there is little research to inform ongoing development of programs to maximize this particular return on the investment. Past research suggests that collaborative strategies enter our repertoires in early adolescence. In interviews for this study, 92 middle school youth articulated 10,872 strategies for changing things they wished were different in their schools and communities. Only fifteen percent of these strategies involved collaboration. Yet more than 90 percent of study participants considered at least one collaborative strategy, reinforcing that they have the capacity, if not a propensity to do so. Half the study sample participated in a service learning program. Half did not. Using multiple regression analysis, I found positive effects of program participation on the frequency with which participants considered two types of strategies, both building blocks to collaboration. The effect of program participation on the first, persuading others to see one's point of view, was consistent across age. The effect on the second, taking in others' ideas to inform one's own view, was greater among older participants. Both these strategy types involve perspective coordination, a skill that young adolescents are in the process of developing, with the latter requiring a more complex form of that skill. This suggests that program participation boosted the frequency with which participants considered strategies they were ready to consider. Qualitative analysis of interviews in which eleven participants described their experiences in the program suggested that multiple opportunities to interact with diverse community members offered occasion to practice and come to value perspective coordination. And yet different individuals described somewhat different experiences in the program and exhibited different changes in the strategies they considered. This suggests we need to learn more about the interplay of multiple factors in order to maximize the potential of service learning programs to promote development of the collaborative mindset deemed crucial for success in the 21st century.

This assignment affords them the opportunity to take a deeper look at theory and health concepts learned throughout the semester and to see how it has informed their own lives. The challenge assignment is embedded into a health campaigns course that utilizes a service-learning model. In the course, students learn about social marketing and health communication theories while working with a community partner to develop a health campaign plan that can be implemented. They work to develop campaigns specific to their target audience by conducting formative research. Through classroom learning and individual research, students become aware of the many barriers that keep people from changing unhealthy habits. A list of references and suggested readings is included.

AB  - Service learning, the integration of community service & curricular content, is being embraced by sociologists in a variety of teaching settings. One of the primary challenges of service-learning pedagogy is incorporating the community-based experience into the curriculum. This article will center on the author's strategy for meeting this challenge. The Introduction to Sociology course employs a thematic approach in order to create a fully integrated experiential learning experience. The author used this highly adaptable approach successfully in two types of institutional settings. This article will describe the institutional contexts, course content & objectives, service-learning component, use of themes for integrating service & curriculum, & student outcomes. In addition, the author explores the potential pitfalls of this approach & suggests strategies for avoiding them. 38 References. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Growing interest in and support for service learning appears to spring from two opposite political perspectives. Liberals, anxious to retrieve the kind of idealism and concern for the public good that fed efforts such as the civil rights movement and the Peace Corps, see service learning as instilling these values in students today. Conservatives, who worry about the decline of individual responsibility and virtue in public life, find service congenial to orienting students toward lives of volunteerism that might lessen the need for formal government to address social needs. To some degree, these two impulses have shaped a consensus around the virtues of service learning for higher education today. Service learning may be defined as a community-service activity that relates directly to, and strengthens, the academic component of a specific area of study. Community service is defined as involvement in community issues with the purpose of achieving a public good (Morton 1993; Rein 1995). Service learning has three distinct components: 1. preparation that involves both understanding the organization's goals and objectives and acquiring the necessary skills for the service learning to be performed; 2. participation that involves the actual work performed at the organization; and 3. reflection that involves critical analysis of the experience through journal writing, class discussion, and/or a formal essay. Service learning enhances the academic experience because performance of the service is directly linked to the didactic material. It illuminates, enhances, and makes concrete the theories, concepts, and methods described in class. The pedagogical benefits of service learning include inspiring inquiry, empowering students, and moving from concrete experiences to abstract thinking. Service learning relates directly to social work because the service activities selected by the instructor and the students are within the purview of professional social work activities. The service-learning experiences across the four courses described in this chapter appear to be positive for a majority of students. These data on student satisfaction and student self-reported learning are corroborated in exit interviews with graduating seniors, who often explain to the program director that while the service-learning experiences were often difficult to perform, looking back, they were very useful. Areas needing improvement include: 1. better translation of theory into practice; 2. clearer connection between the service-learning activities and the course material; and 3. possible time/scheduling conflicts with the site. Faculty continue to be involved in weekly discussions regarding these issues, their satisfaction with the service-learning experiences, and their observations of student learning. Faculty agree that students become more active learners through the service-learning process and that the power differential in the classroom between faculty and students is reduced through service-learning activities. Faculty also remark on the positive relationship-building experiences for students performing off-campus service-learning activities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The present study integrates service learning into English as a Foreign Language (EFL) speaking class using Web 2.0 tools - YouTube and Facebook - as platforms. Fourteen undergraduate students participated in the study. The purpose of the service-learning project was to link service learning with oral communication training in an EFL speaking class by having each student create two YouTube videos in which they made informative presentations about the university (e.g., transportation system) and the city (e.g., sightseeing spots) in English to international students on campus. A Facebook community was established as a forum for students to share their videos with the international students and peers. The results suggest that the project enhanced EFL students' public speaking-related skills (e.g., idea and content development, and pronunciation), built their confidence in speaking English, and allowed them to develop their own learning process and strategies. Moreover, Web 2.0 tools endow service learning with new possibilities of reaching a greater number of the target audience and provide the members of the community with alternative means of communication.

AB  - We examine the political orientations and activities of women lay leaders (non-ordained) in religious. Loosened from the congregational and denominational strictures that bind clergy, especially female clergy, we expect that female lay leaders will be more willing to speak openly about political issues, and pursue ambitious political agendas, than their ordained counterparts. Using data from congregational surveys and elite interviews (both are drawn from evangelical and mainline Protestant churches in Northwest Arkansas), and anchoring our approach in social movement and interest groups theories, we address the following questions: How frequently do religious female lay leaders, compared to female clergy, participate in civic or political activities? How frequently do female lay leaders discuss politics while serving in their congregational capacities? Do female leaders â " lay vs. ordained - convert their resources (e.g., time, opportunities, skills, position, etc.) into civic engagement at differential rates depending upon their location in a congregationâ s hierarchy? In what manner and to what extent is their civic engagement shaped by religious tradition and gender identity? ..PAT.-Unpublished Manuscript [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Conference Papers -- Midwestern Political Science Association is the property of Midwestern Political Science Association and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

AB  - Drawing from their experiences teaching two different activism-focused writing courses, the authors consider the benefits, pitfalls, and potential dangers of activist writing pedagogy. Scott provides a retrospective on a rhetoric and writing course focused on the employment of digital rhetoric, while Katherine reflects on an activist-rhetoric course that culminated in the execution of an annual Take Back the Night rally. Despite the risk of "politicizing the classroom," the authors argue that activist pedagogy, when thoughtfully implemented, can help students (no matter their political leanings) learn how to write, act, and think--necessary skills for a democratic society. Yet, while both authors support activist-focused rhetoric and writing courses, they also examine the ethical, pedagogical, occupational, and even legal issues that might arise from teaching such courses.

AB  - Fieldwork has always been part of social work and an integral component of social work education. Fieldwork is based on the philosophy of 'learning by doing' and its purpose is fundamental to a sound education in social work. Fieldwork opportunities take the students to a vast variety of ground realities around the world. It is critically important for social work students to acquire, in a classroom environment, practice principles, values and ethics and the scientific basis for practice. Equally important is the need to apply the theoretical content covered in the classroom, to real life situations as part of a student's preparation to become a professional social worker. In this perspective began the evolution of field action projects (presently referred to as social labs or live labs) by the leading social work institutions in the country. These initiatives provide both meeting the needs of the target population and a platform for the students to practice. This paper looks into the major challenges faced by the students, teachers and the agencies/live labs in providing the training for the students. It also draws light on the different issues in the entire process of fieldwork in Kerala. Finally it also highlights the best practices that can be replicated for the benefit of the students and professionals.

AB  - Reviews the book, Changing people’s lives while transforming your own: Paths to social justice and global human rights by J. A. Kottler and M. Marriner (see record [rid]2009-03276-000[/rid]). An emphasis on service learning and global competency has been emerging in social work education in recent years, and the value of international experience on the critical thinking, academic learning, and personal and moral development of learners is receiving greater attention from educators. Into this convergence of events arrives Kottler and Marriner’s Changing People’s Lives While Transforming Your Own: Paths to Social Justice and Global Human Rights. Intended as a supplementary textbook for students in social sciences and the helping professions, the authors seek to 'inspire students to connect with their deepest longings to help those who are most in need'. This book is written in an informal and engaging style, filled with anecdotes and commentary by those who accidentally or intentionally engaged in social justice efforts in developing nations. To that end, the focus of the book is on challenging the ethnocentrism and world view of the readership, forthrightly conveying the hardships and opportunities of international service work, and inspiring students to become globally engaged; and does not contribute empirical evidence of social change or educational outcomes. This supplementary text is a worthwhile addition to social justice courses in a variety of disciplines. With its emphasis on cultural sensitivity, open-mindedness, and shared learning, it would be particularly valuable in courses designed to prepare students for an international service learning experience.

AB  - Objective. To evaluate a service-learning program that involved PharmD students at Duquesne University delivering the presentation, ``The Neuroscience Behind Drugs of Abuse,{''} to area middle school and high school students, to dissuade these teenagers from experimenting with illicit drugs. Methods. Student presenters administered exit surveys to students and teachers in the audience to assess the presentations, kept a reflective journal of the presentations and interactions with the student audience, regularly met with faculty mentors to refine the presentation and compare experiences with other students, and wrote a summative paper on an issue pertaining to substance abuse among adolescents. Results. The middle school and high school students were interested in, appreciated, and learned from the presentations. All participating schools ({''}community partners{''}) indicated their interest in hosting the presentation again. PharmD students communicated their enthusiasm for the project and recognized the civic contribution, leading many to continue their involvement in a volunteer capacity after satisfying their curricular requirements. Conclusion. This service-learning project educated Greater Pittsburgh middle and high school students on how drugs of abuse cause both euphoria and addiction at the molecular level. This approach allows teenagers to make a logic-based, informed decision on whether experimentation with such drugs is worth the risk.

Curriculum-based service-learning, which integrates service activities into chemistry courses, has become increasingly popular as a learning and teaching tool. It provides benefits to students ranging from the application of course concepts into real-world experiences to improved course-related skills and enhanced cognition. Students can also strengthen their connections to the college and the instructor as they increase their appreciation of the need for community engagement. Also cited are the issues' implications for chemistry and chemical education.

AB  - Objectives: This article presents a systematic review of the literature on evaluative studies of truancy interventions. Method: Included studies evaluating truancy interventions appearing in peer-reviewed academic journals from 1990 to 2007. Findings: In total, 16 studies were assessed. Eight studies used group comparison designs and eight studies used one-group pretest/posttest designs. Studies varied on sample sizes, definitions of truant behavior, focus of interventions, and dependent measures. Conclusions: Six studies produced useful and promising interventions including contingency management, school reorganization, punitive measures, community partnerships, and family-oriented activities. The substantial methodological shortcomings, inconsistent definitions, and lack of replication demonstrate a need for more and better evaluation studies to provide a more definitive knowledge base to guide effective truancy interventions for practitioners.

Agency supervisors' decisions about the curricular experiences of students had a significant impact on the social justice aims and intentions of the projects designed by the teachers. Consequently, it is crucial for schools and teachers to take into consideration the community supervisors' perspectives and interpretations of social justice and invite them into a collaborative partnership throughout the process of structuring service-learning experiences.

AB  - This qualitative study addressed the formation of student identity (servant and civic) as well as how students formed community through experiencing difference in a service-learning classroom. An interpretive qualitative study of five high school students was conducted in a service-learning program at Willow Falls High School, a public high school in Ohio. Interviews, journals, observations, student photographs, and contextual artifacts were collected and analyzed with a critically oriented, interpretivist researcher lens. The findings included: 1) Participants' experiences in a service-learning program contributed to shifts in how they viewed themselves and their classmates as well as their relationship as servants to those they served. 2) Aiming for "buy-in," teachers challenged participants through program specific-aims to think about their position and context and were encouraged to push out of their comfort zones in order to do so. 3) Participants were purposefully challenged to accept exposure to difference in a variety of capacities and internalized these challenges. 4) Participants found a variety of outlets for community-making in their service-learning experiences; in group/out group distinctions, class sections, site experiences, and bonding activities. 5) Citizenship and democracy were linked with service work in an uneven fashion, with some participants making direct connections while others made partial or nascent links. 6) Personal growth and community change for participants were incomplete. Teachers and students recognized that there were barriers to fully achieving program goals. The findings of the study offer implications for future research in service-learning as well as for teachers, administrators, and, stakeholders interested in implementing service-learning programs in their schools. Through service-learning and experiences with difference, students formed servant and civic identities and wrestled with community formation and democratic thinking.

AB  - This research study examined the effect of international short-term mission trips on the intercultural sensitivity of secondary Christian school students. Christian schools utilize mission trips as a strategy to prepare students for an increasingly global, interdependent world. Research literature purports the short-term mission trip as one model for facilitating a higher degree of intercultural sensitivity through an experiential framework. Current literature contains studies that examine the effect of mission trips for post-secondary students and for younger students through mission organizations, but no empirical study explores mission trips organized by a secondary school. A qualitative case study framed this research, providing an appropriate methodology for exploring the abstract human quality of intercultural sensitivity. Fourteen senior students attending two rural Christian secondary schools and participating in two similarly designed international mission trips were randomly selected for the study. Reflexive photography was a key methodology in unraveling the underlying themes of the participants' experiences. All participants described a substantial impact from the trip. The effect was observed at both a corporate and personal level. Students noted changes in their worldview, attitudes toward life and possessions, and an increased empathy for others. Cognitive dissonance facilitated the changes described by participants. Three themes that illuminated the multifaceted change participants perceived were developing relationships, awareness of poverty, and serving others. Students were affected by their relationships with children, local adults, and classmates. An awareness of poverty evoked much reflection on the host culture as well as the participant's home culture. Serving others provided the framework for developing relationships and the awareness of poverty. These themes were generally convergent with themes from related studies. One divergent finding was the impact of classmates on participants. Students described a personal impact from their observation of colleagues during the trip. A discussion of the findings and implications for practice and further research conclude the dissertation.

AB  - This manuscript provides the results of a comparative study conducted in the USA with counseling, psychology, and education graduate students in which multicultural competencies were taught using the traditional on-campus and international study abroad course formats. Data were collected via the Miville-Guzman Universality-Diversity Scale, a 45-item self-report of openness towards diverse clients, along with qualitative analysis of two permanent products: cultural activity paper (framed as analysis of cultural interactions) and Reaction Journal (an open-ended reflection on the content of class lectures, readings, presentations, and discussions). A total of 29 graduate students from diverse backgrounds were sampled through two semesters. The results revealed that compared to peers taught via the traditional on-campus format, students enrolled in the international study abroad course reported more willingness to learn and interact with diverse populations. Further, these students evidenced more growth relative to empathy towards diverse clientele, insight into cultural viewpoints, as well as a deeper understanding of their own cultural biases. The manuscript provides the study results; a brief overview of how the international study abroad and the on-campus courses were taught and organized, along with the pros and cons of each course format. It also offers a list of recommendations for the professions of counseling, psychology, and education in terms of the cutting edge practices relative to implementation, instruction, and delivery of multicultural competencies.

AB  - The general education curriculum comprises more than just the academic courses students take. The wide range of extracurricular clubs, sports teams, performing arts programs, student government positions, career development activities, service-learning projects, and other school-sponsored activities offered in middle and high schools provide a rich range of valuable learning opportunities. These activities can shape students' career paths; help them develop the communication, team-building, and leadership skills needed for the world of work; and link what is learned in the classroom to students' everyday lives. Schools offer these opportunities because of the contributions they make to a well-rounded transition experience for all youth. For students with significant disabilities--such as intellectual disabilities or multiple disabilities--a broad range of school experiences are especially valuable for increasing functional life skills, peer relationships, self-determination, and a sense of belonging. Yet, for many youth with disabilities--and a substantial number of students without disabilities--involvement in the array of social and learning opportunities available within their middle or high school can be quite limited. "Opportunity mapping" offers a promising approach for engaging youth with disabilities more fully in the life of their schools. Every middle and high school is full of rich and diverse opportunities for youth to engage in activities that will equip them with the skills, experiences, and knowledge they need to transition to adulthood. The process of opportunity mapping also enables self-assessment of a school's strengths in terms of its available offerings to students, as well as the gaps and barriers that are preventing students with disabilities from participating. This article describes the steps and strategies schools can take to more intentionally connect youth with disabilities to the full range of experiences and opportunities that constitute middle and high school life.

AB  - Adolescents in the United States have become increasingly involved in activities that trouble their sense of well-being and, in some cases, place their lives at risk. At the same time, regressive and reductive calls for school reform in this country are not only gaining currency but also alienating large numbers of students from schools. As these events unfold, teachers are being asked to prepare themselves to reform the practice of education in professional development programs that do not speak meaningfully to the challenges they face in classrooms. The Write for Your Life Project (WFYL), developed in response to this set of social and educational problems, invites teachers and students at sites in ten states to develop, in dialogue, inquiry-based literacy curricula designed to address what students perceive to be challenges to their health and well-being in their local communities. Students use the English language arts to identify, research, seek funding for, conduct and evaluate service learning projects that address these challenges. Teachers and students involved in the project across the country consult with one another, primarily via electronic conversations conducted on WFYL Project teacher and student listservs. In this dissertation, after I present contextual material, I discuss the WFYL teachers' listserv conversation. The log reports of that conversation--what I call an electronic dialogue journal--represent five years of dialogue in which WFYL teachers developed a strong sense of community by affirming and confirming their goals for the WFYL Project and the importance of the network in which they have developed productive patterns of leadership and a shared understanding of what makes their network valuable to them. Within the network that WFYL participants created on-line in dialogue with one another, teachers have offered one another what the literature identifies as "authentic" professional development opportunities. In so doing, I argue, they have offered our profession an example of professional development that appears to support classroom teachers in their daily practice, and they have offered teacher educators an example of how contemporary technology may be used to enhance in-service teacher education.

AB  - The workforce in the United States is becoming more diverse. To help students prepare to work and live in a diverse society, the author developed a lower-division course called "Communication Ethics and Diversity." After this course, students should be able to: (1) define diversity and communication ethics; (2) understand a variety of approaches to communication ethics, including teleology, deontology, dialogic ethics, and post-modern ethics; (3) apply ethical theories to a variety of communication contexts, including the media, interpersonal relationships, political communication, and communication technology; (4) describe their personal code of ethics as it relates to communication ethics and diversity; (5) compare and contrast their beliefs about communication ethics and diversity to those of their peers; (6) justify their personal code of ethics based on ethical theories and terms; and (7) apply their knowledge of communication ethics and diversity to experiences they have in the community. Over the course of the semester, students addressed these learning objectives through readings, class discussions, essay exams, and, most importantly, through an integrated set of assignments that linked students' work in groups on a community-service-learning project with a group blog and an individual research paper. In this article, the author describes the assignments and how they relate to the learning objectives; she also provides a rationale for linking the assignments. (Contains 1 note.)

AB  - This book concerns potential and actual uses of service learning as an instructional methodology in teacher education. Section 1 discusses how service and learning are primary to practically all roles teachers play. Section 2, a rationale for service learning and teacher education, shows consistency with Goals 2000, school-to-work transition, and character education. Section 3 describes components of service learning in teacher education: planning, implementation and project monitoring, reflection and celebration, and evaluation and reporting. Section 4 addresses issues and challenges--collaboration, faculty professional development, funding, scheduling and transportation, and curriculum integration. Section 5 offers teacher education students' opinions of service learning experiences: opportunities to learn about people from different cultures; its support of individual growth; and insights gained into the persona of being a professional educator. Section 6 describes promising practices: integrating service learning in the student teaching experience or throughout the internship year, seminars, and journals. Section 7 discusses benefits in three areas: students, faculty, and program functioning. Section 8 addresses three levels of assessment: documenting the status of service learning, assessing its effectiveness in teacher education, and evaluating its impact. Section 9 offers possibilities for putting service learning into teacher education programs. Contains 18 references. (YLB)

AB  - This research examined a service-learning program that gave medical students the opportunity to gain both primary care clinical experience and exposure to a medically underserved population. The purpose of the present study was to investigate changes in psychosocial characteristics such as self-esteem, empathy, intentions to help in the future and motivations for volunteering, as well as changes in attitudes regarding medically underserved populations, prenatal care issues and social commitment. The sample consisted of 26 first-year medical students who were participants in a program that paired them with pregnant females who were generally low-income, and some of whom were adolescents. The medical students followed the women through their pregnancies by going to the prenatal appointments, offering support and information, and attending the births. Pre-questionnaires were administered to the students before they met with the pregnant women and post-questionnaires were administered shortly after the women gave birth. Two-factor, repeated measures ANOVAs (gender X time) were used to analyze the data. Results did not show significant effects for gender, time or their interaction for self-esteem, empathic concern or future helping. However, there was a significant main effect for gender for the intention to serve the medically underserved with male medical students indicating a greater intention to serve than female medical students. In terms of the motivation to volunteer there was a significant two-way interaction between gender and time for the enhancement subscale. Examination of the cell means indicated that while female medical students' enhancement motivation decreased across time, male medical students' enhancement motivation increased. No effects were significant for the social commitment, attitudes toward practice in medically underserved areas, and attitudes toward issues in prenatal care measures. Since many medical schools are still in the initial stages of integrating service-learning programs into their curricula, it may be too early to draw conclusions about the effects of such programs on medical students. Although medical students did not change significantly over the course of the service-learning experience, they were not negatively affected in terms of their psychosocial characteristics or attitudes by participating in service-learning.

AB  - Team-teaching an interdisciplinary service learning course with an applied international education component poses many challenges for instructors, students, and community partners. Our experience formed the basis of a case study that allowed us to analyze the challenges of bringing together participants with diverging theoretical approaches. The course, HIV/AIDS in East Africa, brought together students and instructors from the disciplines of journalism and mass communication, and political science. It consisted of a team-taught semester-long class, a three week trip to Tanzania, and two weeks of post-trip production work. The class had two main goals: 1) provide students with a knowledge base about HIV/AIDS and poverty issues in sub-Saharan Africa; and 2) prepare them for a service learning trip that combined field work through participant observation and documentary production to write grants, create promotional materials, and produce a web site for our partner organization, the Ilula Orphan Program. Although we, as instructors, agreed upon our goals and plan for the course, our different disciplinary perspectives and those of our students became apparent on the first day of class. The journalism and mass communication group interpreted the issues through the lens of constructing compelling personal narratives while the interpretation of the political science group focused on the importance of power structures as a means of understanding and representation. Through hours of debate and discussion in the classroom and in the field, we realized this creative tension could not be resolved fully. We did, however, find common ground and this provided opportunities to interrogate the weaknesses and strengths of our own approaches and enabled us to apply multiple strategies in confronting complex problems.

AB  - Early childhood mental health consultation (ECMHC) is a framework that continues to expand as students' social-emotional needs emerge at younger ages. The present systematic review examines the extant literature surrounding the use of ECMHC and behavioral consultation in addressing mental health concerns and challenging behaviors in preschool students. Findings associated with this systematic review suggest that ECMHC could be a promising practice for targeting internalizing and externalizing behavioral concerns in prekindergarten students across a variety of settings. However, more research is needed in the areas of mental health/behavioral consultation and disciplinary disproportionality, as well as on the impact of such practices on preschool children of color. Implications for school psychologists are discussed, as are disciplinary practices when providing ECMHC and behavioral consultation services with students of diverse racial, ethnic, and cultural backgrounds.

AB  - Over the last 25 years, the environmental justice movement has emerged from its earliest focus on US social movements combating environmental racism to an influential global phenomenon. Environmental justice research has also undergone spectacular growth and diffusion in the last two decades. From its earliest roots in sociology, the field is now firmly entrenched in several different academic disciplines including geography, urban planning, public health, law, ethnic studies, and public policy. Environmental justice refers simultaneously to a vibrant and growing academic research field, a system of social movements aimed at addressing various environmental and social inequalities, and public policies crafted to ameliorate conditions of environmental and social injustice. Academia is responding to this social problem by offering courses under various rubrics, such as 'Race, Poverty and the Environment, Environmental Racism, Environmental Justice', 'Urban Planning, Public Health And Environmental Justice', and so on. Courses on environmental justice offer students opportunities to critically and reflexively explore issues of race and racism, social inequality, social movements, public/environmental health, public policy and law, and intersections of science and policy. Integrating modules on environmental justice can help professors engage students in action research, service learning, and more broadly, critical pedagogy. This article offers an overview of the current state of the field and offers a range of resources for teaching concepts of environmental racism, inequality and injustice in the classroom.

Questionnaires and focus group data were analyzed to measure changes in PST competency before and after experiences in NYC schools. Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test revealed statistically significant improvements in pre- (M=59.18, SD=15.04) and post- (M=68.64, SD = 14.41) scores for Cultural Competency Behavior; yielding a medium intervention effect (d =.306). Non-significant differences between pre- (M=63.47, SD=4.33) and post- (M=65.23, SD=5.50) scores for Cultural Awareness and Sensitivity were reported. Qualitative themes include urban culture shock;Teacher and student motivations; Creative lesson planning; and Perception of future teaching practices.

AB  - This paper describes the philosophy, structure and results of a course, Visual Sociology, in which students are taught sociology through filmmaking. Students develop a sociologically aware visual literacy from discussing documentary films that inquire into issues of social justice and inequality. After thinking through problems of sociological narrative and of research methods, students make their own films and write about their research process. Students address, in their films and papers, research issues such as a) the development of a research question, b) ethics of filming, c) problems of rapport with persons filmed, d) interviewing techniques and e) editing raw footage into a sociologically meaningful story. With the groundwork laid by this course, students have gone on to make sociological films for their capstone thesis. Student work is evaluated to discover the quality of sociological understanding resulting from experiential learning through filmmaking. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Privilege, Power, and Public Health Programs: A Student Perspective on Deconstructing Institutional Racism in Community Service Learning

AB  - The Association of Schools of Public Health has identified ``diversity and culture{''} as 1 of 7 crosscutting competencies that public health students are expected to achieve. This competency is traditionally incorporated into the curriculum through a community service-learning (CSL) component that aims to expose students to racial/ethnic health disparities. However, this model of CSL is problematic because although students are directly engaging with community members, it does not ensure long-term sustainable changes or benefits for the host community. Moreover, academic institutions have developed significant critiques of traditional CSL models where white middle-class students engage with low-income clients and communities of color, potentially reinforcing Eurocentric power and privilege. As such, public health programs require a shift in both pedagogy and curricula that more directly addresses underlying institutional racism in health disparities. Consistent with the principles of public health, a social justice framework is imperative in teaching cultural competency and should facilitate discussion of racial injustice and privilege in the students' own lives. This brief presents an autobiographical personal narrative of my experiences with CSL as a racial/ethnic minority student in a California graduate school of public health. Although autoethnography is inherently limited, this brief highlights my observations of the limitations of the service-learning model to adequately educate students on the intersection of racism and health outcomes. In addition, the brief includes suggestions for creating inclusive curricula that critically examine issues of privilege, oppression, and power dynamics related to race/ethnicity.

AB  - The concept of dialogue, from its etymological underpinnings to the philosophical perspectives of Martin Bober and Paulo Freire, suggests that when dialogue is understood as an authentic encounter with another person, it has all important role to play in foreign-language instruction. Adopting a service-learning pedagogy, even in elementary and intermediate courses when learners' skills are limited, creates a space for authentic dialogue and enhances the learning experience. Dialogue as used in this article includes an understanding of others that goes beyond language and offers not only a real-life interaction for learners, but also presents transformative potential. Examples from intermediate students' reflections demonstrate language level and support the claim that authentic encounters are possible.

AB  - Engineers Without Borders USA has been operating and evolving since 2002. As an organization with many student and professional chapters working around the world, EWBUSA has put in place structures to review proposed community programs as well as specific engineering projects. The Application Review Committee, or ARC, considers new program proposals put forward by communities, while Technical Advisory Committees, or TACs, evaluate implementation plans for infrastructure projects. ARC and TAC members are volunteers with relevant technical knowledge and experience, many of whom are also EWBUSA chapter members. EWB-USA technical and chapter relations staff review progress at key points in the project cycle; however, this paper reviews the mainly volunteer efforts at two important moments in the project process.

AB  - This study examined the impact of voice-recorded reflections on cognitive presence in a hybrid course, guided by the research question: How does the use of voice-recorded reflections impact critical thinking and deeper learning for students participating in a service learning experience? Participants of this study included preservice teachers who engaged in a service-learning project where they provided service to young children while developing skills needed to become an excellent teacher. After the service experience, students were asked to participate in a voice-recorded reflection answering specific survey items that were designed to demonstrate critical thinking and deeper learning. Using the community of inquiry framework and specifically examining cognitive presence, student responses to voice-recorded reflections were coded and analyzed. Several implications for pedagogical practices are highlighted, including the use of reflection to develop the growing professional.

AB  - As social media becomes a more potent force in society, particularly for younger generations, the role in activism has been contested. This qualitative study examines 35 interviews with students regarding their perceptions of the use of social media in social change, their perceptions of activists, and their level of self-identification as an activist. Data suggest that students use media to engage in offline participation in activist causes because online interactions present a "safe" place to begin their involvement. Findings also point to the unified pejorative connotations of the term "activist", yet also demonstrate ways that students transform the negative stereotype of activists in a way that creates a more positive image. Most participants in the study were able to see sufficient positive characteristics in behaviors they associated with activism to prompt the students to identify themselves as "activists" or "aspiring activists". We offer 3 practical recommendations for teachers who seek to increase service learning vis a vis activism in their classrooms.

AB  - This study relied on the reflections of 12 novice English language teachers and 3 supervisors to explore the status quo of teacher training in 3 private language institutes with headquarters in Tehran and about 420 language schools throughout the country. Extensive data collection was done through semistructured interviews, focus group discussions, and teacher diaries as well as informal peer interviews and observation of occasional meetings of supervisors and teachers. To analyze data, an inductive analysis procedure was used. Findings revealed that current language teacher training courses in the context of concern may require different types of improvements with regard to theorypractice gap, supervised in-service workshops, reflective teaching skills, use of technology, and teachers' experiential learning.

AB  - Introduction Occupational therapy programs include practice education, which is a vital aspect of professional practice preparation. We evaluated the effectiveness of the Community-Academia Student Tutoring program for enhancing occupational therapy students' perceived readiness for their practice placement, thus reducing their feelings of anxiety. Method The study included 84 first-year undergraduate occupational therapy students aged 21-35 years, of whom 43 participated in the Community-Academia Student Tutoring group program and the rest comprised the control group. Participants completed the Student Self-Competency and Readiness for Fieldwork questionnaire prior to their first practice placement. Findings Anxiety was related to the Student Self-Competency and Readiness for Fieldwork's components and total score. The Community-Academia Student Tutoring group scored significantly higher (p < .05) than the controls in the Evaluation and Communication with Patients components of the questionnaire, after controlling for anxiety level.

AB  - Objective: This study focuses on the design of an entry-level educational model of culturally responsive care in occupational therapy embedded in service-learning (CRCOT-SL) that is perceived as clear, relevant, evidence-based, and useful by occupational therapy educators. The purpose of the model is to guide OT educators in teaching students to enable occupational participation and social inclusion in cross-cultural encounters. Method. The design consisted in defining the areas of the model and the components of each area, and articulating the learning process embedded in service-learning. A formative evaluation of CRCOT-SL was then performed using survey methods to collect feedback from 30 OT educators regarding the clarity, relevance, evidence-based constructs, and usefulness of CRCOT-SL. Results: CRCOT-SL was perceived to be clear, relevant, evidence-based, and useful to 81.5% of the OT educators who participated in the study. Minor modifications to the model were completed based on the educator's feedback. Conclusions: CRCOT-SL is intended to respond not only to the dynamic, multicultural, and diverse environments in which practitioners currently practice but to the future needs of a global community facing social, political, economic, and environmental issues that will continue to affect dramatically people's living conditions and occupational needs.

AB  - Modern learning psychology places an emphasis on the ability of teachers to promote their students' social and emotional learning (SEL) and living a good life. Research on precisely how teachers promote SEL and well-being among their students, however, remains scarce. This study focused on evaluating the Lions Quest teaching workshop (LQ), which aims to improve the knowledge and skills of teachers in SEL and to promote a healthy and meaningful life among students. In total, 153 Finnish teachers participated in LQ. We compared these to 61 Finnish teachers who did not participate in the LQ training as well as a second comparison group consisting of 46 Finnish teachers to investigate the possible effects of pre-testing. We collected data from the intervention group before and after the training and from the first comparison group at approximately the same time points. Data from the second comparison group was collected only once. Using the repeated measures general linear model, we analyzed teachers' readiness to promote the LQ goals from two perspectives, namely from participants' experienced importance of those goals and their perceived competence in promoting them. In addition, we evaluated task values among participants. Teachers participating in LQ rated the goals as more important and relevant after receiving training. Furthermore, participants from the intervention group felt more competent in skills related to the LQ goals than the comparison groups. This study adds to both the theoretical and practical development of teachers' skills in contemporary contexts.

AB  - This article shares the experience of the development, implementation, and evaluation of a service learning course that aims at promoting intergenerational learning between university students and older adults through engagement in community service. It is through service learning that the course purports to achieve intergenerational learning and foster mutually beneficial relationships that are stimulating for both the young and old. Intergenerational service learning is a partnership based on reciprocity and mutuality involving people of different ages where the generations work together to gain skills, values, and knowledge. To examine the effects of such experiences on both the young and old participants in the course, a small-scale evaluative study was conducted on the group of students and elders who took part in the community service project, which is an integral part of the intergenerational service learning course in question. This article reports the findings on the outcomes of cross-generational interactions and makes recommendations for enhancing intergenerational service learning opportunities based on the evaluative feedback from the study.

AB  - This article reports a mixed methods study on the contribution of various aspects of pre-service student teachers' learning in initial teacher education (ITE) to their professional competence in a Five-year Bachelor of Education Programme in Hong Kong. Special attention is given to how student teachers' non-formal learning in higher education contributes to their professional competence, an under-researched area in teacher education. A total of 282 student teachers participated in the quantitative survey, 18 of whom were interviewed. Although Undergraduate Learning Experience: Formal Learning and Non-formal Learning was not the most highly rated factor, multiple regression indicated that it was the only ITE professional learning factor that significantly predicted all dimensions of professional competence. This supports the hypothesis that non-formal learning as a part of learning in higher education makes a significant contribution to student teachers' professional competence. The qualitative findings showed that non-formal learning provided opportunities for service learning, co-curricular activities, and student exchange programmes with different objects of engagement. Student teachers constructed pedagogical content knowledge, general pedagogical knowledge, and knowledge of context through hands-on experiences, professional dialogue with practitioners, and observations of others' practice. Such knowledge contributed to their competence in classroom teaching and to work in schools. Implications for ITE are discussed.

AB  - Although field education is in itself a pedagogical approach, other pedagogies can assist in and strengthen the field- learning experience. One such pedagogy is service learning. Service learning has been described as an experiential teaching approach that engages students in addressing community needs. Additionally, the service must support learning objectives within the course, as students reflect on their experience related to course objectives and reach a broader understanding of their profession and community life. Service learning can be offered as a component of field education via a service- learning capstone project (SLCP) that is competency-based. This article will examine the extant literature on service learning within the social work curriculum. Subsequently, a pedagogical model will be presented that embeds an SLCP within a BSW field practicum. Instructions, examples of completed SLCPs, an evaluative format for an SLCP presentation, and evaluative tools to measure impact of SLCPs on students and agencies are presented.

AB  - Demographic trends related to the baby-boomer generation suggest that the future will necessitate significant increases to the workforce serving this population. Recreational-therapy services are no exception, as this area of practice ties directly to the anticipated health-care and quality-of-life needs of this growing segment of society. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of a 30-hr service-learning project on recreational-therapy students' preferences regarding future employment in settings that serve older adults. Participants were a convenience sample of 23 recreational-therapy students who participated in a 30-hr service-learning project over the course of one semester. At the beginning and end of the semester, participants completed a single-item questionnaire asking them to rank-order their preferences regarding the client populations they would like to work with in the future. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was utilized to determine changes in student preferences. Results indicated that prior to the service-learning project, older adults were the least desired population among five available options; however, after the service-learning program they were identified as the second most desired population. Findings suggest that participation in a service-learning program can increase recreational-therapy students' relative preference for working with older adults and should be considered when developing or revising academic programs.

AB  - Medical education shapes the values, attitudes, and behaviors of future physicians. Service Learning (SL) has emerged as an innovation to both the formal and informal medical education curricula. This study examines, from the perspective of medical students, and by applying a sociological framework for medical education, the role of SL which promotes preventive health practice. First, it explores the dynamics of the bureaucratization of one SL program at Dartmouth Medical School, called "Partners in Health Education." The program places students in public schools to work with teachers on the delivery of health education and prevention programs. Second, it considers the impact of this preventive health SL experience on medical student socialization into the medical profession. The study employs the analysis of 36 interviews, medical student journals and papers, program evaluation data, and observation. Students in this study adopt two different student roles corresponding to their experiences in the formal basic science curricula, and the more informal service learning environment. The study describes the relationships between student roles, status and student culture, student-run service vs. administration-run service learning programs, and factors which contribute to creating norms which support service. Beneficial outcomes in this program did not depend on a prior intention to do service, though latent and predisposing values and attitudes supported service work. Three major outcomes resulted from participation: communication skills, the use of developmentally appropriate health education strategies, and the recognition of social context as it relates to health and disease prevention. Students participated in service for three major reasons: to contribute to social action, for personal well-being, and for the educational experience. Intentionally or not, the decision to participate in service inevitably influences the educational experience of the medical student. A framework explaining the links between service and the academic program, through applied and extended learning, is presented. The perception that time in service was producing an impact, including indicators of impact on themselves and others, are described. Students' perceptions of the values of service, service in the curriculum, training, relationships in the program, and delivery of health education are discussed.

AB  - This article describes our first year's educational activity of a new course: 'Integrated learning-III: Science for Daily Living', using web-based service-learning that commenced April 2009 for freshmen and sophomore students. It was developed through action research in 2002. The course aims were: (1) introduce freshmen to basic understanding of volunteering in health and community; (2) support learning through volunteer activity experiences; and (3) strengthen awareness of social responsibility as a community member. While 34 students registered, only 18 (53%) completed this course. The steps of learning included: e-learning on health volunteers and sending learning-logs; participating in volunteers activities; sending a daily log about volunteer activities and meeting with faculty. The total of 130 student-outcome daily logs were submitted. Students' evaluated their satisfaction of this subject on average as 8.5 point with 10-point scale (1 lowest, 10 highest. Students evaluated the subject using 4-point Likert scale (4, highest. The highly items evaluated were: obtained 'new perspectives' (M=3.92), and 'learning motivation' (M=3.92). The items evaluated poorly were: 'use of educational resource' (M=3.15) and 'teaching methods' (Mean=3.33). Although students completing the course were satisfied, approximately half of registered students did not complete the course. Further improvement of this course is needed in order to increase the completion rate and to enable and support students becoming good citizen working for their own community.

AB  - Teacher education programs face significant challenges in preparing future teachers for diverse classroom settings. Rising student socioeconomic and ethnic diversity is sharply juxtaposed against a relatively homogenous preservice teacher population. This article advances arguments that support the incorporation of service-learning experiences into New Zealand Preservice Teacher Education programs to mediate the ethnic, cultural, and socioeconomic polarization of pupils and their teachers by providing additional preparation for teaching in disadvantaged school contexts. The benefits of including service learning into New Zealand teacher education programs will be discussed as they relate to best practices for preservice teachers and by association the schools and pupils they serve.

AB  - This article presents information on a study which described the role of student affairs professionals in building campus community through work with natural and service-learning groups. Building campus community has long been a goal of higher education that has increased in importance and in challenge over the past decade. Diversity among today's student body has made the building of campus community particularly challenging. The majority of college students are commuters who typically have competing demands of multiple life roles and whose college experience is likely to be very different from that of resident students. Another category of students that is increasing is non-degree seeking students; it is estimated that 25% of postbaccalaureate students and 19% of students in community colleges are non-degree-seeking. Technology presents challenges to campus community as well. The growth of student interest and involvement in the Internet has led to concerns that students will choose to interact on-line, rather than face to face, even with fellow students who may live down the hail or across the street.

AB  - Fostering Healthy Futures (FHF) is a randomized controlled trial of an intervention for preadolescent youth placed in foster care because of maltreatment. As part of the FHF program, graduate students spend sixteen to twenty hours per week mentoring two youths in foster care and receiving intensive training and supervision. During summer and fall 2009, fifty of the fifty-two mentors who participated in the FHF program between summers 2002 and 2008 completed an online survey. Almost all reported that their participation in the FHF program was helpful or very helpful in training them to work with high-risk children and families, diverse communities, multiple systems, and other professionals. Qualitative analyses of mentors' responses to open-ended questions yielded several salient themes. (Contains 2 tables.)

AB  - Higher education institutions are increasingly using service-learning opportunities within their courses, as well as creating service-learning programs for their students. Research studies abound on the benefits of this type of learning paradigm. Service-learning has the capability to benefit higher education institutions, faculty members, the students, and the communities they serve. Considering how valuable students are in the service-learning process, this study examined student perceptions of service-learning at their institutions. Specifically, it examined whether students from different types of higher education institutions had differing perceptions regarding institutional factors related to service-learning. The five research questions that guided this quantitative study included: 1) How do students rate the importance of institutional factors such as mission and vision, institutional leadership, faculty support, and financial support for community initiatives for service-learning or community based learning at their institutions? 2) What are the costs of service-learning or community based learning as perceived by students across different genders, majors, academic year, ages, races, and religions? 3) What are the benefits of service-learning or community based learning as perceived by students across different genders, majors, academic year, ages, races, and religions? 4) Do students across different genders, majors, academic year, ages, races, and religions plan to participate in service-learning opportunities in the future? and 5) Do students’ perceived costs, benefits, and future participation in service differ across geographic areas based on median income levels and population sizes? The results of this study, its limitations, and impact on higher education are discussed, as well as future directions for service-learning policy and practice.

AB  - This paper presents the case of a service-learning art experience in an after-school housing development program. Beginning with a dialogue concerning peace and how it can become part of their world, children and pre-service teachers explored and connected the idea of peace through symbols, metaphor and idealism in works of art. A critical and reflective account of this experience demonstrates the ways that young children and pre-service art teachers can benefit from meaningful and socially relevant service-learning activities.

AB  - University students who were involved in a community service field placement completed the Inventory of Service Experience (ISE), a measure that was designed to assess the extent to which they felt supported by family, friends, and the organizations with which they worked; and the extent to which they experienced positive outcomes (e.g., enhanced skills, a feeling of “having made a difference”) in their community service setting. Students who had a more supportive and positive experience, as assessed by the ISE, were more likely to have continued to work as volunteers in the setting 2 months after they had completed their course requirements. The implications of these results for community service programs are discussed.

AB  - The aim of this action-research project was to evaluate the impact of high school students' involvement in community-oriented, art-based work in the social studies. In Detroit, high school students engaged in persuasive writing and design while exploring community issues. The project culminated in the installation of student artwork on a billboard in the city's cultural center. Mixed methods were employed to evaluate the project; forty-seven students completed surveys at its conclusion. The findings suggest that creative projects with real-world applications are motivational, and they promote civic education. The majority of the students reported that their awareness of community issues had increased. This study has implications for the implementation of projects for democratic education and service learning, arts integration in the social studies, and the use of authentic assessments in contextual, culturally responsive teaching.

AB  - Background: Service-learning is an established pedagogical approach to nursing education found primarily in community nursing. With changing health care landscapes, the expansion of service-learning projects throughout the nursing program provides opportunities to enrich assessment and critical thinking and amplify exposure to determinants of health. Method: Implementing service-learning in foundational nursing courses allows students to be challenged with the application of complex care management within a context of caring, cultural competence, social responsibility, and self-care initiatives. Results: Integrating service-learning throughout the nursing curriculum has the potential to make positive, sustainable changes within a community, while simultaneously preparing students to view clients holistically, think critically, and develop cultural competence. Conclusion: Enhancing nursing curriculum by integrating service-learning opportunities can strengthen the learning experience and foster concepts of caring, social responsibility, cultural competence, and self-care. Working with community leaders from diverse groups can lead to sustainable projects that simultaneously benefit the community and nursing education.

AB  - The authors examined students’ developmental readiness for productively negotiating the disorienting dilemmas and dissonance they experienced during an international service-learning experience. Using a case study methodology, researchers collected data from a diverse group composed of 7 graduate students and 5 undergraduates who participated in a pre-departure course and 3-week immersion in Ecuador, which instructors framed with a critical service-learning pedagogy. Findings emphasize how the complexities of the students’ in-country experience sparked disorienting dilemmas and point to the intertwined nature of developmental readiness, dissonance, and emotions during service-learning experiences.

AB  - The purpose of this longitudinal study was to investigate students' developmental readiness to navigate dissonance and experience transformation as they engaged in an international service-learning program. Using case-study methodology, researchers collected data from a diverse group of 7 graduate students and 5 undergraduate students who participated in a predeparture course and 3-week program in Ecuador. Data were collected at 4 points in time: before the trip, during the trip, immediately after participants' return to the United States, and 1 year later. The findings emphasize 2 main narratives that describe the longitudinal nature of participants' developmental readiness. These 2 narratives include remaining unsure how to do ``good service{''} and reexamining what social identities mean. Collectively, the longitudinal narratives demonstrate that participants continued to consider and, in some cases, made new meaning of experiences in Ecuador that sparked dissonance; however, the transformative potential of international service learning took time to materialize.

AB  - Adolescents are often exposed to the lasting effects of political conflict. Complementing existing research on negative outcomes in these settings, this article focuses on the role of the family (N = 731 mother/adolescent dyads, 51% female, M = 14.72, SD = 1.99, years old at Time 1) in promoting constructive youth outcomes in response to perceived conflict in Northern Ireland. Exploratory factor analyses revealed two related forms of youth civic engagement: volunteerism and political participation. Structural equation modeling revealed that compared with males, female adolescents reported more volunteerism. Older adolescents reported higher political participation and lower volunteerism. Moreover, over three time points, the primary model test revealed that the impact of perceived political conflict on adolescent volunteerism and political engagement was partially mediated by family cohesion. These findings suggest that amid protracted political conflict, the family may be a key factor underlying adolescents' contributions to post-accord peacebuilding.

AB  - International experiential learning programs provide opportunities for young people to develop the necessary skills to succeed in and adapt to the complexity, diversity, and ever-changing landscape of the globalized workforce. There are however, several barriers that prevent students of color from accessing opportunities to be fully engaged in a global discourse – placing them at a severe disadvantage when compared to their White counterparts. While current efforts focus on increasing access for students of color, there is often little done to understand how these students experience and are impacted by these programs. The purpose of this qualitative study sought to understand how a student’s racial identity shapes their experience in a multiracial international service-learning program – and more specifically how it shapes their own ideas and actions around race, belonging, and difference. The study also sought to understand the ways teachers can influence student’s development and learning throughout the immersion trip. There are four major findings of the study: (1) Students’ racial identity shapes their experiences in an international service-learning program in ways that can be both empowering and disempowering, (2) Class shapes the types of connections students formed with their peers and others abroad. Middle to upper-income students adopted a helper mentality, while low-income students felt a sense of responsibility tied to similar experiences of systemic oppression, (3) Class and racial privilege combine in unique ways which shape how students draw lessons from the program and experience encounters with extreme poverty, and (4) The life experiences of teachers and their critical reflections of their own racial identity, power, and privilege fundamentally shape their teaching approach and work as leaders and mentors. These narratives and findings have implications that can be applied more broadly to the ways we approach study abroad experiences for students of color and trainings for educators or support staff. Recommendations include incorporating intentional discussions centered around race and privilege, curriculum that is culturally relevant to students, and educator trainings that build their critical consciousness.

AB  - Special education teachers' practice is influenced by an understanding of special education policy and knowledge of implementation practice. This study examined the perceptions of nine special education teachers related to their interpretation of assessment, progress monitoring, and transition mandates in a large urban district. Qualitative methods included a constant comparative approach to coding of teachers' open-ended interview data. The themes that emerged in this study highlight ways in which teachers' determine student needs, provide student supports and services, and how they navigate the implementation of supports through collaboration and partnerships. Understanding teachers' perceptions and navigation of policy requirements to meet students' diverse needs provides insight to contextualize implementation decisions and provide examples for practice. Implications of these findings for practice are addressed.

AB  - This article presents the views of the vice President of The Association For Childhood Education International (ACEI) on the importance of teaching citizenship and social responsibility in schools. He says that politicians have begun to recognize the importance of civics and citizenship education. Civic education teaches young people the skills, knowledge, and attitudes that will, one hopes, prepare them to be competent and responsible citizens throughout their lives. While much of the service learning literature focuses on college, high school, and middle school students, the hands-on nature of service learning is most appropriate for the 4- to 8-year age groups. The basic steps in a service learning framework include preparation, action, reflection, and celebration. Preparation is the planning phase, action is the service providing phase, reflection is the contemplation over services provided and celebration helps children understand that their services are valued.

He promotes multicultural education and the teaching of service learning as ways to counter dehumanization and proposes community, praxis and courage as essential elements in curricula. He suggests teachers can use events such as the Iraq War, genocide in Darfur, Sudan and Hurricane Katrina to teach students about the need for community.

AB  - Experiential learning is a useful teaching tool in the undergraduate community psychology classroom. In addition to improving student outcomes, experiential learning is particularly relevant for community psychology, as it aligns with several core values of the field and can prompt not only student learning, but also civic engagement, social justice, and community betterment. In this article, we provide an overview of the themed issue on “Experiential Teaching Practices in Undergraduate Community Psychology.” The issue contains a variety of experiential teaching examples that fall into three clusters: (a) individual and group service-learning exercises; (b) using community experiences to augment in-class learning outside of a service-learning context; and (c) ways of having students draw on prior out-of-class or in-class community experiences to increase student understanding.

Service-learning can be used in social work education because it fits within the ecological and reflective practitioner conceptual frameworks, and supports the core social work value of service. It is also well suited to help social work students learn group work skills. The components of service-learning are identified, and the service-learning is differentiated from field placements in social work education. It also outlines the steps for initiating service-learning projects in group work courses.

AB  - In an effort to reform public child welfare systems across the nation, Title IV-E child welfare training programs were established over 2 decades ago. Participating students typically engage in a customized educational experience as part of their MSW program that prepares them to work in the field of child welfare upon graduation. This article describes an initiative taking place in one MSW program where students are encouraged to serve as a Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA), paired with an individual child or youth in foster care. The purpose is to offer students a deeper understanding of the lived experiences of children in care. Information relating to program design and student perspectives on the experience are presented.

AB  - This teaching note delineates seven lessons learned when designing and implementing a graduate-level dementia caregiving service-learning course. The course was designed during a 1-year faculty service-learning fellowship and implemented during the summer of 2015. The course used a person-in-environment framework to explain social work practice with family systems affected by dementia. It aimed to increase students’ knowledge about dementia and improve students’ attitudes toward working with people with dementia through respite visits with families affected by dementia. Three recommendations for future course offerings are described.

AB  - In addition to direct practice skills, social work students need to become familiar and competent with macrolevel approaches to addressing youth and transgender youth homelessness. Service-learning courses provide an effective approach for students to learn the necessary knowledge and skills. In two sections of an upper-division social work macropractice course, teams of students worked with nonprofit organizations that addressed the needs of homeless youths and transgender youths. A three-pronged approach—community forum, fund-raising, and advocacy campaign—allowed a range of activities and learning experiences that benefited the students and agencies. This three-pronged service-learning model engaged the community, spread the message about youth and transgender youth homelessness, and consisted of projects that people can easily implement in their own communities.

AB  - This article presents results from an evaluation of service learning in statistics courses for master of social work students. The article provides an overview of the application of a community-based statistics project, describes student feedback regarding the project, and illustrates some strengths and limitations of using this pedagogy with social work statistics courses. Student evaluations (N=38) suggest that implementing a service-learning pedagogy allows students to master basic statistical analysis skills and see practical applications for statistics. Such an approach also provides myriad benefits for faculty, although incorporating service learning into a statistics course can present specific challenges.

AB  - Nursing programs are challenged to prepare future nurses to provide care and affect determinants of health for individuals and populations. This article advances a pedagogical model for clinical education that builds concepts related to both population-level care and direct care in the community through a contextual learning approach. Because the conceptual pillars and hybrid constructivist approach allow for conceptual learning consistency across experiences, the model expands programmatic capacity to use diverse community clinical sites that accept only small numbers of students. The concept-based and hybrid constructivist learning approach is expected to contribute to the development of broad intellectual skills and lifelong learning. The pillar concepts include determinants of health and nursing care of population aggregates; direct care, based on evidence and best practices; appreciation of lived experience of health and illness; public health nursing roles and relationship to ethical and professional formation; and multidisciplinary collaboration.

AB  - The use of experiential approaches to teach social welfare policy suggests that such methods may increase undergraduate social work students' knowledge of and skill in working on social and economic justice issues. This article compares 2 such methods using qualitative and quantitative approaches. The first teaches social welfare policy as a service learning course and the second integrates social welfare policy into the students' practicum experience. The authors conclude that both approaches are equally effective in helping students to increase their knowledge of policy concepts and may help students feel more competent in using policy-related skills.

AB  - Teaching about poverty and homelessness in the United States provides participants opportunities to become active learners, developing sociological perspectives while learning about and understanding how poor and homeless people experience hardships. This requires curricular materials which describe poor and homeless people while also elaborating the social consequences of homelessness and poverty for larger groups and communities. Teaching and evaluating knowledge of key concepts help increase understanding of homeless, poverty, and social programs. Learning goals go beyond social criticism toward understanding key concepts and developing a sense of civic responsibility. Teaching about poverty and homelessness truly helps students gain a sociological perspective.

The leadership class at Cornwall Central High School (New York) is a full-year course, designed carefully to be a course, not a co-curricular activity. It is not a frill, nor is it an easy grade. The commitment to time in the classroom, school, and community laboratories is significantly demanding, as a true commitment to leadership requires. It is open to all students, staff, and parents. A commitment to 'making a difference' in the lives of others is the only prerequisite. The thrust of the program is three-fold: to serve the needs of self, school and community. When schools work both to elevate the academic level of students and to raise their social consciousness, they are on the right path. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This paper offers one possible avenue for teaching students how individuals can and do act collectively to change the world and further for motivating students to believe that they too can make a difference. My approach is to combine case studies of transnational advocacy with complimentary experiential education opportunities. The case studies allow for exploration of key international relations concepts ranging from key actors in the global arena to broader discussions of power and constructivism. The service learning opportunities offer students a chance to observe and participate in organizations and projects that provide hands-on understanding of international relations concepts and demonstrate activism strategies which can be applied locally, nationally or globally. This paper discusses teaching strategies utilized in an international relations class on transnational advocacy. I begin with a brief assessment of current literature on service learning. Next, I discuss the value of transnational advocacy networks (TANs) as educational cases for international relations students. This is followed by a brief discussion of three service-learning opportunities that I use to teach both international relations concepts and activism strategies. Finally, I conclude with an appendix of sample course and resource materials. ..PAT.-Conference Proceeding [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Conference Papers -- American Political Science Association is the property of American Political Science Association and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

AB  - This study evaluates the effectiveness of an experiential approach to teen pregnancy (TP) prevention called ‘Baby Think It Over,’ a computerized infant simulator, on adolescents' attitudes and behaviors regarding teen pregnancy and sexuality. Recently, a more realistic model called ‘Real Care Baby’ was developed. The small amount of research on the effectiveness of the original program yielded mixed results. Participants were experimental (n=133) and comparison (n=116) groups of primarily white, middle class, suburban high school students. Multivariate analyses revealed no overall effect, but univariate, correlational, and narrative analyses suggested several positive outcomes. Theoretical implications for experiential approaches are discussed. Research and practice applications are emphasized.

AB  - How can instructors use experiential learning strategies to enhance student understanding of research ethics and responsible research conduct? In this article, the authors review literature on using experiential learning to teach research ethics and responsible research conduct. They present a three-step exercise for teaching research ethics and responsible research conduct using experiential learning strategies. Their primary teaching and learning objective is to broaden student understanding of ethical behavior beyond notions of "right" and "wrong" to a conception of ethical behavior involving thinking critically about all stages of the research process. The authors present assessment data that suggest that participation in the exercise increased knowledge about ethical guidelines and broadened understandings of ethical behavior.

AB  - The Research Institute for Sustainability Science and Technology under the Master degree in Sustainability Science and Technology organises the course action research workshop on Science and Technology for Sustainability (5 ECTS). The authors have been coordinating the course during the academic years 13/14, 14/15 and 15/16. The purpose of the workshop is to put together civil society organisations, local administrations, students and educators to collaboratively undertake responsible research, performing transdisciplinary learning environments and by an action research framework, to answer questions such as: Who are we researching for? Who profits from our research? What are the impacts of our research? Which methodologies and tools should be used when dealing with sociotechnical sustainability challenges? Students work on real projects, related to local sustainability problems, represented by a community entity (Service learning and Campus Lab). Action research methodology is used with a two-cycle approach. In each real-life project, students, faculty and stakeholders are asked to follow the action-reflexion process of action research projects: Action 1-Jointly defining: Project purpose; Customer and interest; Involved actors; Reflexion 1-Students define: research question, initial situation, needed additional information, action Strategy, Tasks planning and distribution: Action 2-Items returning and discussing with stakeholders, Reflexion 2-Revising and reformulating. Having now run the workshop three times, we can conclude that: first, students realised the significance of framing an investigation under a research methodological framework that allows bringing research to the community, enhancing transdisciplinarity in any initiative or action in sustainability science. They set out the importance of some topics and the difficulty to hold them. Second, the formulation of the problem became one of the most arduous tasks in the process; difficulties were mainly related to the perception of the problem from distinct community group motivations. Third, interaction and communication with stakeholders and the recognition of their role was problematic as engineering students are not usually trained to work in wicked problems nor accompany stakeholders during the whole process. Finally, it is relevant to highlight that during the process students faced conflict and frustrating situations both within their team and with stakeholders. To help tackle this problem, an Emotional Intelligence module was introduced in the workshop which proved useful in helping students to solve some paralysing situations, which could otherwise have stopped the progress of the project. We suggest that engineering students need specific training in transdisciplinary research and in conflict resolution, to avoid collapsing in frustration when dealing with real transdisciplinary sustainability transitions.

AB  - Higher education is a principal agent for addressing the sustainable development goals proposed by the 2030 Agenda, because of its key mission of knowledge generation, teaching and social innovation for sustainability. In order to achieve this, higher education needs to integrate transversally the values of sustainability in the way of developing the field of management, as well as research, university life and, of course, teaching. This paper focuses on teaching, and more specifically on the didactic strategies considered most relevant for training in sustainability competencies in college students, according to the guidelines commonly accepted by the international academic community. Through collaborative work among experts from six Spanish universities taking part in the EDINSOST project (education and social innovation for sustainability), funded by the Spanish R&D+i Program, in this paper the role of five active learning strategies (service learning, problem-based learning, project-oriented learning, simulation games and case studies) in education for sustainability are reviewed, and a systematic approach of their implementation in higher education settings is presented. The results provide a synthesis of their objectives, foundations, and stages of application (planning, implementation, and learning assessment), which can be used as valuable guidelines for teachers.

AB  - Scholars have long argued that civic organizations play a vital role in developing members’ civic capacity. Yet few empirical studies examine how and the extent to which civic skills transfer across distinct and separate civic contexts. Focusing on Latino immigrant members of a Los Angeles janitors’ labor union, this article fills a void by investigating union members’ involvement in an independent civic arena—their children’s schools. Analyses of random sample survey and semi-structured interview data demonstrate that labor union experience does not simply lead to more civic engagement, as previous research might suggest. Rather, conceptual distinctions must be made between active and inactive union members and between different types of civic engagement. Results show that active union members are not particularly involved in plug-in types of involvement, which are typically defined and dictated by school personnel. Instead, active union members tend to become involved in critical forms of engagement that allow them to voice their interests and exercise leadership. Furthermore, findings suggest that the problem solving, advocacy, and organizing skills acquired through union participation do not uniformly influence members’ civic engagement. Experience in a social movement union serves as a catalyst for civic engagement for some, while it enhances the leadership capacity of others.

AB  - This study documents the evolution of service learning in America and the types of service learning. This case study examined the perception of 28 young, gifted adolescents involved in a Community Action service learning project toward their project, the effects of this involvement upon them, the impact of the project on the rural community, and the effects of the methodology that was used in the classroom from 1998–2000. The study examined this case in relation to an earlier pilot study by the researcher. Data were gathered through focus group and individual interviews, observations, and a review of documents. The importance of service learning to the young, gifted participants in this study was highlighted in the following themes emerging from the data: methodology, attitudes, student development, empowerment, commitment, and effects of celebration. The experiences from this project gave the students opportunities to grow academically, intellectually, personally, creatively, and socially. Through their participation in this Community Action service learning project, the students began to see outside the walls of their classroom into the community beyond. Civic awareness and responsibility were developed. Basic skills were propped up, while the students' sense of responsibility toward their community and each other developed. They learned how to creatively elicit ideas to improve their community. This project had both a direct and an indirect impact on the community. Directly, it led to beautification of the downtown area and educated the community about its historic resources. Indirectly, it led to the community perceiving youth as a positive element in the community. It also affected student attitudes positively toward the community. These findings point to the importance of methodology to service learning. In order to help gifted students perform to their maximum potential, a conscious effort to lead students toward self-learning and independence is needed. The study suggests that students must have opportunities to work cooperatively; to learn the skills of creative problem solving; to have ample, formal reflective activities; and to have opportunities for celebration. Implications for educators are discussed.

AB  - At the 2006 National Association of Gifted Children Conference, a panel presentation addressed the importance of providing gifted children with opportunities to take positive social action through service-learning; this article is a result of that discussion. The Future Problem Solving Program (among others) has a community problem-solving component to help instill the habits of responding to community needs in socially constructive ways. A service-learning project conducted by secondary gifted students is discussed. The highest level of service-learning is an effective curriculum for gifted students that exposes them to community problems and encourages them to solve those problems creatively. Through service-learning, gifted youth have opportunities to expand their global awareness, practice skills of positive action, and make real their vision of a better future.

AB  - Implementing service-learning programs in schools for our gifted may help nurture the development of more highly moral people. Service-learning, a method by which students learn and develop through curriculum integration and active participation in thoughtfully organized service experiences that address needs in their community, has three levels: community service, community exploration, and community action. Community action, most appropriate for gifted youth, involves a high degree of service that produces a broad community impact and the highest degree of learning. This article discusses case studies of four gifted, middle-grade students who participated in community action service-learning projects that positively impacted both the community and the students. Could service-learning be helpful in creating more people like Thoreau and Gandhi by developing co-cognitive traits in gifted youth?

AB  - How can parents help their children develop the sensitivity and compassion of people like Henry David Thoreau, Mahatma Gandhi, Rachel Carson, and Martin Luther King, Jr.? Participation for gifted students in service-learning programs, both in and out of school, may be one helpful method. In the last two decades, there has been a resurgence of interest in community service, with many schools requiring service hours for graduation. Service-learning is an advanced form of community service, in which children learn and develop through actively participating in organized service experiences that address actual needs in their community and involve integration of learning objectives. Service-learning allows for gifted students to look beyond themselves, to care about something enough to make a difference in the world. It is important for gifted children to acquire skills needed to become more responsive and effective citizens and to help them become more confident and compassionate human beings. By having a "passion" for their "community," gifted children develop "compassion" themselves. This article discusses what parents can do.

AB  - Background: Rural and remote communities in Australia fare worse than their urban counterparts across major health indicators, with geographic isolation, restricted accessibility to health services, socioeconomic disadvantage, lifestyle and behavioural factors all implicated in poorer health outcomes. Health disparities, which are especially stark in Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations, underscore the urgent need to build a culturally responsive and respectful rural health workforce. Allied health student placements in settings with high Aboriginal populations provide opportunities for the development of cultural capabilities and observation of the causes and impact of health disparities. A service learning pedagogy underpinned by strong campus-community partnerships can contribute to effective situated learning. Positive placement experiences can also encourage future rural practice alleviating workforce shortages. This article reports on the first stage of a proposed longitudinal investigation into the impact of remote placements on clinical practice and employment choices. Methods: In-depth interviews were undertaken with health science students and recent graduates from Australian universities who spent up to 4 weeks at the remote community of Mt. Magnet (Badimaya country) in Western Australia. Interviews, which occurred between two and 12 months following the placement were recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed for patterns of meaning. Results: Factors which contributed to positive professional, personal and socially responsive learning experiences were identified. These included pre-placement cultural training to build understanding of the local Aboriginal community, peer support, community engagement, cultural exchanges and interprofessional collaboration. Highlights were associated with relationship-building in the community and opportunities to apply insights into Aboriginal cultural ways to clinical and community practice. The role of the Aboriginal mentor was integral to students' understanding of the social and cultural dynamics in the practice setting. Challenges related to the logistics of supervision in remote locations and workloads. Conclusions: The interprofessional placement offered students a unique opportunity to experience how isolation, socioeconomic disadvantage and cultural factors conspire to produce health inequities in remote Australian settings and to observe how communities respond to their circumstances. Despite difficulties encountered, learnings derived from the application of clinical, social and interprofessional skills, and rural employment opportunities that arose following graduation, were all highly valued.

AB  - The profit-driven tendency of interior design trends and styles today has developed in line with the decrease of social awareness in design. The majority of interior design students also decide to pursue interior design education for its marketable and profitable purposes rather than seeing interior design as a field of opportunity to contribute to the social welfare of their communities. Hence, the objective of this research is to implement community service through co-design in interior design pedagogy. The article describes the learning and design methods used based on human-centred design approaches of co-design and analyses the resulting benefits from this approach. Findings reveal that the process of collective creativity and collaborative development with the community enables a direct experience of learning and fosters a deeper connection and understanding of users. They also promote novel multidisciplinary design innovations, accommodate the community's potentials in the society and stimulate a reflexive impact, allowing students to reflect on their future role as interior designers in bringing positive changes to their community against the profit-driven tendency of contemporary designers today.

AB  - This research was aimed to develop multimedia and activities to enhance knowledge about arts and cultures for community youths through social lab at the community under the bridge zone 1, to determine the quality of the multimedia and activities, to examine the learning achievement of the community youths, to evaluate the satisfaction of the sampling group and to evaluate the after-action review (AAR) of the organizers. The research tools in this study included the quality evaluation form for contents, the quality evaluation form for media and activities, the learning achievement test, the satisfaction survey for the sampling group towards the multimedia and activities, and the activity to get after-action review (AAR) of the organizers. The sampling group consisted of people who had lived in the community under the bridge zone 1 for over 2 years had participated in this research from the beginning till the end. There were 120 people who filled out the questionnaires. They were chosen using purposive sampling method. The group included local people and community youths. The research results showed that the organizers ran the project about dancing performance alongside single-head drums for the community youths through social lab. The multimedia included vinyl media and video clips to teach dancing performance alongside music from single-head drums. The clips and teaching were made by students who got scholarship from KMUTT for their art and cultural skills and the fence-painting activity was done by graduate students from the LTM652 Principle and Theories of Mass Communication course. The organizers analyzed, designed and developed multimedia and activities in accordance with the ADDIE Model in the first semester of the academic year 2018. The quality of the contents was at a good level (x-bar = 4.46, S.D = 0.26). The quality of the media and activities was at a very good level (x-bar = 4.60, S.D = 0.26). The learning achievement of the students from their pre-test and post-test scores showed that their average post-test score was higher with statistical significance at the 0.05 level. The satisfaction of the sampling group was at the highest level (x-bar = 4.63, S.D = 0.56), confirming the research hypothesis. The after-action review showed that it was at a good level. The organizers expressed their opinion that the multimedia and activities to enhance knowledge about arts and cultures for community youths through social lab were beneficial for both the organizers and the community youths. The organizers learned how to work as a team and they could use their skills in real situations. They realized the importance of giving, especially teaching knowledge about arts and cultures for community youths. The community youths learned to spend their free time on useful activities and did not involve in drug abuse. They also learned new skills and they could do dancing performance to earn their living on the weekends and holidays or when there were festive events. It could be concluded that the multimedia and activities to enhance knowledge about arts and cultures for community youths through social lab were of good quality and could be applied for real use.

AB  - They are everywhere: young people who refuse the narrow label of "student." Of course, they take care of schoolwork, but they also look outside of themselves and see a world full of need--and they want to help. This article features short profiles of adolescents--students, athletes, musicians, community activists, inventors, scientists, and all-around caring people--who have earned the label of "changemakers." This is just a small representation of the young changemakers in schools. These 12 profiles are offered in honor of all the young people engaged in their communities--and with the hope that more will take up the mantle.

AB  - Two challenges facing 21st century librarians are the rapid growth in information and technology and the growing population of diverse students who lack access to information and technology. While most LIS students are aware of disparities in society through classroom-based coursework, "real-life" experiences are needed for a deeper understanding of issues such as the digital divide and equity of access for diverse populations. This study examined LIS students' understanding of equity of access issues through a service-learning course designed to connect course content with service-learning experiences in schools and public libraries serving large populations of Latinos. The research questions addressed include: (1) Does service-learning contribute to a better understanding of course related issues? (2) To what extent does service-learning contribute to the depth of understanding of issues related to the course content? (3) To what extent does service-learning contribute to increased cultural understanding? and (4) To what extent are social capital and civic involvement developed through service to the community?

AB  - This study examines the ways in which program characteristics (i.e., involvement with service users, agency support, and class experience) and psychological engagement interact in university students to affect service-learning outcomes in such areas as personal development and civic commitment. The basic premise is that these two sets of variables may have differing effects on the outcomes. To test this premise, the study employed survey data collected from 113 university students participating in a service-learning program in Hong Kong. The results support the hypothesis that involvement with service users and psychological engagement are the strongest predictors of student outcomes. On the other hand, no support is found for the possibility that agency support and class experience might affect the outcomes. Implications of the findings for further research and future development of service-learning programs are discussed.

AB  - Service-Based Learning (SBL) has become an emerging pedagogical tool for engineering education. Although there is a large body of literature reporting the benefits of SBL activities, most studies have relied on self-report measures and generalized learning contributions. Our evaluation went beyond self-perceptions by investigating what effects, if any, SBL activities had on the metacognitive processes of students during an engineering design task. Verbal protocols were collected from ten engineering students during an open-ended, model-building design task. The five SBL students and five non-SBL students also completed post-task interviews and reflection papers. The students in our sample who had participated in SBL activities voiced more metacognitive phrases, demonstrated more accurate task analysis and clearer strategic planning skills, were more skilled at discriminating useful from superfluous information, and had a better understanding of clients' needs and constraints.

AB  - This study aimed to determine if pre-internship teacher education students’ participation in service-learning activities in K-12 classrooms would significantly affect their teachers’ sense of efficacy (TSE). A secondary focus sought to determine if one type of service-learning activity (e.g., whole-class instruction) would affect teacher efficacy more than another (e.g., small-group tutoring). Findings revealed that pre-internship service-learners in both types of service-learning activities increased significantly in their TSE. However, neither type of service-learning activity was superior to the other as measured by the minimally accepted .05 level. The discussion focuses on factors shared between the two service-learning designs that might mediate a positive mastery experience. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This article focuses on the preliminary statement prepared by a committee on the Elementary School Counselor appointed jointly by the Association for Counselor Education and Supervision and the American School Counselor Association. The purpose of this statement is to identify and provide guidelines for the development of the role of the elementary school counselor as perceived by the membership of the Association for Counselor Education and Supervision and the American School Counselor Association. Guidance for all, children is accepted as an integral component of the total educational experience in the elementary school. Guidance is defined as a continuing process concerned with determining and providing for the developmental needs of all pupils. School Counselor in an elementary school is a term used in this policy statement to designate a counselor working as a member of the professional staff of an elementary school; responsible to the principal of that school; concerned with and accepting a responsibility for working with pupils, teachers, and parents; and having as his major concern the developmental needs of all pupils. The counselor is educationally oriented, highly knowledgeable in the area of child growth and development with a broadly based, multidisciplinary background in the behavioral sciences and a high degree of competence in human relations.

AB  - Students in global service-learning and similar programs frequently encounter substantial social, cultural, political, and ethical differences when working with project partners in different countries and regions. Neglecting such differences can lead to project failures and/or disempowered communities. In response to these challenges, educational resources have been developed to teach students to think about how the people, social structures, and other contextual factors associated with projects can affect, and be affected by, students' designs. Yet, there remains a scarcity of valid and reliable instruments to evaluate the effectiveness of such interventions. The purpose of this study is create a theoretically and empirically grounded instrument, the Energy Conversion Playground (ECP) design task, that is able to provide a meaningful and robust assessment of an individual's ability to identify salient technical and non-technical considerations when approaching an engineering design task situated in a developing country context. We present the scenario and an accompanying rubric that was first developed inductively from student responses to the scenario (specifically 449 discrete items from 93 ECP design tasks submitted by students who attended a Global Engineering Design Symposium). Further development of the rubric involved deductive grounding in relevant literature. To demonstrate the sensitivity of ECP design task to changes in students' thinking, we also performed comparative analysis of responses from a subset of the students (n=37) who completed the same instrument both before and after participating in the GEDS.

AB  - Integrating service in a post-licensure registered nurse to bachelor of science in nursing (RN to BSN) program provides licensed registered nurse (RN) students the opportunity to learn, develop, and experience different cultures while serving the community and populations in need (McKinnon & Fitzpatrick, 2012). Service to the community, integrated with academic learning can be applied in a wide variety of settings, including schools, universities, and community faith- based organizations. Academic service-learning (ASL) can involve a group of students, a classroom, or an entire school. In the RN to BSN program, the authors use a student-directed service learning approach that integrates service-learning throughout the curriculum. RN students are introduced to service-learning at program orientation prior to the start of classes and receive reinforcement and active engagement throughout the curriculum. The students and volunteer agencies receive and give benefits from the services provided and the life lessons gained through mentor ship, education, and hands-on experiences.

AB  - In this article, I examine the impact of service-learning on both cognitive and affective learning outcomes to determine whether using class time for service hours has a negative impact on course outcomes. I do this by looking at these outcomes in two sections of the same lower level political science class, Education Policy, offered in two consecutive semesters. In one section, service learning was part of the course requirements. For half of the class periods, students went to a local elementary school to tutor second grade students. In the second section, service learning was not part of the course requirements, due to scheduling difficulties. In each section, a survey designed to assess both cognitive and affective learning outcomes was administered at the beginning of the semester and at the end of the semester. The results suggest that despite reduced face time, students in the service-learning system showed more affect toward the education and political systems with no reduction in cognitive learning. ..PAT.-Unpublished Manuscript [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Conference Papers -- American Political Science Association is the property of American Political Science Association and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

AB  - Service-learning provides an excellent pedagogy for introducing students to clients of different cultural backgrounds, helping students become aware of the issues these clients face related to culture and health care, and teaching culturally appropriate care. The Transcultural Self-Efficacy Tool was used to evaluate self-perceived cultural competence in a convenience sample of 60 baccalaureate nursing students enrolled in a community health nursing course following the completion of service-learning projects with local and international communities. Pre- and posttests were analyzed based on total scores and subscale (cognitive, practical, and affective) scores. A paired-samples t test compared the mean pretest total score to the mean posttest total score, which demonstrated a significant increase. In addition, paired-samples t tests demonstrated a significant increase in each subscale.

The purpose of this study is to examine the extent of the impact of the Freshman Academy/Learning Community program on student progress at a historically Black university. The authors also looked at the extent to which students engaged in their learning as a result of strategies developed and implemented based on the quality enhancement plan of "Strengthening the Quality of the Freshman-Year Experience through Student Engagement and Active Learning." Finally the extent of engagement and satisfaction with the program as reported by students were compared. The results showed some interesting differences in these core practices: active learning, integrated assignment, co-curricular and service learning activities. Performance was measured by analyzing student progression at the course, program, and university levels. The results are being used as feedback for program improvement.

Each of these is included in the core functioning of campus-based Christian institutions. As these institutions move more and more to providing distance learning opportunities, it is questioned if equal importance is being given to these ethos enablers in interactions with distance learners. The purpose of this study is to describe what is being done and how effective selected Christian institutions perceive themselves to be in including intentional ethos enablers in their distance learning opportunities.

AB  - An explanatory methods design was used to evaluate the influence of a service learning course on learning, personal, and social outcomes for service learning (n = 142) students. These students showed improvements in diversity and political awareness, community self-efficacy, and civic engagement scores from the beginning to the end of the semester. In addition, the students' academic learning, personal and interpersonal development, and community engagement were detected as the major benefits from engaging in service learning. The findings of this study suggest that service learning contributes to students' academic learning and personal and social development through social-emotional processes.

AB  - The emergence of human-centred design strategies has directed attention to the role of empathy within design. While research on co-design acknowledges the potentially improved outcomes of using an empathic design approach, a comprehensive analysis on how empathy functions throughout the design process has been minimally explored in this literature. In this study, we analysed a series of design review videos depicting students’ design procedures within a service-learning course. These student designers were tasked to design a universally accessible zip-line and access ramp along with associated features. Our objective was to explore how empathy functioned throughout the development of the students’ final design solutions, which included a zip-line access point, ramp and cheering platform. To guide our depiction of these empathic design pathways, we relied on a set of pre-established empathic design techniques utilised by student designers. We provide a visual summary of student designers’ empathic design techniques, the interrelation of these techniques, along with implications for how design educators might effectively embed empathy throughout design curricula.

According to him, donating a gift for a charity drawing, buying advertisement in school programs and giving dollars in the Salvation Army during Christmas is not enough for a person to be called that he/she actively participated in community activities. He suggests that donating musical instruments to school is important since it helps students develop their talents.

AB  - Since I began teaching a course titled Writing in the Community, I have been fascinated with how narratives deepen students' service-learning experiences. In their article "Narrative Learning in Adulthood," M. Carolyn Clark and Marsha Rossiter say that stories "draw us into an experience at more than a cognitive level; they engage our spirit, our imagination, our heart, and this engagement is complex and holistic." Narratives give broader context to students' service, foster critical consciousness, help students believe they can make a contribution in their own communities, and contribute to making service-learning a transformative experience, all outcomes that remind us of the importance of the humanities in forming active citizens.

AB  - While service learning in communication appears to be gaining in acceptance, few previous empirical studies examine changes in its availability and implementation over time. The present study compared a 1995 (Sellnow & Oster, 1997) and a 2001 survey of department chairs to reveal how service learning fared in communication departments. The survey indicated increases in both the number of communication studies majors and the number of students participating in service learning. Fewer departments appeared to be diligent about providing essential elements of service learning such as finding meaningful service and requiring structured reflection. The survey uncovered perceived benefits to students, including communication skills believed to be improved through service learning. Across the six year span, multicultural awareness and intercultural skills were increasingly associated with service learning.

AB  - In response to the need for culturally competent care, faculty can instill in students the desire to become culturally competent practitioners by providing the opportunity to participate in a short-term study abroad immersion experience. While this strategy is not considered cutting-edge or revolutionary, changing global dynamics warrant rethinking this curricular option. Nurse faculty conducted two short-term study abroad courses in Croatia. Students explored health care and nursing education in this Eastern European country and participated in a service-learning project. Based on their experiences, the authors offer five dos and five don'ts for planning and implementing a successful study abroad course.

AB  - Background: The Training for Health Equity Network (THEnet), a group of diverse health professional schools aspiring toward social accountability, developed and pilot tested a comprehensive evaluation framework to assess progress toward socially accountable health professions education. The evaluation framework provides criteria for schools to assess their level of social accountability within their organization and planning; education, research and service delivery; and the direct and indirect impacts of the school and its graduates, on the community and health system. This paper describes the pilot implementation of testing the evaluation framework across five THEnet schools, and examines whether the evaluation framework was practical and feasible across contexts for the purposes of critical reflection and continuous improvement in terms of progress towards social accountability. Methods: In this pilot study, schools utilized the evaluation framework using a mixed method approach of data collection comprising of workshops, qualitative interviews and focus group discussions, document review and collation and analysis of existing quantitative data. Results: The evaluation framework allowed each school to contextually gather evidence on how it was meeting the aspirational goals of social accountability across a range of school activities, and to identify strengths and areas for improvement and development. Discussion: The evaluation framework pilot study demonstrated how social accountability can be assessed through a critically reflective and comprehensive process. As social accountability focuses on the relationship between health professions schools and health system and health population outcomes, each school was able to demonstrate to students, health professionals, governments, accrediting bodies, communities and other stakeholders how current and future health care needs of populations are addressed in terms of education, research, and service learning.

AB  - Leaders in nursing education are incorporating innovative educational strategies, including reflection, which will more fully develop student nurses' intellectual capacities to conceptualize knowledge to better meet patients' needs (Bout Keough, & Walker, 1998; Duraghee, 1996; Hallett, 1997). This article examines the theoretical basis for reflective practice and explores its usefulness in the development and transmission of nursing knowledge in baccalaureate nursing education. Critical reflection can be effectively utilized by leaders in baccalaureate nursing education in classrooms, clinical settings, service learning experiences, experiential learning activities, and in the instruction of ethical decision-making.

AB  - Examined the effects of 2 service learning experiences on the psychosocial and moral reasoning development of occupational therapy students. The assumption was that ethical reasoning ability can be facilitated through participation in value-laden experiences. Ss visited older adults in nursing homes (n = 19) or interacted with persons with disabilities in community settings (n = 33). All Ss reflected on their experiences through weekly journal. Psychosocial and moral reasoning development were measured at the beginning and end of the experiences with the Student Development Task and Lifestyle Inventory and the Sociomoral Reflection Measure-Short Form. Ss in both groups exhibited a significant time-related increase in psychosocial development but no increase in moral reasoning, Ss interacting with persons with disabilities exhibited a decrease over time in moral reasoning compared with the Ss interacting with older adults. Service learning effected a change in the Ss psychosocial development indicative of developing an appreciation for dignity, equality, and justice. The lack of advancement and current level of moral reasoning in these undergraduate students raises a question as to their readiness to engage in ethical reasoning as entry-level practitioners.

AB  - Many countries rely on community health workers (CHWs) at a primary health care (PHC) level to connect individuals with needs to health professionals at health-care facilities, especially in resource-limited environments. The majority of health professionals are centrally based in facilities with little to no interaction with communities or CHWs. Stellenbosch University (South Africa), included interprofessional home visits in collaboration with CHWs as part of students' contextual PHC exposure in a rural community to identify factors impacting on the health of patients and their families. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of this interprofessional student service-learning initiative on identifying and addressing health-care challenges of households known to CHWs. Active physical, social and attitudinal factors were identified and recorded using a standardized paper case report form. Data were anonymized, captured and categorized for analysis. The frequency and proportion of each type of active problem and referral were calculated. The collaborative team identified many unaddressed health and social issues during their visits. Their exposure to communities at a PHC level offered benefits of experiential learning and provided insight into community needs, as well as offering services to enhance the current health-care system.

AB  - The redesign of an undergraduate curriculum at one baccalaureate nursing program resulted in adoption of a required course on case management for chronic illnesses. The course is structured around rehabilitation standards and medical-surgical and community health principles of nursing care. A service-learning model was used to develop the clinical experience, which involved student nurses visiting the homes of individuals with chronic illnesses. These visits were made in collaboration with personnel from community-based agencies or programs. This article discusses the design of the course and some of the content areas and clinical activities.

AB  - This is an attempt to explicate the necessary components which distinguish a valid experiential educational approach from a cavalier, or random, pragmatism. After a brief review of the varieties of experiential learning, the notion is expressed that experiential education should produce intellectual growth; include problem-solving, object-setting, & decision-making endeavors; & blend the cognitive objective with the student's own unique background & skills. A path of creative problem-solving progress incorporated at UCLA is presented which involves the steps of planning, execution, & evaluation. In planning, students design a learning proposal describing an individualized educational experience centered around a field study project of internship. In the execution phase, students perform research & fact gathering activities, while being intimately involved with the environment or subjects of investigation. Evaluation is continuous & creative, involving both a faculty & field mentor, & the learner, who continuously monitors his/her progress throughout the learning experience. Experiential education, with its problem-revealing & problem-solving implications can teach us more about the process of learning. AA.

AB  - This training manual presents concepts and skills that students can be taught to successfully address social, economic, and ethical issues both inside and outside of school. The manual is intended as a comprehensive guide for effective service learning and peer helper programs; the concepts and skills provided here are designed to apply human relation and communication skills in both personal and professional settings. The sourcebook's underlying purpose is to foster the development of healthy, well-adjusted, and confident role models and leaders. It presents a series of 16 daily lesson plans that teach, among other skills, helping skills, attending skills, questioning skills, critical thinking skills, and interpersonal feedback. Three different units then address specific themes. Unit 1 describes ways to create a helping environment, and features a series of exercises that prompt participants in self-discovery and positive outlooks. Unit 2 explores skills development in effective communication and focuses on restating content and feelings, and on conflict resolution. The last unit concentrates on group work and emphasizes team building and collaboration. Two appendices feature handouts, as well as testing and evaluation materials. (RJM)

AB  - Assessed an interdisciplinary service learning experience in geriatrics provided for graduate-level occupational and physical therapy students. The service learning experience functioned as the clinical component of an interdisciplinary geriatrics course. Purposes were to (1) provide students with an introductory experience in performing evaluation techniques in geriatrics, (2) provide a service to elderly clients by screening them for physical and communications dysfunction, and (3) develop students' ability to interact and work directly with elderly clients. The learning experience was carried out over 9 wks and provided an opportunity for students to work directly with 14 elderly patients in a community-based setting. Course evaluations regarding the experience and anecdotal feedback from the students suggest that the experience was worthwhile and constituted an effective design for teaching geriatrics.

AB  - The paper describes how CUHK is developing video-assisted case sets (Cases) as part of the Service Leadership Initiative (SLI). Cases can be effective in supplementing traditional lecture-based methods to train leaders, introducing interactive and applied pedagogy, and assessing students. As a part of the flipped classroom, videos are increasingly and effectively used in education and can promote die goals of SLI. Production of a Case involves a writer, a producer, a camera person, and an editor. Six Cases have been completed; another six are in various stages of production, and 13 have been indefinitely postponed. We conclude that finding compelling Case subjects is challenging; leadership issues are more understandable for students in the words of the leader expressed through videos; obtaining academic faculty commitment for Case development with real-world leaders is difficult; the risks of non-completion of Case writing are high because of leader risk aversion; video production and editing services may be more effective if accomplished by in-house expertise; instructor risk aversion militates against Case adoption, and placement of a Case with platforms cross listed with Harvard Business Publishing is a necessary but not sufficient condition to effective distribution.

AB  - The overriding purpose of this study was to gain insights of parents’ perceived value of internship opportunities for urban high school students. Parents, educators, and employers are among the stakeholders concerned with the lack of use of internships for senior level students. The theoretical frameworks for this study were The Experiential Learning Theory and The Service Learning Theory. To accomplish the goal of discovery, it was necessary to create a questionnaire for this qualitative study. The research questions specifically asked about the value of internships, post-internship employability, and the implementation of school mandates for internships. The instrument was administered to parents using a triangulation method. Data was scored and coded where major and minor themes emerged. Internships provide real-life experiences in the workforce for students to make application of learning. Learning in the classroom is vital to the success of an internship experience as hard and soft skills taught in the classroom exhibit connections that employers consider invaluable and are willing to invest time, space, and energy. This on-the-job training affords successful students a definitive edge—one ensuring they are not easily overlooked. This study indicated 100% of the parents had an appreciation of internships and employers value experience over education alone. Future studies as to the impact of culturally responsive education and the impact of internships on dropout rates were recommended. When culturally responsive parents, educators, and employers work together to create internship opportunities and propagate internship programs, Validated Authentic Learnings in Urban Education (V.A.L.U.E.) is created.

AB  - This article uses critical race theory to engage with the phenomenon of international experiential learning. Based on fieldwork in Mysore, India, we argue that students must be more rigorously prepared for volunteer work in the Global South. We suggest that pre-departure training should integrate components of critical race theory in order to more adequately prepare students to grapple with systemic racism. Finally, we contend that critical race theory and the concept of white fragility are essential to understanding the impact of international experiential learning programmes on international development.

The ideas reflect an experiential learning philosophy that encourages students to address perceived sexism themselves. The approach downplays the role of the tutors, uses a poststructural definition of gender, critically examines the socially constructed binary of femininity & masculinity, seeks to reduce polarization, & seeks to appeal to & involve both women & men. Ideas & materials described include conversation interventions, role playing, gender riddles, & critical examination of advertisements. 2 Figures, 18 References. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Character education has been a part of public schooling in the United States since its beginning. It has undergone dramatic changes over the years, from didactic instruction to service learning; it continues to evolve as more and more schools become involved in teaching students right from wrong. The current emphasis on character education in schools began in the early 1990s as an attempt to alleviate the increasingly violent behavior of students as reported in the media. The purpose of this study was to determine how character education affected the behavior of students. The study involved: observing student behavior, interviewing teachers, students, and parents to determine their perceptions of the effects of the character education program on student behavior; and reviewing disciplinary records to identify behavioral patterns. The findings from this study suggested that character education programs may have a positive effect on student behavior. Furthermore, the findings led to recommendations regarding the implementation of character education programs in elementary schools. Character education should be an integral part of the curriculum, not taught as a separate subject. This includes not only academic subjects but also specialty areas such as art, music, and physical education. Classroom rules should be based on the principles of good character, and teachers should model good character for the students to observe. Additionally, students should be taught character through hands-on service activities that contribute to the school, the community, and society in general. This will help the students develop a sense of ownership of the program and should help to improve student behavior.

AB  - This paper shares the survey results of students' perceptions of the benefits of their experiences with service learning. The service learning experiences were related to children and their physical growth and development and/or to children and their health education. An open-ended questionnaire was sent to 376 graduated students (representing 11 courses over six years) to gather their thoughts regarding the benefits of their service learning experiences several years after completion. Responses were overwhelmingly positive with the most prevalent themes relevant to educational and career goals: "confirmation of future goals," "practical skill development," and "enhance my resume and/or application to a particular field of study/occupation." Given these findings, service learning should be included in post-secondary education not only for the practical experiences that link theory with reality, but also for the potential benefits to students' future career and education.

AB  - This book on service-learning provides a current view of service-learning research in the second language classroom and practical applications for the acquisition of both cultural knowledge as well as the different language modalities. This book helps in understanding how using service-learning in the language classroom can facilitate language acquisition. The author addresses many of the challenges faced by teachers in the second language classroom as they try to implement service-learning programs in their curriculum. Based on the research as well as the experience of the author and other practitioners in the field, suggestions are given in each chapter as to how to maximize student learning and acquisition of specific aspects of a language as well as on the formation of successful programs and service-learning experiences. These suggestions are integrated into the individual chapters based on the focus of the unit. This book shows how service-learning allows students real world application of the language they are learning in the classroom. This book discusses how service-learning assists students in contextualizing their learning and seeing the reality of their field of study and the applicability of their language classes to settings that they encounter in their own communities. Finally, at all levels teachers, professors, and administrators are being asked to provide standards and assessments to demonstrate achievement and excellence in their different fields. This book addresses how service-learning aids students in meeting these proficiency standards and helps them achieve many of the goals set forth by national and international foreign/second language learning organizations.

AB  - This paper examines how the structural features of engineering engagement programs (EEPs) are related to the nature of their service-learning partnerships. "Structure" refers to formal and informal models, processes, and operations adopted or used to describe engagement programs, while "nature" signifies the quality of interactions or interpersonal dynamics within partnerships. We developed the Transactional, Cooperative, and Communal (TCC) framework to code interviews (N=30) with community partners, administrators, faculty members, and students at three well-developed and geographically-diverse EEPs. A thematic analysis approach was then employed to relate the three TCC partnership natures to six emergent structural themes: (a) program purposes, (b) partnership structures, (c) modes of interactions, (d) organizational partners, (e) individual partners and advisors, and (f) projects. The paper concludes by discussing specific implications of the TCC framework for educators and program administrators, the importance of recognizing both individual and organizational influences on partnerships, and the salience of engineering education as a context for service-learning and community engagement (SLCE) programs.

AB  - Research of engineering community engagement has primarily focused on the experiences and outcomes of students, yet it is often the faculty, administrators, and community partners who have a long-term commitment to the program's success. In this study, we are developing and validating an assessment instrument that combines two previously identified aspects of community engagement programs: participant motivation and the nature of engagement relationships. Participant motivation refers to the reasons people stay engaged in the community engagement experience and can be categorized into: student learning and growth, personal and professional development, and benefits to the community organization. The nature of an engagement relationship is defined as the quality of interactions and interpersonal dynamics within partnerships. It is associated with transactional, cooperative, and communal interactions. A validation survey was developed by creating 45 statements associated with the interacting effects of motivational categories and the nature of engagement relationships. Statements were validated by service-learning practitioners with a minimum of two years research and/or practical experience. Validation participants were provided with a codebook for motivational categories and relationship natures. They were asked to code each of the 45 initial statements with the provided categories and natures. We received feedback from eight researchers, with the initial goal of attaining 10 responses. We identified ten statements that maintain at least 75% coding convergence across responses. Our results highlight key underlying assumptions associated with the TCC Framework and opportunities to improve the instrument to increase clarity and reduce potential bias.

AB  - This book connects resiliency to five major educational megatrends--character education, multiple intelligences, emotional intelligence, service learning, and violence prevention--and gives educators proven strategies for incorporating the 'resiliency attitude' into everyday classroom experiences. The author identifies a myriad of applications through six resiliency-building strategies: Care and support through meaningful relationships; opportunities to participate and contribute in meaningful ways; high expectations, knowing that others believe they can be successful; pro-social bonding through positive connections with peers and adults; clear boundaries and expectations that are fair and consistent; and life skills such as decision making, effective communication, and stress and conflict management.

AB  - Teachers and other school staff are overwhelmed with myriad concerns. As a result, many view positive youth development as just "one more thing" to add to an already full plate. This article assists educators in understanding how positive youth development (PYD) is inherent in good educational practice, and does not have to be one more thing. Using the metaphor of a baseball team, the author describes the core skills that educators need to have in order to coach and mentor young people both academically and personally.

AB  - One of the presumptions of a well-functioning, viable democracy is that citizens participate in the life of their communities and nation. The role of higher education in forming actively engaged citizens has long been the focus of scholarly research, but recently an active debate has emerged concerning the role of service as a third core function of institutions of higher learning. Service learning (SL), a teaching approach that extends student learning beyond the classroom, is increasingly seen as a vehicle to realize this third core function. By aligning educational objectives with community partners' needs, community service is meant to enhance, among other objectives, reciprocal learning. Although the term and its associated activities originated in the United States (US), theoretical debates linking civic engagement and education extend far beyond the US context. Nevertheless, research on SL as a distinctive pedagogical approach remains a nascent field. A significant gap exists in the literature about what this pedagogical approach seeks to achieve (in nature and in outcomes) and how it is construed in non-western contexts. Using a comparative analysis across three widely different contexts, this article explores the extent to which these differences are merely differences in degree or whether the differences are substantive enough to demand qualitatively different models for strengthening the relationship between higher education and civil society. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Leaving implicit the definition of service and the larger implications of service learning, Serve and Learn (see record [rid]2004-14929-000[/rid]) raises questions of how to implement service-learning projects. It is assumed that educators, as well as adolescents, need assistance with organizing their time and setting distal as well as proximal goals. The book does not offer detailed reports or empirical research on the effectiveness of particular programs. Instead, it contains a set of recipes for thinking about how schools can sustain service-learning programs while ensuring that students are able to meet national achievement standards. Using well-established lesson planning strategies, Serve and Learn encourages readers to imagine where in a school's curriculum service learning might take place, how to set goals for students that correspond with community needs, and how to evaluate the outcomes of a project. Much of the book is based on conjecture rather than empirical research, but chapters raise key questions that educators would do well to anticipate before asking students and community members to commit to a project. A major tenet of the No Child Left Behind Act involves holding schools, teachers, and parents, as well as students, accountable for student achievement. Serve and Learn offers general suggestions for accomplishing this aim. Unfortunately, because the book offers little evidence that the suggestions have been used, monitored, and evaluated in actual schools, the impracticalities of the proposed guidelines have not been acknowledged.

AB  - In this project, I articulate a democratic pedagogical model, which is based on and modified from the pedagogical theories of the American psychologist, Carl Ransom Rogers (1902-1987). Rogerian Democratic Pedagogy (RDP) is based on Rogers’ claim that learning that is student directed, and involves the learner emotionally as well as cognitively, is more effective than the traditional, teacher-directed model of education. RDP focuses on empowering composition students to have a sense of ownership of their process of learning and their class, to be responsible and active learners, and to participate as citizens in a democracy by completing public writing projects that serve a purpose outside the classroom. One type of public writing project, community service writing that is based on the Stanford model, in which the writing that students do for non-profit organizations is their service work, encourages students to conduct writing that fulfills a need in the community and that addresses a real rhetorical situation. I have found that my students who complete public writing projects, such as service-learning writing projects, interpret this kind of work as more meaningful to them than their traditional writing assignments, like the expository essay. According to Rogerian theory, the effectiveness of learning is increased when students are, as in these situations, more engaged and invested in their work. While any teaching method that facilitates a democratic learning environment can potentially be a useful strategy for an RDP approach to teaching composition, the RDP methods that I discuss most extensively in this project include the attempt to level the power structure of the classroom, the use of student-centered dialogue to facilitate critical thinking, and public writing projects. I assert that an RDP approach is particularly useful when linked with service-learning pedagogy, and it can help service-learning practitioners address and overcome several challenges. RDP can help to explain why service learning, when it works well, is such a transforming pedagogy. It illustrates why service learning, rather than having civic and moral value only, also increases the effectiveness of learning, which helps to overcome a common objection to service learning pedagogy by faculty who worry that a service learning approach will not help them teach the academic content of their courses. Not only does Rogerian theory address this objection because it explains that the best learning is that which students interpret as significant, but it calls into question the importance of any course material that the instructor alone, as opposed to the student, deems valuable. In addition, RDP can help service-learning practitioners facilitate reflection and critical-thinking, overcome challenges associated with grading service-learning projects, and, according to some students in my service-learning composition class, encourage students to write for “more than just a grade” and to learn “just to learn.”

AB  - Service-learning can serve as a vehicle for teachers of English/Language Arts to help students use language and other symbolic tools to promote their interactions with and position in the greater community and world. Negroni argues that 'Schools cannot continue to work in isolation, as if our work has no relationship to the larger society and the issues facing it'. If teachers endeavor to create a community of lifelong learners who can apply their academic education to the problems and challenges facing their greater community, then the relationship between student and community must strive to be both intimate and reciprocal.

AB  - The interaction of agency and context in workplace learning is explored through a micro-analysis of the implementation of networked learning communities in schools in England. Interviews with local activists show evidence of co-participation between individuals' responses and their workplace roles and experience as they take up the opportunity to create a networked learning community for their schools. The paper raises issues about the community of practice model as promoted for workplace learning, with its emphasis on group participation rather than individual agency. Activists make strategic use of existing power relationships in order to facilitate networked learning, and develop skills in influencing and communicating across existing practice communities. Sustaining the network also depends on continuing intervention and strong support from activists' personal communities of trusted peers and colleagues with whom values and goals are shared. The opportunities, challenges and risks of using a networked approach to foster workplace learning are explored. (Contains 7 notes.)

AB  - Leadership, service, and exploration are three concepts that have been a growing focus in the academic world over the course of many years. Higher education institutions have begun incorporating leadership curriculum, service learning initiatives, and experiential learning into academic curriculum to provide students with a more holistic learning experience in preparation for the professional world, which is becoming more internationalized each year. This article explores the ideas of learning about leadership, service, and exploration in the local, national, and international context as a part of a cohort experience.

AB  - Learning/volunteer abroad programmes are increasingly popular in international development studies (IDS), and educators recognise the importance of quality preparation and debriefing sessions for students travelling to the Global South. In this paper, we examine the findings of a 2007-2011 Canada-wide study by Tiessen and Heron of student participants in learning/volunteer programmes, and the relational and ethical issues the youth encountered abroad. Building on materials and methods employed by IDS faculty and programme facilitators that appear most effective in helping students reflect on and analyse their experiences, we conclude with some suggestions for improving the ethics dimension of international experiential learning programmes.

AB  - Work-integrated learning options--or experiential learning--(such as co-operative education, practicum placements, and community service learning/volunteer placements) offer much scope for enhancing educational opportunities for post-secondary students to learn about the workplace and to develop skills that may contribute to their future employability. However, community service learning (CSL) placements and co-operative education (co-op) programs, among other forms of experiential learning, offer so much more than the practical outcomes of skills-development and résumé-building. They provide a space for reflexivity on the student's positionality in relation to privilege and national and/or global citizenship identity-formation; for critical reflection on ethical issues; for the promotion of social justice; and for praxis (the application of knowledge). The research presented in this article is an evaluation of two sets of experiential learning reflection assignments: co-op work-term reports (from 2nd, 3rd, 4th year and graduate students) and CSL papers (assignments submitted for a fourth year class I taught in winter 2016 on experiential learning). I examine the common themes and differences between these two sets of assignments with particular attention to the preparation and facilitation of learning in both instances, and the difference this preparation makes in terms of the student's critical reflection.

AB  - There is a call for education, including teacher education, to transform from solely transmitting knowledge to creating dynamic learning opportunities for students to experience real-world situations so they can develop the skills and competencies necessary to navigate a changing and unpredictable world. Service-learning is proposed as one strategy to facilitate this transformation. Therefore, the purpose of this qualitative case study was to describe how individual or group service-learning experiences might impact the attitudes and beliefs of pre-service teachers in a teacher education course. This study was guided by two research questions: How do pre-service teacher participants describe their individual or group service-learning experiences within the context of a required teacher education course? In what ways do participants’ attitudes and beliefs towards service-learning vary, based on individual or group service-learning experiences? The service-learning experiences for this study were designed using experiential educational theory and a blended framework from service-learning common goals (academic enhancement, personal/professional growth, and civic learning) and common components (academic material, critical reflection and relevant service) (Ash, Clayton, & Moses, 2009). Fourteen pre-service students agreed to participate in the study. Two sources of data were identified, (a) individual semi-structured, face-to-face interviews and (b) critical reflective journals written by participants. Findings suggest that service-learning experiences reinforce academic content including experiential education. Personal and professional growth and an understanding of diversity can result from service-learning experiences. Teacher involvement in the local community was viewed by participants as important for student-teacher relationships and to improve connections between the school and the community. Participants of the study viewed critical reflection as a fundamental component in service-learning. Self-identified personality type can impact how each participant described their individual or group service-learning experiences, including benefits of social interaction and collaboration. Individual and group service-learning present different challenges in implementing effective experiences. Participants’ beliefs and attitudes did not vary based upon individual or group service-learning experiences. In conclusion, incorporating the experiential pedagogy of service-learning in teacher education programs can better prepare pre-service teachers for the very unpredictable nature of teaching.

AB  - We report on the service-learning component of a Spanish-language Saturday school in Ann Arbor, Michigan, for elementary-aged Spanish-language heritage learners and also examine the newly forming Latino community served by this innovative program. The US Spanish-speaking population is growing throughout the country, resulting in greatly increased numbers of English language learners who enter the school system as heritage Spanish speakers. The current study provides compelling data that first language Spanish literacy support can be very beneficial for these students as they acquire English literacy. Such efforts also provide numerous experiential- and service-learning opportunities for native Spanish speakers, as well as for intermediate and advanced second language Spanish learners in this study. Both first- and second-language service-learners benefit from the Spanish immersion environment of the Saturday program outlined. Moreover, our case-study findings show that heritage students in the program and their largely immigrant parents are forming part of a diverse community that values bilingualism, Spanish literacy, and academic achievement.

The system can generally be implemented simply by reallocating existing resources and rethinking traditional approaches. Purpose-centered education connects students with academic subjects, ideas, teachers, cultures, and the community. (MLH)

AB  - The overarching objective of this study is to examine the nexus of relationships that emerged between university students and Latino families paired through a university service-learning course. The relationships crossed socially constructed boundaries of ethnic groups, language, educational levels, and socioeconomic status, exploring the intersection of community service, scholarship, and teaching-and-learning. The research questions necessitated the use of qualitative research methods. The narrative attempts to capture the essence of the setting, the actors, and the resultant relationships by describing and examining the spontaneous relationships that occurred. The researcher spent 1 years as an interpreter/participatory member in the Latino community prior to beginning the research study. She collected data collected for this case study over 2 years, examining the backgrounds of the participants, their perspectives toward their partners, and the role of service-learning in the development of relationships between two disparate groups. She conducted 46 interviews with students and community members while collecting over 2500 reflection papers, 100 transformation papers, and 25 PowerPoint presentations from students. The participants developed relationships at different levels, some resulting in friendships that will probably continue for some time; others sharing respect and concern for each other only during the placement. A few unsuccessful partnerships had to be changed. Student and community voices presented an appreciation for the partner's language and culture. The data illustrated satisfying reciprocal relationships in which students and families emerged united in solidarity against a society they deemed unjust. This study seeks to provide information for educators considering service-learning programs, examining a course that provides opportunities for interaction between university students and community members. Through the participants' voices, the reader can explore the integration of academic learning with learning lived in the community. Finally, this study submits general proposals for the inclusion of service-learning programs in Foreign Language and Teacher Education programs as a means of nurturing paradigm shifts in student attitudes toward members of other cultures as well as paradigm shifts in the Latinos' attitudes toward their new culture, suggesting possible deeper societal transformation as the academy and the community become agents of change through service-learning in the Latino community.

AB  - Burgeoning immigrant populations fuel discussions about preparing preservice teachers to teach students who have limited English proficiency and diverse cultural backgrounds. This article contributes to the conversation by presenting service-learning in immigrant communities as an effective pedagogy to develop an awareness of students' worlds away from school. This qualitative case study investigates the transformative aspects of a course that places graduate students in service-learning experiences with Spanish-speaking families. The data provide evidence that focused academic study and community experience promote understanding challenges English language learners (SDELs) and their families face, as well as understanding their future roles as teachers of SDELs.

AB  - This study evaluated leadership components in seminary curriculum and the relationship between leadership-enhanced curriculum and the leadership practices of seminary-trained pastors. The Master’s of Divinity curricula for the 251 Association of Theological Schools (ATS) were evaluated for leadership development components. Data indicates that only 7.62% of the evaluated ATS schools can be classified as leadership-enhanced, and that leadership development is not an integral part of ATS seminary. Six hundred and nineteen graduates from three representative seminaries were administered the Kouzes and Posner Leadership Practices Inventory (LPI). The two null hypotheses postulated no differences between the LPI scores of graduates from the leadership enhanced curricula and those from the non-enhanced curricula. Previous studies indicated curriculum-enhanced students outperforming non-enhanced students on the LPI. The fact that the opposite occurred in this study creates dissonance between the findings of the present study and previous studies. Since the null hypotheses were not rejected, these findings are inconclusive. The problem of the dissonance between previous research and the present study is discussed from three different perspectives: philosophic reasons, possible methods errors, and problems from limitations and assumption. The only variable that indicates a difference when analyzing LPI scores by demographic data is participant age. The primary research relevancy of this study is in the questions raised. Most research on academic leadership development affirms the value of leadership curricular components. This study challenges those findings. The theoretical relevance of this study addresses the theories of student involvement, experiential learning and reflection, and leadership development as a life-long process. The practical findings of the study could lead to improved educational practices in service learning and social responsibility. It also suggests the need to increase student collaboration and faculty involvement, and the possible benefit in administering the LPI (or similar instrument) to students as they enter seminary to gather information about students’ past leadership experience and adjust curricular requirements. The next research step to advance this study is a replicate study to determine if the results of this present study are merely an anomaly.

AB  - Abstract: This article shares the dilemmas that emerge from a community service project that engages students in a systematic critique of the juvenile justice system from the inside. It explores how competing images of youth (as dangerous thugs, vulnerable children and kids who have made bad choices) coexist uneasily within the juvenile justice system and significantly shape and constrain this community service learning project. They influence how volunteers understand their experiences and relationships with students inside, and they shape how young people in the system speak about their own lives, the inequalities they see around them, and the juvenile justice system itself. By exploring these dynamics this article aims to develop a more nuanced understanding of youth voice. [Copyright &y& Elsevier]

AB  - Objective. To create a service-learning project to provide poison prevention education to preschool through fifth-grade students. Design. The School of Pharmacy collaborated with the Illinois Poison Center and campus departments to train pharmacy students as poison prevention educators. Seventy-eight first-year pharmacy students developed and gave age-appropriate, interactive presentations to more than 8,000 students at pre-schools and elementary schools. Assessment. Preintervention and postintervention evaluations and reflections were collected from the pharmacy students. Ninety-nine percent agreed that they enjoyed the experience and 88% stated that they would continue to provide poison prevention presentations. Based on written assessment of the presentations, most of the preschool and elementary teachers agreed or strongly agreed that the presentations were organized, clear, appropriate for the students, and relevant, and that the pharmacy students appeared knowledgeable and professional. Conclusion. Poison prevention education was an appropriate service-learning project for pharmacy students and provided a beneficial service to the community.

AB  - As part of a larger project examining the role of humanitarian service learning in engineering (NSF project number EEC-1540301), we conducted an investigation of first-year engineering students' perceptions of humanitarian service learning projects, social responsibility in their discipline, and ethics in STEM. Students (n=231) taking a required freshmen level engineering course were surveyed with a pre- and post-instrument, and provided with these working definitions: Community Service is voluntary work intended to help people in a particular community. Social Responsibility is an obligation that an individual (or company) has to act with concern and sensitivity, aware of the impacts of their own action on others, particularly the disadvantaged. Social Justice relates to the distribution of the advantages and disadvantages in society, including the way in which they are allocated. Pro bono- work done without compensation (pay) for the public good. This course specifically addresses the issues described above with the goal of providing early exposure to topics that will be reinforced in non-major coursework, such as general education elective courses. Results showed that there was little change in student perceptions before and after completion of the course in terms of their perceptions of ethics, social responsibility, and social justice. In the areas in which there were statistically significant changes, students were, on average, slightly less sure the engineering profession can help people or solve social issues and slightly less interested in a job that involves helping people. On the other hand, students were slightly more aware, after the course, of the need to include social aspects in engineering practice and rated technical and professional skills as slightly less important after the class. It was also found that some groups in the class (women, minority students, first-generation students, and student less focused on salary in thinking about their future jobs) entered the class with different attitudes and changed in different ways by the end of the course. Overall, the results of this survey support other findings in engineering ethics which suggests that one course is insufficient to make significant impacts on the ways engineering students think about the societal implications of their work. However, these declines in student confidence, while small, are important to take seriously and this paper will draw out potential implications of this finding. Finally, we will discuss the implications of the differences within the class in terms of effective teaching of these topics and retention of underrepresented students.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the influence that volunteering before medical school with older people in a care home has on the perceptions of older people. Design/methodology/approach: Eight medical students answered an anonymous questionnaire relating to their experiences of volunteering in a care home before medical school. This was combined with an analysis of the relevant literature. Findings: All the students had initially volunteered to enhance their CV for medical school. After volunteering, they had a greater realisation of the variety of older people. They also gained a number of transferable skills related to communicating with older people, especially those with cognitive impairment. The greatest learning experience was around the issues to do with dementia. Research limitations/implications: The research is based on eight students although they were from different areas. Practical implications: It would be beneficial if care homes could be more proactive in encouraging prospective medical students to volunteer. Medical schools could also provide clearer advice or take a more active stance such as encouraging prospective students to volunteer with older people. Further research should be with a larger sample to gain insight into varying perspectives. It would also be useful to conduct research into older adults' attitudes towards the contribution of potential medical students to their own lives and to the home. Social implications: Volunteering before medical school should be encouraged as it will enhance the chances of getting a place as well as being an eye opening experience and equip them with lifelong skills. Originality/value: Original.

AB  - In response to the increasing diversity in American public schools and concerns over inequities in opportunity and achievement, many teacher education programs are infusing multicultural topics and coursework into their programs (Akiba, 2011; Hollins & Guzman, 2005). While some programs utilize what O'Grady (2000) called the Human Relations approach to multicultural education with an emphasis on "reducing prejudice and getting along with others" (p. 11), other programs drive things further and seek to foster a social justice orientation in their students (Zeichner, 2003). O'Grady (2000) has labeled this social justice approach as Social Reconstructionist Multicultural Education since it "teaches directly about oppression, discrimination, social justice, and how to take action against these inequities" (p. 4). Fostering a social justice disposition can be a challenging endeavor when working with white, middle-class pre-service teachers who have grown up in rural or suburban environments with very limited experience with diversity (Causey, Thomas, & Armento, 2000). Because of this, teacher educators have to consider an approach that allows an opening of students' minds to ideas of diversity and social justice. This study explores the authors' attempt to initiate this process through the use of a service-learning experience. This interpretive study elucidates the experiences of a group of preservice teachers (n = 37) participating in a service-learning project as a course requirement for a social foundations of education course. The preservice teachers were required to complete ten hours of service (with at least six visits) at a local Job Corps Center. They tutored Job Corps students seeking to complete their high school diploma or General Educational Development (GED) high school equivalency diploma. This experience required the group of predominantly white, middle-class preservice teachers to interact one-on-one with a diverse group of students primarily from urban areas. The purpose of this study is to explore the impact that this experience had on the preservice teachers' perceptions of and receptiveness to diversity.

AB  - This mixed methods study explores a service-learning experience embedded in a social foundations course in a teacher education program. The authors differentiate learning outcomes for social justice and charity service-learning, and utilize this framework to examine whether the service-learning experience fosters a social justice perspective. The findings demonstrate that while the experience did foster social justice perspectives for some students, the data also reflect evidence of learning outcomes that align with charity service-learning.

AB  - This article reports on how one teacher education program utilized a Learn and Serve America grant to embed service-learning experiences into its practices. Included are narrative reflections on how the program faculty developed a community-based, participatory approach to service-learning in order to act as a responsive partner to the needs of the local community. The experience of the team illuminates opportunities and challenges in how a community-based, participatory service-learning approach--which attends to the needs of community partners--can strengthen relationships between teacher education programs and the communities in which these programs are situated. The findings suggest that this type of approach can be a useful way to develop transformational service-learning relationships that support teacher education students in developing cultural competence related to inequities associated with poverty, race, and English language acquisition.

AB  - This interpretive study examines the outcomes of using a social justice service-learning field experience in a social foundations course to help illuminate for teacher candidates the often "invisible" institutionalized inequities of public schools. The findings demonstrate how social justice service-learning can be used as a field placement to increase preservice teachers' exposure to diversity, to help refocus attention on the needs of individual learners, and to assist teacher candidates in understanding and questioning existing school structures.

AB  - When considering inequality, one goal for educators is to enhance critical engagement to allow learners an opportunity to participate in an inquiry process that advances democracy. Service-learning pedagogy offers an opportunity to advance engaged-learning opportunities within higher education. This is particularly important given the power dynamics that are endemic within conversations about education, including the conversations around the Common Core, charter schools, and the privatization of education. Critical inquiry is central to the ethos of service-learning pedagogy, a pedagogy that is built upon community partner participation and active reflection. Within higher education, service-learning offers an important opportunity to enhance practice within the community, allowing students to engage stakeholders and youth which is particularly important given the dramatic inequalities that are endemic in today's society.

AB  - Background: The ability to effectively teach culturally and linguistically diverse students is critically important. Research has shown that providing teacher candidates educative experiences through critical service-learning can better prepare future teachers and can foster a social justice stance. Purpose: This study examines teacher candidates' perceptions of a critical service-learning experience in a literacy methods course where participants worked in community settings to support English language learners. Methodology/Approach: Using an interpretative framework, the authors collected and analyzed data from 18 participants including reflection portfolios, questionnaires, and interviews. Findings/Conclusions: This study found that the critical service-learning experience (a) cultivated an understanding of the identities, strengths, and motivations of learners; (b) nurtured their practice; and (c) fostered their understanding of the importance of community engagement, which all contribute to a social justice perspective. Implications: This study demonstrates how critical service-learning enriches understanding within our communities, which allows individuals to tackle issues to advance social justice and equity.

AB  - International service learning experiences provide many opportunities for nursing students. Using a varied approach to students' self-reported learning in Cambodia, students reported gaining first-hand knowledge and experience about global nursing and health care, including its rewards and challenges. The key components of a service-learning program, as defined by the International Service Learning Task Force (Sigma Theta Tau International), include reciprocal relationships between academic and community partners encompassing a range of activities and outcomes including social responsibility and cultural competence. (Leffers & Plotnick, 2010). The outcomes of the students' international-service learning experiences are consistent with those reported in the literature. Creating global citizenship is necessary in the education of professional nurses with implications for nursing education.

AB  - Humane education research is limited in its scope and structure and this has led to its inability to find a place in standard curriculum. As resources become scarcer for school districts and shelters, proving efficacy of programs is essential for successful partnerships and program achievements. VSI: Veterinary Science Initiative is a program developed by the education team at the Charleston Animal Society as a model for cooperative education between shelters, veterinarians, and other private organizations to collaborate with local school districts, while also conducting research about how this curriculum benefits student knowledge, organizational awareness, and community engagement. The focus of this research is in two primary areas: to examine the efficacy of the program through changes in knowledge, attitudes, behaviors, and evaluation of student products, surveys and observations, and to look the impact of the program as a model from a collaborative leadership perspective. Insights from this analysis can shape science education, humane education, and collaborative educational initiatives. The multimodal research approach adopted in this dissertation includes: comparing pre and posttest participant and control groups, evaluating rubric-based student products, tracking behavioral changes between control and participant groups, and collecting student and teacher surveys. Using these assessments, the VSI program produced significant changes in the participants' behavior, attitudes, and knowledge. This dissertation recommends that humane education shifts focus to a more behavior-driven model that can appeal to animal shelters, schools, and their students. Implications for best practices in curricular development and instruction are reinforced by the impact of individual teachers on the classroom and power of interdisciplinary authentic lesson plans that provide accessibility to a diverse student population. Larger sample size would allow for a more accurate and complex model of impact from the program based on multiple covariates such as pet ownership, ethnicity, and school. In the future, more elaborate analysis of factors impacting humane education, science attitudes, and long-term student behaviors would be beneficial.

AB  - Background: There is a misalignment of skills that employers are looking for and skills that young job-seekers possess in regard to being prepared for work and for their daily lives. Often, these skills play a crucial role in promoting educational and occupational success in everyday life. Various life skills have individually been found in adolescents to predict future employment and social behavior. Strengthened life skills are associated with educational attainment, participation in activities, work skills, and gainful employment. Purpose: The purpose of the study was to explore the perceptions of urban youth regarding service learning activities that would prepare them for attainment of professional life skills. This study sought to answer the following questions: (1) What are the perceptions of three Houston urban youth regarding service learning? (2) What are their perceptions on how service learning has impacted their skill development? This study also attempted to define how service learning could benefit youth in gaining life skills as well as work skills. Methods: This qualitative single instrumental case study analyzed data yielded from the interviews of three Houston urban youth (ages 19-23 years of age). Using constant comparative analysis, data were coded, and themes were determined. Results: This study generated four themes that pertained to the perceived perceptions of Houston urban youth and what skills they developed doing service learning to prepare them for their professional and daily life. These themes were (1) critical thinking; (2) teamwork/collaboration; (3) community engagement; and (4) intercultural competency. Conclusion: According to the results of participants’ experiences while engaging in service learning, it was determined that their participation in such activities was instrumental for the development of skills to be prepared for their professional and daily life.

A content analysis of 36 students' reflection papers revealed that service-learning was extremely beneficial, even when the experience was brief. Numerous valuable lessons were learned by the students about themselves & their future careers. Specifically, they became more accepting of others, & they realized the importance of service to one's community. In addition, they were able to process & synthesize the information they learned in the classroom by experiencing the course content in a real-world setting. Tables, References.

AB  - Principles of sustainable urbanism were established to overcome the problems associated with conventional urban form. These principles, however, can become more tangible and achievable through use of an inclusive and generative design process, which utilizes community participation techniques and pattern language. The case of Pacoima (a community in Los Angeles, CA) demonstrates the use of an inclusive and generative design process in order to alleviate the adverse consequences of conventional urban form and implement the principles of sustainable urbanism. By using community workshops and generative pattern language, students of two courses in two departments implemented several principles of sustainable urbanism (e.g. walkability and mixed use) in an attempt to transform the conventional urban form in Pacoima into a more sustainable one.

AB  - In the United States, learners for whom English is not a first language (EL2) tend to experience greater difficulties becoming proficient readers of English by expected timelines than learners for whom English is the first language (EL1). The primary goal of this study was to examine the extent to which when teachers reported practices associated with a comprehensive model of service delivery to a higher extent, their struggling EL2 and EL1 students received supplemental interventions earlier and had better reading outcomes than when teachers reported engaging in such practices to a lower extent. The extent to which reported availability of linguistic support, perceived administrative support for practices associated with a comprehensive model of service delivery, and teacher belief that these practices were important for children to learn to read, were linked to the reading outcomes of students, was also investigated. The responses of 525 teachers from 248 elementary schools from 9 US states were collected through an online survey and analyzed to answer these questions. The study had numerous limitations which impacted the meaningfulness and implications of the findings. However, results suggested the importance of screening practices in the provision of early reading interventions for EL2 students and availability of interventions for the provision of early interventions for EL1 students. Results also implied, though not conclusively so, a distinction between what constitutes an effective instructional environment for EL1 and EL2 students.

AB  - This article argues that a commonly neglected dimension in service-learning pedagogy is the consideration of community perspectives in developing these service-learning projects. Areas considered in this study were: (1) Community members' needs and problems, (2) Community members' perceived roles and participation, and (3) Community members' suggested activities and projects. This article focused on the community members of Jaime Hilario Integrated School (JHIS), a Lasallian co-educational primary school located in Sitio Look, Bagac, Bataan, Philippines. Interviews and focus group discussions (FGDs) were the qualitative research methods used to identify possible service-learning projects that can be implemented by various educational institutions. Five implications were drawn from the gathered data. The first implication is that it is important for educational institutions to ensure that service-learning projects meet the needs of the community. Secondly, various sectors in the community have unique needs to be addressed. Thirdly, aside from the common economic, education, and social services problems, rural poor communities also need trainings on values formation and personal development. Besides the above, it is necessary that community members be involved in the initial planning and development of service-learning projects and not merely participate during the actual implementation. And lastly, given the poor understanding of community members on their roles and participation, clear explanation of the goals of service-learning projects is perceived as a way of strengthening the relationship between service-providers and recipients.

AB  - Ironically, the discipline of sociology appears oblivious to the social forces that threaten it: the discerning parent's investment in their offspring's education, the mounting individual student debt and the New Zealand government's intention to collect and report data by discipline on recent graduate incomes. Sociology departments both nationally and internationally market boundless career possibilities for their graduates, but fail to identify the pathways to these lucrative destinations. The following discussion focuses on potential pathways. The article presents a response to these social forces: the establishment of a research based internship in a remote New Zealand university isolated from ideal placements in government ministries or NGO headquarters. The article outlines the setup of a research focused public sociology internship and argues for the centrality of an ethics application as a pedagogical device as the first step into research focused experiential learning and teaching.

AB  - The goal of this research was to evaluate the outcomes of the first year of a new internship course from both the perspective of the students and the lecturer. Did the course reach the lecturer's goals and create a powerful research experience for the students? Did the students see the class as unique or as just another class? The first part of this article examines how the students evaluated the course. The research demonstrates considerable increases in the confidence of these students in abilities typical of professional sociologist researchers. The ability of this cohort to describe their activities as sociologist researchers, however, remained variable. The paper ends reflecting on how the course could be taught more effectively if the lecturer was more hands-off in the writing of the students' projects ethics applications ahead of time.

AB  - The technical and professional writing curriculum has seen an increase in demand for digital publishing and web design courses as leaders in the industry are now expecting professional writers to know the "ins and outs" of communicating to online audiences. My internship with the Southeastern Writing Center website allowed me to employ theories in document design, web design, and audience analysis as I redesigned the Center's website. The task of uploading ten volumes of The Pick to the website placed me in a real workplace situation where I was required to collaborate with subject-matter experts in a service-learning project with students in a management information systems class. I gained valuable experience working with a content management system as well. In the thesis that follows, I present my research and the processes I went through to give the Center's website a new look.

AB  - Motivating students in analytical chemistry can be challenging, in part because of the complexity and breadth of topics involved. Some methods that help encourage students and convey real-world relevancy of the material include incorporating environmental issues, research-based lab experiments, and service learning projects. In this paper, we describe an approach that combines all three of these methods by integrating environmental research-based activities into the second-year undergraduate analytical chemistry course. We discuss the development, implementation, and preliminary evaluation of the research-based labs employed during the new summer analytical chemistry course. Students perform environmental investigations of sites on Beaver Island, Michigan, and prepare reports to contribute to an ongoing research project analyzing these locations that began in the 1970s. Preliminary impacts on analytical students were examined using pre- and postsurveys, including the Chemistry Attitudes and Experiences Questionnaire, and a new survey and questionnaires developed for this work. Responses and grades were compared across three summers, and to those from students in the traditional analytical course. Results suggest that the research-based activities positively impacted aspects of student attitudes, their perceptions of how chemistry knowledge influences understanding of environment issues, and their perceptions of how analytical techniques are applied in the real-world. Students indicated that the new labs provided real-world applications of class content, helped them learn new concepts and gain skills working with others, and helped them feel more confident conducting chemistry-related experiments.

AB  - One of the biggest challenges facing nonprofits is attracting and retaining volunteers to help deliver their programs. One way that colleges and universities are attempting to educate students on the importance of community issues and to graduate good citizens is through service-learning (S-L) programs. Although many scholars argue that collegiate S-L programs will increase the extent to which students volunteer following graduation (for example, Astin, Sax, and Avalos, 1999; Misa, Anderson, and Yamamura, 2005), more empirical research has been called for to examine this relationship. This article proposes three predictors of future volunteerism for alumni of a collegiate S-L experience: the amount of personal development experienced during the S-L project, the perceived value of the S-L project to the community organization, and the level of volunteerism prior to participation in an S-L project. Results showed significant effects of all the proposed predictors on postgraduation volunteering. Our findings have implications for nonprofit managers charged with maintaining a sufficient level of volunteers to provide their community services as well as individuals who are responsible for organizing S-L programs. These managerial implications and directions for future S-L research are discussed.

AB  - The overall aims of this study are to explore (1) how beginning teachers integrate technology in their practice and (2) the connections between teachers' technology uses and their pre-service education programmes. Data of this follow-up study were collected through in-depth interviews with beginning teachers. The results reveal that all beginning teachers used a wide range of technological applications, mainly for structured learning approaches, while few created opportunities for student-centred technology use. Further, pre-service learning experiences that impact graduate teachers' technology use are identified. While teacher educators modelling technology use are an important motivator for beginning teachers to use technology in their own teaching, field experiences seem to be the most critical factor influencing their current practice. Based on the results of this study, recommendations about how to prepare and support pre-service and beginning teachers for technology integration are discussed.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the level of West Virginia public elementary school teachers' self-efficacy for teaching character education. Questions addressed teachers' overall level of perceived self-efficacy for teaching character education; the levels of perceived self-efficacy in student engagement, instructional strategies, and classroom management; and the differences between levels of perceived self-efficacy and selected school and teacher demographic/attribute variables. Teacher self-efficacy to instruct character education was measured using the Teacher Self-Efficacy to Instruct Character Education (TSICE) survey, an adaptation of the Teacher Sense of Efficacy Scale (TSES) designed by Anita Woolfolk Hoy and Megan Tschannen-Moran (2001). The TSICE was distributed electronically to principals in 420 West Virginia elementary schools. Principals were asked to forward the survey to their teachers for response; 433 teachers completed the survey. Overall levels of perceived self-efficacy indicated that teachers had a significantly high level of total self-efficacy for teaching character education and held high levels of self-efficacy in the three sub-factors. Statistically significant differences were reported by counselors in character education functions including responding to difficult questions, aiding student comprehension using a variety of assessments, providing alternative examples to students, and providing appropriate challenges like service learning. Statistically significant results were also found for teachers of PreK – grade three for gauging student comprehension and establishing routines that stressed good character in the classroom. Ancillary findings indicate that the respondents felt they were least able to influence positive out-of-school behaviors and best able to influence positive principled behaviors.

AB  - This paper is a critical evaluation of a pilot cooperative education project conducted with a charitable organization in the UK. An action research approach was adopted. Final level students who are studying auditing have had the opportunity to apply the knowledge and skills they are developing through their studies to a real-life situation in the form of a cooperative education and service learning project. The experience is described and evaluated from the perspective of each stakeholder (i.e. the students, the charity and the lecturer). The main implication of the project is that the experience is of real benefit to all the stakeholders, but brings with it investment and maintenance costs which need to be factored into any potential roll out of the project to other students or other third party organizations.

The report — produced by the Washington-based American Youth Policy Forum and the Alexandria, Virginia-based Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development — includes a seven-point agenda for improving civic education, and ultimately civic engagement, across the country. It advocates, among other strategies, broadening the definition of "core" curriculum to include civic learning, increasing opportunities for service-learning and character education in schools, and integrating civics lessons into other subjects.

The class follows a structured method, which includes community workshops and project development, in dealing with the communities. Among many observations gained in eight years of running the class are that citizens feel very comfortable in allowing students to facilitate the public workshops, students benefit from immersion in a real community, and the classes' presence in the communities can benefit local civic engagement and sustainable economic development efforts.

AB  - This study offered an opportunity to explore what happens when seven elementary and middle schools in seven states attempt to foster a school-wide and lasting change in classroom practice. The schools all sought to implement service-learning as part of a nationwide network sponsored by the National Youth Leadership Council and funded by the DeWitt Wallace Readers' Digest Fund and the W. K. Kellogg Foundation. Service-learning is a experiential, largely youth-driven classroom pedagogy that integrates service into the academic curriculum and meets a genuine community need. The conceptual framework for this study sought to identify the deep structure of school change by focusing on the role that teachers' instructional mental models and professional learning communities played in implementation. Implementation was defined as both breadth (i.e., teachers' use) and longevity (i.e., institutionalization). The research design included both quantitative and qualitative measures. Three primary sources of data were used in the study—surveys given to all staff members, teacher and principal interviews with significant actors, and focus groups with key service-learning leaders and also non-users. The salient variables differed for implementation breadth and longevity. In understanding why some teachers used service-learning and some do not, users and non-users were not different by age, gender, years at their current school, or teacher commitment. What differentiated service-learning users was their mental models about the nature of teaching and learning. This teacher group also had higher levels of efficacy and displayed a pattern of instructional practices (e.g., using the internet, cooperative groups) that was different than non-users. Teachers who used service-learning also enjoyed a significantly higher level of professional learning community, but that significance was overshadowed by the importance of their beliefs. In the area of institutionalization, professional learning community but not mental models proved to be significant in supporting the long-term sustainability of service-learning. In a comparative case study of two schools, the stronger professional learning community was able to create greater agreement about a shared purpose, more support for change leadership, higher staff participation and ownership, more shared learning, less political conflict, less structural tensions, better communication, and more openness to change.

AB  - The integration of service learning and difficult dialogues pedagogy is one avenue for enhancing counseling psychology social justice training. We provide an illustration of this integrative model including advocacy and systems perspectives, and propose that the model can be applied to other service learning foci within counseling psychology training. The article presents an ongoing project that provides counseling graduate students the opportunity to implement skills in career and employment counseling with homeless and near homeless individuals, as well as to develop greater cultural sensitivity and humility. The model provides a structural framework for understanding poverty, homelessness, and bureaucratic systems of care as essential to knowledge, awareness, and skill development for social justice advocacy regarding social class and economic inequalities. Difficult dialogues are incorporated during pre-service, engagement, and debriefing stages of the training experience as a means of promoting best practices for social justice training in counseling psychology.

AB  - Educational programs in refugee camps are conceived mostly as emergency and temporary measures until refugees are either repatriated or resettled in a third country. While there are numerous primary and secondary education programs, only a few initiatives offer higher education for refugees while they are in camps. This chapter describes an initial evaluation of a post secondary course in Community Development in Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya, conducted as part of Jesuit Commons: Higher Education at the Margins (JC: HEM). The findings confirm the need to look beyond an emergency relief framework and consider a developmental approach to education with refugees. As a result of participating in the course, our students felt a sense of empowerment and agency; more respect from their community; and increased confidence personally and in the workplace. The focus on diversity, intercultural learning, and building networks was important for our students. Introducing transformational and servant leadership theories as well as examples of global leaders made a lasting impression on students and that was reflected in the data and the students' continued involvement in their community. The chapter also offers insights that may be helpful to others interested in providing higher education to refugees in camps. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to examine different facets of trust in the political system or civic realm and how they are correlated to the expected civic or political engagement of young people. The nature and effects of trust in social and political institutions have been studied in adults, distinguishing between various types of trust (in institutions compared with more generalized trust in people). Few studies have focused on how trust affects the political socialization of children and adolescents, who are in the process of developing their attitudes towards government and other social institutions. This analysis uses data collected in 1999 from the IEA Civic Education Study of 14-year-olds to examine trust at three levels?trust in institutions with which individuals have little or no daily contact (those delegated as representatives in institutions such as the national legislature), trust in institutions with whose representatives individuals interact frequently (schools), and trust in other people. First in this analysis, levels of these three types of trust are compared in five democracies whose levels of political stability vary (Bulgaria, Chile, Colombia, England and the United States). Second, correlates of individuals' levels of trust (including school climate and experiences with family) are examined. Third, trust, civic knowledge, school experiences, and family variables are used to predict levels of three types of civic or political engagement (voting, conventional political participation that goes beyond voting, and community participation). Levels of trust relate to the stability of democracy in the countries examined and to participation, suggesting a ?threshold? of trustworthiness which a political system needs to establish in order to foster civic and political participation in young people. Additionally, different types of civic engagement are influenced differentially by trust and by other aspects of experience in schools.

AB  - Reviews the book The Psychology of Citizenship and Civic Engagement, by S. Mark Pancer (see record [rid]2015-03901-000[/rid]). The book considers a wide range of topics, and includes brief discussions of the ways in which developmental psychology, social psychology, community psychology, and political psychology contribute to understanding citizenship and civic engagement. Other strengths of the book include its positive focus on characteristics such as self-efficacy and sense of community, which may be enhanced through civic engagement activities. Some weaknesses are identified, in particular the focus on studies conducted in Canada and the U.S. without sufficient attention to the role of social or political context in civic engagement, especially in other parts of the world. The book could serve as a starting point for developing an enhanced research agenda for psychologists interested in this area. The reviewers, a U.S. developmental psychologist and a Polish social psychologist, suggest that this agenda for future research should consider the ways in which burgeoning social media and the social climate of schools are influential in civic engagement. The book’s intended audience, in addition to psychologists, includes educators, social welfare workers, youth workers, neighborhood organizers and those interested in service learning.

AB  - As charters and other autonomous schools grow to serve larger percentages of students both nationally and internationally, it is becoming increasingly important to understand how to best support and prepare leaders in this alternative setting. This study focuses on how charter school leaders perceived pre and in-service preparation and support. These perceptions matter because they may shape the early success, efficacy and commitment of leaders, which are critical issues given the higher than average principal turnover rates in charters. We analysed in-depth interviews with school leaders from independent (standalone) charter schools and those managed by a central management organisation and found that those leaders affiliated with Charter Management Organizations participated in a variety of formally designed pre-service and in-service learning experiences such as residency programs, mentoring, networking and ongoing coaching. By contrast, leaders in standalone charter schools largely directed their own learning – for example, joining informal networks with other nearby charter principals, or reading professional texts. For both kinds of leaders, the availability and quality of mentorship most significantly shaped the perceived quality of learning for all leaders.

AB  - The recent enactment of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) is prompting adult basic education and family literacy programs to more intentionally focus on supporting adult learners to transition to family sustaining employment. This change directly affects family literacy practitioners who primarily work with underskilled or undereducated adults living below the poverty line. Family literacy programs that include an adult basic education component are critically important because they can provide opportunities for parents to pursue additional training or education needed for skilled employment. To be competitive for skilled employment, many family literacy participants need guidance and intentional instruction in basic skills, English language development (in the case of immigrant students), and employability skills. In addition, family literacy practitioners can provide vital transition support to help participants find employment in an industry with a career path, postsecondary opportunities, or further training. This brief draws on lessons learned from an ongoing formative evaluation of the National Center for Families Learning (NCFL) Toyota Family Learning program. The evaluation seeks to identify promising practices for integrating employability skills development into programming that supports parent and child literacy and family learning--core principles of family literacy programming.

AB  - Social justice education aims to develop critical thinking about social inequities and social responsibility to increase civic engagement in high school youth. While high schools increasingly recognize the importance of social justice education, teachers are often initially under-prepared to teach this material, particularly about managing challenging emotions, and working with a group-processes as students work with social justice content and process. Psychologists are often asked to be diversity consultants or instructors, creating opportunities to contribute to social justice education. Drawing from implementation science, this paper describes a model of collaboration between university-based psychologists and high-school educators in providing a social justice course to high school students. Our education model enabled a multi-layered collaborative network that maximized the contributions of collaborators (i.e., Students, High School Teachers, Consultants, and Mentor) and enabled sustainability within the high school.

AB  - In Our Global Village is a project that originated when Barbara Cervone of What Kids Can Do traveled to Kambi Ya Simba, Tanzania, and spent time with the students at Awet Secondary School. Although the students were skeptical, Cervone persuaded them to write a book about their village, their lifestyles, and the challenges that the inhabitants face. The book, titled "In Our Village," was published, and now Cervone and the students challenge others around the globe to share the stories of their "villages." The project can easily be adapted to any school environment and any age group. In this article, the author describes how she, with the help of her fellow sixth-grade teachers, devised a process to guide her students through the In Our Global Village project.

AB  - The objective of this paper was to evaluate pre-registration nursing students' experiences of a pilot program that placed them in community based non-government organisations for clinical placement as part of a core mental health subject. Clinical placements that adopt a Service Learning model in primary health care environments are valuable to nursing students but are not commonly available in Australia. In order to enhance student exposure to primary health care models and support experiential learning about the social determinants of health, a pilot Service Learning program was designed to provide clinical placements in non government organisations. Qualitative data were collected through one focus group with program participants. The focus group was audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis of transcribed data was undertaken. The overarching theme identified was `new ways of seeing'. Three sub-themes - `learning outside the box', `confronting the real world' and `transformative experiences' - were also identified. The authors have concluded that nursing students in community organisations for clinical practicum facilitated valuable learning and generated professional and personal insight leading to increased understanding of the social determinants of health and increased awareness of mental health nursing in the community.

AB  - This research examined a new service-learning component introduced in the curriculum of a graduate school of psychology. A program evaluation was conducted to assess the Community Service Practicum (CSP) as a modality of teaching Socially Responsible Practice, a core competency of the Adler School of Professional Psychology (Adler School). A total of 49 students and 10 faculty from the Adler School completed three assessment instruments as part of the program evaluation of the CSP. These instruments included the SSASL (Shumer's Self-Assessment for Service-Learning), the SSSI (Sulliman Scale of Social Interest), and the CES (Community Engagement Survey). It was expected this study would provide information on the strengths/assets as well as weaknesses/barriers of the CSP, a new service learning component of the Adler School curriculum. In addition, the study examined any differences between student and faculty characteristics or their evaluation of the CSP. It was hypothesized that scores from the measure of service learning (SSASL) would be positively correlated to both the scores on a measure of social interest (SSSI) and the ratings on a measure of the actual activity level of those serving the community (CES). Results showed at least half of all participants scored all the items on the SSASL (with the exception of two items) as “meeting expectation”, “exceeding expectation”, or “exceptional”. Weak negative correlations were found between the SSASL and the CES, and should be looked at as trends only, informing future service learning evaluation questions. Lastly, results showed no correlation between social interest as measured by the SSSI and civic engagement. Future research on assessing service learning and social interest was discussed.

AB  - Though it is well-documented that experiential service learning activities can greatly aid in student learning, providing these activities can present various challenges for faculty, particularly when they are tied to consulting. Some of the issues this poses for faculty include identifying suitable projects for graduate students, meeting client demands while also instructing students, and the dual role of supervisor/professor. This article addresses these challenges and provides some potential solutions to the issues raised. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Substantive information is provided to help students recognize and treat clients suffering from chemical dependency. This concern cannot be limited to addictions specialists but must be shared with generalist social work practitioners. The ecological perspective is a relevant approach in the treatment of a disease that has strong physical and psychological ramifications. The following questions are addressed: Why should general BSW/MSW students need to know about alcoholism/addiction? What should the general or specializing social work student know of chemical dependency? What skills are required for assessment of chemical dependency intervention with individuals and families? How can the social work curriculum be shaped to provide adequate training for work with substance abusing clients?

AB  - Noncommunicable diseases account for 53% of deaths and 44% of disability-adjusted life years lost in India. Village health workers (VHWs) were trained in blood pressure (BP) and blood sugar (BS) measurement and assessed using a checklist. A total of 38 VHWs with a mean age of 44.8 years, schooling of 9.9 years, scored 10.0 (76.9%) for BP and 9.74 (69.6%) for BS. There was no difference in scores for education and age. It is possible to train VHWs in BP and BS measurement and utilize them for screening and monitoring of hypertension and diabetes in a noncommunicable disease care program.

AB  - To examine whether trajectories of participation in organized activities during the high school years and beyond (from ages 14 to 20) predicted outcomes at age 21 (externalizing problems, internalizing problems, civic engagement, number of years of education, and perception of physical health), 354 youths (60% girls) were surveyed annually over nine years. Four trajectories were found: (a) "Low and decreasing" (71%), (b) "Moderate and stable" (12%), (c) "High and decreasing after high school" (12%), and (d) "High and increasing after high school" (5%). Results revealed that the predicted outcomes varied according to the different trajectories. Pursuing high levels of activity participation beyond high school was especially beneficial with respect to externalizing problems and educational attainment.

AB  - Students in alternative education face several educational barriers and are more susceptible to risk factors, including the risk of educational failure, substance abuse, juvenile delinquency, homelessness, or teen pregnancy. After-school programs are an empirically demonstrated deterrent to these risks factors. The purpose of this project was to write a grant to obtain operational costs in order to re-implement an after-school program which was no longer funded for alternative education students. The amount requested would be used for a youth development-based model for the after-school program. Activities proposed consisted of tutoring, a built-in mentoring component, sports recreation, art modules, and community service-learning opportunities. Funds would be provided to ACCESS Safe Schools and Support Services, which strives to inspire and encourage its students to discover their strengths and develop character in order to maximize their academic achievement by providing them with opportunities to develop positive factors in their lives.

AB  - Critical service learning requires that students grapple with power even as they negotiate with discourses that frame service as transformative for others, without the reciprocal effect of service learners being transformed. To highlight microprocesses in power, this article uses figured worlds to explore the positional identities of service learners based on how participants viewed their experience, perceived the service site, and understood others' structural and biographical contexts. Three positional identities emerged from this inquiry: (1) service learner as role model, (2) service learner as future professional, and (3) service learner as beneficiary. Each successive positional identity demonstrated more critical and relational content. Positional identities that emphasized the service learner as a transformative agent featured more acriticality and less relationality than those that positioned the service learner as having been transformed. However, neither position explicitly addressed race, class, or other dimensions used to distribute power. This article illustrates the value that examining small moments of positioning might offer service learners and instructors as a reference point for their own criticality.

AB  - To cultivate a more informed citizenry, we argue that service-learning as a pedagogy has the potential to transform argumentative discourse by creating space for both compassion and rationality in a politically contested learning environment. The paper describes a service-learning experience where engagement with the prison population exposed students directly to issues surrounding rehabilitation. The study found that service-learning relationships between students and prisoners, coupled with reflective writing, provided students with new evidence to support claims about the need for rehabilitation programs in prisons.

AB  - Personal and professional experiences influence teachers' perceptions of their ability to implement environmental science curricula and to positively impact students' learning. The purpose of this study was twofold: to determine what influence, if any, an intensive field-based life science course and service learning had on preservice teachers' self-efficacy for teaching about the environment and to determine which aspects of the combined field-based course/service learning preservice teachers perceived as effective for enhancing their self-efficacy. Data were collected from class documents and written teaching reflections of 38 middle-level preservice teachers. Some participants (n = 18) also completed the Environmental Education Efficacy Belief Instrument at the beginning and end of the semester. Both qualitative and quantitative data analyses indicated a significant increase in PSTs' personal efficacies for environmental teaching, t(17) = 4.50, p = 0.000, d = 1.30, 95 % CI (0.33, 0.90), but not outcome expectancy, t(17) = 1.15, p = 0.268, d = 0.220, 95 % CI (-0.06, 0.20). Preservice teachers reported three aspects of the course as important for enhancing their self-efficacies: learning about ecological concepts through place-based issues, service learning with K-5 students and EE curriculum development. Data from this study extend prior work by indicating that practical experiences with students were not the sole factor in shaping PSTs' self-efficacy; learning ecological concepts and theories in field-based activities grounded in the local landscape also influenced PSTs' self-efficacy.

AB  - Honduras is a frequent destination for service-learning initiatives, including medical missions and study abroad programs. Much is known about how healthcare providers can prepare generally for medical missions and about how educators can prepare students for international immersion experiences, (i.e. study abroad programs) in countries such as Honduras. However, little is known specifically about the Honduran nurses with whom healthcare providers and students work. Yet such knowledge is important for developing collaborative partnerships between Honduran nurses and both study abroad and medical mission participants. In this article, the authors describe the current status of healthcare in Honduras and their study to learn about the work of Honduran nurses. They present their data analysis and findings, discuss Honduran nurses' challenges and internal rewards, and offer implications and suggestions for future international service learning initiatives. They conclude that understanding the experiences, perceptions, and needs of nurses in international settings is critical for developing collaborative partnerships that meet the goals for all the members of the partnership.

AB  - PACE Center for Girls is a unique program that provides academic and social services to girls ages 11 to 18. Girls eligible for PACE exhibit multiple health, safety, and delinquency risk factors, such as poor academic performance, exposure to abuse or violence, truancy, risky sexual behavior, and substance abuse. PACE seeks to help them onto a better path and reduce the likelihood of negative outcomes, such as involvement with the juvenile justice system. PACE operates 19 nonresidential, year-round program centers across the state of Florida. Girls attend PACE daily during normal school hours and receive academic and extensive social services in a gender-responsive environment--that is, one tailored to the needs of girls. Most girls plan to attend PACE for approximately one year; during this time, they receive academic instruction and advising, a life skills curriculum, assessment and care planning, individual and group counseling, and service learning and work readiness opportunities. Parental engagement and transition and follow-up services are also key components of the PACE program. When girls leave PACE, they often return to other schools in their communities to complete their secondary education. This executive summary describes the PACE Center for Girls, PACE's evaluation, and key findings from MDRC's ongoing evaluation of 14 PACE centers. [For the full report, see ED574048.]

When girls leave PACE, they often return to other schools in their communities to complete their secondary education. This report presents implementation research findings from MDRC's ongoing evaluation of 14 PACE centers. Key findings include: (1) The PACE program model, defined through both general program principles and a detailed manual, was implemented consistently across multiple locations; (2) PACE incorporated gender-responsive programming into all services through a focus on safety and relationships, an emphasis on recognizing and building on girls' individual strengths, and an awareness of the effects of trauma; (3) Girls who attend PACE tend to be low-income, and they often struggle with school and have a range of other health, safety, and delinquency risk factors; and (4) PACE differed from the traditional school environment by offering smaller classes, access to frequent individual academic advising and counseling, life skills programming, and connections to other services in the community, such as transportation or health care. Three appendices include: (1) Supplementary Tables on Sample Member Characteristics and Risk Factors; (2) CLASS-Secondary Observations; and (3) Data Collection and Analysis.

AB  - This paper reports on the assessment of initial data from an ongoing, award-winning service learning project called "Computer Training for Persons with Intellectual Disabilities." The project was researched, designed, and implemented by Masters in Library Science (MLIS) students at a large southeastern university. The two explicit goals of the project were to assess the effectiveness of the core curriculum in preparing students to undertake such a project and to provide technology literacy to clients with intellectual disabilities. However, the three implicit goals were to benefit the students, the clients, and the community partner through the process of engagement. The data reported are based on the first eighteen months of the project and are gathered from an exercise mapping the students' perceptions of the usefulness of the core curriculum, their written reflections concerning their participation in the project, and their records concerning client progress through the instruction. The student data are corroborated through an interview session with the community partner. The methods and results reflect a qualitative text analysis protocol since the first phase of the project was exploratory and the population was limited. Quantitative data reflect only simple descriptive statistics due to sample size and lack of comparative data. Results indicate that the goals of the original project are being met, and other corollary effects, such as students' attitudes concerning underrepresented populations were offected positively and constructively We also identify necessary revisions and challenges as the project progresses, and numerous avenues for further research.

AB  - Our world is becoming more interconnected through international commerce, new technological developments, and vast communications systems. As a result, the ability to successfully communicate and interact in this global environment is of critical importance. Thus, institutions of higher education are actively developing programs to address the challenges of a new interconnected world through programs that include intercultural education. At the vanguard of such institutional efforts is the development and expansion of study abroad programs, specifically in the area of short-term international service learning. As these programs expand, it becomes important that research and analysis around such programs also develops. To fill the gap in the existing literature, the focus of this study is an exploration of the perceived effects of an international arts-focused service learning program from the perspective of program participants who traveled to East Africa. The research design is a basic qualitative study utilizing Chickering and Reisser's seven vectors of student development and Bennett's model of intercultural sensitivity as a theoretical framework to explore the perceived identity development and intercultural development of the six participants from their perspectives. The results of the study indicate a clear connection between the international service learning program and participants' perspectives related to identity and intercultural development. The results of the study also suggest that after a period of reflection, participants are able to more accurately describe the experience and its effects on their lives. Furthermore, the results suggest that the reflection process facilitates participants' ability to resolve issues that may be experienced at reentry, such as confusion about the trip's meaning and questions regarding life choices. Recommendations for future study are suggested in the areas of reciprocity, group dynamics, heritage seeking, and the reflection process.

AB  - This study relies on qualitative inquiry methods to explore students' notions of community as first step to implementing service learning. Various procedures were utilized to ensure triangulation of data; pre and post test data, videotape transcription, student work, third party observation notes, and my personal notes and reflections. Students' definitions, perceptions, and feelings about their community and its problems were explored in depth using various group and individual activities as well as games and discussions.

He argues that traveling like an anthropologist allows for a great deal of creativity due to the interaction of diverse cultures. He presents his belief that service learning trips by college students are often a waste of valuable resources. He also comments that making an effort to learn the local language can teach individuals a lot about themselves.

AB  - Active learning techniques are generally considered to be any classroom activities in which students become an active participant in learning, instead of a passive listener to a lecture. Service learning activities are generally experiential (real life) and reflective problem-based learning activities in which students enrolled in an academic course provide a needed service to a community partner. In the fall semester of 2016, one section of a calculus-based Physics I course included both active learning and service learning components. One of the several active learning activities used in this course was that demonstrations, traditionally performed by the instructor, were performed by the students for an audience of seventh- and eighth-graders. Prior to the presentations, the groups of students met with the instructor to learn and practice the demonstrations. After perfecting their presentations, the students invited seventh- and eighth-graders from an inner city school to a "Day of Science," where they presented the demonstrations for part of the day. This paper reports on the active learning and service learning activities involved in the "Day of Science" and analyzes the results.

AB  - Objective. To develop and validate the Assessment, Development, Assurance Pharmacist's Tool (ADAPT), an instrument for pharmacists and student pharmacists to use in developing and implementing health promotion programs. Methods. The 36-item ADAPT instrument was developed using the framework of public health's 3 core functions (assessment, policy development, and assurance) and 10 essential services. The tool's content and usage was assessed and conducted through peer-review and initial validity testing processes. Results. Over 20 faculty members, preceptors, and student pharmacists at 5 institutions involved in planning and implementing health promotion initiatives reviewed the instrument and conducted validity testing. The instrument took approximately 15 minutes to complete and the findings resulted in changes and improvements to elements of the programs evaluated. Conclusion. The ADAPT instrument fills a need to more effectively plan, develop, implement, and evaluate pharmacist-directed public health programs that are evidence-based, high-quality, and compliant with laws and regulations and facilitates documentation of pharmacists' contributions to public health.

AB  - Integrating engineering practices into service-learning is the focus of the EPICS Program The goal of EPICS High and its curriculum is to engage high school students in the fields of engineering and technology while meeting a critical educational need of providing hands-on engineering and technical design opportunities. Key elements of the program include: teacher professional development; engineering mentors and support; and STEM and computer science content (EPICS Program students apply their knowledge to meet real needs). The EPICS Program has the potential to play a prominent role in addressing many current issues facing today's communities by providing not-for-profit organizations--such as community service agencies, schools, museums, and local government offices--the creation, implementation, and delivery of technology resources needed to improve services.

AB  - This article attempts two tasks. First, to clarify how the claim that colleges and universities may “shove religion down students’ throats” has a historical background. Second, to indicate how pedagogical strategies—like service learning, discussions, paper revisions, and “Just in Time Teaching” exercises—can be used in ways that both effectively teach theology and address the claim of students that classes in theology are coercive.

AB  - Service-learning is a form of experiential education in which students apply the knowledge and skills they learn in the classroom to carry out projects that meet a human or community need Service-learning has been integrated into an `Introduction to Mechanical Engineering' course to enhance learning of first-year engineering students and to meet the need for more resources in local middle-schools to promote active, hands-on learning of mathematics and science. Student assessment results over a three-year period demonstrate that service-learning is an effective strategy for first-year mechanical engineering students to learn and practice engineering design and teamwork, and to become aware of civic responsibility. Service-learning provides engineering students the opportunity and motivation to develop the `softer' skills described in Engineering Criteria 2000 and complements the traditional approach to design projects, in which students interact primarily with technical personnel.

AB  - The contemporary business world demands adaptive individuals (Friedman & Wyman, 2005). Adaptation is essential for any life transition. It often involves developing coping mechanisms, strategies, and seeking of social support. Adaptation occurs in many settings from moving to a new culture, taking a new job, starting or finishing an educational program, or transitioning in or out of an interpersonal relationship. For managers, an understanding of how to help individuals to adapt becomes imperative. Transition to graduate management school, often after years of working, characterizes a life change for many individuals (Goplerud, 1980; Griffiths, Winstanley, & Gabriel, 2005; Mallinckrodt & Leong, 1992). A better understanding of how to improve adaptability and the factors that predict effective adaptation has becomes a central focus of graduate management education efforts. However, little is known about how students adapt to graduate school. Drawing on experiential learning theory (Kolb, 1984), learning how to adapt involves the integrated functioning of the whole person- thinking, feeling, perceiving, and behaving. During the learning process, to reconcile dialectically opposed learning modes and successfully adapt, it often elicits negative emotional reactions and stress (Kayes, 2002; Thoits, 1986; Vince, 1998). For graduate management students, the unique demands of the academic environment further confound the stress from other domains of life. For many of these students, effective adaptation may predict how they perceive their overall educational experience. Based on a resource vs. demand view of adaptation, social support is proposed as a critical situational determinant of graduate adaptation because it helps students reduce uncertainty and enhance mastery over the environment (Albrecht & Adelman, 1987; Thoits, 1995). Drawing on multiple bodies of literature, including social support theory (Cohen & Wills, 1985a), social learning theory (Bandura, 1997), and the adaptation literature, this study provides a better understanding of graduate stress, social support, and self-efficacy and how they relate to graduate student adaptation. The study utilized a longitudinal design and data were collected from 150 MBAs at the middle and end of the fall semester, 2011. I used Partial Least Squares (PLS) to test hypothesis. Controlling for individual characteristics, social support was found to have direct, positive impacts on learning adaptation, stress adaptation and graduate satisfaction. In addition, social support had indirect effects on these adaptive outcomes through the mediation of perceived stress and academic self-efficacy. Despite the direct and indirect effects of social support, the moderating effect of social support was not found, suggesting social support is effective for all level of stress. Finally, the examination of type-specific effects of social support indicated that while some types of support were beneficial for adaptive outcomes, others had deleterious impacts. The study contributes to the social support literature by comprehensively examining different effects of social support in a management education setting. Also, the study contributed to the literature on adaptation in general and Pulakos et al.'s (2000, 2002) work in particular by examining social support as a situational predictor of adaptive performance. Finally, it offered insight into how to facilitate students' adaptation through adequate types of support and efficacy enhancement.

AB  - Language teacher identity (LTI) has gained prominence in second language education in the recent two decades, particularly the complexity of identity construction in the changing context shaped by local and global forces. This study adds to recent work on LTI by exploring how Asian teachers of English as a foreign language (EFL) constructed their professional identities in the context of service-learning. Adopting the theoretical framework based on the perspectives of identity-in-practice and identity-in-discourse, the present research investigates eight Taiwanese preservice teachers' identity construction, as they worked with their American collaborators to teach English to Taiwanese elementary school pupils. Data analysis reveals that initially, as the preservice teachers drew upon and negotiated two dominant discourses which are associated with educational models in Confucian heritage culture (CHC) and American culture, they experienced conflict between their desired identities and the identities available to them. However, when the preservice teachers participated in relevant social practices from their service-learning experiences, they managed to reconcile identity conflict by appropriating discourses, which led to empowerment in identity development. Based on the findings, this study discusses implications for future research and the provision of support in preservice teacher education to handle identity conflict and facilitate identity development.

AB  - This study investigated the influence of a service-learning component in an advertising course, specifically examining its ability to enrich advertising knowledge, build students' portfolios, and influence students' community engagement after graduation. The research revealed that service-learning positively affects students' understanding of advertising principles and concepts; students are more likely to try harder and dedicate more time to an authentic project; participation in an authentic project provides ethos for students' portfolios; and students have the opportunity to experience other communities and the dynamics of their residents. Documenting the outcomes of service-learning is central to promoting the value of community-engaged teaching in the field of advertising education.

This article defines community service learning, discusses its importance to business as well as higher education, and describes three community service learning projects. Students in these projects taught elementary students, designed a computer system for a community nonprofit, and developed accounting systems for university divisions. In doing so, they enhanced their understanding of classroom theories and communication skills through service-learning.

AB  - Service learning is a pedagogy that combines classroom instruction with community service. Its goals are to provide students with learning experiences that reinforce the curriculum, improve students' personal and interpersonal development, and connect students to the needs of the community (Jacoby et al., 2003). Since the mid 1980s, the number of service-learning courses offered by faculty in higher education has steadily increased, and research indicates that service learning yields significant gains in student learning outcomes (Eyler & Giles, 1999; Astin et al., 2000). While the definition of seryice learning includes civic learning (Bringle & Hatcher, 1996; Howard, 2001), in most service-learning courses, the focus remains mainly on the academic learning outcomes of students. A common concern is the lack of civic learning goals in service-learning courses (Saltmarsh, 2005; Musil, 2003; Kirlin, 2002). Civic learning is the development of citizenship skills, values and knowledge in students resulting from civic engagement. In order to more effectively utilize the power of service-learning, faculty may seek to integrate civic learning goals into their service-learning courses. Through the use of qualitative research techniques, this study aims to uncover civic dimensions in service-learning courses. The unit of analysis is faculty who integrate civic learning into service learning. Twelve faculty members are interviewed to discern the professional and interpersonal contexts of their teaching that influence the civic aspects of their service-learning course. Data is collected from four professors at each of the three institutions of higher education selected for this study. By examining course design and learning goals, this research is significant because it reveals new understandings that are instructive to those concerned about the civic engagement of students while reinvigorating the civic mission of higher education. It contributes to filling the gap in the current literature and enables scholars to link research and teaching in the context of civic engagement in American democracy, as well as providing a foundation on which further research can be built.

AB  - School-based childhood obesity prevention programs have grown in response to reductions in child physical activity (PA), increased sedentariness, poor diet, and soaring child obesity rates. Multiple systematic reviews indicate school-based obesity prevention/treatment interventions are effective, yet few studies have examined the school nurse role in obesity interventions. Building on a previous study, this study examines a refined health messaging (Let's Go 5-2-1-0) program delivered to fourth and fifth graders (n = 72) by a school nurse with reinforcement on-site health coaching by senior nursing students. Two nursing schools and two elementary schools participated. Measures of PA, body mass index percentile, and self-reported health habits were collected at baseline (School A, September 2009 and School B, January 2010) and end of year (April 2010 for both schools). Findings included statistically significant increases in PA levels and improvements in child-reported health habits. School nurses can influence obesity prevention. Further research on adoption of school nurse-led obesity interventions is warranted.

AB  - Service-learning is a relatively new pedagogy which uses service activities to support traditional teaching methods, giving students a better understanding and ability to remember and carry out functions/skills taught in class. Although its use in an HRD course has rarely been reported in the literature, the teaching methods appear to be ideal for instilling in students the skills and/or traits necessary to be successful in HRD (e.g., intellectual versatility, adult learning insight, and industry understanding).

AB  - This document discusses how service learning has developed over the past century in its practices from involvement in volunteerism to active civic engagement. It is so beneficial to both learners and the community that many educators and government leaders believe it should be a required component in the educational career of all students. The findings from a study about Service Learning and Problem-Based Learning concluded that student and teacher motivation substantially increased when combining Problem Based Learning (PBL) with Service Learning in the Communication classroom. Reciprocity of motivations exists between the teacher and her/his students. Students' communication skills improve, having successfully engaged in collaborative writing, speaking, and listening processes, and public speaking opportunities and additionally students report transfer of communication skills to other settings. The data shows that this process causes students to move through all five levels of Bloom's (1964) Affective Taxonomy. By combining two pedagogies, students met or exceeded cognitive learning outcomes. It is important to understand the critical role of the teacher in combing the two pedagogies effectively because the immersion of the teacher in the student endeavors makes him/her a stakeholder in the project's outcomes.

AB  - Discussions of service learning emphasize opportunities for students to gain real world experience through work in community contexts. Less attention, however, has been given to the role of technology in these projects. Incorporating critical reflection on the rhetorical and social dimensions of technology throughout students' collaborations with clients can help to situate their practices within larger public contexts. This sort of reflection can encourage student engagement on a variety of levels: professional, rhetorical, intellectual, personal, and civic.

AB  - This document contains materials about and from the School-to-Work for Lancaster County Adults program. This program was a special demonstration project designed to develop a school-to-work (STW) model for adult learners. In an alternative high school setting, the program combined academic instruction, career exploration and planning, and employment skill development through a mix of work-based and service learning. The final project report details how 18 of the 24 students enrolled in the high school-level STW program, which was altered to "front load" the STW and service learning experiences included in the program and which featured an open-entry/open-exit design based on self-paced, competency-based learning. Appendixes constituting approximately 90% of the document contain the following: follow-up survey for noncompleters; STW self-paced materials (progress form, learning activities, student handouts, and core skills list for lessons on communication skills, personal appearance and presentation, human relations skills, code of conduct at work, time management and organizational skills, safety, general computer and equipment skills, and career exploration and awareness); service learning group workshop materials; service learning service site materials; and materials from a career development conference presentation, "School-to-Work Strategies for the Adult Learner" (Diane Tyson, Rhonda Rumbaugh).

AB  - The founders of Expeditionary Learning Outward Bound drew on the metaphor of a wilderness expedition to develop a framework for curriculum design. During "learning expeditions," teachers and students pursue long-term intellectual investigations build around significant projects and performances. The investigations take students out into the world and bring the world into the classroom, and they often provide students with opportunities to serve the wider community. This book assembles the stories of teachers who, for the past several years, have been immersed in creating and teaching curriculum that takes the form of such expeditions. The 12 stories were written by teachers to serve as the starting point for ongoing conversations about developing purposeful, intellectually rigorous investigations. The introduction highlights some of the key elements of an expeditionary curriculum: creating strong connections to the outside world, joining relevance and complexity, using reflection and assessment, and setting high standards. The appendix highlights the design principles of Expeditionary Learning Outward Bound and provides information on the program. (LMI)

AB  - This paper reports on a research study that draws on the perceptions of students, tutors, field centre coordinators and central management to evaluate the support services provided to students in the National Teachers’ Institute’s distance teacher training programme. Within a conceptual framework that built upon models of teaching and learning at_A_distance, both quantitative and qualitative approaches were used for data collection and analysis. Although the major forms of support provided were found to be relevant to students, the study highlights the need to improve the current level of student satisfaction by strategies that will improve the supply of course materials and tutorial support, enhance students networking and exploit the use of multimedia.

AB  - People's attitudes towards ethnicity and culture are formed in their youth. Elementary school students have a great proclivity to develop a positive outlook towards diversity when appropriately guided by teachers and school administrators. As educators aim to create an integrated and harmonious society, they need to recognize that these early years are a critical period for teaching tolerance and interrupting the cycle of racism and discrimination. In this article, the author discusses how social studies teachers can provide young students with opportunities to take classroom learning and apply it to the real world. She suggests teachers to get the students involved in service learning, which puts valuable content knowledge and skills from the social studies curriculum to work in the larger social world. She stresses that a better way to teach civics to students is to engage them in hosting a naturalization ceremony. Hosting a community-wide naturalization ceremony requires a great deal of planning and preparation. With the help of many community leaders, the author describes how she and her grandmother created Citizenship Counts, a non-profit organization that provides support and training to schools as they implement the organization's program.

AB  - Service learning has been proposed as a way to create a meaningful environment for the language acquisition process (Weldon & Trautmann, 2003). As a pedagogical tool for second language acquisition the greatest benefit of utilizing service learning activities is that it creates connections to the target language community and provides authentic experiences for target language use (Long, 2003; Morris, 2001). However, there is no detailed record of how service learning actually impacts language and culture acquisition (Bloom, 2008). This multiple case study describes the ways in which four advanced Spanish learners engaged with service learning and the influence of this activity on their ability to communicate in the target language. Each case provides triangulated descriptions of what actually occurred when students went onsite to engage in service learning activities, what their personal reflections were on the experience, and how they carried this experience back into their classroom and academic work. Qualitative analysis of onsite and in-class observations, face-to-face interviews, electronic journal entries, and reflective written reports revealed the importance of the nature of interactions and language use in service learning for second-language acquisition. Where the service was more academically aligned and offered repeated interactions in the target language, students were more likely to advance their language skills. However, though the service may provide an important community contribution, all service learning did not prove equal in its ability to instruct and align with desired educational outcomes.

AB  - Higher Education gives substantial rhetorical attention to advancing global citizenship, preparing global citizens, and readying leaders for a globalized world. Record numbers of students are participating in study abroad and numerous institutions are claiming to offer exceptional programs in under-represented study abroad destinations that offer special insights on ethical global participation. Yet few institutions have offered clear conceptualizations or operationalizations of global citizenship. If U.S. Higher Education is to remain relevant in the 21st Century, it must prepare students for global understanding and participation. Institutions must also be clear on what they mean with such terminology and how they evaluate their efforts. This article offers a theoretically grounded curricular approach to education for global citizenship through global servicelearning courses offered in many disciplines and in several different destination countries. Following a theoretical account of this particular global citizenship education approach, the article suggests a quantitative methodology for evaluating a portion of global citizenship education outcomes. Comparing students at a Research 1 Institution who (1) participated in composition courses, who (2) attended global service-learning courses, and who (3) attended global service-learning courses integrated with a global citizenship learning curriculum, the author concludes that the third population was exposed to the only intervention with statistically significant global civic awareness, efficacy, and engagement effects. Global service-learning participation without clear global citizenship curricular integration did not demonstrate increased global awareness, efficacy, or engagement.

AB  - Background Abstinence-plus ( comprehensive) interventions promote sexual abstinence as the best means of preventing HIV, but also encourage condom use and other safer-sex practices. Some critics of abstinence-plus programs have suggested that promoting safer sex along with abstinence may undermine abstinence messages or confuse program participants; conversely, others have suggested that promoting abstinence might undermine safer-sex messages. We conducted a systematic review to investigate the effectiveness of abstinence-plus interventions for HIV prevention among any participants in high-income countries as defined by the World Bank. Methods and Findings Cochrane Collaboration systematic review methods were used. We included randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials of abstinence-plus programs for HIV prevention among any participants in any high-income country; trials were included if they reported behavioural or biological outcomes. We searched 30 electronic databases without linguistic or geographical restrictions to February 2007, in addition to contacting experts, hand-searching conference abstracts, and cross-referencing papers. After screening 20,070 abstracts and 325 full published and unpublished papers, we included 39 trials that included approximately 37,724 North American youth. Programs were based in schools ( 10), community facilities ( 24), both schools and community facilities ( 2), health care facilities ( 2), and family homes ( 1). Control groups varied. All outcomes were self-reported. Quantitative synthesis was not possible because of heterogeneity across trials in programs and evaluation designs. Results suggested that many abstinence-plus programs can reduce HIV risk as indicated by self-reported sexual behaviours. Of 39 trials, 23 found a protective program effect on at least one sexual behaviour, including abstinence, condom use, and unprotected sex ( baseline n = 19,819). No trial found adverse program effects on any behavioural outcome, including incidence of sex, frequency of sex, sexual initiation, or condom use. This suggests that abstinence-plus approaches do not undermine program messages encouraging abstinence, nor do they undermine program messages encouraging safer sex. Findings consistently favoured abstinence-plus programs over controls for HIV knowledge outcomes, suggesting that abstinence-plus programs do not confuse participants. Results for biological outcomes were limited by floor effects. Three trials assessed self-reported diagnosis or treatment of sexually transmitted infection; none found significant effects. Limited evidence from seven evaluations suggested that some abstinence-plus programs can reduce pregnancy incidence. No trial observed an adverse biological program effect. Conclusions Many abstinence-plus programs appear to reduce short-term and long-term HIV risk behaviour among youth in high-income countries. Programs did not cause harm. Although generalisability may be somewhat limited to North American adolescents, these findings have critical implications for abstinence-based HIV prevention policies. Suggestions are provided for improving the conduct and reporting of trials of abstinence-plus and other behavioural interventions to prevent HIV.

AB  - Background Abstinence-plus interventions promote sexual abstinence as the best means of preventing acquisition of HIV, but also encourage safersex strategies (eg condom use) for sexually active participants. Objectives To assess the effects of abstinence-plus programs for HIV prevention in high-income countries. Search strategy We searched 30 electronic databases (eg CENTRAL, PubMed, EMBASE, AIDSLINE, PsycINFO) ending February 2007. Cross-referencing, hand-searching, and contacting experts yielded additional citations. Selection criteria We included randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials evaluating abstinence-plus interventions in high-income countries ( as defined by the World Bank). Interventions were any efforts that encouraged sexual abstinence as the best means of HIV prevention, but also promoted safer sex. Results were self-reported biological outcomes, behavioral outcomes, and HIV knowledge. Data collection and analysis Three reviewers independently appraised 20070 citations and 325 full-text papers for inclusion and methodological quality; 39 evaluations were included. Due to heterogeneity and data unavailability, we presented the results of individual studies instead of a meta-analysis. Main results Studies enrolled 37724 North American youth; participants were ethnically diverse. Programs took place in schools ( 10), community facilities ( 24), both schools and community facilities ( 2), healthcare facilities ( 2), and family homes ( 1). Median final follow-up occurred 12 months after baseline. Results showed no evidence that abstinence-plus programs can affect self-reported sexually transmitted infection (STI) incidence, and limited evidence that programs can reduce self-reported pregnancy incidence. Results for behavioral outcomes were promising; 23 of 39 evaluations found a significantly protective intervention effect for at least one behavioral outcome. Consistently favorable program effects were found for HIV knowledge. No adverse effects were observed. Several evaluations found that one version of an abstinence-plus program was more effective than another, suggesting that more research into intervention mechanisms is warranted. Methodological strengths included large samples and statistical controls for baseline values. Weaknesses included under-utilization of relevant outcomes, self-report bias, and analyses neglecting attrition and clustered randomization. Authors' conclusions Many abstinence-plus programs appear to reduce short-term and long-term HIV risk behavior among youth in high-income countries. Evidence for program effects on biological measures is limited. Evaluations consistently show no adverse program effects for any outcomes, including the incidence and frequency of sexual activity. Trials comparing abstinence-only, abstinence-plus, and safer-sex interventions are needed.

AB  - The intent of this article is to share my research endeavors in order to raise awareness of issues relative to what and how we teach as a means to spark interest in applying the scholarship of teaching and learning to what we do as faculty in communication sciences and disorders (CSD). My own interest in teaching and learning emerged rather abruptly after I introduced academic service-learning (AS-L) into one of my graduate courses (Stevens, 2002). To better prepare students to enter our profession, I have provided them with unique learning opportunities working with various community partners including both speech-language pathologists (SLPs) and teachers who supported persons with severe communication disorders.

AB  - This conceptual article explores the merging of service learning and cultural immersion. It presents, to social work educators, the use of "cultural service immersion" with Indigenous peoples in order to move students from knowledge to understanding the breadth of Indigenous peoples culture, ultimately increasing skills and cultural sensitivity. Challenges in recruiting Indigenous social work students has been long standing in social work education. While continued efforts are made to recruit Indigenous social work students, efforts can be made to increase ally support. Social work students need to understand the imprint and effects the social work profession has left on Indigenous peoples. Cultural service immersion is a method that can provide transformational learning for students, which can increase ally support.

AB  - Research on the effects of intergenerational service-learning has more often focused on outcomes for students than on outcomes for elders served by those programs. The purpose of this qualitative study was to investigate the effects of an intergenerational service-learning program on elders living in a small Midwestern community. Service-learning programs may be of particular value for rural-dwelling elders because of the paucity of health and human services in rural areas and the outmigration of the young to urban locations. University students were involved in friendly visiting, reminiscence, oral history, and recreational activities with 43 elders in four community settings: a congregate meal site, a semi-independent living setting, an assisted living setting, and a nursing home. Age of respondents ranged from 60 to 98, with most being in their 80s and 90s. Elders were asked to discuss positive and negative reactions to the service-learning, what students and elders had contributed to each other, and suggestions for improvement. Interviews were transcribed and major themes identified using the method of constant comparison (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). Major themes that emerged from the content analysis were the benefits of personal interaction and companionship, increased intergenerational understanding, and being able to share life experiences. A large majority of elders thought the project should be continued. Suggestions included better advance preparation of students and elders and more attention to termination issues. Implications for further development of intergenerational programs are discussed.

AB  - As society changes and technology advances, the educator's need to increase engagement in the classroom is paramount. Modified teaching channels must be incorporated into the stale classroom experienced by previous generations. The current research explores experiential learning, specifically service learning, as the communication channel for course material. At a faith-based institution valuing Christ, community, scholarship, and service, intentionally integrating these principles into the subject matter can be a challenge. As a result, a more wholistic approach to the course design was sought. The outcome was a comprehensive learning activity which supported the discipline material and more fully engaged students into the service project.

AB  - Service-learning is an instructional strategy that links academic learning with the community's needs. It provides opportunities for learning to occur outside of the traditional classroom setting. Service-learning promotes students' abilities to become critical and reflective thinkers as they apply learned concepts to relevant issues in their communities. This qualitative research study used a phenomenological approach to describe the essence of the service-learning experiences for high school students. This study explored students' perceptions of the benefits they receive from service-learning participation and their desire to participant in service-learning. The study also examined the connection between high school students' participation in service requirements as a direct link to the development or enhancement of their character. Participants in the study were juniors and seniors in high school. The study participants were immersed in service-learning experiences and were working toward earning their Service-Learning Diploma. Data were collected from face to face interviews, focus group sessions, and field observations. These multiple methods of data collection were used to gain an in-depth view of the essence of service-learning participation for the study participants. Data analysis revealed common themes which expressed the benefits high school students received from their participation in service-learning. The research findings revealed that service-learning participation enhanced the development of the study participants' interpersonal skills, leadership, career awareness, academic development, and their moral and performance character. The findings also revealed that the study participants desired to make a difference in their community. The benefits of service-learning from the lens of the participants' evidences the positive impact service-learning participation has on the lives of high school students.

AB  - Many students experience mathematics as a neutral entity, without understanding its impact on social justice and equity. Students must understand that mathematics and statistics are powerful tools for creating social change, and that students themselves are capable to enact positive social change through their mathematical abilities. In this paper, we discuss how we have integrated both service learning and mathematical consulting into a single course to promote civic engagement by mathematics majors through professional applications. We outline methods to engage with community partners to create consulting projects for students while integrating discussions of professionalism, practice, ethics, and social justice into the classroom. We provide qualitative evidence that the integration of service learning and consulting empowers mathematics students to make a difference by doing social justice with mathematics.

AB  - Past research has demonstrated consequences of service-learning and impacts of service-learning experiences on students and community members in domestic and international settings. Researchers have this topic in developing countries; however, few have studied international students' perspectives on doing service-learning in a developed country. This qualitative study aims to determine how students recognize their lives, and lives of community members in need are impacted as a result of their Amizade Global Service-Learning program in the United States. The investigation employs Cone and Harris' (1996) conceptual framework of service-learning to examine interpersonal, sociocultural, and psychological components of the experience. Data were collected using three focus groups and two individual interviews with students, three interviews with adult youth workers, and three audio recorded reflection sessions. Participants included two separate groups from Ireland who did service-learning in the United States. Results indicated international service-learning in the United States positively influenced students' relationship development, leadership, behavior, and tolerance. Students also dispelled stereotypes and subsequently partook in and planned future altruistic endeavors.

AB  - This study implemented a career intervention aimed at training people about the competencies required to have a protean career orientation. Using the theoretical foundations of the protean career, two training sessions were developed reflecting the self-directed and values-driven dimensions of the theory. The differential effectiveness of training in one, both, or none of these sessions was explored for a number of career-related outcomes. Two studies were conducted using employed MBA students. Study 1, using a sample of 444 participants, developed and validated the 5-item Career Values Awareness Scale (Unite, 2012) that determines the extent to which individuals are aware of their career values. Evidence suggests that career-values awareness is situated within the protean career context and particularly in that of the values-driven dimension. Evidence also suggests that higher career-values awareness supports positive relationships between a protean orientation and career self-efficacy. Similar results were also found for career planning. Using a sample of 180 participants, Study 2 found that training using reflection, experiential learning, and discrepancy identification can improve career decision-making self-efficacy, adaptability, career-values awareness, and career planning. More specifically, training related to career values improves career decision-making self-efficacy and adaptability; training related to the skills component of the protean career improves career-values awareness. Future research ideas on the synergistic nature of the self-directed and values-driven dimensions of the protean career are provided in light of these results, together with suggestions for improving the effectiveness of training such as this study implemented.

AB  - Political activism for healthcare workers is a crucial complement to clinical practice. Nurses are in a unique position to not only provide bedside care but also to advocate for change within the political arena and the community at large. Preparing professional nurses for community-based practice involving political activism and civic engagement requires developing and sustaining a philosophy that supports service learning and community partnerships. The concepts of service, community, collaboration, empowerment, and political activism are essential foundations. These ideas are inherent in educationally preparing nurses to meet the healthcare needs of individuals and communities. Many nursing students, however, seem either intimidated by or uninterested in the political aspects of professional nursing practice. The authors will describe an educational strategy embedded in a senior capstone course that involves an account of a senior nursing class's first experience in political involvement.

AB  - We investigated whether participation in a university-based, service learning mentoring program could affect college students' learning about social inequities and the effects of poverty. The program we examined combined four critical components: (a) Mentor training, (b) mentoring youth on-site in their high-poverty environments, (c) mentors' ongoing reflecting, and (d) class discussion of issues related to poverty and social inequities. By analyzing students' ongoing reflective journals in relation to Kolb's learning cycle, we sought to determine (a) experiences students reported to engage in while mentoring and (b) the relation between students' experiences and learning about poverty. Mentees' input was obtained via interviews to corroborate mentors' perspectives. Based on findings, recommendations for the field are proposed.

AB  - This report describes measures and methods of data analysis and representation of a systemic approach to the assessment of curricular and pedagogical contributions to general education learning objectives. An existing system for student evaluation of teaching was transformed to enable faculty to designate the learning objectives of the course and students to evaluate the extent to which the course contributed to their self-appraised growth in intellectual skills. This systemic approach enables analysis at the level of the individual course and across courses with common learning objectives and pedagogical approaches. The utility of this system is demonstrated through assessing the differential contribution to general education learning objectives of curricular components and an innovative pedagogical approach that blends field-based research and service learning.

AB  - To meet Healthy People 2020 goals, health literacy must be included in health care program curricula. In a fully online graduate nursing course, an innovative service-learning activity asked students to collaborate in the creation of low-literacy patient education pamphlets for practice partners at a community rehabilitation facility. Involvement with community stakeholders such as support groups and interprofessional team members enhanced interdisciplinary educational outcomes. Through this innovative project-based activity, students were able to meet the clinical education and decision support needs of rehabilitation patients while translating academic coursework to support actual community needs.

Respondents in the survey were 141 deans of Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) accredited business schools in the United States and 71 heads of Australian commerce programs. Overall, student field-based consultancy is widely used in both countries. This indicates that it should be possible to implement international field-based consultancies between American and Australian business schools, which would, in turn, lead to increased potential for international study abroad for business students of both countries.

AB  - Purpose: To develop an evidenced-based service learning program for Japanese nursing students participating in volunteer activities in Thailand, we addressed the following questions: 1) what are the difficulties experienced by Japanese nursing students, and 2) what is the necessary information and support for the nursing student volunteers in this program?Methodology: Qualitative data was collected from 8 nursing students who participated in the volunteer activities, using a focus group discussion. They discussed their volunteer activities in an elementary school, home nursing, dengue campaign, nurse clinic and orphanage in Thailand in 2006. The four participating Thai nursing instructors responded to the questionnaire regarding the learning needs of the students and how to improve the program. Data was thematically analyzed.Result: Students difficulties were sorted into 4 categories: 1) Culture and language: dealing with garbage and homeless dogs on the street, for instance. 2) Attitude as a volunteer: observation or care? 3) Emotional/mental problems: heart-breaking farewell to orphans. 4) Nursing care: different ways of care between Japan and Thailand. Useful information for students was about culture, language, healthcare system and health problems in Thailand. Information about activities included the purpose and expected students' attitude and role were appreciated. Useful forms of support described by students were: reflection, discussion with other students and supervision by instructors.Requests from Thai instructors included information about the programs and nursing skills level of Japanese students. They also expected Japanese instructors to give necessary information about Thailand and to provide a support to the Japanese students in Thailand.Conclusion: Information about difficulties faced by Japanese nursing students participating Thailand-based volunteer activities, useful advance information and possible supports in the field can improve the service learning programs. The daily reflection form was developed with the assistance of students and already adopted in the program.

The goal of the project was to provide contextual application of HBSE theories and concepts by engaging students in semester-long intentional interaction with older adults. Qualitative evaluation of the oral history project found that students reported multiple benefits from participation. The authors attribute the project's positive outcomes to its service-learning nature as well as the unique and applied way in which it allowed students to learn mandated course content.

AB  - Service learning has long been touted as a useful experiential education approach in political science classes, especially for teaching civic education and community engagement in American government and politics courses. Though debated, the value of service learning includes higher student engagement in the material, expanded skill development, exposure to diversity and new experiences, and increased self-reflection. This article discusses the potential for incorporating service learning and its associated educational advantages in international relations (IR) oriented courses. Globalization, technology, increasing student interest in world affairs and growth in international advocacy organizations now enable instructors to create assignments that allow students to become active not just in local communities but also in the larger global community. ..PAT.-Unpublished Manuscript [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Conference Papers -- American Political Science Association is the property of American Political Science Association and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

AB  - Students in four upper division Sociology of the Family courses (N=198) participated in a Service Learning assignment for one semester. Students completed 10 hours of service at local non-profit organizations that provided services to families. Students were asked to volunteer with organizations whose mission covered concepts in class (e.g. poverty, children, elderly, abuse, or immigration). The goal of the service learning assignment was to help students make connections with concepts covered in class and "real life" situations. At the end of the semester students were asked to answer twelve questions about their experience. The questions asked students to evaluate the experience and to discuss the challenges and successes of service learning. Preliminary data analysis shows that students reported a variety of challenges, resistance, and positive outcomes in completing their service learning assignments. In addition, their use of the "sociological imagination" was also examined.

AB  - The United States of America's government relies on the people. Unfortunately, research illuminates a gradual decline in the civic and political participation among youth, ages 18-29, in the U.S. since the 1970s. While the decline takes shape in multiple forms other than voting, this article argues that teachers can improve students' civic engagement through the aide of social media. In order to achieve that goal, the article begins by defining civic engagement, especially within context of a digital age. Then describes three prominent classroom techniques for using social media found in the literature: micro-blogging, backchanneling, and virtual social networks. Finally, the article provides classroom-tested examples of how teachers can utilize the three techniques to promote the kind of civic and political engagement first defined.

AB  - This study explores the professionalization of a group of 28 pre-service teachers, using a qualitative case study design and reflective practice as the analytical framework. The pre-service teachers were involved in a service learning project at a local middle school in the U.S. where they designed and taught a content area lesson to English language learners (ELLs). After the lesson, the pre-service teachers analyzed their experience through a reflective essay assignment. Findings indicated that the pre-service teachers recognized the need to adapt their lessons for ELLs in varying degrees primarily in the areas of language and content support. Reflective practice as a component of the process of providing sheltered instruction of English should serve as an instrumental part of preparing teachers to work in diverse educational contexts.

AB  - Current research in teacher education emphasizes the urgent need for preservice teachers to be prepared with an understanding of the social context of schooling including the complex interactions of race, class, gender, and ability in K-12 classrooms (Gay, 1993; Cochran-Smith, 1995). This understanding is a component of critical consciousness, which emphasizes both emancipatory knowledge construction and a commitment to act transformatively on the conditions of schooling (Freire, 1970, 1973; Shor, 1992). Based on a democratic social orientation for education, the purpose of this study was to examine the extent to which "seeds" of critical consciousness developed in four preservice teachers as they constructed knowledge about teaching and learning over the course of three semesters. Initially, the preservice teachers were students in a two semester Professional Seminar series that involved service learning as a method for making connections between practical or "everyday knowledge" and teacher education content or "academic knowledge" (Vygotsky, 1978, 1986). The goal of the Professional Seminar series was to raise the awareness of preservice teachers to social issues, such as the effects of class, race, gender, and ability on the experiences and outcomes of schooling for K-12 students. This study continued through student teaching, held concurrently with a third semester Professional Seminar, in order to capture the early interactions of the preservice teachers in their student teaching placements. Changes in discourse, conceptual organization, and role elaboration were documented throughout the course of this study from interviews, course syllabi and requirements, and observations. The experiences of four preservice teachers were situated: (1) within the classroom context of the Professional Seminar series; (2) within the institutional context of a teacher education program emphasizing the social context of education and; (3) within the sociocultural context of teacher education reform.

AB  - This report provides a qualitative evaluation of Colorado's 56 Learn and Serve programs. It contains descriptions of 39 K-12 school-based programs and 17 community-based programs funded during the 1997-98 grant cycle. The profiles were written by the program directors, and each profile provides an overview of the program and includes general information about the community and the community members participating in the program. Details are also offered on the service-learning projects and the young people participating; the goals, assessments, and accomplishments of the projects and participants; and the challenges of implementing service-learning programs. A final component of each report offers some reflections about the program and discusses issues that require further attention. The profiles show how the programs have developed over time and indicate whether a program is new or has been funded for years. The report is divided into five sections and includes information on 4 elementary-school programs, 14 middle- and junior-high school programs, 8 high-school programs, 3 K-12 schoolwide programs, and 15 community-based programs. The descriptions include contact information, amount of funding, number of participants, number of volunteers, participant hours, and volunteer hours. An appendix presents the program-narrative guidelines. (RJM)

AB  - Background: Previous studies have reached conflicting conclusions about the associations between service and academic achievement and service and primary care specialty choice. Purposes: This study examines the associations between service at a student-run clinic and academic achievement and primary care specialty choice. Methods: Retrospective review of medical student service and statistical analysis of grade point average (GPA), Step 1 and Step 2 Clinical Knowledge (CK) scores, and specialty choice were conducted, as approved by our Institutional Review Board. Results: Volunteers, compared to nonvolunteers, had higher GPA (3.59 +/- 0.33vs. 3.40 +/- 0.39, p < .001), Step 1 (229 +/- 19vs. 220 +/- 21, p < .001), and Step 2 CK (240 +/- 18vs. 230 +/- 21, p < .001) scores, but did not pursue primary care specialties at a significantly higher percentage (52% vs. 51%, chi(2) = .051, p = .82). Conclusions: Further exploration of the associations between service and academic achievement and primary care specialty choice is warranted.

AB  - Inclusive education remains a challenge for Australian tertiary education, particularly specialized pedagogical approaches like work-integrated learning (WIL) and service learning. Critiques of mainstream pedagogical approaches raise questions about the predominant models of educating students (Butin, 2010; Howard, 1998). There is a definitive need to recognize the diversity of the student population within course structures, rather than integrating diverse student needs into a static curriculum (Harrison & Ip, 2013) "Wise practice" takes WIL objectives--professional skills development and professional experience--and positions inclusion and transformation at the center of the learning experience. This paper explores inclusive education in WIL and service learning and examines how a wise practice approach can help all students equally benefit from the transformative potential of service learning

AB  - Service-learning is characterized by students' engagement in their local communities to apply and learn course concepts. Communities afford students venues in which to practice solving authentic real world problems with tangible outcomes. Service-learning includes collateral benefits to academic programs and to the local community. Students learn course objectives and the value of becoming contributing citizens of the greater community. In turn, communities benefit from students' provision of needed programs and services. However, without careful course construction, instructors run the risk of providing ‘feel-good’ activities that are not linked to learning objectives. This article discuses the philosophy of students' “serving to learn and learning to serve” and provides examples of establishing meaningful links between course learning objectives and service-learning activities.

The paper examines service learning concepts to identify ways in which internships may be improved to engage students more fully in learning goals related to stewardship and ethics by allowing students to take part in activities related to sustainability and corporate social responsibility. Pilot qualitative data collected from local internship partners are examined to explore both benefits and limitations of the values-based internship concept. The author provides subsequent recommendations and identification of areas for future research.

AB  - This article examines the growing body of literature on service learning as a pedagogical tool within political science. It also reports the results of a service learning experiment used in a course on State and Local Politics. Students completed service learning projects that combined community service, attendance at local political meetings (i.e., city council or school board meetings), and interviews with elected officials. The students reflected on their experiences through written papers, oral presentations, and an evaluation of the service learning experience. The vignettes presented in this article highlight the potential benefits of incorporating service learning into political science courses, including enhanced civic engagement and understanding of the policymaking process. Assessment of these learning outcomes was based on the content and quality of the written and oral presentations, student self-evaluations, and a pretest/posttest. The model used in this course is easy to adapt to any political science course, offering a useful tool to promote active learning outside the classroom experience. (Contains 2 tables and 1 note.)

AB  - This article assesses to what extent and how 18 Protestant and Catholic religiously based high schools in Alberta, British Columbia, and Washington state prepare students for cultural awareness and engagement. All schools claimed to educate students to make constructive and significant differences in culture and society. While this was evident in most schools, the range, depth, and kind of cultural perception and immersion usually depended on the initiatives of individual teachers rather than on school-wide planning. Almost all schools involved their students in service activities both locally and overseas, but these were seldom well integrated with their curricula. Nevertheless, the results of the study challenge the commonly assumed stereotype that religious schools isolate students from culture and neglect social justice issues. (Contains 7 notes.)

AB  - Faculty-led short-term international service-learning (STISL) experiences are thought to have great potential in developing students' global citizenship through combining study abroad and community service pedagogies. However, thorough investigation of the pedagogical strategies employed in STISL courses to achieve such outcomes has yet to be conducted. This qualitative narrative inquiry of STISL faculty at 7 different institutions across multiple academic disciplines and country service sites sought to fill that void. Data reveal a new conceptualization of STISL teaching, learning, and service success that involves culturally contextualized solidarity, global civic engagement, and global competence, which culminate into students' global agency. Emerging from the data, the Van Cleave Pedagogical Design framework for Global Agency illuminates the interactions of five interdependent learning dimensions: academic, professional, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and intercultural. Course, program, and policy implications are explicated across pre-departure, host-country, and re-entry experiences.

AB  - In the literature on citizenship education, frequent references are made to Dewey. However, educationalists do not always interpret him correctly. To provide some counterbalance, I explain Dewey's views on education and democracy. I base this, not only on "Democracy and Education", but also on 17 articles that Dewey wrote after "Democracy and Education", and on his "Ethics" and two earlier works, frequently cited by educationalists: "Ethical Principles Underlying Education" and "School and Society". According to Dewey, democracy and education are two sides of the same coin. Both involve and foster self-determination, self-development and participating in the common good, enlightened by intelligent understanding and scientific spirit. At the present, it is customary to define democratic citizenship education primarily in terms of social and moral learning, sometimes as though it can be distinguished from academic learning, as something extra besides learning subject matter. When such an approach is attributed to Dewey, as it often is, this is unwarranted.

AB  - Core competencies for midwifery practice include an understanding of systems of health care delivery and advocacy for legislation and policy initiatives that promote quality in health care. Today's rapidly changing health care environment, due in part to the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, mandates that midwives possess greater literacy in health policy and comfort with political action than ever before. Frequently disinterested in politics and intimidated by the policymaking process, student midwives lack the foundational knowledge and practical skills needed to meet this professional obligation. The Midwifery Institute of Philadelphia University graduate program educates both student nurse-midwives and student midwives in health policy using an innovative, project-based service-learning approach featuring real-world collaborative experiences. This novel teaching style is ideally suited for instruction at a distance because of the diversity of experience brought to the virtual classroom by students in widely disparate geopolitical locations. As students accomplish measurable objectives within their individually developed projects and reflect with classmates about their experiences, they feel empowered to effect change and report lower perceived barriers to future political engagement.

AB  - Background: South Africa’s shortage of health professionals is most pronounced in rural and underserved communities, where the burden of disease is greatest. One key question is: how pharmacy training contributes to preparing students to address local health priorities in these communities? Aim: Our aim was to implement a first year service-learning activity that addressed a local health service need. Method: Case study methodology was used to describe and analyse implementation of the service activity. Results: Implementation entailed students pre-packing sugar and salt into a sachet for use by clinics for the treatment of diarrhoea-induced dehydration. This activity proved to be beneficial for student learning and the health services. Despite the two-pronged significance, key questions emerged about how this activity aligned with current pharmacy practice. Conclusion: Our preliminary attempt to embed relevance in pharmacy training uncovered apparent inconsistencies in expectations for the role of the pharmacist between training institutions, accreditation bodies and the public health system.

AB  - Background. Community practice in occupational therapy is becoming increasingly relevant worldwide. Moreover, a social-change approach focusing on occupational enablement is pertinent in community practice as occupational therapists endeavour to promote health, well-being, and occupational justice in communities. Purpose. Drawing on theory from the fields of community development, community engagement, and occupational enablement, and based on the findings of a previous empirical, qualitative study, a framework for occupational enablement in community practice was developed. Key Issues. This article presents the background to the development of the framework, after which the framework is introduced and discussed in terms of the composition, relevance, and application of its components. The framework details outcomes and objectives that may be targeted and activities that may be utilized successfully during occupational therapy community practice engagements. It further illuminates facilitators of enablement related to contextual factors, stakeholders, and strategies that enhance the potential for enabling community practice engagements. Implications. This framework can provide a strategic management guideline for occupational therapists and students who engage with communities in endeavours such as community development and service learning.

AB  - Earthquakes are some of the more dramatic expressions of the dynamics of our planet. The sudden release of stress built up slowly by tectonic or volcanic processes often has far-reaching consequences, and can be measured (in classrooms) around the world. This is one reason why designing and building seismometers has been a popular activity, and why different versions of "Seismometer in Schools" projects thrive in the United States, Australia, and Europe. We present a cheap, robust, and easy-to-build seismometer--called the TC1--to measure seismic displacements in the vertical direction. Its components are easy to obtain and assemble, yet the resulting instrument is accurate enough to record earthquakes from around the globe. The parts list and building instructions of the TC1 seismometer are freely available online. Alternatively, a complete kit can be purchased for around US$300. Assembling the system naturally introduces students to a number of concepts in physics and engineering, while upon completion seismic recordings trigger discussions about the dynamics and internal structure of the Earth. The discussions are fostered by service learning and shared in the network of TC1s called the Z-NET.

AB  - Objective. To determine the impact of performing critical-thinking and reflection assignments within interdisciplinary learning teams in a biochemistry course on pharmacy students' and prospective health professions students' collaboration scores. Design. Pharmacy students and prospective medical, dental, and other health professions students enrolled in a sequence of 2 required biochemistry courses. They were randomly assigned to interdisciplinary learning teams in which they were required to complete case assignments, thinking and reflection exercises, and a team service-learning project. Assessment. Students were asked to complete the Scale of Attitudes Toward Physician-Pharmacist Collaboration prior to the first course, following the first course, and following the second course. The physician-pharmacist collaboration scores of prospective health professions students increased significantly (p<0.001). Conclusions. Having prospective health professions students work in teams with pharmacy students to think and reflect in and outside the classroom improves their attitudes toward physician-pharmacist collaboration.

AB  - Fostering empathy in future health-care providers through service-learning is emerging as central to public health promotion. Patients fare better when their caregivers have higher relationship-centered characteristics such as the ones measured by the Jefferson Scale of Empathy. Unfortunately, these characteristics often deteriorate during health-care professional training. Nevertheless, growing literature documents how we can promote empathy, and other patient-centered characteristics, throughout health-care professional students' undergraduate education. As for proven treatment plans, we believe we should also use evidence-based guidelines to foster relationship-centered characteristics in our students when training them to practice as part of an interdisciplinary health-care team.

AB  - Based on the premise that school reform efforts must consider the needs of at-risk children, this paper discusses parallel reform efforts that focus on community service. The first part discusses logical linkages between community service and "at-risk" education and describes how Arizona is attempting to formalize these linkages within the state context of school reform. The Serve-America program, which arose from passage of the National and Community Service Act of 1990, allocates funds to states for school-based community-service programs in grades K-12. Through formalized school-community agency and youth organization/community agency partnerships, Arizona's Serve-America project is designed to: (1) encourage school-age and out-of-school youth to volunteer their services for the benefit of others in their communities; (2) increase the number of adult volunteers in Arizona's schools; (3) provide productive, meaningful experiences for participants; and (4) emphasize coordination of community agencies to avoid duplication and maximize utilization of local resources. Together, Arizona's Serve-America programs have involved over 3,300 youth and adult volunteers who provided over 11,500 hours of community service in the ares of education, community improvement, human services, public safety, and conservation. Participants reported positive changes in their attitudes and behaviors as a result of their community service and service learning participation. (LMI)

AB  - This booklet provides information on implementing the Landscapes for Learning (LFL) program, which was conceived to bring children, youths, and communities together to learn about landscaping while beautifying local schools and communities. The booklet begins with a discussion of the concept of environmental stewardship. Described next are the objectives, benefits, and principles of LFL, which is designed to help participants develop job, teamwork, gardening, and academic skills through participatory learning activities in which all participants become teachers and learners. The next three sections present the following sets of profiles: (1) 10 LFL service learning projects for students at all levels, from preschool through graduate study; (2) 11 LFL projects linking landscaping to areas of the curriculum such as language arts, mathematics, social studies, science, and French; and (3) 3 LFL projects involving students, parents, and other community members.

AB  - This case study was conducted to evaluate the experience of students in one university course about juvenile justice and one community partnership working together to create a unique learning experience for two very distinct groups of young adults. One of the groups involved justice-involved young men and their parole officers; the other group involved college students enrolled in the course. University students learned civic engagement is not charity, but rather it is working alongside a community partner toward a joint goal. All participants disrupted the “othering” that commonly exists between two such disparate groups. Finally, the community participants gained hope through experiencing a college course firsthand and being able to see themselves as college students. The success of this collaboration was demonstrated thoroughly through informal feedback, formal reflections, course evaluations, and participant observation.

AB  - There are many opportunities to use engineering skills to improve the conditions for marginalized communities, but our current engineering education praxis does not instruct on how engineering can be a force for human development. In a time of great inequality and exploitation, the desire to work with the impoverished is prevalent, and it has been proposed to adjust the engineering curriculum to include a larger focus on human needs. This proposed curriculum philosophy is called humanitarian engineering. Professional engineers have played an important role in the modern history of power, wealth, economic development, war, and industrialization; they have also contributed to infrastructure, sanitation, and energy sources necessary to meet human need. Engineers are currently at an important point in time when they must look back on their history in order to be more clear about how to move forward. The changing role of the engineer in history puts into context the call for a more balanced, community-centred engineering curriculum. Qualitative, phenomenographic research was conducted in order to understand the need, opportunity, benefits, and limitations of a proposed humanitarian engineering curriculum. The potential role of the engineer in marginalized communities and details regarding what a humanitarian engineering program could look like were also investigated. Thirty-two semi-structured research interviews were conducted in Canada and Ghana in order to collect a pool of understanding before a phenomenographic analysis resulted in five distinct outcome spaces. The data suggests that an effective curriculum design will include teaching technical skills in conjunction with instructing about issues of social justice, social location, cultural awareness, root causes of marginalization, a broader understanding of technology, and unlearning many elements about the role of the engineer and the dominant economic/political ideology. Cross-cultural engineering development placements are a valuable pedagogical experience but risk benefiting the student disproportionately more than the receiving community. Local development placements offer different rewards and liabilities. To conclude, a major adjustment in engineering curriculum to address human development is appropriate and this new curriculum should include both local and international placements. However, the great force of altruism must be directed towards creating meaningful and lasting change.

AB  - There is an increasing interest in the humanitarian engineering curriculum, and a service-learning placement could be an important component of such a curriculum. International placements offer some important pedagogical advantages, but also have some practical and ethical limitations. Local community-based placements have the potential to be transformative for both the student and the community, although this potential is not always seen. In order to investigate the role of local placements, qualitative research interviews were conducted. Thirty-two semi-structured research interviews were conducted and analysed, resulting in a distinct outcome space. It is concluded that local humanitarian engineering placements greatly complement international placements and are strongly recommended if international placements are conducted. More importantly it is seen that we are better suited to address the marginalised in our own community, although it is often easier to see the needs of an outside populace.

AB  - The purpose of this qualitative study was to examine the effects of a service-learning project with rural older adults on social work students' choice of working professionally with older adults upon graduation. Service learning is a course-based community service experience designed to enhance students' understanding of course content while meeting an identified community need at the same time. The service-learning intergenerational project consisted of ten hours of face-to-face interaction between a BSW student and an older adult living in rural South West Virginia and the city of Charleston. Twenty-one undergraduate social work students attending the Micro Practice course participated in the study. Data collection consisted of face-to-lace interviews guided by a set of open-ended questions. Data analysis revealed that participation in the intergenerational project did not change a students" choice of major but it increased their desire to explore the field of aging.

AB  - Highlights • Academic partnerships to meet patient safety competencies for prelicensure nursing students. • Innovative service learning projects. • Interprofessional patient safety and quality improvement teams. • Scholarship for nursing students and faculty. Abstract Nurse-graduates today must be prepared to practice in a complicated healthcare system with numerous safety challenges. Although patient safety and quality competencies are a priority in nursing education, effective strategies for applying this knowledge into practice are needed. To meet this challenge, the Helene Fuld Leadership Program for the Advancement of Patient Safety and Quality at Johns Hopkins School of Nursing has developed an academic-clinical service partnership. Students are assigned to mentored, quality improvement projects in which they complete 100 hours over 2 semesters. This partnership links the Fuld Fellows with an interprofessional network of Johns Hopkins Medical Entity clinical Quality Improvement leaders. The partnerships have lead to manuscripts, professional job opportunities, and quality networking for both our students and mentors. Our strategic, academic-service partnership has improved student knowledge of patient safety principles and promoted nursing competence in patient safety with the development of future patient safety and QI nurse leaders.

AB  - Practicums provide opportunities for students to connect theory with practice through experiential learning and hands‐on work experience. While recommended for students in Kenya, there is little research on the practicum experience. This article describes evidence used to prepare students for practicum experiences. Interviews and focus groups (FGs) were conducted with three stakeholder groups in two phases. Findings informed the development of a practicum preparation course that covers topics including (i) becoming a reflective professional and/or practitioner; (ii) articulating practicum learning goals; (iii) mental preparation for demanding field‐based situations; and (iv) developing confidence in interpersonal communication. Phase two evaluated the initial impact of the course through FGs and follow‐up interviews.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to describe a model for creating a successful service engagement partnership with a community organization that may lead to the development of a short- or long-term service engagement project or course. The article explains how to create a successful partnership, including how to identify and choose the right community partner, the importance and development of a memorandum of understanding, and procedures for evaluating the partnership. Examples of two successful partnerships with two different structures, at two different universities, with one organization (Special Olympics) will be used. One partnership has produced a service-learning course for a sport management program that includes service-engagement opportunities for physical education, health, and exercise science students, while the other partnership has resulted in a three-tiered service-engagement project that involves interns, two community recreation and nonprofit leadership classes, and a co-curricular registered student organization. Lessons learned from this article can be replicated in other higher education programs, as well as in elementary, middle, and secondary education settings.

AB  - This research, conducted with an introductory sociology class at the University of British Columbia during the 2001‐2002 academic year, explored community service-learning as a pedagogy and philosophy. The theoretical focus of this paper is Nancy Fraser’s (1997) criticisms of Jurgen Habermas’ (1992) bourgeois liberal model of the public sphere. We analyzed the class experiences with community service that emerged from students’ contributions to a database of community organizations, concept maps, and a student‐driven course evaluation. The outcomes of this research include a description of potentially useful course strategies and a narrative of a unique type of community‐service learning.

AB  - This study examined issues regarding the educational development of students in service-learning programs using sets of performance-based assessment rubrics and other assessment techniques. In particular, this study employed the Service-Learning Assessment Toolkit (SLAT), a compilation of instruments, measures, and guidelines developed by the researcher. The SLAT captured students' educational development through a variety of data sources and measured development across six target constructs: career exploration, civic participation, and academic, ethical, personal and social growth. The researcher used a naturalistic inquiry and data was collected and analyzed based on a two-group scenario, instructor and student. The research data identified whether the students who used the SLAT had a significant level of developmental growth in a service-learning target construct compared to students who did not use the SLAT. The study concluded that all students who participated had examples of positive educational outcomes in at least three of the six educational targets. There was no evidence that one type of target dominated the learning process. Each assessment tool contains some features to enhance student development across the six educational targets. Although this study did not reveal firm causal relationships between the SLAT performance-based assessment rubrics and service-learning student development, it did capture some effective strategies for assessing service-learning educational outcomes. The researcher hopes that this study will continue to help instructors measure service-learning outcomes through an effective set of tools that is specifically relevant to service-learning programs. The outcomes of this study have real-life implications that empower students to analyze, evaluate and synthesize practical problem-solving situations.

AB  - This study details the experiences from a pilot program aimed at virtually pairing pre-service teacher education candidates with fifth-grade students for the purposes of raising achievement and creating meaningful field experiences. Researchers paired the difficulties of traditional field experiences with the difficulties in vocabulary comprehension for at-risk students to reach a solution of service-learning through virtual tutoring. Junior and senior level pre-service candidates majoring in middle school education used videoconferencing to tutor fifth-grade students in vocabulary at a nearby elementary school. Results suggest that the pilot program provided increased student achievement for elementary students as well as increased satisfaction concerning field experiences for pre-service teachers.

AB  - The urgent messages of good business include the importance of ethical management behaviors, focus on corporate citizenship, recognition of principled leadership, moral awareness, and participation in social change. This article describes the Service Learning Metaproject (a nested set of projects required of all students) and shows what students can accomplish to promote a better world. It addresses four measurable learning objectives: providing contact with divergent populations, making conscious moral decisions and committing to ethical action, deriving meaning from everyday activities, and developing adaptability and flexibility. It documents the achievement of these with undergraduate business students performing metaprojects that begin with service, lead to learning, and are followed by the development of a direct application. The conclusion is the implementation of that application. All the service learning projects this article describes required a Service Folio for student reflection on service experiences, relationships to readings, and concrete team project deliverables.

AB  - Comments on an article by Lise Saffran (see record [rid]2013-31200-012[/rid]). This and several other recent articles give U.S. medical students, clinicians, and educators plenty to digest regarding the ethics of temporary international learning experiences. However, if you are going to learn, to grow, and to open yourself to potentially life-changing experiences if your interest is in developing new understandings of illness and disease from multiple biological, psychological, and social perspectives then by all means, go. Go in humility, go in reflection, and go in solidarity. And return a better physician for having gone. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This autoethnography of my lived experiences as a middle-school service-learning course teacher has helped me solve a personal mystery and present an important perspective for the K-12 service-learning field. With an eye on revealing a unique service-learning classroom concept to educational leaders, enhancing middle level teacher education, and hopes of providing greater opportunities for advancing research on service learning in K-12 education, this study has also aided me in understanding my professional self and my subjective educational theory through a personal interpretive framework (Kelchtermans, 1993, 1999, 2009). Using autoethnography (Ellis, 2004; Ellis & Bochner, 2006) as a method to explore my own experiences as a middle school service-learning teacher and the perceptions of critical friends—colleagues, family members, and friends—who have been significant in my experiences, I am able to present an evocative personal narrative on what it means to be a service-learning teacher. Overarching findings from this study reveal that a middle grades service-learning teacher is a self-authored individual (Baxter Magolda, 1999, 2009; Kegan, 1994) who is committed to community-engaged education (Dewey, 1900, 1933), possesses a strong “I must” (Noddings, 2002b, p. 20) perspective on relational care, and are for development in servant leadership (Greenleaf, 1977; Sergiovanni, 1992; Bowman, 2005)

Results show that agency-institution collaboration experienced both successes and barriers. Most subjects (Ss) were overwhelmingly positive about the effects of student volunteers on the agency. Served youth viewed student volunteers very positively. Half of Ss perceived that students volunteered because of course requirements. Ss reported wanting a stronger commitment for college students and protocols for campuses to follow to increase retention and responsibility level among volunteers.

AB  - Leadership development is vital to the future of medicine. Some leadership development may take place through the formal curriculum of the medical school, yet extracurricular activities, such as student government and affiliated student organizations, can provide additional, highly valuable leadership development opportunities. These organizations and their missions can serve as catalysts for students to work with one another, with the faculty and administration of the medical school, with the community, and with local, regional, and national organizations. The authors have organized this discussion of the leadership development potential of student organizations around six important principles of leadership: ownership, experience, efficacy, sense of community, service learning, and peer-to-peer mentoring. They provide practical examples of these leadership principles from one institution. They do not presume that the school is unique, but they do believe their practical examples help to illuminate the potential of extracurricular programs for enhancing the leadership capabilities of future physicians. In addition, the authors use their examples to demonstrate how the medical school, its surrounding community, and the profession of medicine can benefit from promoting leadership through student organizations.

AB  - Since 1999, pre-service teachers undertaking the Bachelor of Teaching (Secondary) Program at the University of Western Sydney have participated in an alternate practicum called Professional Experience 3 (PE3). This practicum encourages students to engage in broader educational settings within local communities. Increasingly, a number of service-learning opportunities have been developed, most notably, senior student tutoring programs and the involvement of students in the Plan-It Youth project in conjunction with the Department of Education and Training (DET) and the South-western Sydney Institute of TAFE. A focus of these programs has been to address the issues related to students at risk of leaving school early within the local South-western Sydney community. In this paper we discuss the benefits of these programs to the university, pre-service-teachers, school students and school communities, and the broader local community. Specifically, we examine service learning as a conduit for the development and maintenance of meaningful symbiotic relationships between the university and the educational community, and pre-service teachers and the local community. Finally, we look towards the future and highlight the challenges and opportunities for service-learning programs within the practicum.

AB  - Living in Alaska offers many extreme challenges and opportunities for family and consumer sciences (FCS) teachers to step up to the challenges of facing the future. In this article, the author describes how she started the "Stepping Up For Our Future" program. She relates that as the sole FCS teacher in Chugiak High School, she was challenged to educate teens in all areas of FCS to prepare them for the many "shoes" they will be expected to fill as adults. "Stepping Up For Our Future" is a program created to offer students real life opportunities to experience FCS applied in their daily lives. Utilizing skills acquired from courses in food preparation, ProStart, textiles, child development, food science, and adult responsibilities, and from Family, Career and Community Leaders of America (FCCLA), teens learn to connect to their schools, homes, and communities.

AB  - Context: We studied students' perceptions regarding a required 120-hour practicum within a program including service learning and Problem-based Learning. Responses to pre- and postpracticum surveys and a second-year survey were analyzed for 2008 to 2010 graduates. Preceptors' responses regarding students' performance were also analyzed. Objective: To assess attainment of public health competencies by analyzing student and preceptor identification of areas for improvement. Design: Basis of study was a 29-item survey regarding competencies before/after practicum completion, and a 27-item postsurvey assessing perceptions of practicum, preceptor, and site. Instruments included a 5-point Likert Scale (1 = strongly disagree/highly ineffective to 5 = strongly agree/highly effective). Setting: Practicum experiences are selected from more than 250 community-based partners including government, health systems & not-for-profit agencies. Participants: Three first-year student cohorts and preceptors surveyed. Response rates varied across cohorts and instruments. Main Outcome Measure(s): Study focused on satisfaction scores and pre- and postsurvey response differences reported by respondents. Results: Students reported high degrees of satisfaction & value in learning by doing, increased ability addressing real world problems, and commitment to working in the community. Preceptors reported satisfaction with students' competency and ability completing projects. Conclusion: Experiential learning in competency-based graduate public health education derived from Problem-based Learning and service learning shares commonalities and relevance with public health practice, illustrating how Problem-based Learning enhances students' ability becoming self-directed, collaborative, problem-solvers working with communities. Students' service learning ethos is manifested in value attributed to the practicum and community advocacy. Self-assessment of personal and professional development appears enhanced through the practicum experience.

AB  - At its core, engineering and similar disciplines rely strongly on technical innovation to design and develop creative solutions to complex problems. However, for novice engineering students, conceptualizing engineering design activities is not an easy task. To do so, they must overcome cognitive blocks to facilitate unique and adequate engineering design solutions. This effect may be compounded when engineering design projects centered around service learning are introduced. The intent of this study was to explore if and what types of conceptual blocks may be present among novice engineering students when design heuristic cues are provided in the classroom. Findings suggest that using classroom interventions around design heuristic, students had a difficult time ``shaking off' their conceptual blocks to the design solution. Primarily, communicative and perceptual blocks were found to predominate among novice engineering student groups.

AB  - Vision 2020 urges Jackson State to distinguish itself from other institutions of higher learning--to develop its "niche" in a marketplace that requires colleges to promote the unique educational experience only they can offer. Establishing this niche entails determining what the University does well and channeling resources to support and develop those programs for "optimum" learning. The proposed reorganization will help to position the new modern academy to uncover new consumer clientele, retain the current consumer clientele, identify new methods and means to locate new revenue streams, and maintain the institution's historical credibility as the premier institution of higher learning for central Mississippi and other urban municipalities in the U.S. and throughout the world. Based on an analysis of standards, benchmarks, and the campus-wide academic program review and the criteria required by the Board of Trustees for Institutions of Higher Learning (IHL), academic programs were grouped in the following designated categories: (1) high productivity. These initiatives include academic enhancements and improvements in mathematics education, English education, Honors College, Continuing Education, Graduate School, University College, faculty compensation and work load, experiential/service learning, action research across the curriculum, on-line education, library resource development, partnerships with community colleges and other research institutions, foreign language development, technology-assisted instruction, global education and awareness, the infusion of urbanization, and other systemic issues related to student life.

Like teachers in many states, I have critically assessed my lesson plans in relation to the state's curriculum standards, which in California are contained in the History/Social Science Framework for California Public Schools. I discovered four areas in which I might strengthen my lessons: civic values, rights and responsibilities, social participation and ethical literacy.

AB  - Service-learning is an instructional method that integrates community service and academic study into a project that promotes civic responsibility. The purpose of this research was to identify what legal issues are associated with service-learning and analyze how nurse educators respond to these legal issues. Student nurse case scenarios involving a legal issue were developed using expert opinion from five attorneys. Interviews were conducted with twenty nurse educators using the student nurse case scenarios and open-ended questions with reference to decision making, legal issue identification, nurse practice, and risk management. Findings indicated there is inherent legal risk associated with service-learning and that nurse educators were not able to correctly identify or recognize many of the legal risks. Most notable were the similarities between the student nurse case scenarios used in the research and actual nurse educator practice, indicating that legal issues are not uncommon occurrences in nursing education. This study established a clear identifiable link between the need for more education on legal issues and the need to provide risk management skills to nurse educators involved in service-learning projects. It is recommended that nursing schools increase efforts to inform nurse educators of their legal responsibilities to effectively and safely carry out service-learning projects in the community.

AB  - Background. Service-learning (SL) is a pedagogical method that can increase community engagement by health professions schools and train students in community health competencies. As SL becomes increasingly prevalent, questions of how to sustain SL and maximize its quality are of growing importance. Goals. (1) To assess the sustainability and long-term impact of SL in health professions education, and to identify factors that influence sustainability; (2) To explore how sustained SL initiatives in health professions education have fostered the quality and sustainability of SL, and to produce strategies for success and lessons learned from their experiences; and (3) To examine how students can provide leadership to advance SL in health professions education. Methods. Manuscripts 1 and 2 report on a study of the ten-year outcomes of the Health Professions Schools in Service to the Nation (HPSISN) program, which supported the integration of SL into the curriculum at 17 health professions schools. Methods included in-depth interviews with administrators and faculty from 16 of the HPSISN SL initiatives and a comparative case study of two SL initiatives that were successfully sustained. Manuscript 2 reports on a case study of a student advocacy group at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health that provided leadership to advance SL. Findings. Manuscript 1 provides evidence that SL is highly sustainable in health professions education, and identifies three main categories of influences on sustainability: organizational setting, SL design and implementation, and proven impact. It also provides evidence that SL can build capacity for community engagement in academic and community partners. Manuscript 2 offers strategies to sustain SL in organizational settings that are more and less supportive of SL, and to maximize the quality of SL as a teaching tool and as a mechanism for beneficial community engagement. Manuscript 3 provides evidence that students can offer unique leadership for SL, as advocates and innovators, and offers recommendations for engaging students as co-leaders for SL. Conclusions. These findings will inform efforts to advance the quality and sustainability of SL in health professions education. They have implications for the leadership of academic administrators, faculty, and students, and other stakeholders.

AB  - This research study documents the perceptions of Manitoba teachers working with educational assistants as schools comply with the Appropriate Educational Programming Amendment to the Public Schools Act (Manitoba Education, Citizenship and Youth, 2005). Eight teachers who work with educational assistants in rural and urban Manitoba were asked about four aspects of this emerging role: (i) What are their experiences working with educational assistants in the classroom (what roles do they perceive educational assistants to perform), (ii) the competencies they think they need for their work, (iii) how they have been prepared for this responsibility, and (iv) how they think teachers should or could be (better) prepared for their work with educational assistants. The study invited four novice teachers (less than two years of teaching experience) and four veteran teachers (more than 10 years of teaching experience) to participate in one-on-one face-to-face interviews. Open-ended questions based in current research prompted the participants to reflect on their own practice. The study reveals some of the perceived issues teachers report as challenges in their changing role to meet new legislative mandates. It examines the need to introduce collaboration with educational assistants during pre-service training and access to professional in-service learning opportunities to facilitate teachers understanding of the role of educational assistants in Manitoba schools. The study also reveals some of the competencies required for managing the activities of educational assistants.

AB  - Youth civic engagement occupies a central space in applied developmental science. However, understanding of the processes and contexts in which early adolescents become civically engaged is still limited. This study draws on a sample of approximately 4,000 students from 11 urban middle schools in Tennessee to address several gaps in the civic engagement literature. First, we use latent class analysis to identify types of civic engagement in early adolescence. Second, we explore associations between types of engagement and youth behavioral and academic outcomes. Third, we focus on urban youth. A latent class analysis using survey items suggests a three-class structure for civic engagement in urban middle schools. One distinction is between students who are engaged and those who are not. Another distinction is that, among the engaged groups, one is engaged both behaviorally and attitudinally (social justice actors), whereas another has strong civic attitudes but infrequent civic behaviors (social justice sympathizers).

AB  - Based on a partnership between a teacher preparation program and an urban school district, this study evaluates a project that used a service-learning model to connect preservice teachers to working teachers to help the working teachers integrate technology into their teaching while giving the preservice teachers an authentic context for their assignments. Using multiple data sources including questionnaires, class projects, interviews, and field notes, this study looked at the success of service-learning in technology instruction in terms of student satisfaction and student learning related to technology skills, technology integration strategies, and issues that teachers confront teaching diverse populations. The results of the study provide suggestions for the successful integration of service-learning for technology training in teacher education. (Contains 4 tables and 3 footnotes.)

AB  - A first-time service-learning instructor explores balancing the obligation to help students achieve approved learning outcomes with ensuring that the service-learning partner receives value from the project. This is a vexing issue because few students deliver professional work. The author recommends that while students must be the instructor's top priority, the instructor also has an obligation to use his or her expertise to help the service-learning partner glean value from students' efforts. To meet this obligation, the instructor must be very generous with his or her time. This investment of time will pay off for everyone involved in service-learning courses.

AB  - In recent years, more and more business schools have introduced team-based projects into their curricula as a means of addressing corporate, small business, and community-service issues while teaching students a variety of project management skills (technical and sociocultural). In designing a project-oriented course, an instructor has a number of options available with respect to project identification, project focus and scope, team size, composition and leadership, course content, content delivery, and student project evaluation. This article discusses the advantages and disadvantages of these various options, as well as the factors that are most likely to moderate an instructor's choices in seeking to maximize student learning and project success.

AB  - The U.S. student demographics are changing rapidly with a growing trend of increased diversity. This increasing trend shows that the public education student population has shifted. NCES reports that 50.3% of the nation’s K-12 students represent minorities as a result of decreasing numbers of White and Black students and increasing numbers of Hispanic and Asian students. Meanwhile, although the teaching population has almost doubled, the ethnicity of the teacher demographics has hardly shifted from 2000 (85% White) to 2011-12 (82.5% White). This student demographic shift requires all K-12 teachers to acquire and extend their intercultural competency skills to meet the diversity challenge and intercultural competence is an increasing need for effective teachers. This study focused on the impact of intercultural training on new teachers in a suburban school district in which the demographics were similar to the nation’s teacher demographics and that had a minority majority student population. The study used an experimental pre-posttest control-group design with a sample of 58 K-8 teachers new to the district. The study was based on Bennett’s Developmental Model of Intercultural Sensitivity (DMIS), the basis of the Intercultural Development Inventory (IDI®). The sample was randomly divided into an experimental and a control group. Both groups received the IDI® to assess their intercultural competence stages prior to the intercultural training (the pretest). The experimental group received the intercultural training, and then both groups were administered the IDI® again to assess the impact of the intercultural training on the experimental group (the posttest). Examination of the IDI® pre- and posttest data revealed that the experimental group had a significant change in its developmental intercultural competency scores from pretest Developmental Orientation (DO) (M = 96.40) to the the posttest DO (M = 115.97) and its Orientation Gap score decreased from 26.29 to 16.39. The control group showed no significant change. The study’s concludes that K-12 public education school districts could further develop teachers’ intercultural competency skills using Bennett’s DMIS and a validated tool such as the IDI® to provide meaningful intercultural training.

AB  - Schools cannot prepare students to become leaders in society on their own. Schools must partner with community agencies and expose students to leadership in the world. Partnerships create a broad range of support and opportunity, allowing students to learn and engage themselves in life-changing initiatives. For the past several years, students from Lord Beaverbrook High School in Calgary, Alberta, have partnered with staff members from Calgary Family Services, Developmental Disabilities Resource Centre, and Calgary Health Region. The partnerships have provided students with countless opportunities for proactive involvement in the community. This article describes Lord Beaverbrook's Together Everyone Achieves More (T.E.A.M.) Leadership program, a program that has created fertile ground for the growth of partnerships. The program pairs students with professionals in the community. The students supply the vision for service projects, and the adult professionals contribute their support and knowledge to make them work. The students develop servant leadership qualities and expand their perception of community. (Contains 1 resource.)

AB  - Background: Service-learning is a teaching-learning strategy in higher education that provides hands-on experiences in authentic clinical environments. Mutual decision making, shared goals, reciprocity, and tangible benefits to organizations and the people they serve are hallmarks of service-learning. However, the literature is sparse pertaining to preceptor experiences with service-learning projects, the extent of reciprocity, or the projects' impact on those who received the service. Method: A small phenomenological study was conducted to better understand the experiences of four community-based health professionals who worked with nursing students on service-learning projects. Results: Four themes emerged from face-to-face interviews and written reflections: (a) reciprocity among preceptor, clinical faculty, and student, (b) intentional planning and project clarity, (c) meaningful and authentic experience, and (d) valued and beneficial contributions that addressed a need. Conclusion: Insight gained from the experiences of the four preceptors in this study suggest that through careful planning and reciprocity, service-learning can have a positive impact on community-based organizations and the people they serve.

AB  - Service learning is philosophically congruent with the objectives of progressive occupational therapy curricula. This article presents a case-based research study that examined the attributes and outcomes of a service-learning course that included Level I fieldwork. Analysis of the case study identified three themes: (a) the translation of theory to practice, (b) the value of contextual learning, and (c) the gestalt of occupational awareness. Service learning can be considered a pedagogical [2] model that promotes the synthesis of conceptual models to clinical practice. Furthermore, it enables students to develop a professional and personal philosophy of occupation earlier in their careers.

AB  - This bibliography addresses the issue of service as an instructional strategy. The citations in the bibliography are divided among five sections. Section 1 contains references that focus on the social and psychological outcomes of participation in service. The impact of service on relationships with others, self-esteem, and moral reasoning are common factors under consideration. The effect of service on academic achievement, intellectual development, and school behavior is the concentration of research in section 2. Though fewer in number, the research in this section may be of greater importance in establishing service-learning as a credible educational practice. Much research considers both the psycho-social and academic impacts of service; section 3 lists these sources. The few existing reviews and bibliographies of the research literature are listed in section 4. Section 5 contains examples of service program evaluations. Literature pertaining to both K-12 and post-secondary populations is included. (EH)

AB  - Background: Christian Medical College Vellore (CMC) aspired through its Fellowship in Secondary Hospital Medicine (FSHM), a 1-year distance-learning program, to integrate academic learning and service development through guided projects for junior doctors working in small rural hospitals. Aim: The purpose of this article is to report the evaluation of the effectiveness of the project work in the FSHM program. Method: Mixed method evaluation was done using focus group discussion with students, written surveys for students and faculty, and telephone interviews with students and medical superintendents. Evidence for validity was gathered for the written survey. Criteria for trustworthiness were applied for the qualitative data analysis. Results: The major strengths of the project work identified were that students became aware of local health problems and how to deal with them, learned to work as a team, and had a sense of doing something useful. Recommendations for improvement were to have more interactions between guides and students. The benefits of projects to the hospital were providing improved clinical care, improved health systems, cost effective care management and benefits to the community. Conclusions: Service learning through guided project work should be incorporated into distance-learning educational programs for junior doctors working in rural hospitals.

AB  - In this article we describe three examples of service-learning projects carried out by faculty who have attended the Maine Watershed Project, a 'greening the curriculum' workshop that is designed to encourage faculty in all disciplines to address environmental sustainability issues in their teaching. Drawing on in-depth interviews conducted with these faculty members, we highlight how they understand and teach sustainability through service learning carried out in groups and we examine challenges tied to using this pedagogical approach. We also explore how faculty and student' experiences with service learning and groupwork increased their sense of connection to local communities, fostered innovation in the classroom, and developed hope-based learning—that is, educational experiences designed to leave students feeling inspired, motivated, and hopeful.

AB  - The intent of this chapter is to discuss community service and service-learning, and highlight this powerful experiential learning pedagogy's application to the unique population of student veterans returning home from deployment. The significance of the entire concept of community service and service-learning is directly linked to the military core values of 'service before self' and 'no soldier left behind'. These core values fit well with the mission of service, and they poise student veterans to lead as change agents both in the development of self-efficacy and in community service provision. Service-learning links service and academic curriculum to promote learning and civic engagement. Service-learning engages students' personal, social, and intellectual growth, and encourages a sense of civic responsibility as is demonstrated in military training. Service-learning is traditionally multidiscipline and involves individuals with varying talents and levels of expertise seeking a whole-person education. Many different service-learning activities can be designed to meet the needs of student veterans, who strive to continue to serve in their local and global communities beyond military duty.

AB  - Portfolios have often been promoted as a tool for reflective thinking, yet few studies have examined the use of portfolios in reflective teacher education programs. This exploratory study uses interviews, essays, and survey data to examine 212 teacher education students' efforts to think reflectively through the process of constructing portfolios based on their experiences in a community service-learning program. Findings revealed that the portfolio process prompted reflective thinking in many, but not all, students. Recommendations for using portfolios in teacher education programs include: focusing attention on students' initial understanding of the process and its purpose, encouraging student ownership and individual expression, providing some structured aspects to balance the open-ended nature of portfolios, and evaluating the portfolio process and students' responses.

The chapter begins with a brief literature review on teachers' responses to curricular changes. The author continues with a discussion of the teachers' personal backgrounds and their beliefs about service, teaching, and learning. Teachers' experiences with program planning and working with others, and the rewards and challenges of service-learning practice are presented. The implications for coordinators of service-learning programs, teacher educators, in-service trainers, and teachers of service-learning themselves are discussed in relation to 3 key goals of many service-learning programs: recruiting new teachers, providing support for initial implementation of service-learning projects, and fostering teachers' commitment to service-learning over time.

AB  - This study focuses on beginning teachers' experiences with a currently popular curriculum strategy in the US: community service-learning. To determine the personal and contextual factors influencing novice teachers' experiences, we surveyed over 300 early career teachers and interviewed 30 of the larger sample. The study provides evidence that some beginning teachers are willing to implement strategies they learned in their teacher education programs, and can do so successfully, in spite of being busy and unsupported. Results indicate that specific preparation features and school characteristics may play a large role in whether novice teachers implement service-learning activities in their classrooms.

AB  - This bulletin focuses on the method that teacher/authors use to connect curriculum with community: service-learning. The bulletin's introduction notes that, although service-learning projects can occur within any subject area, they have a particular suitability for the social studies, given the discipline's focus on the skills, values, and knowledge inherent in democratic participation. This bulletin features many examples of what service-learning can look like in the social studies curriculum. Chapters in the bulletin are: (1) "Community Service-Learning in the Social Studies" (Rahima C. Wade); (2) "Service-Learning Projects for Elementary Social Studies: Book Drive for Navajo Students" (Kate Foley); AIDS Awareness (Robyn Parks); B.I.G.--Bridging Intergenerational Gaps (Helen Bergey); and Marine Environmental Activism" (Gerri Faivre); (3) "Service Learning Projects for Middle Schools: Poverty and Homelessness: The Open Shelter Project (L. Richard Bradley; Kim Rhodes); Action, Advocacy, and AIDS (Michele Cerino); The Hunger Project (Diane Vliem); and Community Planning: Playground Redesign" (Deb Bradley); (4) "Service Learning Projects at the High School Level: Public Policy for the Homeless (Dick Diamond); Marion Community History (Marc Ferguson); Social Advocacy: History, Theory, and Practice (Barbara L. Wysocki); and Government Service-Learning" (Michaelean Monahan; Kathy Quesenberry Fout); (5) "Service-Learning in Social Studies Teacher Education" (Joan Rose); and (6) "Challenges to Effective Practice" (Rahima C. Wade). Appended are several resources for social studies educators and a position statement by National Council for the Social Studies on service learning. (BT)

The service-learning activities described here begin with student interest and initiative and focus on advocacy and concerted efforts to right unjust situations. With teacher support and guidance, students consider multiple perspectives and challenge the status quo. At times they accomplish their aims; in other cases, success is found in students learning valuable life lessons about the skills and long-term effort needed to effect change. Struggles with state mandates, required curriculum, colleagues, and parents are discussed, as well as the creative and subversive measures teachers use to address these challenges.

The article provides examples of service learning, such as a literacy campaign initiated by elementary school students, to demonstrate the academic skills service learning can provide. The article describes literacy skills that include writing grant proposals, tutoring kindergarten reading partners, writing letters on behalf of projects, and utilizing geometric skills to build vegetable gardens. Suggestions are offered to teachers in applying the skills and knowledge they wish to impart in the classroom in conjunction with service learning projects and available opportunities within their communities.

AB  - A service learning outreach was undertaken to assess the feasibility of adapting the Preconception Peer Educator (PPE) program to Bahamian youth. By focusing on preconception health, the PPE program is a logical step toward ensuring age sensitive and developmentally appropriate education to improve potential birth outcomes and decrease infant mortality rates (IMR) associated with the complex societal problems on Grand Bahama. Concerned with the prevalence of adolescent pregnancy, lack of social support, depression, and failure to complete high school, a nurse midwife invited PPEs from a School of Nursing to meet with stakeholders to introduce the PPE program to Bahamian youth. Mentored by a faculty advisor, the PPEs assumed a leadership role and determined that the primary needs of Grand Bahamian adolescents were messages of self-empowerment and proactive life planning within a cultural context. Positive responses from stakeholders and the promise of a partnership between a School of Nursing and a Caribbean community encouraged the PPEs to adapt their PPE program to the cultural climate and needs of the island of Grand Bahama. The experience informed students' practice and leadership ability by enhancing cultural awareness and sensitivity, expanding world-views, and instilling an ethic of social responsibility.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the health-related impact service-learning interventions had upon university students. College students from The University of Toledo were trained to conduct five, one-hour, sessions of Transmissive Reminiscence Therapy (TRT) with non-institutionalized senior adults within their community. Another group of university students made five, one-hour, informal visits with non-institutionalized senior adults within their community. These groups were compared to a group of university students that did not carry out any form of service-learning. A sample of 89 university students completed the SF-36 health survey instrument at pretest and at posttest; 32 from the TRT group, 27 from the visitation group, and 30 from the control group. The analyses revealed significant positive change on 4 variables among students assigned to the therapy group, on 1 variable among students assigned to the visitation group, and on 2 variables among students assigned to the control group. Significant negative change was detected on 1 variable among students assigned to the visitation group, and on 1 variable among students assigned to the control group. The TRT form of service-learning proved to be the more effective of the two interventions aimed at impacting student health perceptions in a positive way.

AB  - Background: Students seeking degrees in healthcare in Ecuador participate in community improvement projects and provide free health services under the supervision of faculty health professionals. The aim of this study is to determine the impact of a community-based intervention delivered by nursing students on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and perceived social support of a rural population in Ecuador. Methods: A quasi-experimental non-equivalent control group design study was conducted in two rural communities in Tumbaco, Ecuador. Families from one rural community were invited to participate in the intervention, receiving 8 weekly home visits from nursing students. Families from a neighboring community were similarly recruited as wait-list controls. One member of each family was consented into the study; the final sample included 43 intervention participants and 55 control participants. HRQoL and perceived social support were assessed before and after the intervention in both groups. The SF-12 was used to measure HRQoL, including eight domain scores and two composite scores, and the Interpersonal Support Evaluation List was used as an indicator of perceived social support. Difference-in-differences (DD) analyses were conducted to mitigate the effects of any baseline differences in the non- equivalent control group design. Results: When compared to the control group, the intervention group realized significant improvements in the physical component summary score of the SF-12 (4.20, <italic>p</italic> < 0.05) and the physical function domain of the SF-12 (4.92, <italic>p</italic> < 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences for any other components of the SF-12 or in the measure of perceived social support. Conclusions: Nursing students completing their rural service rotation have the potential to improve the health-related quality of life of rural residents in Ecuador. Future research should continue to examine the impact of service-based learning on recipient populations.

AB  - E-service-learning (electronic service-learning)--online course instruction and/or service--holds massive potential to transform both service-learning and online learning by freeing service-learning from geographical constraints and by equipping online learning with a powerful and much-needed tool to promote engagement. Students are increasingly pursuing their education online, yet few are exposed to service-learning in their online coursework. To remain relevant, service-learning must also go online. How do we transition service-learning from high-touch to high-tech? E-service-learning provides the answer. Through an extensive literature review, this article identifies four emerging types of e-service-learning endeavors and presents best practices. Armed with these best practices, we call on our colleagues to increasingly integrate e-service-learning into their online courses and to study the outcomes of such efforts to ensure the relevance of service-learning in the 21st century.

AB  - Service-learning can provide a range of literacy learning experiences for children as they work to solve real world problems and engage in inquiry, collaboration and reflection. Rather than being an extracurricular activity, service-learning projects are designed to meet standards and align with existing curriculum. This article explores how teachers can engage their students in literacy-based service learning using the example of a book drive that supported literacy and children's libraries in Ethiopia. The article draws on both scholarly research and personal experience and provides practical information and resources.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to gather data from first- and second-year dental hygiene students concerning their perceptions of the benefits and possible impediments to effective patient communication. Additionally, the students were asked to theorize as to the impact emerging communication technologies could have on oral health promotion, practice administration and patient/provider communication. Methods: A self-administered questionnaire of 6 open-ended queries was employed. Thematic analysis was conducted to reveal themes related to their perceived ability to effectively communicate, perceived barriers to communication, possible solutions to lessen or eliminate these barriers, and the impact of emerging technologies on interpersonal communication. Results: The questionnaire was completed by 63 of 68 students (93%). Patient apathy and patient unwillingness to change detrimental health-related habits were the most frequently cited barriers to effective communication. Of the students having patient contact, many stated that they were less sure of their ability to communicate effectively if the patient differed from themselves, such as being elderly or being from another culture. While most of the students believed their fundamental communication skills were good, many noted that improving their higher-order skills, such as conveying empathy or displaying a nonjudgmental attitude, were essential to being more effective communicators. Many students felt emerging technologies such as universal translators could potentially assist them in overcoming some of their perceived deficiencies. Conclusion: While perceived inadequacies will likely diminish as the students gain more experience in school and later in private practice, dental hygiene programs may wish to consider implementing additional structured educational experiences to better prepare students to address patient apathy and to effectively convey a sense of personal compassion. Promoting student involvement in community outreach activities and providing a variety of service learning opportunities, including foreign travel, may broaden student experiences and deepen their awareness and appreciation of verbal and nonverbal communications displayed by differing cultures.

AB  - This study sought to investigate how the Sheikh Zayed Private Academy (SZPA) can further develop the school service program to better serve students and community. Community service, service learning, service's roots in experiential and civic education, and the outcomes of these programs are highlighted. Also investigated are existing school service programs, theories behind them, program implementation strategies, reasons for student involvement, and outcomes for all stakeholders. A community-based action research (CBAR) approach was utilized, involving two focus groups and two interviews. Participant groups included students, school personnel, and two community members. Findings affirmed that service has only positive outcomes for all stakeholders involved in the serving relationship. It was concluded that while Islam does not impede students providing service, Emirati culture can provide some challenges for girls providing service beyond the school community. All participant groups believed that these cultural challenges could be overcome.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of an integrated experiential learning and action research project on preservice science teachers' developing ideas about science teaching, learning, and action research itself. The qualitative, interpretive study examined the action research of 10 master's degree students who were involved in service learning with children in informal education settings. Results indicated that all of the participants enhanced their knowledge of "children as diverse learners" and "the importance of prior knowledge" in science learning. In-depth case studies for three of the participants indicated that two developed deeper understandings of science learners and learning. However, one participant was resistant to learning and gained more limited understandings.

AB  - Aims The aim of this study was to determine whether dental hygiene students attending residential aged care facilities ( RACFs) during a placement programme gained any knowledge about the oral care of elderly patients and the RACF environment. Location Aged Care Facilities on the Central Coast of New South Wales, Australia. Methodology: Final year dental hygiene students undertook a 12-week placement, one day per week, in one of 17 residential aged care facilities on the NSW Central Coast. They were asked to complete pre-placement and post-placement questionnaires, which recorded their knowledge of medical, dental and environmental issues related to older people. The placement questionnaires used five point Likert scales, ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree, pre- and post-mean scores were produced for each question and P values calculated using a paired t-test. Results Thirty-three students attended the placement, 26 (79%) completed both the pre- and post-placement questionnaires. Post-placement mean scores as compared to pre-placement mean scores showed significant improvement in student knowledge of medical ( P < 0.05) and dental ( P < 0.05) conditions specific to the older person and improvement in knowledge ( P < 0.05) about the residential aged care facility environment. Conclusion The placement programme enhanced student knowledge across three subject categories; medical and dental conditions of the older person and the structure and services of the residential aged care environment.

AB  - Purpose: To record the views of final year dental hygiene students from the University of Newcastle, Australia about a placement in 17 residential aged care facilities, on the NSW Central Coast. Methods: Final year dental hygiene students undertook a 12 week placement, 1 day per week, in 1 of 17 residential aged care facilities. They were asked to participate in focus group discussions after the placement to determine their ability to transition from the classroom to the real-life experience of the residential aged care facility placement. Results: Students felt ill-equipped for the aged care placement program even though they had attended a pre-placement orientation. Students expressed feelings of being overwhelmed by the residential aged care environment, particularly by the smells and unexpected sights of the aged, fragile and cognitively impaired residents, and the difficulties in providing them with oral hygiene care. Conclusion: To enable students to transition from the classroom to the aged care environment in a more effective manner, a more realistic pre-placement orientation program is necessary.

AB  - Introduction The aim of this qualitative study was to measure the effect of a specifically designed orientation re-enactment DVD used to facilitate dental hygiene students transition from the classroom to a Residential Aged Care Facility (RACF) service-learning placement with less personal anxiety and more confidence in their role during the placement. Methodology Final year students ( n = 47) were randomly allocated to one of 17 RACFs on the NSW, Central Coast, Australia. All students were then randomly allocated to a two-group study with the active group assigned to view the DVD prior to their placement. Students who viewed the DVD were asked not to discuss the content with students who were assigned to the control group. Post-placement focus groups were organized, recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were collated, analysed and unitized into emergent themes. Representative quotes are presented in the results. The study was informed by 4 years of previous quantitative and qualitative process evaluation of the RACF programme. Results Focus group discussions identified that those students who had seen the DVD reported a shorter timeframe to successfully transition from the classroom to the RACF and stated that the DVD provided them with a realistic expectation of the RACF environment and their role in the placement experience. Conclusion The orientation DVD reduced student anxiety and improved student confidence in their role during the placement by providing a realistic orientation of the RACF environment.

AB  - A Saint Louis school experimenting with applying multiple intelligences theory to curricula and instruction defines "genuine understanding" as using information in novel ways. By surveying area museums and designing user-friendly botanical exhibits for a community-based project, first graders developed a better understanding of their own varied learning strengths. Creative thinking and entrepreneurial skills were used to create a museum gift shop. (MLH)

AB  - The health of women and childbearing families is a global concern that must be addressed if we are to be successful in ensuring healthy families. Numerous strategies have been suggested to increase appreciation for the global factors that influence maternal and child health and the overall health status of a community. Inclusion of cultural content in courses offered in educational programs and provision of clinical learning experiences in diverse communities have commonly been used in midwifery and nursing education. This article reviews the concept of service learning and its application in a course that provides an opportunity for students to participate in an international immersion program. Evaluation of the course found that participants increased their knowledge and skills in providing reproductive health care, developed appreciation for the knowledge and skills of traditional birth attendants, and expanded their world view of women and families in communities.

AB  - Four service-learning projects were conducted in technical communication courses using wikis. Results confirm previous findings that wikis improve collaboration, help develop student expertise, and enact a “writing with the community” service-learning paradigm. However, wikis did not decenter the writing classroom as predicted by previous work. Instructors using wikis to scaffold client projects should calibrate standards for evaluation with students and client, and they may need to encourage clients to stay active on the wiki.

AB  - This action research study details the journeys undertaken in a large Midwestern diocese by two Catholic elementary schools that design and implement their own unique and identifiably Catholic standards-based Service Learning program and the impact this process has on the Catholic culture and identity of those who create the program. This case study approach is described through the structure of a three-article dissertation, each article reflecting a separate stage of the research study: identification of strengths and challenges for implementation of a program, designing a solution to address the challenges, and evaluation of the impact of the process on the participants of the study. Researchers first carried out a problem-based consultation with principals at the schools to identify the common challenges that the schools faced that could impact the design and implementation of a program in their school, as well as identifying unique strengths and challenges for each school. Lack of knowledge about service learning as a pedagogy and its curriculum standards, lack of understanding of the relationship between service learning and social emotional learning, and lack of explicit connections between the social teachings of the Catholic Church and service for justice were found to be common challenges. The proposed solution to address these challenges, and to build on the strengths that each school brought to the process, was to design tailored professional development around standards-based service learning, social emotional learning, and church teachings in the area of social justice. The professional development stage of this study was carried out in two parts, in June and in the following August. At this point the participant schools began the design phase for their own unique program, which they implemented throughout the Fall semester of the school year. Throughout the three phases of the study, the researchers collected data in the form of journals, exit slip reflections as follow-up to professional development, focused discussions, and field observations. The findings indicate that each school applied the knowledge gained through the tailored professional development to design and implement an identifiably Catholic and standards-based service learning program. Significant shifts in understanding occurred for the participants in the study that suggested an impact on the Catholic culture and identity of the school communities as measured through these shifts and through the teachers’ perceptions of impact on their students.

AB  - The aim of my study was: (a) to measure the effectiveness of a supporting tutor-training curriculum and content knowledge gains for preservice teachers engaged in service learning and (b) to determine whether tutor training and field experience improved the preservice teachers' teaching self-efficacy beliefs. One hundred and thirteen upper-division undergraduate students enrolled in Social Foundations of Multicultural Education courses participated in course-embedded tutor-training and fulfilled a 20-h service-learning requirement by tutoring pupils in local elementary schools. Analyses of variance (ANOVA) on a pretest and posttest measures of content knowledge, tutoring skills, and teaching self-efficacy demonstrated a statistically significant difference with higher mean scores at the post time. These results suggest that a course-specific tutor-training curriculum advances the participants' knowledge and skill in tutoring. The results also indicate that the combination of tutor training and field application (i.e. tutoring in a classroom) function to increase students' self-efficacy as future teachers.

AB  - In the field of rhetoric and composition, scholars commonly mobilize the concept of the citizen in calls for critical pedagogy, letter-to-the-editor assignments, service learning, and in discussions of the public sphere. Yet the desire to create participatory citizens does not often move beyond prevailing rights and participation models in which students need only enact good citizenship in order to become a full citizen. As a result, the terms and boundaries of citizenship are often left unexamined. My dissertation takes on the question of how concepts of citizenship have been embedded in the practices of literacy training by examining literacy's role in the construction of citizenship. Through a study of documents from literacy and citizenship training in the early twentieth century, such as those sponsored by labor unions and Americanization programs as well as by institutions of higher education, I argue that themes of productivity emerged from this training to shape the concept of the good, productive citizen-worker and eventually led to the equating of citizenship habits with good work habits. I look at the documents that reveal the goals and rationales for teaching literacy—how teachers and architects of programs imagined students acquiring citizenship and literacy through their courses and what students would do with that citizenship and literacy once they left the classroom. By examining a range of spaces where those hoping to acquire full citizenship may have encountered literacy, I investigate how citizenship and literacy have been mutually but often contradictorily implicated for often disenfranchised individuals. Literacy became a way to measure the potential productivity of industrial workers, many of them immigrants, during a period that established many of the legal and cultural requirements of U.S. citizenship in parallel with the proliferation of mass manufacturing. Additionally, this study reveals how workers and immigrants themselves position literacy as a tool for social and economic mobility in their quests for full citizenship.

AB  - This study focuses the following: (1) the development of social responsibility and intellectual complexity as outcomes of service-learning courses, (2) the relationship between these two outcomes, (3) whether different course designs have differential effect, and (4) whether student characteristics results in differential outcomes. Development of social responsibility is a major motivation for those who theorize about or design community service and service-learning. The development of intellectual complexity is one of the goals of most higher education institutions. The possible relationship between development of social responsibility and intellectual complexity also needs to be studied. Course designs which emphasize and do not emphasize social justice need to be investigated in order to learn if they have different outcomes on development of social responsibility and intellectual complexity. Finally, students' characteristics such as previous levels of volunteer involvement and reasons for taking service-learning courses were examined because they may have influence on students' development of social responsibility. In this study, the development of social responsibility is measured by the Scale of Service Learning Involvement (Olney & Grande, 1995), and students' intellectual development is measured by the Measure of Epistemological Reflection (Baxter Mogalda & Porterfield, 1985). Courses with strong, moderate, and minimal social justice content were compared on the two outcomes. Students with occasional and consistent volunteer history were compared as well as students who are required to take service-learning courses and students who freely elect to take service-learning courses. The major outcomes are as follows: (1) Service-learning courses, especially the ones with strong social justice designs have positive influence on students' development of social responsibility and intellectual complexity. (2) Students who had previous volunteer involvement and who took the courses as free electives had not only higher level of social responsibility development at the beginning of the courses but also developed more after taking service-learning courses than those who did not participate in volunteer work consistently and those who took the courses as required for their majors or as general education requirement. (3) Levels of social responsibility have a positive relationship with levels of intellectual ability. The development of social responsibility may presuppose intellectual development. There were exceptions, however. Some students in lower position of intellectual development also scored high in development of social responsibility. This issue needs further study.

AB  - Service-learning courses focus on both service experience and academic learning. Academic content is covered in both the classroom and the service experience, and the service experiences are reflected upon and processed in the classroom. Based on educational values, potential outcomes can be classified as development of personal competence, interpersonal relationship, and perception of community service as a responsibility of charity or perception of community service as a responsibility of social justice. The Student Service-Learning Course Survey (SSLCS) is designed to measure these four outcome domains. It draws attention to the dichotomy between the two kinds of citizenship and operationalizes the concepts by developing questions to measure the differences. The present study explored the factorial validity of SSLCS and the factorial invariance across gender groups using confirmatory factor analysis. The results of our study indicate that the four factors of SSLCS are validly measured and the partial factorial invariance across gender groups lends support for comparison between female and male groups.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate how factors such as personal traits and school locations influence junior high school students' conceptual learning of biology. The study was carried out island-wide with the whole area divided into 10 districts, from which 4,537 students were selected using stratified random sampling. A questionnaire on biological concepts was used to gather the data, which then were statistically analysed using one-way analysis of variance and a t-test. It was found that junior high school students in urban areas had clearer and better biological concepts than those of students in eastern Taiwan and other distant districts. Students in the ninth grade performed better than those in the eighth grade. No significant difference was observed in terms of gender. Besides, students who had more positive biology self-efficacy, who watched science-oriented television programmes, and who had stronger motivation and more positive attitudes towards biology learning all scored higher for their biological concepts. On the basis of the findings of the study, the authors make several suggestions for improving biology education.

AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorOriginated from the United States, service-learning is an education of experience which value both learning and service. The features of service-leaning cover almost all personal and social aspects, including improve student's academic intelligence,critical ability and self concept,the school atmosphere and the relationship between schools and communities. With Dewey's discussion on experience education, service-learning was formally proposed in the 1960s and boomed in the 70's in a number of campuses, now widely used in primary and secondary schools in the United States. This can be used for reference to Chinese basic education reform and the integrative practical activity curriculum. The thesis is divided into four parts. The first part briefly introduces the related researches on the topic of service learning written by domestic and American scholars, and then defines related concepts. The second part first overview the basic meaning and characteristics of service learning, review the historical evolution of service learning, and interpret the relevant policy, finally sort out the ideological foundation of service learning. This study suggests that, the. U.S. Service Learning's definition includes three elements: service closely combines with the learning,provide true help to others,students make self development from self-reflection. A typical service learning projects should meet the real needs of the community, students involved in the process of service learning as a leader, service learning should related to the academic subject, students have enough time to reflect, schools and communities establish a good collaborated working relationship. The third part introduces the status of the U.S. primary and secondary school implement service learning from the practice level. Introducing the impact of service learning to students, schools and teachers, and communities, the classification of service learning activities, focuses on the implementation of operational and quality standards of service-learning, using a classic case to illustrate the specific steps to implement service learning. This study suggests that in the specific implementation process of service learning, we should pay particular attention to the application of reflection. The forth part analysis the situation of service learning carried out by the United States primary and secondary school, attempting to summarize the success factors of U.S. service learning, in that case we can learn from the meaningful experience for Chinese basic education reform and the integrative practical activity

AB  - Background: Service-learning as a pedagogy and curricular consideration to revitalize undergraduate education has been flourishing in the Asia-Pacific Region for years. The W. T. Chan Fellowship Program is designed as an intercultural service-learning program, with the fellows coming from China and Hong Kong, to experience service-learning in the United States. Aims: This study investigates the effects of service-learning international program on intercultural competence of participants, using a pre-test and post-test approach. Sample: All twelve fellows involved in the W.T. Chan Fellowship Program. Method: Cross-Cultural Adaptability Inventory (CCAI) was utilized to measure intercultural competence of participants. The CCAI scores of the participants were compared prior to and after the program to measure any change during the period. Results: The results using a t-test analysis indicated that students who participated in the W.T. Chan Fellowship program showed a significant increase in total score of CCAI as well as in each dimension after completion the program. Data analysis also revealed that participants without previous intercultural experience gained significantly more in the dimension of emotional resiliency than those who had. Conclusion: As an intercultural service-learning program, participants can develop international competency, particularly in the areas of Emotional Resilience, Flexibility/Openness, Perceptual Acuity, Personal Autonomy. The findings of this study can assist international educators to design more effective education programs that would aid students in attaining the desired knowledge, skills and competencies.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the attitudes towards physician-pharmacist collaboration among pharmacy students in order to develop an interprofessional education (IPE) opportunity through integrating cooperative learning (CL) into a team-based student-supported community service event. The study also aimed to assess the change in students' attitudes towards interprofessional collaboration after participation in the event. A bilingual version of the Scale of Attitudes Toward Physician-Pharmacist Collaboration (SATP(2)C) in English and Chinese was completed by pharmacy students enrolled in Wuhan University of Science and Technology, China. Sixty-four students (32 pharmacy students and 32 medical students) in the third year of their degree volunteered to participate in the IPE opportunity for community-based diabetes and hypertension self-management education. We found themean score of SATP2C among 235 Chinese pharmacy students was 51.44. Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.90. Our key finding was a significant increase in positive attitudes towards interprofessional collaboration after participation in the IPE activity. These data suggest that there is an opportunity to deliver IPE in Chinese pharmacy education. It appears that the integration of CL into an interprofessional team-based community service offers a useful approach for IPE.

Research indicates that SL improves particular learning outcomes, but little is known about how this happens. Using Kolb's theory of experiential learning, the authors develop and test a conceptual model that explains how SL activates the four cycles of experiential learning and affects the learning outcomes of academic knowledge, career development, personal growth, and civic responsibility.

AB  - Service-learning (SL) is a form of experiential education which promotes student learning through community service and critical reflection. This study aims to examine the effect of SL on Chinese college students' transfer of learning and to explore the psychological mechanism of such effect. In Phase 1 with 186 Chinese college students, the SL group performed better in the quality of transfer but worse in the quantity of transfer than the traditional group. In Phase 2, survey data from the SL group demonstrated that constructive cognitive conflict had positive effects on behavioral engagement and transfer of learning; behavioral engagement fully mediated the relation between cognitive conflict and transfer of learning; and gender moderated the relation between cognitive conflict and behavioral engagement. This study answered whether and why SL could promote Chinese college students' transfer of learning. It has significant implications for promoting SL in reforming current teaching practice in China.

AB  - Using governmentality as a theoretical framework, we examine two Australian policy areas where young people are disciplined into becoming good, active citizens. These policies—mutual obligation through the work for the dole programme, and school-based active citizenship programmes similar to American service learning programmes—both mirror volunteer-type activities, in a social context where volunteers are viewed as good citizens. In this study, we present findings from a qualitative study that addresses the question of whether young people will develop active citizenship through compulsory volunteer-type programmes. The findings show that first, young people are very conscious of the lack of choice involved in these programmes and that this weakened their sense of agency. Second, the programmes failed to develop positive community attitudes and active social behaviours. These results suggest that policies that compel individuals to contribute to society may actually weaken their citizenship identities.

AB  - This paper explores community perceptions of students and faculty involved in service learning and campus outreach initiatives, examining how communities and campuses engage in service activities; how the service mission of higher education is perceived; whether service learning students help or hinder community agencies; and how partnerships between campuses and their communities can be enhanced. In the first part of the two-phase study, 65 directors of community service agencies in four towns in a rural Northwestern state were surveyed; questions covered general background information, overall perceptions of the campus, and questions related to student service providers. In the second phase, follow-up interviews were conducted with 30 agency personnel from a single community. The study found that communities generally have positive perceptions of campuses in their area; that there are challenges and benefits in working with service learning students; and that agency personnel want more coordination and communication with campus counterparts. Some concluding recommendations are offered: (1) communication lines need to be opened; (2) campuses need to open their doors to community partners; (3) campuses and communities need to jointly approach issues associated with recruitment, training, and retention of service providers; and (4) the purpose and expectations of campus-based service initiatives need to be clearly defined.

AB  - In support of the community-based education philosophy, nursing faculty at a small health careers college in the midwestern United States incorporated a service-learning experience involving Sudanese refugee families and Latino community members into its accelerated community-based nursing program (ACE) curriculum. The purpose of the service-learning experience is to allow students the opportunity develop relationships through which they may gain an understanding of unique needs within a community. This article describes the development and benefits of the service-learning experience across the ACE curriculum. Through reflection, students broaden and deepen their understanding about the health of individuals in the community and acquire a more sophisticated understanding of risk factors associated with the social determinants of health. ACE program faculty believe that having students involved in a continuous service-learning experience spanning the 15-month program allows students to develop strong relationships within the community and gain a greater understanding of the unique needs within that community. Overall, the experience has been successful and challenging.

AB  - Concerns around the provision and retention of quality teachers are global. Amongst these concerns are the preparedness of graduate teachers and the quality and nature of teacher education. The purpose of the article is to focus questions of teacher preparedness and education within a wider discussion around the professional life-cycle of teachers. Initial teacher education is viewed as the first phase of the professional life-cycle of a teacher; part of a professional continuum of learning and expertise, rather than a distinct preparatory phase. We do not present a detailed model for this continuum; believing there is still significant work to be done on defining and delineating the levels of expertise. Such work is beyond the scope of this paper. We do provide a starting point for further consideration. Further, we suggest a scaffolded transition, determined by the learning needs of teachers, between initial teacher education and induction, moving to in-service learning, with closer connections between providers and schools to mitigate against a disconnect between these phases of development. The potential role of professional standards in supporting teacher learning across the professional life-cycle is also discussed.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore preservice teachers' experiences of cognitive disequilibrium (CD) theory during a service-learning project in a study abroad experience. Method: A case study with 8 participants was used. Data sources consisted of: Formal interviews, videos of planning, videos of teaching, videos of reflection sessions, and informal interviews. Data were analyzed utilizing open and axial coding (Corbin & Strauss, 2008). Trustworthiness strategies included: prolonged engagement, multiple data source triangulation, and member checks. Results: Results indicated four themes: ``We made it our own thing{''}, ``Summer camp for teachers{''}, ``Struggle and disequilibrium{''}, and ``By the end it was a transformation{''}. Discussion/Conclusions: CD was ultimately positive for these students. The positive resolution of CD catalyzed a transformative effect on their perceptions of their teaching. This was supported by positive peer interaction.

AB  - This dissertation uses a case study of youth service proposals to examine how policy is formulated. For this study, youth service refers to federal programs that provide America's youth with opportunities to participate in domestic, non-military, full- or part-time community service activities. A theory is proposed that synthesizes two complimentary approaches to the study of policy--process analysis (Kingdon 1984, 1994) and the analysis of policy content (Schneider and Ingram 1990, 1993)--and advocates analyzing policy over time. Four theoretical categories of data--actors, ideas, opportunities, and strategies--guide the study. Three versions of youth service--national service writ large, team oriented programs modeled on the New Deal Civilian Conservation Corps, and school-based service-learning--are identified. Analysis of policy content underscores the importance of the social construction of target populations (Schneider and Ingram 1993). The youth service policy community's efforts to change the public perception of youth illustrate how policy entrepreneurs understand and use this policy tool. In the late 1980's, when the target population, youth, was successfully portrayed as positive (i.e., deserving and potentially powerful) rather than as negative (i.e., deviant and/or politically weak), the U.S. Congress passed PL 101-610, the National and Community Service Act of 1990. Youth service policy entrepreneurs are assertive and manipulative. They frame policies, use rationales to link their ideas to problems receiving Congressional attention, and create opportunities to advance their proposals. For the youth service case study, Kingdon's description of policy entrepreneurs as mostly reactive underestimates the role of these individuals. The theory advanced here reveals the process of public policy formulation to be less random than research by Kingdon suggests. Patterns emerge when policy is studied over time. A review of youth service bills in the U.S. Congress over thirty years identified only marginal change from one Congress to the next. Competing policy ideas seldom converged. Advocates for each version of youth service pursued separate strategies and addressed different audiences. Most innovations were proposed by newcomers to the youth service policy debate. In 1986, an umbrella organization was formed to unite youth service advocates. Eventually most members of the youth service policy community saw the wisdom of supporting a wide variety of program types. This strategy further enlarged the policy community and made it easier for divergent groups within Congress to support a broad youth service bill. Nevertheless, the dedicated commitment of a skilled and powerful member of Congress, Senator Edward Kennedy, and a 1988 youth service campaign commitment by successful presidential candidate George Bush were required before Congress would enact a comprehensive federal domestic youth service program.

AB  - Although service learning provides unparalleled real world experiential student learning opportunities and benefits to four major constituencies--student, faculty, community and institution, it takes place in an uncontrolled environment introducing uncertainty into the instructional process. Faculty might avoid this valuable approach to instruction seeing the uncertainty as additional risk that jeopardizes a major desirable outcome, student learning. This paper provides evidence that a major disruptive event, in this case the client quitting the project before the end of the course, does not limit the student learning levels achieved. The Plato's taxonomy levels of learning are used in a grounded theory approach to gauge learning achieved based on students' reflective papers from two service learning project classes where one client quits during the semester. Effective strategies to manage this major challenge inherent in experiential service learning are presented.

AB  - This study explores teacher educators’ beliefs and practices related to the modeling of effective instruction in the pre-service classroom. Previous research has shown that when teacher educators model effective instructional practice, there are positive learning outcomes for pre-service teachers and for teacher educators (Daniel, 2011; DeLuca, Chavez, Bellara, & Cao, 2013; Hogg & Yates, 2013; Ritter, 2012; White, 2011). Yet the literature on teacher educator modeling is sparse, especially in foundations courses. While limited, the extant research indicates that teacher educators do not model as explicitly or as widely as scholars recommend (Lunenberg, Korthagen, & Swennen, 2007; Ritter, 2012; Ruys, Defruyt, Rots, & Aelterman, 2013; Santangelo & Tomlinson, 2012). To explore teacher educator modeling, this multi-case study included two class observations, a pre-observation interview, and a post-observation interview with four instructors who teach required foundations courses in the Rutgers Graduate School of Education (GSE) teacher preparation program. Interview data indicate that the instructors believe that teacher educator modeling is an important aspect of pre-service learning, and observational data suggest that the instructors regularly engage in implicit modeling of effective instructional practice. However, explicit modeling types, which the literature indicates are most beneficial for pre-service learners (Grossman, 2018), were underutilized. The data also suggest that there is a relationship between instructors’ beliefs about teacher educator modeling and the types of modeling that they enact. The instructors who believe that teacher educator modeling involves modeling instructional practices and pedagogical thinking were the most likely to model explicitly, whereas the instructors who believe that teacher educator modeling involves modeling attitudes and beliefs were more likely to model implicitly. These findings have implications for the GSE and, more broadly, for education preparation providers wishing to enhance both teacher education pedagogy and pre-service teacher learning.

AB  - Can art make a difference? This is a call for a new sense of interconnectivity among visual art programs in and out of schools. This common ground will be found in the embodiment of performance, critical reflection, and social change within art learning. One goal of this article is to encourage educators to use the "verbs of art" for building curriculum investigations that integrate social change and community engagement. The cite/sight/site of our critique is centered on an after-school art program for refugee children. Two focal questions: Can performance help art educators become more-effective leaders in community development? Will the study of performance enhance our commitment to active inquiry and social learning? (Contains 5 figures and 3 endnotes.)

AB  - Health care is being called upon to better prepare practitioners for providing health related services within the community. This dual design study looked at the value and impact of using service learning as pedagogy to improve occupational therapy students' awareness, commitment, and sense of responsibility toward community. Sixty-nine occupational therapy students from two occupational therapy practice courses participated in the study, with 44 students in the experimental group and 25 in the comparison group. The experimental group participated in service experiences of their choice that were limited to the client population connected to the practice course in which they were enrolled. The comparison group did not participate in a service experience. All participants completed a demographic survey and a pretest/posttest consisting of a semantic differential (SD) and the Community Service Involvement Preference Inventory (CSIPI). Each member of the experimental group was also required to keep a journal. Analysis of variance of the concepts and factors of the SD showed minimal change, however, descriptive analysis of the adjective pairs did indicate a change in attitude occurred. Analysis of variance of the phases and factors of the CSIPI indicated no movement through phases but qualitative analysis of the journal entries, using the Service Learning Model, indicated developmental differences between experimental groups existed. The younger students in this study consistently showed more statistical and descriptive activity than did the older students. This activity was concrete and in the direction of a more heightened awareness of and commitment to community. The older students had already been participating in service learning for three years. They did not show as much of a difference from the beginning to the end of the study as the younger students but, they did exhibit more sophistication and maturity in their reflections and a more abstract view of community issues and needs. Overall, results indicated that the descriptive analyses produced more informative data than the inferential analyses. The data strongly suggests that design and implementation of service learning programs should consider using developmental learning models to clarify expectations and maximize positive outcomes.

AB  - International mindedness and global citizenship are two key terms within international education, which underpin much of the discourse within the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme. This article proposes how a participatory approach to education for international mindedness and global citizenship can help educators within international schools to encourage students to think critically about reality beyond their "ivory tower isolation", questioning the inequalities in the world that surrounds them. The article shows how the use of a critical, participatory pedagogy within the field of service learning can be employed in order to explore what global citizenship and international mindedness mean in the context of the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme. The article also proposes that this participatory, critical inquiry involves engaging students as researchers as an effective pedagogy in order to bring about new knowledge and understandings relating to the concepts of global citizenship and international mindedness.

AB  - Although [Kay Chan], like [Peter Chan], had expectations for her children to be successful, she made few attempts to teach the children "the achievement literacy" that schools value and make visible, i.e. reading and writing. She expressed displeasure and frustration: "I do not know how to help my children. That is what the teachers do." Kay appeared to be like other parents who work "within memories" of the past ([Taylor], 1983), for in traditional Chinese schools there is a set script for learning. In this paradigm, the Chinese teacher's role is an agent of knowledge which is transmitted to students via a lecture. In contrast, Canadian teachers guide learners to interpret meaning for themselves and engage in reflective interaction through experiential learning. Kay was unaware that in recent years there has been a rapid restructuring of Chinese schools which provided alternative pedagogies for teaching and learning in order to meet the demands of an expanding socialist market economy (Lin & Ross, 1998). Not understanding Western pedagogy either, Kay believed that Canadian schools were lax, did not teach her children, and did not assign sufficient homework which in her view was based on rote learning. "My children just go on field trips. They have no homework." In Canada, a capitalist society, a transmission model does not function as well as a transactional pedagogy. What makes transactional learning more appealing is that it is grounded in critical thinking, generating possibilities, analyzing, and weighing alternatives--a way to "make it" in a global society. All too often, many, like Kay, do not value the things we value, as transactional learning is a major shift in educational thinking. Contrary to other studies of Chinese North American families (Lu. 1999, Chao, 1996; Siu, 1994; Peng & Wright, 1994; Sung, 1987) which describe families that take no chances with the school failing to teach their children, or of Chinese families (Lin & Qinghai, 1995) who place home-school pressures on children, I realized that there little time was invested in home teaching and literacy activities in the Chan household. Over time, I understood the reasons. What counts as literacy? Literacy as a social practice enables one to use language to extend cultural meanings and knowledge about ideas and experiences. According to Gee (1996), "literacy practices are almost always fully integrated with, interwoven into, constituted part of, the very texture of, wider practices that involve talk, interaction, values, and beliefs" (p. 41), both in families and communities. In this study, I explored the diversity of family literacy as social practice in the two Chinese immigrant homes within their bi-cultural and bi-literacy contexts. To facilitate translation and rapport building, a graduate student translator from the People's Republic of China accompanied me. Through explanatory narrative (Polkinghorne, 1988), which is a multilayered act of reality. I relate my understanding of three ESL children's contrasting literacy "experiences-as-lived" (Van Manen, 1996). Since narrative is a form of understanding meaning in peoples' lives, I find narrative to be useful in offering glimpses of ethnographic realities readers may take away, compare, and develop. Differences between the children and families are not anomalies so much as varied social and cultural experiences. Using a sociocultural lens allowed me to see the children and families as cultural participants whose identities and perceptions reflect the nested cultural contexts of ethnicity, literacy attainment, gender, and economic status. I was careful to "bracket" by not ascribing my interpretation of those observations as only my understanding of the world. I did not want to essentialize or make generalizations about both Chinese immigrant families, the Chans and the Yeungs, for I had only the privilege of a partial perspective, seeing them in a snapshot of time. I wanted to describe their sense of their literacy practices, not my sense based on what I perceived their world should be like. By describing bi-literacy in a natural setting, "what and how it means" ([Fishman]. 1988), the study was guided by the following research question: What are the socialcultural environments of literacy development and the possible occasions for languages in Chinese families?

AB  - To identify motivations and expectations regarding experiential education programs, a study interviewed 143 individuals from five participant groups. High school students, program coordinators, secondary principals, employers/sponsors, and parents involved in eighteen experiential programs in four states (Ohio, California, Florida, and Massachusetts) were interviewed. Programs ranged from alternative schools which offered optional community activities to service learning programs, to Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) youth programs. Although some students were paid and some received academic credit, all programs offered young people the opportunity for a structured learning experience in a workplace setting. Results of the interview data revealed seven areas of conflicting expectations: pay, recruitment, support for programs, quality of learning, graduation credit for experiences, creation of placements, and appropriate scheduling. Although respondents generally expressed positive attitudes, each constituency brings to program participation a unique set of problems and needs. Learners and their parents are convinced of the value of experiential education; employers/sponsors are also, as long as organizational efficiency and productivity are not compromised; and school administrators are interested in experiential education as a means of addressing building problems and community expectations.

AB  - In this chapter, the author examines the role of student characteristics in service-learning programs. Four questions drawn from the research on volunteer service are the focus: (1) How do students who engage in volunteer service differ from those who do not? (2) What factors play a central role in the motivation to engage in volunteer service activities? (3) Among service providers, what characteristics are associated with the level of involvement, in terms of hrs of service, devoted to helping others? (4) Among service providers, what characteristics are associated with sustaining volunteer service over time, as opposed to terminating such activity? The implications for service-learning programs are discussed throughout the chapter. In addition to a review of the literature on each question, the author summarizes the findings emerging from his own work on these questions.

AB  - Three principal sets of problems with quantitative research on service-learning are addressed in this chapter. Taken together, these problems provide a basis for concluding that, due to the anticipated diversity of possible outcomes of such programs, existing methodologies are relatively insensitive assessment techniques. These sets of problems are: (a) problems associated with the selection of outcome variables for study, (b) problems associated with the selection of research instruments to measure the variables selected, and (c) problems associated with confounding life events that make it difficult to attribute observed impacts to the program under study. An alternative methodological approach using the individual student as the unit of analysis will be proposed as a means to address many of the problems raised here.

AB  - Service-learning is an instructional strategy used by faculty at hundreds of institutions, including those that are members of Campus Compact, an organization committed to service-learning and community/civic engagement. For this study, researchers examined a variety of online survey assessment tools used in service-learning projects. The study's purpose is to demonstrate what questions, concepts, and categories are currently being utilized for evaluation of (1) students, (2) faculty, and (3) community partners from 121 Campus Compact member institutions, using Gelmon, Holland, Driscoll, Spring, and Kerrigan's (2001) taxonomy. Six unique concepts emerged from the study that diverged from Gelmon et al.'s taxonomy. This research provides a survey tool that is readily accessible for educators' use when constructing service-learning assessment. The article concludes with recommendations to educators for use of assessment surveys.

AB  - Client expectations about mental health services relate to the client’s and the therapist’s role, the therapeutic process and therapeutic outcomes. Research with adults shows that such expectations affect service engagement and clinical outcomes. Aim: The present study investigated expectations for adolescents and young adults, which have not been adequately investigated and may partly explain the reluctance of young people to seek professional help. Methods: Participants included 20 young people aged 12–24 attending their initial session at a youth mental health service, who were interviewed immediately prior to their initial session. Data were analysed using qualitative methods to draw main themes around each of the four expectancy types. Results: Overall, the strongest theme was that young people were unsure of what to expect from attending a mental health service. The key theme for expectations of their role as a client was readiness for therapy, and for the therapist’s role the key themes were who they expected to see, the directiveness and likeability of the therapist, and the type of help they expected they would receive. The young people expected that the therapy process would involve simply talking and expected their engagement to be dependent on how much they liked their first few sessions. Outcome expectations were non-specific and the theme of hopefulness was most evident. Conclusion: As unrealistic and unmet expectations can lead to poorer engagement and outcomes in therapy, the study highlights a need for young people to be better informed about what to expect when coming to mental health services.

AB  - Purpose This study set out to explore the current state of global health concentrations in Canadian medical schools and to solicit feedback on the barriers and challenges to implementing rigorous global health concentration programs. Method A set of consensus guidelines for global health concentrations was drafted through consultation with student and faculty leaders across Canada between May 2011 and May 2012. Drawing on these guidelines, a formal survey was sent to prominent faculty at each of the 14 English-speaking Canadian medical schools. A thematic analysis of the results was then conducted. Results Overall, the guidelines were strongly endorsed. A majority of Canadian medical schools have programs in place to offer global health course work, extracurricular learning opportunities, local community service-learning, low-resource-setting clinical electives, predeparture training, and postreturn debriefing. Although student evaluation, global health mentorship, and knowledge translation projects were endorsed as important components, few schools had been successful in implementing them. Language training for global health remains contested. Other common critiques included a lack of time and resources, and difficulties in setting standards for student evaluation. Conclusions The results suggest that these guidelines are appropriate and, at least for the major criteria, achievable. Although many Canadian schools offer individual components, the majority of schools have yet to develop formally structured concentration programs. By better articulating guidelines, a standardized framework can aid in the establishment and refinement of future programs.

AB  - There is currently little knowledge or understanding of medical students' knowledge and attitudes toward the poor. Teaching hospitals bring students face-to-face with poor and uninsured patients on a regular basis. However, an overview of the research available suggests that this contact does not result in students' greater understanding and empathy for the plight of the poor and may, in fact, lead to an erosion of positive attitudes toward the poor. A basic understanding of justice suggests that as the poor are disproportionately the subjects of medical training, this population should enjoy a proportionate benefit for this service. Furthermore, medicine's social contract with the public is often thought to include an ideal of service to the underserved and a duty to help educate the general public regarding the health needs of our nation. In their discussion, the authors situate medical students' attitudes toward the poor within larger cultural perspectives, including attitudes toward the poor and attributions for poverty. They provide three suggestions for improving trainees' knowledge of and attitudes toward the poor-namely, increasing the socioeconomic diversity of students, promoting empathy through curricular efforts, and focusing more directly on role modeling. The authors argue that service learning, especially efforts that include gaining detailed knowledge of a particular person or persons, coupled with critical reflection, presents a very promising direction toward achieving these goals. Finally, they posit an agenda for future educational research that might contribute to the increased efficacy of medical education in this important formative domain.

AB  - This guide takes illustrated children's literature into the world of service learning (positing that when these two are joined, learning opportunities open up) and suggests how teachers can enhance students' service learning experiences with children's literature. Topics covered in the nine short sections of the guide include telling stories, the power of children's literature, from womb to tomb (how stories affect readers or listeners at various ages), learning about service learning, tales for preparation, tales for action, tales for reflection, tales for celebration, and tales for everyone. The guide also contains a list of 27 references for the stories discussed, an annotated bibliography of 27 additional books, and a list of 5 resource organizations. (KC)

AB  - There is ample evidence that points out that the majority of social work students have little interest in social policy analysis. In this study, the impact a classroom-based policy construction exercise had on the interest level in policy of a differentiated sample (N = 43) of MSW students, in which participants were enrolled in either a community- or family-practice program, was measured. Results of a paired samples t-test suggest that the exercise significantly increased the participants' interest in social policy, as t(42) = 2.59, p < .05. When comparing the effects of the intervention on the respective subsamples, only the family-practice group yielded significant results, as t(20) = 2.14, p < .05. The implications this study has for social work educators striving to increase students' interest in social policy, particularly among aspiring micro practitioners, are also discussed.

AB  - Independent schools are increasingly placing significant priority on community service and understand the important messages about social and personal responsibility that these programs convey to students, along with the invaluable hands-on, real-world experience that they get in community service work. And while student community service is certainly an important part of what goes on in independent schools, if independent school heads are truly going to walk their talk with respect to the importance of community service, the author contends that they need to do something more, something that students and parents can see as evidence of their schools' own institutional commitment in this area.

AB  - Current approaches and trends in writing pedagogy within the composition classroom focus on the development of students' identities through personal, cultural, or disciplinary processes. By employing writing assignments and activities that concentrate on developing certain traits or characteristics of students' identities has led to a "crisis" within the field of composition studies. This crisis exists because many writing pedagogies operate within cognitive and social paradigms, which involve ways of knowing and doing things, such as the use of grammar, interpretation of culture through literature, and methods of research. In essence, many writing pedagogies in the cognitive and social paradigms tend to promote and produce an Academic Literacy that is not only alienating to many students, but that also acts as a "gate-keeping/grade-giving" mechanism (Beaufort, 2007). By viewing freshmen composition from a social-cognitive standpoint, institutions of higher learning can implement curriculums that promote writing assignments and activities that influence students to "trace" academic literacy, which is based on Standard Academic Discourse (SAD). On the other hand, writing pedagogy that incorporates anthropological, ethnographical, and service-learning approaches within a rhizomal paradigm promotes assignments and activities that offer students the opportunity to "map" out their own way of researching and writing within the freshmen composition classroom (Deleuze & Guattari, 1987). The following are appended: (1) English Composition 1301, Section 000; (2) Composition 1301 Grading Rubric: The Resume; (3) Composition 1301 Grading Rubric: The "Interviews" Essays; (4) Writing Assignment # 3: Research Proposal Grading Rubric; (5) Writing Assignment #4: The Research Paper Grading Rubric; (6) Writing Assignment #5: Formal Poster Board Presentation Grading Rubric; (7) Writing Assignment #6: The Final Reflection Grading Rubric; (8) English Composition 1302, Section 000; (9) Composition 1302 Grading Rubric: Service-Learning Project; and (10) Composition 1302 Assignment Description: The Formal Debate on the Service-Learning Project.

AB  - Dwindling resources for tertiary education, has resulted in reduced emphasis on intensive, small group, staff-student collaborative project-based service learning. However, training scientists to manage significant issues, such as sustainable water use, requires an ability to engage both industry and community stakeholders. This paper describes the results of an "action conversations" approach to explore community perceptions, teach students skills for community engagement, and evaluate their experience of this as a teaching and learning method. It suggests that there are significant parallels between factors contributing to successful community engagement and effective teaching and learning by students. (Contains 2 footnotes and 2 tables.)

AB  - Service-learning is an educational method that is usually examined for its practical applications and outcomes, and can help instructors and students to realize the connective aspect of classroom discussions, assignments, activities and discourses that occur within the community. In this respect, “connective” refers to more than just bridging the distance between the classroom and community using service-learning. Instead, it acts like the “connective human tissue” that unites individuals together. Individuals as biological beings themselves are the connective tissue that unites them linguistically, physically and emotionally. In essence, the connective human tissue that unites individuals together creates an intertwined community through the construction, dispersion and consumption of the discourses and rhetoric(s) they use to consume knowledge(s). In this research, I apply the connective human tissue metaphor to the service-learning writing classroom and how instructors and students can use it to address issues such as race and whiteness. Green (2003), Lietz (2008) and Endres and Gould (2009) have examined race and whiteness within the context of a service-learning writing classroom. More specifically, a writing classroom that incorporates service-learning will have students discussing, expressing and writing about their thoughts and assumptions of race and whiteness in a way where they do not get “bogged down” in the superficial or stereotypical dialogues and representations produced by the consumer culture mentality. I have two main goals, which are 1) to envision and create my Connective and Interwoven Communities (CIC) Model, and 2) to offer new approaches and pedagogies for addressing race and whiteness in the service-learning writing classroom. My research questions are 1) How should race and whiteness be addressed in the service-learning, writing classroom?, 2) How does service-learning, as a pedagogical approach, allow, hinder, or help the writing instructor and students address and explore race and whiteness in the writing classroom?, and 3) What assignments, readings and activities can be used to allow the service-learning writing instructor to address such issues? My research provides and encourages writing instructors to create a variety of pedagogical approaches for the service-learning writing classroom that 1) encourages critical discussions and reflections over race and whiteness, 2) enables students with a sense of agency when writing about their experiences within the community and 3) eventually helps students develop strategies and techniques in using rhetoric to create greater awareness of whiteness and race. In order to understand how issues of race and whiteness play a role in the service-learning writing classroom, I have interviewed six experts within the field of rhetoric & writing studies. The responses provided from these six scholars provide insight into developing further theoretical frameworks for incorporating and analyzing race and whiteness into the service-learning writing classroom.

AB  - The extant body of research reveals that at-risk students have difficulty connecting to school and classroom curricula. These students often develop negative attitudes toward school that prevent them from fully benefiting from the curricula. Negative school experiences set the stage for at-risk students eventually dropping out of school. This trajectory particularly applies to at-risk Latino students who are exposed to home factors outside of school that lead to disengaged classroom behavior and poor social skills. School-wide discipline systems are punitive and do not provide positive behavior supports. Service learning, by comparison, is an instructional approach that provides positive behavior supports that teach students to collaborate and to work on being interdependent with their peers. The purpose of this qualitative case study was to examine teachers' experiences of service learning and to explore their views on the effect of service learning on the development of social skills among at-risk Latino elementary school students. Freire's theoretical framework of critical consciousness, life-course theory, and Waller's sociology of schooling helped to frame this study. Data from 6 teacher interviews, observations, and field notes were analyzed via axial and open coding, which revealed that service learning benefits at-risk students socially and academically. The results also revealed that teachers often lack the training and administrative support to implement effective service learning projects. These findings led to the recommendations for stronger service learning implementation. The results of this research contribute to social change by addressing the specific social needs of at-risk students, which will benefit educators in their application of learning strategies to better engage students.

AB  - Ninety-three young Australians were interviewed about volunteering as part of a larger three-stage study on youth spirituality and social concern. The results indicate that young people who were older, better educated and had access to networks and mentoring were more likely to be engaged in social-cause service than those without these resources. Social-cause service involves volunteers having direct involvement in causes or activities that help people who are in need, are disadvantaged or marginalised. In comparison, standard-cause service involves volunteers working in activities which assist other people but do not involve direct exposure to them or to issues of inequality or injustice in society. Respondents who engaged in social-cause service saw clear benefits for themselves as well as for the group with whom they were serving. (Contains 2 notes.)

AB  - As service-learning projects have spread throughout academia, efforts to assess the service-learning experience have assumed a greater importance. The BERSI scale (Business Education's Role in addressing Social Issues) was developed as a measure of business Students' attitudes toward social issues being addressed as part of a business education. As such, it was intended to be useful in assessing attitudinal outcomes of service learning. In order for the BERSI to be useful for nonbusiness students, the Scale would need to be reconceptualized and revalidated. This Study modified the BERSI items with a focus on college Students in general rather than business Students, making the resulting scale, College Education's Role in addressing Social Issues (CERSI), potentially helpful to service-learning researchers in a broader setting. The CERSI scale was then validated using standard techniques and normative data were reported.

AB  - Purpose: If business education programs are to meet the needs of the business community, educators must continuously examine the strengths and weaknesses of their programs. While the current business curriculum typically educates students in the key business disciplines, many business schools deliver their curriculum by creating courses based on functional area, rather than the integration of knowledge from a holistic perspective. Therefore, the purpose of this literature review is to explore several approaches for delivering the business curriculum Design/methodology/approach: This aim is achieved through a holistic approach, which highlights the benefits and limitations of each proposal. Key approaches include capstone projects, service learning projects, team teaching, and integrative case studies. Findings: The literature review revealed that all four approaches provide students with the opportunity to integrate their business knowledge with the critical skills that they have mastered in their liberal arts courses. However, of these approaches, the research suggests that implementing a service learning program not only permits students to integrate their knowledge, but also provides the opportunity for real-life application of these concepts. In addition, this approach also provides the opportunity for students to experience social responsibility through civic engagement, hopefully strengthening their sense of ethics and character. Originality/value: The role of modern business is not only to maintain profits for its shareholders, but also to demonstrate good corporate citizenship. Thus, today’s business educators have the responsibility to prepare students for the role of modern business, including corporate citizenship, sustainability, and social responsibility. Thus, this paper will allow business educators to explore ways to achieve this goal. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Urban schools, especially those serving high minority, high poverty, and low performing students, are in desperate need of high-quality teachers, yet issues with retention, recruitment, and preparedness plague urban districts (Aragon, Culpepper, McKee & Perkins, 2014). Teacher educators are challenged to prepare teacher candidates to overcome misconceptions about urban schools. This study was designed to explore the effects that one sustained, supervised, course-based service learning experience had on preservice teachers' preconceptions and attitudes towards urban education. Surveys were administered to 38 teacher candidates before and after their service learning experience at an urban charter school. Results were analyzed using paired samples t-tests and indicated significant changes in attitudes towards the facilities, teaching materials and neighborhood safety for urban schools. Implications for teacher educators are examined.

AB  - Check-in/check-out (CICO) is a well-established Tier 2 intervention to address at-risk student behavior problems. Despite its widespread empirical support and applied use, CICO can be taxing for teachers to implement when there is insufficient time available and teacher self-efficacy in addressing behavior problems is low. Evaluation of CICO is necessary to promote smarter decision making and efficient service delivery for students at risk of developing more severe problem behaviors. The discussion article outlines one method to identify the exact amount of Tier 2 support needed to improve an individual student's behavior.

AB  - In this chapter, the authors argue that there is compelling research that proves the pedagogy of service-learning to be an effective, instructional tool that appropriately prepares today's youth to create a better tomorrow. Service-learning not only increases academic knowledge and performance but also cultivates social development and lifelong skills such as critical thinking skills. By implementing service-learning programs within educational settings, new and effective pathways for teachers to reach students within and among various ethnicities and gender, especially Latino youth are being created. Through an initiative supported by the National Council of La Raza, research has found that Latino participants gain a number of social skills and personal values which allow youth to view themselves and their communities through a positive lens. While gaining leadership, critically thinking, and decision-making skills, students' academic connection to school increases. Emerging data such as this contributes to the conversations on the role of service-learning pedagogy in classrooms of Latino students and the function this powerful, instructional tool can provide to educators and their students.

AB  - Recommended approaches to promoting children's physical activity through schools call for physical education teachers to serve as champions for, and leaders of, Comprehensive School Physical Activity Programs (CSPAPs). Little evidence, however, exists to suggest that physical education teachers are ideally prepared or supported to assume CSPAP leadership roles. The purpose of this article is to consider expectations that must be met for physical education teachers to serve as central protagonists in CSPAP implementation efforts, and to propose a conceptual model aimed at increasing both effectiveness and sustainability of CSPAPs through key external-internal partnerships. Specifically, community-based participatory research, communities of practice, and service-learning are presented as possible strategies to expand the support system for growing and sustaining CSPAPs. In sum, this article offers some reasons for rethinking current recommendations for CSPAP implementation.

Data sources included focus group interviews, written reflections, field notes, and artifacts. Constant comparison techniques and triangulation guided data analysis and interpretation to identify overarching themes describing the PPETs' successes, challenges, and lessons learned. Results: Four themes were identified: (a) outcomes with youth, parents, and staff, (b) communication, (c) planning and preparation, and (d) priorities and possibilities. Discussion/Conclusion: This study provides insight into the feasibility and outcomes of CSPAP-related service learning for PPETs, and uncovers promising aspects as well as potential issues with CSPAP implementation.

AB  - This article addresses the development of cross-cultural competency within the context of service-learning. The need to integrate cross-cultural competency into the academic curriculum has risen dramatically with the sharp increase in resident Hispanics and their families. Service-learning addresses the demand for culturally competent graduates who can address the paradigms of inequality and invisibility as well as the language barrier. Service-learning develops cultural competency through weekly direct contact and journal writing exercises. By venturing into the community, students see beyond the cultural walls that often divide neighborhoods, and they also make connections between economics, anthropology, history, political science, and other disciplines. Through service-learning, many university students develop maturity and ingenuity that they would not acquire in the classroom. Community partners—the families, students, and teachers—discover how to complement and advocate for each other to help ensure well-being and academic success. This article analyzes and evaluates the service-learning experience through a community practicum course in which students spend 40 hours working with Hispanic migrant families. It includes the evolution in service-learning in a university program and the value in the shift from a focus on language acquisition to the development of cultural competency as an integral part of the program. Working with a population that is culturally different from themselves and the textbook knowledge they have received has become a cornerstone of university language and teacher-training programs.

AB  - Service learning is increasingly being used as a pedagogical strategy for promoting the development of civic-mindedness among university students. Despite the use of this strategy, little is known about the benefits derived from specific types of service-learning experiences. Additionally, few notable studies have examined the unique outcomes experienced by mentors of at-risk youth. Therefore, this study examines the civic-related benefits that college students derive from mentoring at-risk youth within a structured, service-learning course. A series of linear regression models were estimated to determine if there were significant post-intervention differences between the treatment and comparison condition for the variables of interest, after adjusting for key background factors and pre-intervention levels of all variables. The results indicated that, in comparison to college students who did not participate in the course (n = 258), college student in Campus Corps, a youth mentoring program, (n = 390) had significantly higher scores at post-intervention regarding mentors' civic attitudes, community service self-efficacy, self-esteem, interpersonal and problem solving skills, political awareness, and civic action. Findings hold important implications for youth mentoring programs and future research.

AB  - Service-learning for social justice is celebrated by progressive educators as a practical that encourages students to examine axes of power and privilege across social boundaries such as race, gender, class, age, and sexuality via the service experience. Derived from social justice pedagogy, the literature around theory and practice is predominantly aimed at two groups: privileged students and marginalized students. This tendency presents a challenge for educators who work with racially and economically diverse students as well as those students who do not qualify as privileged or marginalized, but rather 'in the middle.' The purpose of this chapter is to examine the literature around social justice service-learning pedagogy directed at students at both ends of the spectrum, in order to highlight that there is considerable overlap between the two, giving us hope for new approaches to service-learning that help all students regardless of position on the power and privilege spectrum, confront injustice, and work for change while avoiding helplessness, guilt, or confirmation of destructive stereotypes.

AB  - This paper discusses the implementation of an intergenerational service-learning (IS-L) project with a mentorship component for graduate students at Western Michigan University's Gerontology Program. Two classes of students, one graduate and one undergraduate, taking introductory gerontology courses were brought together to complete IS-L projects of their own designs. Graduate students were asked to act as mentors to undergradute team members. To guide development of mentorship skills, eight Seifter and Economy (2001) teachable principles of good team management were used: (1) put power in the hands of the people doing the work; (2) encourage individual responsibility; (3) create clarity of roles; (4) share and rotate leadership; (5) foster horizontal teamwork; (6) learn to listen, learn to talk; (7) seek consensus; and, (8) dedicate passionately to your mission. While challenging, most of the graduate students found the process of developing mentorship skills personally insightful and valuable. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Student- or learner-centered teaching has an historical context--it is old and new. This article traces the path that has brought us full circle to once again concentrating on student learning instead of teacher teaching from the era of learning being restricted to the wealthy and privileged, to today where learning institutions are inclusive. Three pressures are identified and discussed that have been the catalysts for reevaluating teaching methods in higher education: assessment of teaching and learning at the institutional level, generational differences between instructor and student, and a better understanding of how students learn. The rubric is examined as a method of assessing student progress in a student-centered environment. These are then related to the teaching of gerontology and geriatrics where students and teachers alike have a distinct edge over other content areas where the practicum experience is not part of the educational fabric.

AB  - In the summer of 2014, students from universities in the contiguous United States (Lower 48) and Inupiat youth from Alaska carried out a pilot project as participants/co-researchers in a process called Intergenerational Dialog, Exchange, and Action (IDEA). This action-oriented, community-based, and participatory research method was first developed in 2008, as a platform for structuring dialog between adults, Elders and youth within a community, and for extending resonant ideas emerging from these discussions through Photovoice and digital storytelling amongst youth participants. This pilot study was designed to investigate the feasibility and potential of university students from the Lower 48 and Indigenous youth from Alaska to carry out the IDEA process together as co-researchers. The results of the pilot suggest that it is both possible and meaningful for IDEA to be conducted by a team of youth co-researchers. We found that participation in IDEA expanded the perspectives of youth co-researchers from both Alaska and the Lower 48 in parallel, yet different ways. Exploring the strengths of older community members, being exposed to different ways of living and being, and having opportunities to reflect on and build narratives around these ideas, allowed all the co-researchers to develop a new understanding of their own communities and their roles and responsibilities within them. This paper shares youth co-researcher reflections of the process and the ways in which the process prompted these new perspectives about themselves, their respective communities and their roles within them.

AB  - Social capital is a designer social science concept that is very much in academic and popular vogue. Indeed, in recent years there has been a proliferation of theoretical articles in academia lauding the veracity of social capital as a 'silver bullet,' explain all, cure all phenomena. However, it seems that little work has been undertaken on linking the theory of social capital to work in practice in the field of community learning and development. This article aims to redress the balance in some way by offering an analysis of social capital in terms of a 'work in progress' at an intergenerational school/seniors' community project in Midlothian, Scotland, where the theory of social capital is informing practice and thinking of the staff of Midlothian Befrienders and vice versa.

AB  - Turns to contemporary feminist object-relations theory to understand the efforts of students in a service learning course, to push beyond the usual subject-object, active-passive dualisms that pervade community-based literacy projects, and to compose instead complex representations in which all participants are composed as active, as knowing, and as exceeding any single construction of identity. Argues for placing writing and the problems of composing at the center of such courses. (SG)

AB  - When service is linked to learning and placed at the core of the curriculum, the combination opens the door to the multifaceted education we Americans want for all young people, equipping them for their roles not just as learners, but also as community members and workers. In addition, there is growing agreement that school-based civic education is critical to the development of a new generation of young people with the values, knowledge, skills, sense of efficacy and commitment that define an active and principled citizen. Properly seen, there are meaningful connections between service-learning and civic education; service-learning can be a critical pedagogy for students to acquire and enhance citizenship knowledge and skills, and civic education can be a critical avenue through which students connect their academic learning to serving their communities and country.

AB  - Service-learning continues to be utilized in teacher education programs. A salient feature of this form of pedagogy is the use of reflection. Many instructors and students struggle with the reflection process. Particularly, instructors are challenged to assess students' reflection entries. This article describes a guided reflection rubric that was used as a learning and teaching tool for service-learning experiences in special education courses. A quantitative analysis revealed significant improvement in reflection entries of students' journals. Teacher educators socially validated the rubric as a teaching and assessment tool.

AB  - This report explores the impact, through themes that emerged in interviews with 59 participating adolescents, of the Mentor/Advisor Program on students with or at risk of emotional disturbance. The Mentor/Advisor Program is implemented as part of the existing regular education high school curriculum and is designed to promote resiliency and school success among high school students, particularly those with emotional and behavioral challenges. This is accomplished through opportunities for building relationships, leadership and problem-solving skills, and community engagement. The main components of the project include: (1) heterogeneous groups of 6-8 students (those with and without emotional and behavioral problems) meet with their mentor throughout the school year for approximately one hour 2 to 3 times per week; (2) community service learning projects that meet the needs of the community; (3) Individualized Learning Plans; and (4) family and community involvement. Participating adolescents indicated that the mentor groups gave them a chance to be accepted and a sense of belonging not based on traditional social groups. Students also indicated that one of the key reasons they liked the mentorship class was the opportunity for student leadership. The community service learning was consistently noted by students as one of their favorite aspects of the program. (CR)

AB  - This paper examines in detail how higher education serves the larger public good, focusing on how higher education assesses and accounts for its service to society. It begins with a brief description of how the civic education of students and institutional service to society are defined for the purposes of this paper. It then discusses assessment and accountability strategies, including the kinds of measures that tend to be the focus of most public reporting strategies. The civic education and service roles of higher education are not usually the focus of public reporting. When civic contributions are assessed, something else, whether service learning, campus, climate, student diversity, or "service" to the community, is measured. To build assessments of the civic contributions of higher education into reports of accountability, there are some obstacles that must be overcome. This paper identifies those obstacles and presents some strategies to build assessment and accountability capacities for the civic roles of higher education. The strategies are drawn from assessment models currently being used to measure specific dimensions of campuses' civic roles and activities. An appendix lists 14 resources for further information.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In the context of a group process course, occupational therapy students learned health promotion skills through working on personal wellness goals and leading community-based health promotion groups. The groups targeted topics such as smoking cessation, improving diet, reducing stress through yoga, meditation, tai chi chuan, ROM (Range of Motion) Dance, aerobics, and a variety of other activities. METHOD: After identifying a personal wellness goal and developing it in a Wellness Awareness Learning Contract, each student used a Goal Attainment Scale (GAS) to predict an expected outcome for achieving the goal and to measure his or her progress toward attaining the goal. Students also used the GAS to measure progress in attaining group leadership skills within the community groups, which they outlined in a separate Group Skills Contract. Students kept weekly logs to foster reflective thinking, and the logs were used for interactive dialogue with the instructor. To further evaluate lifestyle change, students compared pretest and posttest scores on a Self-Assessment Scorecard, which surveyed six areas of health and human potential in body, mind, and spirit. RESULTS: Students monitored their own change process on both their personal health lifestyle goals and their group leadership skills while developing a richer appreciation of the dynamics of working for change with clients in community and traditional settings. Differences on the Self-Assessment Scorecard indicated improvement on two of the six scales for physical health and choices. CONCLUSION: Students experienced firsthand the challenges of developing healthier lifestyles on the basis of their personal goals as well as through fostering group changes. The two GAS learning contracts provided them with concrete evidence of their growth and learning. This experience--embedded in the context of a group process course with a community service learning group practicum--provided most students with a positive initial experience with group leadership as they began to explore roles as agents for lifestyle and health change. Suggestions for expanding health promotion roles in practice in the changing health care environment are also examined.

AB  - This paper proposes that schools can participate with communities to partially alleviate the concerns about a steady blood supply. A review of the literature reveals the effective use of social learning models to encourage high school students to participate in blood drives. Combining an educational approach with a psychological approach to obtain higher rates of participation, expected outcomes are similar to those cited for service learning projects. Additionally, it is noted that the act of donating blood increases self esteem, and that blood donors have more favorable attitudes than non-donors as demonstrated by scores on measures that assesses affective, cognitive, and behavioral domains. It is believed that schools can incorporate information and activities into their service learning projects that will promote motivation to make the decision to donate blood.

AB  - Study abroad may be defined broadly as "the international movement of students and scholars." US education abroad, for these purposes, includes short- and long-term programs, exchange programs, service learning abroad, internships, and all other program types in which students from the US fulfill part of their education by traveling to a foreign country. As higher education institutions and study abroad providers offer students more options for studying in the African, Asian, Latin American, and Middle Eastern regions, students are responding in a positive way. Because of increased student interest, institutions are offering more of these programs, and a mutually reinforcing cycle has appeared. This paper examines current literature, policy, and theory, and creates a framework for analyzing the personal, societal, and institutional rationales for education abroad in nontraditional locations. The author concludes with policy and research implications based on the analysis, including a specific call for more empirical research into the outcomes and impacts of nontraditional study abroad destinations.

AB  - Young learners represent a source of renewable energy that could benefit communities worldwide. While there are a growing number of isolated case examples of successful community engagement projects led by youth and their educators from around the world, a gap remains regarding a mechanism by which these projects can be connected to share best practices. In this article, we introduce a core curriculum for civic engagement (CC4CE) that can serve as a mechanism to bring various community engagement projects together through collaborative learning networks. The focus of an ongoing international research project, the primary objectives of the CC4CE are to (a) optimize school-led community improvement initiatives worldwide, (b) support youth and adult learning across academic disciplines and, (c) promote the development of 21st-century knowledge transfer skills. The design of the CC4CE is particularly suited for guiding community collaboration and implementation of appropriate technology through service learning. Interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research methods, and the discipline of Integration and Implementation Science are utilized to guide collaboration and teamwork within CC4CE networks and social action during community outreach. Development of the CC4CE seeks to empower learners with the skills and confidence needed to take-on the mounting social and environmental challenges of our time.

AB  - This study assesses the effectiveness of service-learning in the public relations capstone course by measuring perceived student learning outcomes. An assessment instrument is proposed and tested via a longitudinal survey of students (n=210) enrolled in the public relations capstone course at a large southeastern university. Results support a general service-learning assessment instrument for public relations education that includes measures of practical skills, interpersonal skills, personal responsibility, and citizenship, as well as discipline-specific functional, creative, and research skills.

The first part, 'Why Service-Learning?,' explains why I believe in service-learning; the second, 'How Service-Learning?,' suggests how service-learning can empower students and citizens. These are followed by a section on practicalities, such as locating opportunities and keeping projects manageable. The chapter ends by encouraging others to explore service and define their own goals and philosophy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Service-learning is an excellent tool for teaching sociology because it enables students to experience sociological concepts such as poverty, stratification, & other concepts first hand. I have found that these experiences are very powerful for students, & they can provide new insights that can be life changing. This results in students having a more compassionate view of society, which can lead them into new directions with their careers or it can lead students to continue to volunteer on their own time because of their newfound interests. Service-learning benefits students by providing them with a more realistic view of the world, it benefits the community by providing much needed volunteers, & it benefits society by creating more informed, caring citizens. In this paper, I cover the basics of how to get started with service-learning. I discuss class policies that are helpful for service-learning projects. I also provide guidelines for contacting, dealing with, & finding local service agencies that are appropriate for service-learning & that are in need of volunteers. I also discuss some of the experiences that my students & I have had with service-learning.

AB  - This study evaluated the Memory Bridge Initiative (MBI), an educational, experiential program pairing high school students with older adults who have dementia. A qualitative, single group design with baseline and follow-up measures examined whether or not students would have a positive learning experience while gaining newfound appreciation and understanding of older adults with dementia. Findings showed that students' perceptions of older adults and of Alzheimer's disease became more optimistic and hopeful after participation in MBI. Students also favorably described their learning experience and recommended improvements for future programs. This evaluation informs future service-learning and dementia-care programs with results supporting wider dissemination of the Memory Bridge Initiative.

For Hispanic students, the learning that takes place in PBSL projects may be even more significant, although the research published in academic journals about clientbased projects for Hispanic students is limited. This article begins to advance an understanding of how PBSL projects can enhance the learning of Hispanic students. Data were gathered from 5 business courses and approximately 127 students, predominantly Hispanic, who served as consultants for various business organizations.

AB  - Educators and policymakers are increasingly pursuing a broad variety of programs that aim to promote democracy through civic education, service learning, and other pedagogies. Their underlying beliefs, however, differ. For some, a commitment to democracy is associated with liberal notions of freedom, while for others democracy is primarily about equality of opportunity. For some, civil society is the key, while others place their hope for social change in healthy free markets. For some, good citizens in a democracy volunteer, while for others they take active parts in political processes by voting. This paper calls attention to the spectrum of ideas about what good citizenship is and what good citizens do. The paper underscores the political implications of education for democracy and suggests that the narrow and often ideologically conservative conception of citizenship embedded in many current efforts at teaching for democracy reflects not arbitrary choices, but rather political choices with political consequences. It details three conceptions of the good citizen: (1) personally responsible, (2) participatory, and (3) justice oriented. States that these emerged from analysis of both democratic theory and a two year study of 10 educational programs aiming to promote democracy. Drawing on quantitative and qualitative data from the two programs studied, the paper argues that these three conceptions embody significantly different beliefs regarding what citizens need for democracy to flourish. They carry significantly different implications for pedagogy, curriculum, evaluation, and educational policy. Politics and interests of varied groups are often deeply embedded in the ways people conceptualize, implement, and study efforts to educate for democracy. Includes seven notes and four tables. Contains 64 references. (BT)

AB  - Intermediate Phase students in the Bachelor of Education programme who elect art as one of their majors often experience problems in the teaching of art at schools during teaching practice. To overcome this problem, a service-learning project was designed by which students were granted the opportunity to teach art to children from a children's home. This project proved to be a valuable component in curriculum studies in the fourth year of Art Education. To determine in which way and to what extent art lessons contribute to the development of children and students, a case study was conducted. Data were obtained from studying their conduct and the results of their work. Additional data were drawn from interviews with caregivers at the home and discussions with children to determine to what extent art classes had an effect on their lives. Student evaluations and interviews upon completion of the project provided data which emphasised the reciprocal nature of this service-learning project. Considering the data, inferences can be drawn about the value of service-learning to learners and students, accompanied with suggestions for the future development of the project.

AB  - Describes an experiential learning activity based on social inequality among kindergarten children with different-sized boxes of crayons that was designed to help students understand social stratification. The advantages of experiential learning are discussed, along with background readings & discussions that should precede the exercise. Crayon boxes containing from 8 to 64 crayons are distributed among the students who are asked to notice how they feel both when they receive their box & when they are asked to draw pictures of specific things or events. They are instructed not to share crayons with anyone else. The subsequent class discussion focuses on such issues as what it feels like to get more/fewer crayons, whether a person would be willing to steal to get more, the advantages of having a greater number of crayons, & whether relative deprivation exists among crayon users. Interesting student comments are described. It is concluded that the exercise makes the material on stratification more appealing & encourages students to learn more about the subject. 14 References.

AB  - This author recognized that she needed to revisit her preservice teachers' practicum experience to reassess her goals, ideas, and priorities regarding how to provide a quality teaching and learning experience of her preservice teachers. As the author reflected on the practicum experience, she identified the missing link--reciprocity. The practicum served the purpose of engaging preservice teachers in a teaching/learning experience that advanced their skills, but it did not meet the needs of all stakeholders. In this article, the author describes her efforts to provide elementary preservice teachers with the opportunity to become active citizens through a methods course and practicum involving academic service-learning.

AB  - In September 2001, case managers had completed only twenty percent of the file reviews and written student profiles (although the profiles are required) of the youth in the Oregon Youth Authority (OYA) facilities. Less than one third of the previously identified special education students had current eligibilities (written within the past three years) and Individual Education Programs (written within the past one year). To help alleviate the problem, the author wrote a manual for educational case management at OYA facilities. The manual includes information and procedures for service delivery and file compliance for regular and special education. The manual will assist case managers in fulfilling their duties to ensure that incarcerated youth receive a meaningful education that is in compliance with the laws and regulations that govern OYA facilities. The manual covers routine matters and special procedures. The purpose of the manual is to assure that Performance-based Standards (mandated by OYA) are completed in a timely manner and that the facilities are in complete compliance with the requirements stated in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The focus is on providing an appropriate education to youth who are incarcerated. These students present challenging behaviors and needs that require a comprehensive and systematic method of assessment and service delivery. The child find section of IDEA (P.L. 105-17) mandates that all students who are not making adequate academic progress be reviewed for possible special education assessment. Each youth in custody has the right, and the case managers have an obligation, to determine whether there is a need for specially designed instruction. OYA has determined that each youth entering a closed custody facility be assessed with the Northwest Evaluation Association's Measure of Academic Progress (MAP) tests. The result of this assessment and information identified during comprehensive file reviews will ensure that students who qualify for special education are identified and receive services within a specified time frame.

AB  - Character education is an inclusive concept regarding all aspects of how families, schools, and related social institutions support the positive character development of children and adults. "Character" in this context refers to the moral and ethical qualities of persons as well as the demonstration of those qualities in their emotional responses, reasoning, and behavior. Character is associated with such virtues as respect, responsibility, trustworthiness, fairness, caring, and citizenship. Character education "programs" are activities and experiences organized by a provider for the purpose of fostering positive character development and the associated core ethical values (also described as moral values, virtues, character traits, or principles). The What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) review of this topic focuses on character education programs designed for use in elementary, middle, or high schools with attention to student outcomes related to positive character development, prosocial behavior, and academic performance. Closely related program areas, such as social-emotional learning, conflict resolution, violence prevention, social skills training, service learning, and the like, may be addressed in future WWC reviews but are not intended to be covered by this one. A systematic review of evidence in this topic area addresses the following questions: (1) Which character education programs have proven effective for improving student outcomes related to positive character development, prosocial behavior, and academic performance? and (2) Are different character education programs effective for improving different outcomes, particularly academic performance?

AB  - The author reflects on the role of community service in the faith development of adolescents. He stresses that many youth pastors and non profit service workers conduct service projects in order to foster faith development in adolescents. He argues that given the power of service, everyone should pay more attention to the kinds of faith and skills development (FSD). He emphasizes that those who sponsor youth service projects need to focus on their theological and sociological presuppositions.

AB  - Historically there has been a relative dearth of social science research into civic education—even in political science, a discipline that had civic education as one of its founding objectives. This is partly due to the mistaken impression that civics instruction has no effect on civic and political participation, a conclusion that was once conventional wisdom but has since been refuted. More and more evidence has accumulated that well-designed civic education—both formal and informal—has meaningful, long-lasting effects on the civic engagement of young people. Existing research finds four aspects of schooling that affect civic learning and engagement: classroom instruction, extracurricular activities, service learning, and a school's ethos. Furthermore, state-level civics exams can positively affect knowledge about politics and government. The unifying theme that arises from this burgeoning literature is that effective civic education can compensate for a dearth of civic resources in the home and community. However, the renaissance of research into civic education is only just beginning, as more needs to be done. The existing data are too limited, and randomized studies are rare. Truly advancing our understanding of civic education will require a large-scale, multi-method, interdisciplinary effort.

AB  - On the surface, the 1999 program doesn't reveal a great deal that is new. A shade more than thirty sessions were devoted to assessment in the areas of general education, major fields, and institutional effectiveness. But a few new topics are cropping up. Nine sessions addressed collaborative or interdisciplinary assessment; four of these focused on the synergies that can be effected when academic and student affairs professionals work together. There were five sessions on assessing learning communities and four on approaches to evaluating the effectiveness of service learning. In developing a portfolio, the student has the responsibility for selecting and providing the evidence that learning has occurred. The electronic portfolio gives students the opportunity to display diverse learning styles through a variety of presentation media and allows faculty to scan collections of work quickly for evidence of specific kinds of learning.

AB  - This study examined reports and programs from across the state, the nation and from international sources to gather a broad selection of published and unpublished environmental education research. A variety of sources were used, such as the internet, interviews with key informants and experts in the field of environmental and sustainability education, and bibliographies of other published studies. In all, 76 studies were located. Each study was then reviewed and specific pieces of information gleaned from the studies were entered into an Access database. To compare content among the studies, a set of criteria was developed to "grade" each study based on its methodology and outcomes. These criteria helped the team identify "gold", or most rigorous, and "supporting" standard studies. Subsequently, gold-rated studies received further in-depth review and are discussed in the Key Findings section of this report. This study uncovered a number of overall findings, as well as findings specific to each outcome area. The studies identified a number of general conclusions on the effectiveness of environmental education programs, the state of environmental education in Washington and indicated opportunities for additional research. These include: (1) Effectiveness of Environmental Education; (2) Environmental Education in Washington State; and (3) Additional Research on Environmental Education. In addition to general findings, the study produced a number of findings specific to the five outcome areas. These are: (1) Academic Achievement; (2) Career Development; (3) Graduation Requirements--Culminating Projects; (4) Self-Esteem, Engagement and Motivation; and (5) Civic Responsibility and Service-Learning. Based on the conclusions contained in this report, OSPI and the statewide partners have developed recommendations to guide Washington State in maintaining its leadership role in environmental and sustainability education, and to help ensure the success of each and every Washington State student. The following are appended: (1) Engrossed House Bill 2910; (2) Definitions; (3) Historical Highlights of Environmental Education in Washington State; (4) Additional Literature Reviews of EE Studies; (5) Sources for Research; (6) Database Snapshots; (7) Outcome Area Tables; (8) Model Programs; (9) Bibliography of Studies Collected and Reviewed; and (10) Additional References.

AB  - Service-learning is an ideal teaching approach to use in courses on the psychology of aging because it allows experiential education to be actively integrated with classroom instruction. This article describes the results of adding a service-learning option to a lecture course on the psychology of aging. For this course, service-learning took place at local nursing homes, area retirement communities, and the local community center, which houses an activity program for older adults. Each student was required to complete 30 hr community service-learning during the semester, maintain a journal, write a summary paper, join a reflection group, and participate in a group presentation. Students were involved in a wide range of activities, from assisting with a hot lunch program to spending time talking with nursing home residents. Evaluation of the effectiveness of this approach was established by using open-ended student evaluations that were completed at the end of the semester. Data were gathered over 2 years from the portion of the class (approximately one third) each semester) who chose to complete a one-credit service-learning experience. The service-learning component significantly enhanced the course experience for the students, instructor, graduate and undergraduate teaching assistants, and facilities involved. Overall, the majority of students affirmed that their participation in the service-learning project related well to the course, and facility responses to student service-learning participants were overwhelmingly positive.

AB  - This study explores sense of community (SOC) among low‐income college students. The development of a SOC among college students, especially low‐income students, may be particularly vital because of its implications for student success. Six low‐income Arizona State University students were selected based on receipt of a prestigious last‐dollar scholarship. Using narrative inquiry, participants were interviewed about their understanding and experiences with communities. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed. Participant narratives were created to provide context and in‐depth understanding of experiences. We identified the following themes: (a) mutual support and caring; (b) shared values and goals; (c) interaction and intentionality; and (d) community as self‐constructed, intersecting, and nonlinear. These findings expand existing literature on SOC, with an emphasis on low‐income students in university settings. This research offers an opportunity to examine ways in which universities and student services can provide students an opportunity to better understand their own SOC.

AB  - Learning that includes people of different life experiences is beneficial to people of all ages and cognitive abilities. Three public intergenerational schools in Cleveland, and now collaborative programs internationally, have been providing such opportunities in a variety of organizational and community settings. Pedagogical emphasis is placed on fostering lifelong experiential learning, sharing stories and art, building relationships, and creating spirited citizens. Intergenerativity, meaning innovating though integration and going between to go beyond, is a new word that highlights the value of diverse perspectives in addressing the huge social and ecological problems we face in the twenty-first century.

AB  - Faculty members constantly struggle to integrate "learning" and "doing" in the classroom in order to increase their students' understanding of course concepts--the interpersonal communication class is no different. The Library of Congress Veterans History Project seemed perfectly adapted to the goal of bringing interpersonal communication theories and concepts to life by providing students with an opportunity to work from a skills-based learning approach, within the boundaries of a relationship in development. This article presents an activity for interpersonal communication which aims to increase understanding of interpersonal communication theories and concepts, to apply interpersonal skills studied in class, and to develop an intergenerational relationship by means of an interview project. It also describes the Library of Congress Veteran History Project's goal and the steps in starting the intergenerational service-learning project for interpersonal communication. A list of references and suggested readings is included.

AB  - While the quality and quantity of research on service-learning has increased considerably over the past 20 years, researchers as well as governmental and funding agencies have called for more rigor in service-learning research. One key variable in improving rigor is using relevant existing theories to improve the research. The purpose of this article is to present a draft conceptual framework of relevant theories that can inform the study of service-learning effects on students. This proposed conceptual framework draws from theories, theory-based models and frameworks, and theory-based research. Practitioners and researchers are encouraged to review, test, and critique this proposed conceptual framework so as to advance the discussion regarding the use of relevant existing theories on service-learning research as well as practice.

AB  - Purpose: Three undergraduate students' experiences in a physical activity-based service learning course are chronicled using narrative inquiry. Method: Data collection included demographics questionnaires, pre- and postservice interviews, reflection journals, postservice written reflections, and participant observations. The data were analyzed with comprehensive deductive and inductive analysis procedures, along with the creation of detailed narratives summarizing students' individual experiences and outcomes. Results: Results revealed student growth and development, including leadership development, improved interpersonal skills, increased knowledge of social justice issues, and enhanced self-understanding. However, the number, depth, and complexity of these outcomes varied significantly, which was largely explained by individual variables (e.g., interest in learning, level of effort, degree of adaptability). Discussion: These findings highlight the opportunity for course instructors to lead reflective activities before and during the service-learning experience, along with providing individualized guidance and feedback on students' learning, effort, and adaptability throughout the service-learning course.

AB  - Service-learning courses provide students with practical opportunities to enhance their learning and development in the field, along with getting students engaged in different communities and settings. However, there are still many challenges to designing and offering effective service-learning courses, such as requiring all students to participate in the service-learning component and creating a larger workload for teachers. The purpose of this article is to provide a detailed description of a service-learning course in the sport-based youth development field that addresses these concerns. By partnering with a community-based organization, students enrolled in this service-learning course were able to participate in two ways: (1) serving as a student leader in the 10-week program or (2) serving as a formative evaluator by watching the videotaped sessions each week and providing constructive feedback to their peers. Through an independent study option, some students could also serve as summative evaluators of the program. This article describes the service-learning course and sport-based youth development program, with in-depth reflections from three graduate students detailing their experiences serving in different roles. The article also provides practical implications for teachers and practitioners, serving as one example of a successful service-learning course that maximizes student engagement, learning and development.

AB  - Situated in a theoretical framework of experiential learning, adult-learning theory, constructivist theory, and the elements of capstones and service-learning, this study examined the alignment between employability skills employers need and employability skills graduate business students gain through service-learning in business capstones. The study also investigated whether reflection enhances the employability skills of graduate business students who participate in service-learning during a capstone. This non-experimental, mixed-methods, comparative, descriptive study examined outcomes of students’ development of employability skills through service-learning participation in capstones embedded in MBA programs, and assessed whether the inclusion of service-learning influences students’ development of employability skills. Quantitative data explored which employability skills were enhanced by service-learning in business capstones, and whether there were differences in gender and GPA. The top three employability skills enhanced were decision-making, presentation skills, and teamwork. Of these three, presentation skills was statistically significant, meaning capstones that had service-learning enhanced presentation skills more than capstones that did not include service-learning. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) found a four-factor solution and one factor, Collaborative Learning, was statistically significant. Collaborative Learning was enhanced for capstone students who had a service-learning experience more than students whose capstone did not include service-learning. Qualitative data were analyzed through semi-structured interviews from ten MBA graduates. Four themes were revealed: 1) Structure and Deliverables of Capstones; 2) Opportunities to Make Decisions; 3) Opportunities to Build Teamwork Skills; and, 4) Opportunities to Build Presentation Skills. Participants were also asked in what ways reflection enhanced their employability skills. One theme emerged: Reflection Enhanced the Ability to Complete a Project. Limitations of this study include a lack of generalizability because of the non-experimental design; there are not universal definitions of skills; and the employability skills measured were not an exhaustive list. The main findings included: there is alignment in the collaborative learning skills needed by employers and those skills enhanced through service-learning in graduate business capstones; written and oral reflection improves the ability to accomplish a team-based client project; the instructor’s role in structuring and facilitating service-learning is a key to learning; and presentation skills are enhanced during client-based business capstone courses that include service-learning.

AB  - This dissertation overview summarizes a study that examined the alignment between employability skills employers need and employability skills graduate business students gain through service-learning in business capstones. This nonexperimental, mixed-methods, comparative study assessed whether the inclusion of service-learning in capstone courses influences students' development of employability skills. The top three employability skills enhanced by service-learning were decision-making, presentation skills, and teamwork; only presentation skills showed a significant difference for students whose capstone included service-learning versus those whose did not. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) found a four-factor solution, and one factor, collaborative learning, was significant for service-learning. Qualitative data from semi-structured interviews revealed that decision-making, teamwork, and presentation skills were enhanced by service-learning. Findings show alignment between collaborative learning skills needed by employers and those enhanced through service-learning, and that the instructor's role in structuring projects is key to learning.

AB  - Freshmen year programs in engineering have received recent and growing attention as a method to engage first year students in their profession and start them on a path to success. Service learning is a well-known pedagogical method that has been shown to improve retention, especially of underrepresented groups in engineering, and to promote deeper learning through reflection. This paper describes the implementation of a new long-term (full year) service learning project where 240 freshmen mechanical engineering students worked together in small teams to design and deploy an engineering outreach experience for a designated age-group of 4th - 11th grade students. This educational experience is designed to expose the freshmen engineering students to a variety of concepts and skills necessary for successful negotiation of their engineering careers. The project encourages the freshmen to challenge their assumptions and conceptions of what an engineer is and does. Other knowledge and skills gained include understanding and using the engineering design process, effectively working on engineering teams, effectively communicating, planning and making decisions, all while solving an open-ended problem. The experience also asks the freshmen to consider diverse perspectives as they design for the targeted populations. The paper describes the project implementation and presents results from student reflections and from a survey. Lessons learned and recommendations for best practices are also presented.

AB  - The Colorado College Energy Audit and Retrofit Program is a non-profit organization that teaches students the science and mechanics involved in energy audits and retrofit work through service-learning and community-based research projects. This approach represents a ``win-win{''} scenario where the college contributes to maximize learning and minimize costs to the community. The method of identifying homes for energy audits has evolved from responding to homeowner requests to a proactive approach aimed at targeting older low-income neighborhoods and working with existing neighborhood associations. Recent work on the Mill Street Neighborhood in Colorado Springs, Colorado is presented in which a sample of homes (N = 14) received thermal audits, complete with blower door tests and Energy-10 computer modeling. The results are tabulated, analyzed, and extrapolated over the entire 145 homes in the neighborhood. The normally distributed ACH (n) values and the skewed distributions of R (aver) values and building sizes are discussed. A method of identifying unusual occupant behavior, relative to the building quality, is presented where the Home Heating Index is compared to a Building Thermal Performance Index (R (aver)/ACH (n) ). Estimates from extrapolation of the data predict that an investment of $146,500 USD in retrofit materials will yield a total annual neighborhood savings in energy, utility costs and GHG emissions of 9.1 x 10(6) kBtu (9.6 x 10(9) kJ), $64,000 USD and 555 US tons (5.0 x 10(5) kg), respectively, providing a simple payback time of 2.3 years. This efficient method of neighborhood energy audits provides data that could support neighborhood renewal grant proposals to purchase materials for follow-up retrofits and supports municipal demand-side management programs.

AB  - This article describes and evaluates an interdisciplinary, experiential service-learning project that combined environmental studies and marketing courses at a liberal arts college over a 2-year period. The inherent tensions between these two disciplines regarding issues of environmental protection and conservation make this project’s contribution unique. The project is in line with the increased emphasis on environmental issues as a key strategic consideration for both marketing academics and practitioners. Environmental studies students identified and prioritized solid waste streams. Marketing students developed social marketing initiatives aimed at reducing the high-priority waste streams. The two best initiatives were implemented by students via pilot projects in environmental studies and marketing courses. Students in environmental studies were able to identify and apply ways in which marketing tools can be employed to promote social causes and effect positive environmental behavioral change. Marketing students applied marketing concepts to a real-life situation, while gaining a greater awareness of environmental issues and the role of businesses in environmental stewardship. The authors summarize the project’s learning objectives, planning and design, implementation, and assessment of learning outcomes. Challenges and obstacles encountered and recommendations for the development and implementation of similar learning projects are also discussed.

AB  - Ensuring that all students achieve their full academic potential is no small feat. Service learning--an experiential approach to education that involves students in meaningful, real-world activities--can advance social, emotional, and academic curricula goals while simultaneously benefiting the students and their communities. It supports character development by providing situations in the community in which caring, helping, and collaboration as well as sensitivity to culture and social justice issues become integral parts to the educative process. A practical guide to service learning: Strategies for positive development in schools is a valuable resource that: Describes how service learning--an intervention that can be both remedial or preventive and individual or systemic--can enable school psychologists and other educational and counseling professionals to expand their roles beyond working with special populations to serving students within the academic mainstream; highlights the connections between the positive psychology movement, the nurturing of purpose in youth, and the benefits of service learning; introduces case studies of school-based mental health professionals who have implemented service learning; and provides practical materials and forms to guide mental health practitioners in organizing and assessing service-learning activities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) A practical guide to service learning: Strategies for positive development in schools presents the theory and application of service learning for school psychologists and school counselors. Service learning has synergistic effects in promoting positive social and emotional growth as well as in enhancing career and academic outcomes.

AB  - The scientist-practitioner model, upon which many academic programs (including coursework on teams) are built, suggests that education should focus on more than just rote knowledge of a topic. The training literature also suggests that education must go beyond information to include demonstration, practice, and feedback. Accordingly, we suggest that educators teaching courses on teams should provide students not only with declarative knowledge regarding the science of teams, but also with practical experiences that will develop skilled team scientist-practitioners. We describe an example of how scientific team training was incorporated through experiential learning activities into a graduate-level psychology course on work teams. We conclude with a discussion of how this example represents an innovative approach to the pedagogy of teams, how our methods could be applied to other courses on small groups, and how to further the incorporation of validated team science into the classroom.

AB  - "Now seems an opportune time to turn our attention back to the question of how our education system is going to contribute to helping our children become thoughtful, ethical, caring, and contributing democratic citizens." Wilhelm documents the fact that students "crave the doing of significant work," and posits that this is what we are teaching for--to help students see themselves as "agents of possibility." He sees this goal as part of every class and every unit, and urges teachers to take on the challenge.

AB  - This dissertation examined elements of effective 5 th-12th grade school-based peer mentoring programs from the participants perspective. The researcher conducted 80 interviews at 4 Adirondack public schools; in addition, a survey was administered to those interviewed. Just the survey was administered to an additional 20 peer mentors and mentees at each site. Data gathered indicate that effective peer-mentoring programs (1) are relationally intentional, (2) are transformative, (3) allow for student leadership and voice, (4) attend to gender differences, (5) are developmentally appropriate, and (6) are purposeful and goal driven. This qualitative study included a quantitative survey that showed that 100% of the mentors and 98.59% of the mentees reported that mentoring was a good experience for them. Of the mentee respondents, 87.32% indicated that being involved with mentoring improved their attitude about coming to school; 88.55% of mentors and 80.28% of the mentees reported growth in self-confidence. Results from this study will inform peer mentoring program design, curriculum, and training-workshop contents for both peers and those adults who work with them.

AB  - Background: Service learning (SL) is a collaborative relationship between university professors, their students, and community partners who combine academic learning and active participation to address community issues. Previous studies in SL and physical education teacher education (PETE) found SL projects increased opportunities for learning and applying pedagogical methods, prepared PETE students to teach children from diverse backgrounds, and promoted an understanding of individual teaching responsibilities. Given the number of PETE university programs in SL emerged over the past decade, minimal research has supported the specific use of SL in PETE. It was suggested that PETE programs provided content knowledge and pedagogical strategies to deal effectively with immediate instructional challenges but paid less attention to anticipate future challenges through student teaching experiences. A SL project for children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was designed which enabled PETE students to learn how to manage behavior while teaching physical education. Purpose: To explore the experiences of PETE students in a SL project for children with ADHD. Participants and setting: Four female and two male PETE students were the participants in this study which investigated their project experiences in SL at a major mental health institute in a large urban Canadian city. Research design: A phenomenological approach was used to describe the lived experiences of PETE students in the SL project. Data gathering: Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted and videotaped to acquire rich and deep knowledge of PETE students' SL experience. Each student was requested to bring unit plans, lesson plans, written reflections, and final term papers to enhance the interview process. Data analysis: Each interview was transcribed verbatim and a line-by-line thematic analysis was performed. Findings: Three higher-order themes emerged from thematic analysis. The "where have I been" theme suggested past teaching and community work experiences shaped decisions to become physical educators. The "it's all about caring" theme involved reduction of stigma linked to teaching children with ADHD and merging theory and practice through application of instructional models and deliberate lesson plans. The "teaching to play" theme revealed various benefits linked to PETE student participation in SL and challenges inherent with team teaching. Conclusions: Future research recommendations include capturing the experiences of other participants in the SL project for children with ADHD to gain much greater insight into the whole SL experience and help to shape future projects. Much research remains to be performed in SL and adapted physical education (APE) or local community recreation centers where students from allied health disciplines could participate together. A variety of different qualitative research approaches were also recommended to explore participant experiences in SL projects. Similar SL projects, conducted in multidisciplinary environments, may also be exciting new venues for PETE programs. Finally, the participants' stories led us to suggest that SL is a contemporary pedagogy that addresses calls for the development of caring pedagogies that prepare future teachers for the realities and challenges of a changing world.

AB  - This study explored the effects of an intensive, service learning course on the perceived self-efficacy of participating MSW students. A self-efficacy scale was developed following Bandura's (1977) model, based on the goals and objectives of the MSW program and was administered pre and post. The findings indicated a statistically significant increase in perceived self-efficacy (p < .001) following completion of the course. In addition, the students demonstrated significant increases in self-efficacy related to mezzo (p < .001) and macro-level skills (p < .001). These results suggest that service learning, underutilized in social work education, may be an effective learning approach in master's level programs.

AB  - Service-learning is an experiential learning approach that offers promise in facilitating students' personal growth and professional value development while providing service to the community. In a course that implemented this approach, 21 MSW students participated as volunteers in a seven-day camp for burn-injured children. This study explores the impact of this experience on the students' learning through the analysis of journals, transcripts of focus groups, and written course evaluations. Data were classified according to two broad categories of learning: learning about the personal self and learning about the professional self. The findings indicate application and integration of learning that reflect social work core values such as social justice, the importance of human relationships, integrity, and service. These findings suggest that this educational approach may be an effective strategy in facilitating a deeper understanding of key areas of the social work profession for students.

AB  - This study reports on an effort of eleven coaches to engage urban high school students in social action projects in a charter high school that adopted the Public Achievement model of civic engagement. The coaches, who were graduate students, worked with ten groups of six to twelve students who were required to participate. This study draws from the fieldnotes of each coach, and examines their experiences and perspectives of helping students think critically about community issues. Coaches documented their efforts to change and empower students to engage with community leaders to problem-solve. Findings from the study show the challenges coaches faced and the successes they experienced. Also included are recommendations for teachers and other community leaders who have a desire to support urban youth in transforming their communities.

AB  - Inequities and disparities of various forms exist in public schools that significantly impact the academic success and healthy development of many students. The detrimental effects of social injustices within schools are often ignored by school-based professionals (SBPs) because an entrenched intrapsychic perspective dominates the professional discourse. In this article we explain how the medical model, and its discursive articulation in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., text rev.; American Psychiatric Association, 2000), discourages SBPs from engaging in social justice advocacy in school settings. Next, we describe the ecological paradigm necessary for assessing and treating environmental-based problems within the ecosystem of students. We then argue that ecological psychology provides SBPs with a professional discourse that frames the need for social justice advocacy and action. Finally, we provide specific ways in which SBPs can become knowledgeable and empowered advocates both with and on behalf of K-12 students and their families.

AB  - The purpose of this dissertation is to share the results of a case study that analyzes the contradictions that emerge between stakeholders involved in a multimodal community-based writing project in which students partnered with local “community experts” to compose 1–2 minute videos about the General Education Development (GED) test. Since research on service learning tends to overlook the perspective of the community partners, this study investigates their perspectives alongside students’ and project sponsors’ perspectives in order to identify how each stakeholder evaluates “success” in digitally-delivered community-based writing projects. Questionnaires were collected and follow-up interviews were conducted with community partners, students, and the project sponsor. Final videos and reflections were also collected from the students. I apply Thomas Deans’ adaptation of Activity Theory (AT) to analyze the goal-directed activity systems represented in this project. The community partners assessed the success of the project based on their assumptions about their roles in the project, which they variously interpreted as “client,” “mentor,” or “guide.” The community partners who viewed their role as “mentor” or “guide” were primarily interested in a process of student growth or moral transformation; the community partner who saw her role as “client” emphasized the quality of the final product. The students primarily assessed the success of the project based on their goals related to technical development and their willingness to practice creativity, flexibility, and problem solving. The sponsors’ perspectives shifted as other stakeholders’ perspectives complicated our initial assessments. I argue that rhetorical listening allows us to identify the different cultural logics that frame these assessments, which allows us to hear what we cannot see. This research suggests that success in multimodal community-based writing projects is complex and multivalent. I conclude by providing recommendations for digital writing instructors who advocate mutually beneficial campus-community partnerships. These recommendations include articulating assumptions and clearly defining roles and values; designing ongoing methods of “seeing” the community; discussing the cultural logics of the digital writing classroom; inviting community partners to give feedback at regular intervals; incorporating listening as a rhetorical strategy; and evaluating the risk of publicly sharing the products based on what we hear.

AB  - For over 20 years, Sunnyside Environmental School in Portland, Oregon has adopted service-learning as an instructional approach to engage young people with local communities. This report explores the voices of sixth through eighth graders illustrated by their Reflection Journals as they interacted with hungry and homeless individuals in the community. The human-scale connections resulted in tangible sensibilities of care evident in students' reflections: dispelling stereotypes as students became open-minded, making a noticeable difference however small, developing compassion through new understandings, and taking action to correct social injustices in the communities where they live.

AB  - This article captures a service learning initiative that blends an existing national program designed to teach economic principles to K-12 students with elementary education teacher candidates enrolled in a social studies methods course. The initiative gives candidates the hands-on experience of teaching national and state objectives in the area of economics, supplies the volunteer base the organization needs to sustain its local program, and gives local elementary schools an additional resource in the area of economics. Candidates' reactions, the arrangement and the lessons learned are shared. Findings suggest that teacher candidates develop positive dispositions toward service learning, develop beginning pedagogical practices of efficacy, and reinforce their decision to teach.

AB  - This cross-sectional study examined the comparison between 9th graders and 12th graders in their attitude and preferences in community service. Students were surveyed using one instrument with three components: A demographic survey, The Community Service Attitude Scale (SCAS), and a rank-order preference scale. The CSAS was evaluated using item analysis and internal consistency for the appropriateness for use with a high school audience. The 9th grade students were compared to 12th grade students in participation, rate of occurrence, attitude scales of the CSAS, and community service preferences. In addition, the differences between the gender for each grade on participation, rate of occurrence, and community service preferences were completed. A Pearson Product-Movement correlation analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between students mean scores on the stages of attitudes and preference for types of community service. Results indicated a significant difference between an entering 9 th grade class and a graduating 12th grade class on participation and rate of occurrence of community service. In addition, a significant difference was found on the CSAS stages of awareness, action, ability, and connectedness, and intention (p≤.001). No significant difference between the 9th grade and 12th grade students was found on the CSAS stages of norm, empathy, benefit and seriousness. In addition, this study found gender impacted 12th graders but not 9th grade.

AB  - The importance of preparing teachers to work in diverse environments has been well established, yet there is little research indicating what methods work to prepare teachers. Many teacher education programs use foundations or multicultural preparation classes to develop the multicultural knowledge, skills, and dispositions of preservice teachers. In this study, a semester-long foundations of education/diversity preparation class of 26 students and one professor was examined; the goal was to determine what methods work to advance multicultural knowledge, skills, and dispositions. Mixed methodology was used. The quantitative aspect consisted of a pre/post test using Roysircar-Sodowsky's (1994) Multicultural Inventory-educator version. The qualitative aspect was grounded in ethnographic methods, and consisted of pre/post surveys, pre/post interviews with the professor, field notes of all class sessions, post class interviews with students, anonymous feedback, and examination of all student work and professor comments. Quantitative data indicated that knowledge and skills advanced significantly; dispositions did not, but had the highest pre/post scores. The open facilitation style of the professor was a key factor in the students' consideration of the controversial material often used in diversity preparation classes. Students overwhelmingly perceived that the service learning component of the class (service in urban schools, discussion, written reflection) had the greatest impact on them as future teachers. These classes can be helpful, but are most effective when reinforced by other theoretical and historical education classes, and classes in multicultural pedagogy.

AB  - Each summer, Student Action with Farmworkers (SAF) interns, half of whom come from farmworking families, spend ten weeks in North and South Carolina communities interning with agencies such as health clinics and legal aid offices whose clients include migrant and seasonal farmworkers. SAF uses a participatory, praxis-based pedagogy to teach these students to act in solidarity with farmworkers and to continually reflect upon their action. Starting in 1995, as part of their reflection, these students have written weekly guided reports, and since 1999, two-thirds of the students have completed folklife documentary projects with farmworker participants. In this community-based research study, I have worked in collaboration with SAF staff to analyze their archive of student work. This study discusses the generative themes that students have dealt with in this work, including themes of identification with farmworkers, awareness of injustice and the burden of deciding to do with that awareness, frustration with racism and exploitation in the rural south, questions about one’s own ability to make a difference, and through the documentary projects deepening knowledge gained from farmworkers themselves. This study also compares the broader practices that SAF seeks to instill in students with the written work they assign. Departing from dominant literacy practices in U.S. schools, SAF encourages non-textual expression, bilingualism or even monolingual Spanish, and collective expression. Writing is one among the tools that SAF gives students to reflect and witness, not itself an essential tool for all interns. SAF interns reflect in other ways, and staff translate interns’ reflections and writing of witness into their public work of advocacy. Drawing upon focus groups with staff and former interns, this study suggests that in the future, SAF will preserve both reflection and witnessing and also continue to experiment with their writing practices to reach more interns. SAF’s work can serve as a model for other educators working in campus-community collaborations, non-profit associations doing activist work, and classrooms that invite students to look beyond scholarly work for knowledge. In particular, SAF teaches its interns to value diversity in solidarity, which leads to uses of writing that promote individual reflection and collective expression.

AB  - Authentic learning is touted as a powerful learning approach, particularly in the context of problem-based learning (Savery, 2006). Teaching and learning in the area of instructional design appears to offer a strong fit between the tenets of authentic learning and the practice of instructional design. This paper details the efforts to broaden and deepen the understanding of instructional design through a service learning approach to teaching, emphasizing authentic learning and assessment. Students are teamed and assigned to an actual contract with an external client under the supervision of the instructor who acts as project manager for the group. Contracts are negotiated to deliberately offer instructional design services to clients who would not otherwise be able to afford them, such as community-based non-profit groups. The reasons are two fold: first, we want to avoid competing for contracts that would interfere with the business of commercial instructional design groups and contractors; second, we want to impress on our students the idea that instructional design has social importance beyond the profit/loss and cost/effectiveness orientation of many instructional design businesses. In this way, we promote the idea that instructional designers are agents of social change, and their influence crosses interpersonal, professional, institutional and societal dimensions of change (Schwier, Campbell and Kenny, 2007).

AB  - Based on years of human intelligence research conducted by Howard Gardner and results from a quantitative research study supporting Gardner's research collected from a sample of 205 faculty within the United States, the researcher examined students that are actively engaged in community service experiences and their approaches to reframing their intelligences and enhancing their unique learning, problem-solving, and decision-making skills. Students who reach beyond the class or virtual rooms of academia and become actively involved in community service organizations gain organizational experiences that sharpen their management and human intelligence skills to equip them with operating in a competitive world of constant organizational change.

AB  - This thesis explores the pedagogical potential of images shared during intra-professional conversations held on the social media platform, Twitter. Twitter chats are loosely synchronous exchanges of tweets sharing a unique, identifying keyword or hashtag. They are increasingly being used among professionals to create professional networks in which practice-knowledge and opinion might be shared and where communal connections may be created. As such, they may serve as sites in which professional learning unfolds, both in relation to workplace practices and in relation to the development of new forms of professional practice around social media use. Because the exchanges and broadcasts on Twitter are, for the most part, public, and the conversations are ongoing, they also provide open, freely-accessible, and constantly renewing resources for use in pre-service learning contexts. The research focused on two example chats, one held among midwives and the other among teachers. Inspired by the increasing use of images in new forms of digital communication, the research used images tweeted during the chats as starting points from which to explore flows of knowledge and affect. Data were generated from observations of the two Twitter chats over extended periods, together with interviews with practising professionals, student professionals and their educators in which images were used as elicitation devices. The research combined an approach to reading and “being with” data inspired by ideas drawn from the work of Deleuze (1994; Williams 2013) and Deleuze and Guattari (1988; Massumi 1992), with approaches to reading images drawn from visual social semiotics (Kress and van Leeuwen 1996). The findings suggest that Twitter chats such as those studied here can provide rich opportunities for professional learning. Practice knowledge can flow from one participant to many others, and flows of affect can be used to remoralize individuals and communities. Both chats seemed to serve as sites in which professionals could experience a positivity and affirmation that was not always available in the workplace. However, the forces and intensities at play in these spaces influence both what is said and what is not said, creating new norms of online interaction that generally seemed to avoid negative comments or open disagreement. Educators saw potential to use images such as those shared in the chats in a variety of ways. For example, images could be used as prompts for examination and critique of practices. The educators I interviewed also suggested that the images could be used to help student professionals develop their sensitivity to the forces and intensities that produce particular practices. Group interviews with student professionals suggested that the former happened spontaneously when students encountered and discussed such images, but that the latter might need deliberate facilitation or prompting. The thesis concludes with some recommendations for: (i) educators considering using such images in pre-service professional learning; (ii) professional developers considering using Twitter chats; and (iii) policy-makers involved in drafting guidelines for professionals’ use of social media.

AB  - This year-long qualitative case study investigates how service-learning may enable self-direction and the development of a critical consciousness for marginalized high school students by exploring the dynamics of service-learning through a theoretical framework of critical theory. A central aim among critical theorists is the empowerment of marginalized groups who are disempowered through the current structure of schooling. Service-learning, an instructional approach that integrates meaningful community service with instruction and reflection, is theorized to counter the oppressive nature of schooling as defined in critical theory; however, little research exists to clarify the implications of service-learning on student empowerment. The intention of this study was to consider the negotiation of power and knowledge occurring in the open spaces of community that may empower students, redefining their experience of schooling and their identities as learners. By exploring processes of empowerment and the social structures created through service-learning, the study documents students' self-authorship as they negotiate learning spaces within community. Through this case study, three marginalized, male, urban high school students described their development as learners and as change agents within the context of service and community need. Data analysis of interview transcripts, field notes, and documents revealed how service-learning offered a transformative experience to culturally non-dominant students which legitimized lived experience and enabled the re-writing of self through the construction of new social/intellectual spaces. Overall, the findings provide a holistic account of the spaces, relationships, and identities constructed by participants through service-learning. Service-learning positioned participants to encounter social injustices in new ways that facilitated their re-authoring of self and community identities. This widening intellectual space permitted participants' development of their own evolving interpretations and informed actions upon the world for challenging and transforming social and political inequalities. Participants' identities expanded as they critiqued arrangements of power infusing social structures while recognizing the ways their own narratives maintained harmful arrangements of power. The findings also demonstrate the possibilities for engaging diverse learners whose life experiences and cultural forms of knowledge have been delegitimized through schooling. By providing insight to how empowerment and self-authorship can become central to schooling, this study offers a way to address the opportunity gap which disproportionately affects low-income students of color. Participants' experience offers insight to the pedagogy of service-learning that documents a framework for encountering transformational moments between self, society, and other. Further research exploring the perspectives of marginalized students who are reluctant to engage in service-learning would bring an array of viewpoints to the research purpose.

AB  - The As We Teach and Learn program consists of an instrument to assess the Catholic dimension of a school and is designed to be used with study modules in a faculty- meeting format. Module topics include: "Faith Community"; "Faith Development"; "Religion Curriculum Articulation: Faith as the Root of all Instruction"; "Service Learning"; "Prayer and Liturgy Integration"; and "Social Justice." Each module has been created so that it can stand alone or be used with other modules. Each module contains an overview of the complete program, a general introduction, directions and suggestions for using the program, a suggested first faculty meeting outline, an introduction to the module, outlines of five meetings, materials which can be duplicated, a suggested final faculty meeting, and a school planning form. This module, "Faith Community," has teachers and the principal consider a critical element in the Catholic identity of their school. The module invites them to reflect on themselves as members of a faith community. Five group activities ("Storytelling"; "Imaging Connections"; "Listening and Responding"; "Focusing Growth"; and "Determining Action") are provided along with eight appendices. (RJC)

AB  - Effectively teaching sociological theories to undergraduate students is challenging. Students often enroll in theory courses due to major requirements, not personal interest. Consequently, many students approach the study of theory with anxiety. This study examined the effectiveness of an experiential learning activity designed to teach Karl Marx's theory of alienation. Based on pretest/posttest surveys, responses to open-ended questions, and observational data, students reported that the activity helped them gain a clearer understanding of Marx. They also reported finding the activity interesting, enjoying being able to apply theory, and being able to see how Marx's theory related to real life. Assessment data revealed that students were confident in demonstrating their understanding of Marx's theories on assignments but not always effective in doing so. The findings contribute to literature on active and experiential learning techniques as successful methods for teaching abstract sociological concepts.

AB  - Schools are facing major problems today that are only marginally addressed by most reform initiatives or by standards-based federal and state legislation. New and different strategies are required if schools are to adequately serve their students and communities. This article demonstrates that service-learning is one dynamic way to promote school success because it increases family and community involvement in education, develops adult mentors, makes the curriculum relevant, reduces student feelings of alienation and isolation, and builds an ethic of service.

AB  - This paper reviews service learning definitions and principles to illustrate common threads connecting service learning philosophy across contexts. Although there is general agreement that service learning occurs in school-based and community-based categories, it cannot be universally defined. Definitions from K-12, higher education, and adult programs generally agree that participants learn and develop through meaningful community service experiences. Ten principles for effective school- or community-based programs, as articulated by the Wingspread organization in 1989, are listed. A matrix is proposed as a tool to plan and facilitate the service learning program regardless of the setting or participants. The matrix includes choosing a definition, stating the setting and the learning goals, describing the experience or activity or community need, preparing for the activity, engaging in the activity, reflecting on the outcomes, and recognizing and celebrating accomplishments. Benefits for participants in service learning activities are summarized. (Contains 14 references.) (SAS)

AB  - This article summarizes a study of campus ministries and religious groups that asked how faith is expressed today, if college students view faith as irrelevant, and what programs are effective and needed. The survey encompassed public and private universities, four major faith groups--Jewish, Catholic, evangelical, and mainline Protestant--and each region of the United States. The article discusses marginality and relevance as well as effectiveness of the religious education programs, and concludes with a study of one project, the Religious Youth Service, which appears to be effective. The RYS draws on service-learning and interfaith dialogue and could become an effective paradigm for educating religiously in a religiously plural world.

AB  - Empirical research on social studies instruction for the gifted is scant. Because of this lack of empirically validated practices, a number of curricular modifications and instructional methods are presented in this chapter. Although not all of these learning designs have been validated with gifted students, each shows promise. Discerning educators should consider these different techniques, which include inquiry-based instruction, Advanced Placement courses and related methods, discussion techniques, acceleration strategies, and service learning, as potential curriculum design elements for their own settings. We will present introductions and guidelines for each technique, so that educators can determine for themselves which of these options is best for their educational setting. This will hopefully help educators experiment in their social studies curriculum, helping to academically challenge gifted students. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Over the past decade early childhood education (ECE) teachers have faced increasing pressures to implement standardised tests in order to secure external validation and funding. In response, many teacher education programmes now focus heavily on positivistic training approaches, as opposed to more developmentally appropriate pedagogies [Winterbottom, C., & Lake, V. E. (2013) "Cultivating leadership and responsibility in children." "Exchange," 5, 36-39]. In this study, we examined the effectiveness of an alternative, service-learning training approach based upon constructivist principles in Ohio. Specifically, 120 students in a university teacher education programme participated in semester-long service-learning group-based projects. Post-project assessments indicated remarkably positive student reactions to their experience in ways that relate to important pedagogy-related goals. We conclude with a recommendation to incorporate service-learning methodology into teacher training programmes.

AB  - This guide to implementing a school volunteer program was developed for the 1995 Wisconsin Volunteer-A-Thon project, which was intended to encourage individuals, schools, organizations, and corporations to volunteer time to youth and education. Part 1 contains a timeline for the implementation of the project, a description of how to participate, pledge forms for schools and volunteers, and a reproducible certificate of appreciation. Part 2, "Adult Volunteers in the School," includes information on how to start, design, and organize a volunteer program; contains a sample school board policy on school volunteers; and includes a teacher's guide to using and recognizing volunteers, ideas for involving retired persons and planning intergenerational programs, and a discussion of risk management and resources for volunteer risk management. Part 3, "Youth Service-Learning," discusses service-learning contracts, the elements of effective service-learning activities, ways to integrate service learning into the curriculum, and other ideas for organizing community service projects. Part 4 contains eight appendices: A Family-Community-Schools Partnership Framework; a checklist for schools; and a sample survey of interest for volunteers; a sample volunteer screening reference letter; a sample of a volunteer's emergency information form; a sample volunteer's evaluation of a short-term school program form, and a sample of a school volunteer's evaluation of program form.

AB  - When community members volunteer for young people, they forge pathways of knowledge and compassion, and gain a better understanding of the mission and challenges of the schools. Youth service-learning programs that give high school and middle school students the chance to work with younger students or on community projects also leave lasting impressions of the benefits of volunteering, the gift of self. This resource guide to help schools start or enhance their volunteer programs is distributed by Volunteer-A-Thon, a community outreach project of Wisconsin Public Television (WPT) The guide is in three parts. Part 1, "Volunteer-A-Thon Participation," gives an overview of the program, lists ideas for school participation in the program, and contains sample forms. Part 2, "Adult Volunteers in the School," presents a step-by-step process for starting a volunteer program, and includes a sample design and organization for a volunteer program. This section also provides guidelines for teachers' use of volunteers, suggests ways to give recognition to volunteers, lists ideas for family and retired persons volunteering, describes student mentoring and intergenerational programs, and outlines risk management. Part 3, "Youth Service-Learning," describes opportunities for student volunteerism, including the Learn and Serve American grants; core elements of effective service-learning activities; integrating service learning into the curriculum; outcomes of youth service-learning; and tips for organizing a youth service-learning program. Appendices include a family-community-school partnership project directory for Wisconsin and a checklist of practices and programs to encourage family and community support of children's learning.

AB  - This report details the recommendations of a Wisconsin education task force charged to develop strategies for the enhancement of students' knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary to sustain lifelong participation in the democratic process. The report states that the Civics Action Task Force strongly recommends that action be taken by the Wisconsin State Superintendent of Public Instruction to implement the ideas presented in the four parts: (1) "Learning About and Practicing Democracy"; (2) "Schools and Communities as Laboratories for Democracy"; (3) "Resources"; and (4) "Professional Development." It states that the task force recognizes that citizenship education crosses the entire prekindergarten through 12th grade curriculum, and that social studies programs must reclaim Democratic Citizenship Education (DCE) as their central focus. A course in local and state government including DCE should be mandatory in high school. Democratic citizenship is taught most effectively in an environment in which the principles of democracy are practiced by all. While ensuring that the environments are democratic, students must understand the problems and limitations of democracy. The task force suggests that more and higher quality resources are needed to promote civics action. Professional development for teachers in a DCE initiative is vital in helping Wisconsin students become lifelong participants in this nation's democracy and the development and implementation of a state-of-the-art professional development program for democratic citizenship education is vital. Contains appendixes on service learning, process, social studies guidelines and principles for student government, and political science and citizenship standards. (BT)

AB  - A great deal has been said and written about the importance of giving students the opportunity to provide service to others. This book is designed to provide educators with a "crash course" in how to start or repair such a program in their schools or districts. Following the introduction, chapter 1 defines service learning and explores its origins. The second and third chapters describe the purpose, goals, and principles of service learning programs. Guidelines for conducting needs assessment for the school or district are presented in the fourth chapter. Options for program design and other considerations are examined in chapters 5 and 6. Chapter 7 describes ways to gain the interest, confidence, and commitment of stakeholders. Specific tasks for getting started are outlined in the eighth chapter. Chapter 9 offers tips for understanding the administrative and managerial aspects of operation and maintenance, and chapter 10 discusses how to prepare for and overcome difficulties. The final chapter summarizes and reinforces important points. Appendices contain information sources on service learning and 20 annotated references. Two figures are included. (LMI)

AB  - Funding cuts and loss of support have forced many social service agencies to cut back dramatically on the services they offer. Many agencies have looked for opportunities to forge collaborative relationships with other agencies and organizations in their areas so that they can better serve their clients. These collaborative efforts often lead to the reopening of some programs and the combining of services of others. This article offers an overview of three collaborative efforts which were, and are, very successful. The individuals served by the programs described herein continue to reap the benefits of the collaborative relationships these agencies have developed. Educational benefits also derived from the collaborative projects due to graduate student placements which allowed students to pursue graduate education while gaining valuable work skills in the organizations. The collaboration between their educational institutions and the social service agencies represents experiential learning pedagogy, the process which actively engages students in authentic learning experiences that affect quality learning. The success of these programs should encourage other agencies and organizations to seek out cooperative ventures to benefit their clients. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Healthcare and educational expeditions to developing countries are a life-altering experience for both faculty and students. The benefits gained personally and professionally from foreign travel are invaluable. Providing healthcare to people in developing countries gives a new dimension to holistic care. Proper trip preparation with consideration of safety, legal liabilities, and educational goals is a necessity to ensure positive outcomes for patients, students, faculty, and the university or college.

AB  - Background. During a service-learning module, the focus is on the development of reflective competence, which is part of professional competence. The students have to reflect in a structured manner on the service-learning experience to understand and appreciate not only the module and discipline, but also their sense of personal value and social responsibility. By providing structured opportunities for reflection, deeper learning can be facilitated, which enhances competence. Do students benefit from the process of reflection and how should it be measured? Objective. To determine the usefulness of an assessment tool. Methods. A documented review of reflection journals made use of a rubric to score the structured reflection of students at a particular service-learning site. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the data. Results. The results showed positive changes in terms of analysis, critical thinking, emotive aspects, social responsibility and self-confidence. Conclusion. Specific factors were identified that could have affected the reflections, and recommendations are made to increase the effectiveness of the assessment tool and the process of reflection.

AB  - From making holiday decorations for a local nursing home to serving food at a homeless shelter, students at Friends Academy in upstate New York participate in service activities designed to match their level of social awareness. Maurice Howard's sidebar shows how Maryland high schoolers participate in a state-mandated service-learning program that genuinely helps others and nurtures students' nonacademic strengths. (MLH)

AB  - Moore selected the syllabi from over 125 high-quality syllabi, using the "ASA's criteria of timeliness, creativity, pedagogical coherence, clear expectations for students, and innovative evaluation methods and assignments" (p. iii). Since the collection is primarily for those teaching the course for the first time, Moore notes that "syllabi that included bibliographic lists, exams, and detailed assignments were privileged in (my) selection" (p. iii). Sam Marullo's course requires an innovative strategy of service learning, and he engages students by requiring them to act as participant observers in a social movement organization within the community. [...]it seems that many students would have difficulty reading and comprehending 10 or more book chapters or major research articles in a week. [...]the teacher using these syllabi to construct his or her course for the first time must read the material before deciding to include it in the course.

AB  - More and more programs of citizenship education in Germany (and other countries) tend to advance democratic citizenship through social learning in communities. A strong emphasis is put on social engagement to get young people involved in politics as well as to teach them participation. A qualitative analysis of selected German social learning programs shows that it is not given that students independently evaluate the political contexts of social problems. Nevertheless, these programs, which try to encourage democratic citizenship, are more characterized by behavioral goals and the aspiration to attain a prosocial attitude change than by aiming at democratic behavior. For an "activating state," personal responsibility seems to be more important than critical analysis and truly political participation. This article attempts to shed light on key structural shortcomings and problems that are the origin of young people's apolitical perceptions of community work and common practices of service learning. The goal is to develop a conception of citizenship education that leads from social to political learning.

AB  - Describes how the theory and practice of situated learning provide a model for examining the learning claims of service learning and for research into its effectiveness. While service learning emphasizes the nature of service and students' engagement with communities outside school, situated learning focuses on the nature of the learning in certain kinds of communities of practice, typically those outside school.

The benefits to students reflect principles of global education by modeling sustainability through responsible ecological planning and service to the community, the environment, and humanity. The authors propose a pedagogical framework for planning school gardens and related experiences that demonstrate how gardens promote healthier eating habits, practices that impact global economies, and service to the community, as well as the integration of knowledge of cultures, local and global resources, and sustainable food sources. The article reports interviews with proponents who offer a practical introduction to educators who wish to support students' understanding of how local actions can promote global community building.

AB  - Ethics and social responsibility are the subject of both curriculum materials and research in adult and vocational education. State academic standards and curriculum frameworks address citizenship and personal and social responsibility. Ethical and legal issues for specific occupations are addressed in curricula issued by states, professional associations, and educational institutions. Research studies examine the ethical inclinations and decision making of secondary and postsecondary students, as well as the effects of ethics instruction. Methods and resources used in ethics instruction include case studies, heroes as a model for ethical behavior, and a combination of critical thinking and ethics instruction. Service learning projects are recommended for developing social responsibility. Web sites offer resources for ethics instruction. The adult and vocational education literature reflect ethical issues for educators. A long list of ethical issues arises in the use of technology and the Internet, including power, access, control, intellectual property rights, privacy, equity, free speech, and access for minors. The ongoing debate over the mission of adult education presents many ethical dilemmas. (Annotations are provided for 21 resources and 3 Web sites.) (YLB)

AB  - This study examined the curricular dimensions of stakeholder (i.e., teachers, community agency partners, students, etc.) conceptions and views of service learning. Specifically, the study examined: (a) stakeholders' conceptions and understanding of service learning, (b) the patterns and themes concerning stakeholder views about service learning, and (c) the curricular dimensions of service learning structuring stakeholders' experiences of service learning. In order to examine these aspects of service learning as they pertained to a service learning program in a large urban high school, a qualitative approach utilizing four data collection procedures was employed. These procedures included surveying, interviewing, and observing stakeholder participants, as well as reviewing institutional documents. The first set of findings uncovered 10 conceptions of service learning offered by 565 stakeholders. Further analysis of these conceptions led to a second set of findings: (1) The organizational structure of service learning at this school had an underlying curricular framework. (2) A curricular perspective was a useful method of analysis for understanding both stakeholders' perceptions of and the institutional structuring of service learning. In reframing the options as curricular categories, I found that one option was curricular service learning, which was class-based integrated service learning where the service was tied to course content and objectives. A second option was cocurricular service learning which was a separate stand-alone elective class in service learning, and a third option was extracurricular service learning, where students independently implemented their own service learning projects. In addition to these three curricular options, I also discovered other inherent curricular elements that were masked by the more prominent feature of service learning: (a) service learning as unpaid work, (b) credit for service learning, and (c) required or “forced” service learning. These overshadowed elements were labeled “curricular shadows.” The final set of findings concerned community agency stakeholders' perceptions of the curricular dimensions of service learning. An analysis of these findings demonstrated that service learning is a complex phenomenon; curricular dimensions of service learning shape stakeholders' diverse experiences of it; and a curricular framework provides a useful method of analysis rarely employed in examining service learning programs.

AB  - As a teacher educator who regularly teaches a multicultural education course, the author has often employed service-learning as a pedagogical strategy in assisting preservice teachers to understand better the various multicultural topics they discuss, such as racism, heterosexism, and sexism that impact their schools. Therefore, when she was presented an opportunity through a major U.S. disaster relief agency to serve at a shelter housing Hurricane Katrina evacuees, she jumped at it. She knew that this would be a challenging service experience, challenging her in different ways from the kinds of service (tutoring, working at a homeless shelter, and the like) in which she usually engages. In this article, the author shares six multicultural service-learning lessons she learned as a volunteer.

AB  - Numerous researchers have stressed the critical need for preservice teachers, especially White middle-class teachers, to be educated in strategies and philosophies that are culturally responsive to an increasingly diverse K-12 student population. To this end, Geneva Gay's framework of culturally responsive pedagogy, which includes caring, communication, curriculum, and instruction, informed the study presented in this article. Each of these topics was addressed through the preservice teachers' service-learning experiences of tutoring an English Language Learner (ELL) student. The author discusses three themes that center on the sort of relationship that preservice teachers had with their tutees. The author labels these relationships as "transactional," "transformational," and "transcendent." She highlights the characteristics of each relationship and uses journal entries that illustrate each theme.

AB  - Efforts to improve interprofessional education (IPE) are informed by attitudes of health professional students, yet there are limited US data on student characteristics and experiences associated with positive attitudes towards IPE. A cohort of US medical, nursing, and physician associate students was surveyed in their first and third years, using the Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale and Interdisciplinary Education Perception Scale. Information was also collected on demographics and experiences during training. Health professional students differed in their attitudes towards IPE; characteristics associated with having more positive attitudes at both time points included being a nursing student, female, older, and having more previous healthcare experience. Students who participated in interprofessional extracurricular activities (particularly patient-based activities) during training reported more positive attitudes in the third year than those who did not participate in such activities. Based on these findings, schools may consider how student characteristics and participation in interprofessional extracurricular activities can affect attitudes regarding IPE. Building on the positive elements of this interprofessional extracurricular experience, schools may also want to consider service-learning models of IPE where students work together on shared goals.

AB  - In this article we describe the process of implementing a community-based research project that linked student learning with documenting elements of local histories surrounding the civil rights movement in Mississippi and Tennessee. We show that developing a dialogue among community members, ourselves, and our students worked to democratize the research project, produce strong support among the community members, and contribute to an improved understanding of racial inequality for our students. We rely on our accounts of the process, student journals, and oral histories compiled during the research. Our findings show that there are considerable opportunities for community-based research around documenting and sharing key memories and that these can be realized even when the priorities between researchers and community members do not align. Our historically-oriented fieldwork, research, and findings serve to link service-learning to community-based research. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Assessment and evaluation practices within honors programs have attracted considerable attention within the honors academic community, e.g., the spring/summer 2006 volume of the "Journal of the National Collegiate Honors Council." Calls for carefully created and constructed assessment activities within honors programs have met with mixed responses by directors who identify the difficulty in assessing decentralized, complex learning environments, noting that standard measures such as tests, surveys, or essays are not always applicable or appropriate in addressing honors assessment needs, especially in areas of social justice, service learning, and community engagement (Corley & Zubizarreta; Lanier). The focus of this paper is to share one effective method for gathering evidence that indicates whether students advanced in their ability to think at a more complex level within a short-term honors service learning course. Grounded in Wolcott and Lynch's Steps to Better Thinking Skills model, this augmented assessment tool identifies growth in critical thinking skills and areas of intellectual risk.

AB  - While many scholars agree that service learning is beneficial to both the student and the community, the research on service learning in the physical education setting is limited. However, there are courses that can be aligned with the professional preparation needs of students and the broader needs of the community. Drawing on theory which has guided experiential education, the study examined what the students learning to teach young adults with disabilities consider meaningful when teaching, and how perceptions regarding disabilities evolve during a field experience that incorporates service learning and critical reflection. Fifty undergraduate students enrolled in an Adapted Physical Education course partnered with 24 young adults with disabilities for 10 weeks of biweekly cardiovascular and strength and conditioning instruction. Data were collected qualitatively and grounded theory approach guided the analysis of the critical incident reports, reflections, interviews, and direct observations. When analysing data, three distinct stages of development emerged illustrating students' progression during service learning: anticipation, familiarization, and commitment. The duration of each phase seemed to be unique to each student. Establishing and developing relationships were perceived as the most meaningful experience while communication and effective teaching strategies were most challenging. Critical reflection ensures that students advance from anticipation and familiarization to commitment, which constitutes change, not only in attitude and understanding, but in behaviour.

AB  - This study examined the implementation of a contextualized place-based, service learning curriculum into standards-based curriculums to increase student engagement along with diversifying teacher pedagogy. It provided an ethnological case study analysis of two specific sites where a place-based, service learning program was incorporated into course curriculums and school cultures. The Susquenita Middle School in Duncannon, Pennsylvania and the Blue Ridge Middle School in Purcellville, Virginia, both lying in close proximity to the Appalachian Trail, were explored to evaluate how the integration of a place-based, service learning program has provided benefits to each school's students, teachers, and curriculum. A triangulation of stakeholder interviews, group discussions, and supporting documents from the two schools provided evidence to support the situated and constructivist's theories of utilizing local communities for contextualized (place-based) learning of academic topics. An analysis of the literature and the strategies set forth in this study answered the overarching question of how the implementation of a place-based, service learning education program affects student engagement and allows for the diversification of teacher practices in standards-based classrooms. Although a review of the literature, which focused on common themes, indicated that place-based, service learning programs have been effective in specific instances, there has been little research that focuses directly on the administrative role in the facilitation of a place-based, service learning program to aid teacher practices or student engagement in a standards-based curriculum. The objective of this study was to interpret the qualitative data collected in an effort to provide awareness and direction for educators as they strive for a student-centered approach to a standards-based curriculum. This study found several emerging trends demonstrating that place-based service learning can be an effective tool to engage and immerse students in their curriculum and the surrounding community. The educators interviewed confirmed that students in their classes were able to make connections between the theoretical didactic information that was presented in the classroom and the real world application of their classroom knowledge. Key findings that reinforced the benefits of incorporating place-based service learning in the classroom, was the unwavering and ongoing support from the school administration and the surrounding community that is necessary to make this type of program successful and sustainable in a standards based curriculum.

AB  - A collaborative research project was developed for a multidisciplinary class of advanced undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in Sociology of Natural Resources and the Environment. The goals of the project were to determine the feasibility of offering an experiential learning opportunity and to explore its usefulness in enhancing students' thinking about the social constructedness of natural resource and environmental (NRE) problems. The context was the Mobile Bay watershed, which is the site of a variety of concerns such as land use, pollution, and habitat destruction. To explore these types of problems, students completed a series of assignments including a media analysis, an annotated bibliography, several peer reviews, and a poster. Evaluation found that the project was not entirely successful for teaching and learning about the role of the media in shaping and defining NRE problems, but it was very successful for teaching and learning about rural sociology more broadly.

AB  - In his popular introductory sociology text, Stark identifies W. E. B. Du Bois and Albion Small as important cornerstones of the U.S. sociological tradition. While the work of the “Chicago School” is well known in sociological circles, Du Bois’ sociological legacy is not. The Philadelphia Negro ([1899] 1996) is a classic empirical sociological study that is rarely included in discussions of the development of scientific sociology. Likewise, The Negro Church ([1903b] 2003) represents one of the first empirically based sociological studies of a religious institution. Sociologists of religion routinely discuss the contributions of Durkheim, Weber, and Simmel while virtually ignoring Du Bois. This is ironic because Du Bois’ work on religion was based on ethnographic data, field interviews, surveys, and census data. This article provides an overview of Du Bois’ sociological study of the Black Church in the United States by identifying some of the main themes developed in The Philadelphia Negro ([1899] 1996), The Souls of Black Folk ([1903a] 1994), and The Negro Church ([1903b] 2003). These studies reveal that Du Bois was a pioneer in the areas of evaluation research, public sociology, service learning, and congregational studies.

AB  - Social responsibility is a value orientation, rooted in democratic relationships with others and moral principles of care and justice, that motivates certain civic actions. Given its relevance for building stronger relationships and communities, the development of social responsibility within individuals should be a more concerted focus for developmental scholars and youth practitioners. During childhood and adolescence, the developmental roots of individuals' social responsibility lie in the growth of executive function, empathy and emotion regulation, and identity. Efforts to cultivate children and adolescents' social responsibility in the proximal settings of their everyday lives should emphasize modeling prosocial behaviors, communicating concerns for others, and creating opportunities to practice civic skills.

AB  - In this article, the author describes the intergenerational service-learning program at South Scranton Intermediate School in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Currently in its fifth year of operation, the program was originated by William King, a former principal, as an attempt to develop a working relationship between Oakwood Terrace, an Alzheimer's care center in Moosic, Pennsylvania, and student volunteers from the middle school's Serving and Learning Together (SALT) classes. During the past five years, South Intermediate's program has consistently provided a service to the school and community with a special emphasis on helping senior citizens. The program takes students to visit Oakwood Terrace every week. Students undergo intensive training to learn how to work one-on-one with residents. Learning how to handle unusual situations has helped students' academic and social skills and increased their self-confidence. The program has allowed students and residents to experience great things.

AB  - This booklet, which is addressed to school administrators, examines the principles of service learning as a way of teaching rather than just another program and explains how administrators can customize service learning to the unique characteristics of their own schools and communities. The booklet begins by defining service learning as a delivery system that can be used as a central organizing principle for helping students achieve personal and social growth and prepare for the world of work and citizenship while achieving the school's curricular goals. Discussed in a section devoted to administrative issues are the following topics: the special problems of scheduling service learning in secondary schools; options for reducing transportation costs associated with service learning; funding opportunities; and liability concerns and risk management strategies. The following educational issues are considered: professional development; ways of integrating service learning into the curriculum; student assessment in classroom and nonclassroom settings; and program evaluation. Examined in a section on support issues are the following topics: building an infrastructure, public relations, and community support and involvement. Concluding the guide are brief descriptions of the services provided by three national organizations: the National Service-Learning Cooperative/Clearinghouse, Corporation for National Service, and National Dropout Prevention Center.

AB  - [...]experiential learning's advocates in sociology note that it benefits student learning processes and the classroom climate. [...]many argue that experiential learning can help facilitate the transition between undergraduate education and the workforce, subsequent courses in the discipline, and postbaccalaureate schooling. Dewey (1938:31) considers time for student reflection, arguing that experience is a "moving force" that must be judged and directed. Since student preparation and reflection are requisite components of a successful experiential learning assignment, short-term experiential learning may help novice users attain better results. [...]I relied upon anonymous student evaluations of my own participant-observation assignments, for criminology (N=7) and social deviance (N=10), and of two field trips I helped to design in courses on science, technology and work (N=5), and scientific change (N=17).

AB  - This autobiographical essay 'takes cultural studies personally', drawing on experience, identity and the personal to indicate how and why the author is proponent of and is working on developing a model of cultural studies as social justice praxis despite the constraints academia in general and of the university as an institution in particular. The paper travels roughly from the author's student and teacher days in Sierra Leone through his graduate student days in Canada to his current role as university teacher in the USA. He selectively concentrates on his experience as a teacher of literature (and African multi-role utilitarianism), education and cultural studies (using one of his cultural studies courses and students' questions about the utility of cultural studies as example), his shifting and overlapping racial/ethnic identities (African/black) and the politics of identity, and his thoughts on the place of theory in cultural studies and a black approach to theory (black ambivalent elaboration) as contributory factors. While this account acts in its own way as an argument for conceptualizing cultural studies as praxis, the primary focus is more modestly on my own autobiographical account as a specific case. In fact, an autobiographical approach is employed precisely to be specific and in the attempt to avoid the pitfalls of over­generalization and the authority of authenticity.

AB  - The maximization of productivity and labor efficiency has been a hallmark of the American agriculture and food system. The result of these twin processes is an industrial, concentrated, and consolidated provisioning system that produces cheap and plentiful food. Many view this model as a panacea for providing food to a modern industrial workforce, yet, increasingly, others are identifying cracks in this system. Research shows that an abundant food supply from an industrial model of agriculture has hidden costs to farm family stability, rural community well-being, and human and ecosystem health. A recent turn in this research has shifted away from the identification of weaknesses toward the exploration of viable options to redesign the food system in a manner that ensures long term sustainability. Civic agriculture is one such model that includes community-embedded initiatives to re-localize agriculture in communities of place, while enhancing food security, literacy, safety, and rebuilding rural communities. In this paper, I detail an exercise to teach the concept of civic agriculture through the development of community-based learning in the form of global and local public learning communities, service-learning advocacy, and international exchange. To demonstrate the comparative nature of agriculture and food system changes, as well as emerging models of sustainability, I developed a partnership with a Hungarian class which allowed students to compare and contrast approaches to sustainable development and probe the role of history and culture as causal forces in these endeavors. I describe my efforts to develop this partnership and weave opportunities for service-learning advocacy into the curriculum. (Contains 2 footnotes.)

AB  - There is a growing body of research suggesting that schools need to respond to changing social and economic dynamics by prioritising "21st-century skills". Proponents of this view, who have been termed "the 21st century skills movement", have called for greater emphasis on cognitive and non-cognitive skills development, alongside the learning of subject content and technical skills. This paper explores the potential of International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP) schools to respond to this mandate in China, one of the fastest-growing markets for International Baccalaureate® (IB) schools globally. The authors' research team undertook a multi-site case study of five elite IBDP schools in China. Their findings revealed confidence among interviewees that the IB educational philosophy was conducive to 21st-century skills development, especially through the provision of the three IBDP "Core Requirements", which are Creativity, Action, Service (CAS), Extended Essay (EE) and Theory of Knowledge (TOK). Despite this confidence, concerns remain about the implementation of the IB educational philosophy in the context of IBDP schools in China.

AB  - The Interprofessional Care Access Network is an innovative model for academic-practice partnership providing care coordination for vulnerable and underserved clients and populations in identified neighborhoods. Interprofessional student teams, including health professions students from nursing, medicine, pharmacy, and dentistry, collaborate with community service organizations and primary care clinics to address social determinants of health identified as barriers to achieving health care outcomes and Triple Aim goals. Teams are supervised by a nursing faculty in residence and address issues such as housing, health insurance, food security, and lack of primary care. Two case studies demonstrate the potential impact of the project.

AB  - Purpose: It is well established that partnerships between universities and community organizations can serve to enhance student learning and employability (Anderson et al., 2011; Arantes do Amaral and Matsusaki, 2017; Jones and Sherr, 2014; Voss et al., 2015). Within this context, the purpose of this paper is to explore how one such partnership has resulted in the successful implementation of three pedagogical methodologies, which individually and collectively promote student-centered learning and employability skills through an experiential learning framework. Design/methodology/approach: Using this methodological case study approach where the pedagogies of internships, service-learning opportunities, and project-based learning are critically evaluated, the research reveals only positive benefits for students, faculty, and the community organization(s). These benefits center on improved employability skills, the development of social skills and societal contribution for students. Findings: Participating students also noted the development of their confidence and the importance of feedback from both peers and assigned staff. Members of faculty considered the opportunity for students to put theory into practice, enhanced employability skills and the collective nature of the methodologies as the main benefits with The center echoing the sentiments of other stakeholders. The center considered the workplace preparedness, the development of soft skills and confidence and the collective nature of the methodologies as the main benefits of the partnership. Originality/value: The insight provided by the research contributes to existing literature through examining the relationship between an academic institution and its community, providing a practical framework and guidelines for the implementation of student-centered pedagogical methods.

AB  - Programming assignments are commonly used in computer science education to encourage students to practice target concepts and evaluate their learning status. Ensuring students are engaged in such assignments is critical in attracting and retaining students. To this end, WebHat, a service-based program evaluation platform, is introduced in this work to support programming assignment practice. WebHat provides students with immediate assistance via online evaluation services and helps teaching staff monitor student status and progress. Based on the results of this system, teaching staff can dynamically adjust, if necessary, online evaluation services to provide further help to enhance student engagement in the ongoing assignment. To demonstrate the effectiveness of WebHat, an empirical study is conducted with freshman students as the subjects during the Introduction to Computer Science course. The results show that students are encouraged to start working on their assignments earlier and develop programs in the desired direction with the aid of the dynamically adjusted online evaluation services. WebHat thus enables students to submit better final products with regard to both functionality and quality. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Byram's (2008) intercultural citizenship framework includes the following orientations: cognitive, evaluative, comparative, action, and communicative. Using this framework as a theoretical basis, this study explored the international service-learning (ISL) experiences of four Taiwanese non-native English speakers (NNES) during a two-week trip to a poor community in the Philippines. Data collected from these students' individual reflections, interviews, and public presentations illustrate their acquisition of the knowledge, skills and attitudes of intercultural citizenship. This study thus demonstrates that ISL allowed students to engage beneficially for themselves and their hosts with other NNES, instead of following the tradition of study abroad in countries where English is spoken natively.

AB  - The bottom of the pyramid (BOP) market has gained importance in international entrepreneurship due to its large market potential. Drawing on the literature of international business education, as well as social entrepreneurship and international entrepreneurship education, we propose a course to educate students how to develop business intimacy with the BOP community. We employ the experiential-learning pedagogical framework and design elements including a short-term study abroad service trip, an entrepreneurship project, and structured reflections. Using both qualitative and quantitative data, we demonstrate that the course facilitates students' learning in the key areas of international and social entrepreneurship, including the economic and social value of community embeddedness for BOP ventures, the emotional intelligence in interacting with BOP communities, and the attitude toward social entrepreneurship.

AB  - Nearly 20 years ago, the field of counseling was charged to take up its historic role of advocating for social justice, however, it appears that counselor education programs are not adequately preparing counseling students to fulfill the mandated role of social justice advocate. Advocacy is a complex role with foundations in multicultural competency (Speight & Vera, 2004) that requires the ability to view problems in a multi-systemic fashion. Considering students' ability to engage in social justice concepts is critical in designing educational experiences that will prepare them for the full range of tasks in the counseling profession. Service learning is an academic strategy that links academic content with practical experience focused on solving community problems. In a quasi-experimental design, masters' students enrolled in a community counseling internship course participated in a service learning intervention designed to promote moral development, intellectual development, and social justice advocacy competency. Results indicated that the use of a service learning intervention promoted significant gains in moral developmental levels, as measured by the Defining Issues Test-2 (Rest, Narvaez, Bebeau, Thoma, 1999). A supplemental analysis also revealed significant growth in the advocacy competency domain of Public Information, as measured by the Advocacy Competency Self-Assessment Survey (Batts & Ford, 2008). No significant differences were found between the service learning group and the non-service learning group on intellectual development at posttest. The study suggests that advocacy competency and moral development may be promoted through the use of a service learning strategy. Service learning may be a promising approach that can be used by counselor educators to prepare students for the mandated role of social justice advocate.

AB  - This chapter endeavors to capture the development of policy towards youth work over the past 25 years. Two convenient bookends frame the place of youth work in England during this period: Experience & Participation (Thompson Report, 1982) & Aiming High -- the government's strategy for young people (2007). But first, a definition of 'youth work.' For this author, it is the application in work with adolescents of a form of practice which has three defining characteristics -- their personal & social development (as distinct, say, from their academic learning); the deliberate use of experiential learning & transformative relationships; & adherence to a set of values (which, inter alia, puts the interests of young people first). For much of the period it was 'hosted' in an ill-defined set of structural arrangements -- 'The Youth Service' -- which lacked a clear legal basis but were usually seen as a partnership between local authorities & voluntary organizations. In the course of the period, the use of the terms 'youth work' & 'Youth Service' increasingly ceased to be synonymous as youth work practice was taken up in a range of other settings & services. This chapter focuses on work in England; policy elsewhere in the UK increasingly diverged in its structures if not in its intentions. References. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - This paper investigates social-environmental factors contributing to differential ethnobotanical expertise among children in Raramuri (Tarahumara) communities in Chihuahua, Mexico, to explore processes of indigenous ecological education and epistemologies of research. One hundred and four children from two schools (one with a Ráramuri knowledge curriculum and one without) were interviewed about their knowledge of 40 useful plants. Overall, children showed less ethnobotanical expertise than expected and a great deal of variability by age, though most shared knowledge of a core set of culturally and ecologically salient plants. No significant difference was found between girls' and boys' knowledge. The overall use-knowledge scores were almost twice as high as naming scores (mean of 40% vs. 24.4%). This supports the conclusion that use-context is more culturally relevant, salient or easier for children to remember than names. The social-environmental factors significant in predicting levels of plant knowledge among children were whether a child attended a Rarámuri or Spanish-instruction school, and, to a lesser extent, age. However, these effects were not strong, and individual variability in expertise is best interpreted using ethnographic knowledge of each child's family and personal history, leading to a model of ethnobotanical education that foregrounds experiential learning and personal and family interest in useful plants. Though overall plant knowledge may be lower among children today compared to previous generations, a community knowledge structure seems to be reproduced in which a few individuals in each age cohort show great proficiency, and children make the same kinds of mistakes and share specialized names for plants.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - This article describes a culminating assignment for students enrolled in a human ecology course in a Masters in Science Education program. The goal of this assignment was for students to use published scientific data to link daily life, human impact, and sustainability to ecological function. This activity required students to consider the complicated task of making data accessible to younger learners while retaining data accuracy. This data-centric approach is broadly applicable to other science courses because the root requirement that students "show the data" reflects the heart of science. Requiring students to visit published scientific research and explain how the data are used to make conclusions is essential to their understanding of the scientific process and their learning how to evaluate the wealth of data and assertions that they encounter in their daily life.

AB  - The Mayor's Youth Technology Corps (MYTC)--Creating Safe Communities through Information Technology Training in Homeland Security Applications (2008-2012)--offered a collaboration of resources, supports, and opportunities for strengthening science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education efforts in an underserved community, the City of Detroit. The MYTC internship program is an important form of student civic engagement and also the highlight of hands-on experiences for the MYTC trainees. The internship is the capstone and a true test of how the MYTC students were trained and whether the students were learning what was designed for them in this project. Moreover, the internship program aimed at advancing the participating students' motivation toward STEM careers. This paper examines the rationale for selecting the internship as the MYTC project's capstone and the lessons learned through the internship program implementation. The author believes that the municipal and business communities of major cities would find this model viable and rewarding with additional ties to service learning and workforce development. Future needs would require looking into how to build an organizational structure in order to provide sustained financial resources to support students' participation in civic activities in underserved communities.

AB  - This article draws on Marcia’s model that defines four statuses of adolescents’ identity formation to examine adolescent moral and civic identity formation. Interviews were conducted with 23 students at three Hong Kong senior secondary schools to address the following research question: How does community service help adolescents develop their moral and civic identities? Among the participants, most of them reported attaining moral identity development and just a few participants reported civic identity development; nonetheless, one of them did not report identity development in the moral and civic domains. Furthermore, five core elements of community service programs facilitating the participants’ identity formation emerged from the findings, namely, meaningful service activities, diversity, youth voice, reflection, and extended service duration. The influence of these service elements varied across the moral and civic domains of identity. By reporting the findings gained from an East Asian school setting, the article contributes to a fuller understanding of the role of community service in adolescent identity formation.

AB  - We examined the effects of a gerontology course and an intergenerational service-learning project for people with dementia (PWD) on three dimensions of students' attitudes including attitudes toward older people, community service for older people, and working with PWD. Data consisted of a combination of pretest/posttest survey and review of journals that students maintained during the service-learning project. Results indicated that students who completed the gerontology course, and those who completed both the course and the service-learning project, reported significantly more positive attitudes toward older adults, whereas students in the course only had significantly less positive attitudes about working with PWD, and those in the other courses (sociology) showed no change in their attitudes. Students' journals are replete with reports of the satisfaction they derived from their experiences. The findings highlight opportunities and challenges that should be considered in future intergenerational service-learning programs and gerontological education.

AB  - This study examined the development of community involvement in a place-based high school program for at-risk youth. Teachers and community members founded the program to address concerns about low achievement and high dropout rates among Native Hawaiians. In addition to funding, community members provided program development, supervision of students' service-learning, cultural consultation, political support, and teacher and curriculum development. Collaborations were sustained by open communication, the development of a common set of values among a diverse group of people, and flexibility of community members' schedules. Challenges to community involvement included a lack of support from school leadership, teacher burnout, and occasional interpersonal conflicts.

AB  - Although service learning has been proposed as a teaching-learning modality in response to an ongoing challenge to transform nursing education, there is a risk to community and student when service learning is poorly conceived. A community-centered service learning approach founded on a nursing theoretical perspective and community model is explored as a way to honor the wisdom and perspective of the community in changing while illuminating a new way of being a nurse in community for the nursing student.

AB  - We designed a cross-disciplinary interdepartmental volunteer program, which involved student participation in 'community care teams for the elderly living alone.' Our aim was to enhance communication between students and the elderly. Students were expected to meet and learn to get along with the elderly, to develop listening and communication skills, and learn to cooperate with student participants in other services. Students were required to devote at least 14 hours per semester to this two-semester program. Between September 2008 and June 2009, 19 students (1st semester), 34 students (2nd semester), 7 students (both 1st and 2nd semesters), respectively, and 15 elderly participants became involved in the program. Students were divided into 15 groups (each with 2–4 students), and each group visited the assigned elderly person at least 6 times per semester. According to student accounts, these visits improved their interpersonal and communication skills and their ability to express concerns with self-confidence. Our analysis of students’ reflections found that early exposure to such community experiences increases their capacity for self-reflection and teaches them how to show respect. The opportunity to develop empathic communication skills with the elderly and learn to cooperate with faculty and colleagues can be beneficial to students in their future medical practice and strengthen the quality of community care.

AB  - This article examines the role of international service-learning (ISL) in facilitating undergraduates' exploration of their conceptions of self (i.e., self-exploration). Conception of self refers to the use of values to define one's role in a social/cultural group or organization and in society, and to determine current actions and future commitments. ISL is intentionally structured activities involving students in social services in overseas settings. Existing research underscores the importance of inducting students to other-oriented (showing care and empathy for others) values in facilitating their self-exploration through ISL. Interviews with 48 students in Hong Kong who participated in ISL revealed qualitative differences in students' conceptions of self related to moral, cultural, and leadership values. The findings highlight the need to guide students to critically self-reflect on their values and actions, and build reciprocal relationships with others. Implications for international educators and service-learning practitioners to support students' self-exploration in ISL are proposed.

AB  - In this study, we combined social inclusion with a curriculum design emphasizing service learning to transform academic classroom curricula into meaningful services in community-based settings. In a service-learning curriculum at the junior and senior levels in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), we implemented a service learning pedagogy to engage students in a social context. The curriculum encouraged students to work with special education schools in joint projects that help children with disabilities. In short, problem-based and service learning are integrated so that opportunities for students to participate in communities can be more meaningfully created. The framework of participatory research, which includes problem identification, intervention, and interpretation of results, was adopted. This framework offers students an in-depth perspective when they take action to implement changes in the community, as well as the broader society. A group of four junior students helped the special education teacher prepare the task analysis steps of showering and designed a shower training game. Six children with autism participated in the design process of the game and also used the game to acquire showering skills. Overall, the children's independent performance in terms of task correctness immediately increased when the game intervention was introduced, and all of the participants acquired and maintained the skills necessary for the task of taking a shower independently. Although they had very limited verbal skills, they used various other expressions to provide feedback, which made the game design possible. This project brought engineering students' attention to issues that arise for a large, yet marginalized, group of individuals. Through community-based participatory research, children with disabilities and their teachers were included as contributors and participants; so often professionals do things "to and for" people with disabilities instead of "with" them.

AB  - This paper provides an overview of research on community service in adolescence and outlines a theoretical approach that relates service participation to identity development. After building the case that the 1990s has been a period of increased interest in the prosocial effects of service participation among school-aged youth, this paper discusses the scope of this interest and describes the current state of the research literature. The report then provides a framework for organizing the literature by delineating three concepts associated with service: agency, which refers to findings that associate service with personal directedness and increased self-understanding; social relatedness, which pertains to findings that address the social characteristic of service; and moral-political awareness, which refers to findings that relate service to morality and civic behavior. Taken together, the findings suggest that experiences of service pertain to the process of trying to understand oneself with social-historical reality and helps youth to feel that they can actively "make history," rather than simply "live history," and that service participants come to view themselves as political agents in improving societal conditions. Future directions for developmental research in this area are also discussed. Contains 33 references. (DR)

AB  - This paper outlines a theoretical approach to understanding how youth community service participation can stimulate identity development and encourage civic investment. The study elucidates the developmental processes through which individuals become invested in civic activities and the activities in which youth are involved. The paper explains developmental continuity in civic participation from adolescence to adulthood and then illustrates this approach using data from a case study of participants in a school-based service program. Findings are presented from a 1993-1994 juniors' essays on service and from the alumni surveys and essays. Presenting participants' reflections as they go through the program and 3-, 5-, and 10-years later, the study shows how service experience can stimulate reflections on self in relation to society and can foster a sense of agency and responsibility.

AB  - This article addresses the interconnection of political socialization and identity development. We begin with Erikson's work, which identified the development of political commitment in adolescence as a key aspect of identity formation. We then seek to shed light on the social processes through which youth become engaged in political activities and issues. We discuss the influences of family and peers as well as participation in community service and other civic activities. The development of social responsibility and agency, and an understanding of the complexity of social issues a re considered as important facets of political commitment. Data from a case study of Black urban adolescents who participated in a year-long service learning program are used to illustrate our perspective. We conclude that social-historical context, instantiated in social relationships and actions, plays a pivotal ride in the process and shape of political socialization and identity formation.

This project provided care to senior residents in an apartment complex and was integrated into a nursing educational program in Taiwan. In collaboration with these organizations, an educational partnership model was developed and evaluated. Three goals were accomplished: to provide health care to elderly residents, practical learning experience for nursing students, and practical experience for nursing faculty. The findings indicated that teachers, students, and residents in the apartment complex presented a high level of satisfaction with this model. The model created a vivid, practical, community-based resource and applied the principles of service-learning into practical nursing education in Taiwan. The model not only facilitated the empowerment of involved organizations, but also served as a reference for developing other community center-based nursing educational partnerships.

AB  - This paper presents an innovative two-course, laboratory-based, and design-oriented robotics educational model. The robotics curriculum exposed senior-level undergraduate students to major robotics concepts, and enhanced the student learning experience in hybrid learning environments by incorporating the IEEE Region-5 annual robotics competition with open-ended design challenges, by establishing a robotics club, and by implementing a K-12 mentorship program. A four-faculty team developed two elective courses in which the theoretical concepts underlying the robotics design competition topics were supported with corresponding laboratory activities. Students took the courses sequentially. They were formed into diverse teams, whose performance was assessed via weekly team presentations and participation in an outreach day. The best robot design teams participated in the IEEE Region-5 competitions. All students participated in a service-learning activity, acting as mentors during local K-12 robotics competitions while enhancing their own robotics comprehension. The robotics curriculum's two-year evaluation results illustrate the consistent efficacy of the curriculum during the project duration, indicating a successful robotics educational model for other academic institutions to follow.

AB  - The aim of this qualitative survey was to investigate what kind of teaching methods have been used in biology to promote biodiversity education (BDE) and how the methods support biodiversity (BD) learning. We found, in total, 317 international scientific articles published since 2000 which described the teaching methods regarding BDE and the teaching, and/or the learning. From these ones 12 articles specifically addressed the teaching methods of BD. The content of these articles was analysed in detail. The detailed analysis was based on (a) the categories of the teaching methods used, (b) the conception of learning in the Finnish National Core Curricula for Secondary schools and (c) the revised Bloom's taxonomy and Stanny's verbs concerning the levels of taxonomy. The most used teaching methods were hands-on instruction, experiential learning, and teacher presentation. The least used ones were games, roleplay, debates, service learning, study trips, and visits. In all the articles, various teaching methods used during the lessons were described. The items concerning the teaching methods, which supported students learning were active participation and interactionmentioned in all the articlesfollowed by observation, experimental work, experiential learning, and techniques for increasing environmental awareness. The understanding of the different perspectives of BD and the development of self-evaluation were addressed in only four and two of the articles, respectively. The four types of knowledge were supported by the used teaching methods in nine articles jointly. The lower levels of thinking skills were well-supported by the used teaching methods. The highest level of thinking skills, such as synthesis and evaluation, received the least amount of attention.

AB  - This study explores service-learning's attention to power both historically and in present practice. The study is guided by five questions that examine: conceptions of power among Service-learning (SL) Pioneers and 2007 Service-Learning Emerging Leaders; historically how power has been addressed in SL; best practices addressing issues of power in SL; the operationalization of a power score; and the link between critical theory and SL as social justice. The study discusses practitioners' attention to power in the service-learning process through the use of critical ethnographic interviews of service-learning pioneers as well as interviews with service-learning emerging leaders identified by the National Youth Leadership Council and the National Service-Learning Partnership. A historical analysis of service-learning's attention to power is conducted through expanding on an existing policy analysis of the service-learning field. Interviews are triangulated with relevant literature to identify key indicators of attention to power within the service-learning experience. These indicators are used in an exploratory attempt to operationalize the construct of power within the National Youth Leadership Council's 2006 National Service-Learning Study on Transitioning to Adulthood to construct a power scale. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is used to identify a set of items from this study to measure power in service-learning practice. A power factor is generated from the Power Scale and is used as a dependent variable in multiple regression. Measures of student empowerment are used to predict a power score. The study findings suggest that there are common best practices used by service-learning emerging leaders and pioneers, supported by service-learning literature and often informed by critical theory. Six SL principles are identified to guide the field toward integrating a social justice focus. Findings suggest that an increase in explicit attention to power in SL is urgently needed to move toward this goal. Overall, the study points to participants' development of personal power as least explored in SL practice, with little explicit attention to power occurring in SL overall. The study concludes with recommendations for expanding attention to power in service-learning practice in order to fully operationalize attention to power within the Service-Learning field.

AB  - Our aim in this study was to propose an integrated model to examine the structural relationships among a higher education institution’s service quality, student satisfaction, institutional image, and behavioral intention at a private university located in South Korea. We conducted a survey of students majoring in business to analyze these relationships. Structural equation modeling showed that students were satisfied with various aspects (tangibles, reliabilities, responsiveness, empathy, and assurance) of service quality. Also, service quality directly affected both student satisfaction and perceived institutional image. In addition, the results indicated that students’ perceived institutional image and satisfaction directly influenced behavioral intention. Although perceived service quality was not a significant construct to predict behavioral intention of students, our results showed a mediating effect of perceived institutional image and student satisfaction on the relationship between service quality and behavioral intention.

AB  - Background: Animal-assisted activities (AAAs) show promise in providing emotional and social benefits to older adults and may be used as a tool to promote therapeutic communication between students and cognitively impaired older adults. Purpose: The purpose was to develop a program incorporating AAAs to enhance social engagement of cognitively impaired older adults in a community respite program and in turn enhance student comfort when caring for this vulnerable population. Methods: The Dementia Attitudes Scale, a validated tool, was used to measure students' attitudes before and after AAA intervention. Data were analyzed using repeated-measures analysis of variance. Results: Students were significantly more comfortable and demonstrated a gain in knowledge after AAAs were included in the community clinical experience. Conclusions: Incorporating AAAs into student community/service-learning clinical experience improved communication between students and cognitively impaired older adults, improving students' attitudes when caring for this population.

AB  - This chapter shows how student positioning by adults shapes opportunities for students to develop collective systemic agency. Collective systemic agency refers to the capacity to organize others, participate in discussions, develop a systemic analysis, and take action in complex institutions, such as schools. This repertoire can be cultivated by encouraging students to ask critical questions about their educational experiences and to uncover evidence about how policy affects people. In observing this process taking place in schools, we notice that the ways adults positioned students, in part through talk, greatly impacted learning opportunities. To warrant our claims, we draw on data from Critical Civic Inquiry (CCI), a university-school partnership in which teachers guide students through an action research cycle. Our analysis looks at the ways in which school and classroom level positioning of students impacts student experiences and openings for action. Both focal classrooms make space for civic learning, but the chances to express agency are limited in some cases. We argue that these learning opportunities are strengthened when education professionals look beyond curricular experiences and attend to how students are positioned through discourse in the broader context of the school.

AB  - Following the introduction of a National Curriculum for Science, all secondary science teachers in England need to be prepared to teach all aspects of a broad and balanced science curriculum. This is the second paper in which we explore science student teachers' subject knowledge development during a one-year postgraduate teacher preparation course. In this qualitative study we explore the role of university tutors and school-based subject mentors in science student teachers' subject knowledge development as perceived by student teachers, school-based subject mentors and university tutors. The findings reveal that student teachers are reluctant to use university tutors and school mentors for subject knowledge development because they are aware of their assessment roles. The role of the university tutor in subject knowledge development is perceived as one of facilitation and of developing student teachers' sense of professionalism. School mentors perceive that they do provide support for subject knowledge development and they are largely unaware of any potential conflict arising from their assessment role. The findings of the study are discussed in terms of the nature of student teachers' professional learning in communities of practice. The implications for mentor training programmes are considered.

AB  - The purpose of this chapter is to provide recommendations to teacher educators in terms of structuring service-learning experiences in ways that promote beliefs and help preservice teachers develop the skills necessary to be effective with English language learners (ELLs). Teacher education is at a crucial juncture as the demographic makeup of current students is changing rapidly, resulting in a need to reexamine teacher education in light of these shifts. For example, the percentage of minority students in K-12 public schools increased from 33% in 1990 to 46% in 2010, whereas only 16.5% of teachers reported belonging to minority groups in 2007-2008, and most do not have the experience of becoming proficient in a second language, the kind of experience that may help them relate to the learning histories of their students. This disparity raises concern about the limited abilities of those with monocultural and monolingual experiences when they view and value the perspectives of their students from other cultural backgrounds. Additionally, many preservice teachers believe they are not as capable of instructing students who differ from themselves in terms of race or language as they do those from their own cultural backgrounds.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide an understanding of how service learning pedagogy assists in student and organizational learning. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use case study reflection and ethnography approaches. Findings: The key to the success of the internship was time spent on relationship building between the parties, clear documentation of roles and responsibilities, the selection and matching process and open communication between all parties. Using Mezirow's (1991) transformational learning approach, and Kolb's (1984) learning framework, it demonstrates an example of perspective transformation where the "unfamiliar" helps participants to question the "familiar"; through embedding learning in relation to culture, values, ownership and identity. Service learning relies on collaborative pedagogy where reflection and relationships with community and educators provide a platform to test students' values and moral reasoning and build community cultural understanding. Research limitations/implications: The paper includes a single case study and autoethnographic research methodology only. Practical implications: Community-learning activities supplement the course content and embeds learning, broadening the students' experiences, providing them with an understanding of context, and dealing with complexity to question their own cultural values. In practical terms it provides students with different career opportunities such as in the not-for-profit sector or in advocacy work. Service learning pedagogy enhances graduate capabilities, across many areas including problem solving, values development and community engagement and thinking of the other. Originality/value: The paper reports on and analyses the learning of a service learning internship between a business school and an Indigenous organization. The paper uses a reflection methodology and is written by the University internship co-ordinator (teacher) and an international student intern, whilst drawing on reflections of the Indigenous leader of the not-for-profit organization.

The database broadens the range of organizations that instructors and students have for client-based communication projects. We argue in support of incorporating service learning into classes and facilitating partnerships among university instructors, their students, and nonprofits. We report strategies we learned for working with student interns and IT experts and strategies we developed as we worked with usability-test participants.

AB  - This book presents a theoretical rationale for youth involvement in community service. Its thesis is that youth participation in solving social problems has the potential to promote the development of personal and collective identity. Through community service, youth can acquire a sense that they can make a difference and a concern for society's welfare. The book is based on a qualitative study of the 1993-94 junior class of a Catholic high school in Washington, D.C. with a predominantly African-American student body. The researchers followed these students as they progressed through a required course on social justice in which service at a soup kitchen was a mandatory ane essential part. The book reports the results of the study, especially through anecdotes of discussions with the students and excerpts from their essays. The study demonstrates the following: volunteer work can be a key building block of self-development in youth; the youth learned much about homelessness and society and the political processes involved; and they changed their values and became more mature and caring people. The book contains 140 references. (KC)

AB  - Mature moral and civic life is distinguished by respect for common humanity which develops through participation in community service. This proposition is illustrated by studies of adults who rescued Jews during World War II and contemporary adults who lead lives of moral commitment. These individuals do not view themselves as heroic but believe that their moral sense and actions simply express their identity. A putative developmental process is described by studies that longitudinally track youth activism to adult moral–civic behavior 10 to 30 years later and that detail changes in adolescents' thinking during a course on Christian social justice that required community service. Everyday morality seems to be rooted in an essential identity rather than being mediated by calculated reason. It follows that educators who seek to justify service learning can emphasize the identity process while pointing to the life-long linkage between youth participation and adult moral–civic activism.

AB  - Identified predictors of normative, unconventional, and deviant identity orientations among youth in a nationally representative sample of 13,000 high school seniors. Found that frequency of community service substantially increased predictability of identity orientation above background characteristics and part-time work involvement. Most school-based extracurricular activities and part-time work were associated with doing service. (Author/KB)

AB  - The timeliness of civic education for American youth is discussed. Particular attention is given to the history of calls for civic education, the state of civic education in schools today, particularly those serving youth in disadvantaged contexts, and the specific ways in which schools can better address the civic education needs of contemporary youth. Findings from research are synthesized around three strategic moves: 1) Promote public discussion and debate of critical issues; 2) Provide quality extracurricular and student government activities; and 3) Build on particular types of service that have proven to enhance civic participation in and identity with one's community. It is concluded that these activities can provide factual knowledge of history and government and encourage students to partake in active practices of the daily life of being citizens.

It notes that it is usually closely supervised with defined learning goals. These may include classroom content reinforcement, skills development or personal growth. Experiential learning may help students reinforce their knowledge, learn more on things they have interest with and gain experience in new areas of practice.

AB  - This article describes a school-based youth-driven teen dating violence prevention project. The project objectives are to provide opportunities for students to plan presentations and activities; develop knowledge and awareness about unhealthy gender norms, seen as an important root cause of relationship violence, particularly for teenagers; and identify ways to cope with and influence their environment with respect to this issue. This project was conducted in a rural Wisconsin community over the course of 5 years. It started as a multischool “drop-in” program with students from various high schools but eventually evolved into a youth action team at an alternative high school as a for-credit service learning class. Evaluation findings show the project to have promise in changing individual attitudes and beliefs while promoting bystander intervention. This youth-led health approach provides excellent opportunities for youth to become involved and empowered, and collaborating with schools can also be a successful strategy. Because unhealthy gender norms are so deeply entrenched, it is important to document and celebrate the smallest positive shifts in attitudes and behaviors.

These include the primacy of collective activity for forming political identities and ideas and the greater heterogeneity of civic compared to other discretionary activities, the groupways or accumulated opportunities for acting due to the groups (social class, gender, ethnic, caste, etc.) to which a young person belongs, and the role of mediating institutions (schools, community-based organizations, etc.) as spaces where youths' actions contribute to political stability and change. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this report was to describe a pediatric service-learning program in entry-level physical therapy (PT) education in Taiwan. Key Points: To meet the needs of the local community and provide preclinical service-learning experience to PT students with people with physical disability, a service-learning program of a 2-day camp for children with cerebral palsy (CP) was developed in 2012. To date, 356 entry-level PT students have participated in this program, serving 286 children and their families. Important professional attributes, identified by the World Confederation for Physical Therapy guideline, such as altruism, compassion and caring, cultural competence, personal and professional development, professional duty, social responsibility and advocacy, and teamwork, were in the reflective reports of some of the PT students. Conclusions: The experiences provided by this pediatric PT service-learning program appear to have the potential to foster the development of professional attributes in entry-level PT students.

AB  - This article presents an overview of a community development service learning programme operating in the Greek Ionian Island community of Farsa Village. The philosophical approach of the Kefalonia Program is one of "threading the past with the future". It seeks to combine traditional knowledge with contemporary technologies in order to create a sustainable future for a community that was completely destroyed by an earthquake in 1953. The village provides a case study for collaboration, research and community education for students, teachers, researchers, nonprofit organisations, island governments and, in particular, the local Farsan Village community. As a catalyst, the programme has engaged the local community in an active planning process, which both reawakens the dream of village restoration and provides a common vision for the future.

AB  - Background: Community-based participatory research (CBPR) is rapidly gaining respect within the health care community as a means to promote public health and address health disparities. It has also recently been named as one of the competencies needed by public health professionals to be effective. Method: This article describes an educational innovation where CBPR is integrated into a baccalaureate nursing curriculum as a strategy to create meaningful learning experiences for nursing students while benefitting the health of the community. Results: The impact of this approach was analyzed over a period of 12 years. The positive outcomes for the community, students, and faculty are described, along with the unique challenges. Conclusion: Integrating CBPR into a nursing curriculum is an innovation that is worthy of further assessment. [J Nurs Educ. 2015;54(7):394-398.]

AB  - This small-scale study investigates the effects of community service learning (CSL) projects or a cultural presentation on the development of the cultural understanding of low- and high-intermediate L2 students. Fifty-two learners in four sections of two Spanish classes in Canada participated in the study. The participants also completed pre- and postquestionnaires which explored their attitudes towards the target language and culture. The results show that, after completing their CSL or cultural presentation projects, the CSL learners had more positive attitudes towards the target language and culture than those who worked on the presentation. In addition, the high-intermediate CSL participants saw an increase in their self-confidence as L2 speakers. However, this was not the case with the low-intermediate CSL students, whose CSL experience may have been inhibited by their L2 proficiency and problems in the delineation of their CSL duties.

The Middle Grades Partnership hosted 400 public school students in 2006 as compared to the 150 students in 2005. The program focuses on students who are high achievers or average students who run the risk of not going to college. Many of the activities are hands-on, something that students say is lacking in public schools where textbooks are the main source of learning.

AB  - Tens of thousands of Latino students helped fuel rallies across the country the week of April 10, 2006 against federal proposals to crack down on immigrants who are in the United States illegally. It was the third week of such rallies, which have put some school officials into politically delicate situations, such as having to decide whether to punish protesters, find ways to keep would-be protesters in school, and clarify policies on community service credits. "This shows our people have a voice," 16-year-old Peter Canales, a junior at High Point High School in Beltsville, Maryland, said during an April 10, 2006 rally in front of the U.S. Capital. He was joined by his mother, an aunt, siblings, and cousins.

AB  - The purpose of the research was to examine how participation in an intergenerational community service art project, creating a wall mural in a nursing home, might affect the personal development of an adolescent. The researcher developed the project to explore the use of new media and the creative arts, as vehicles to improve self and community. The research took the form of a social action project. Qualitative and art-based research designs were used to investigate adolescents' perceptions and attitudes about aging, the development of relationships between adolescents and the elderly, and the collaboration between adolescents and members of the nursing home community to create an artwork. The project took place in a rural city in northern New York State. Art students and campus ministry students, from a private catholic high school, and residents, from a county nursing home, participated. Twenty-one adolescents, aged 15–18 years old, engaged in a variety of activities. They visited with residents, engaged in acts of kindness with residents, photographed residents with digital cameras, and painted a wall mural in the physical therapy room. The project lasted eight months. On site, at the nursing home, the researcher, acting in the role of participant observer, recorded the daily interactions of the participants in photographs and a written journal. The researcher also conducted in-depth 30–45 minute interviews after the project was completed. Ten adolescents and two physical therapy staff members were selected for interviews. The sampling represented adolescents and staff who were willing to be interviewed. The interview instrument contained both standardized open-ended questions and closed fixed response questions. It was piloted with three adolescent participants. Results of the evaluation indicated that positive interactions with peers, residents, staff and the facilitators significantly affected the personal development of the adolescents. Many students expressed a heightened feeling of self-awareness. Generally, students experienced positive growth in the following areas of development: social development, emotional growth, work ethics and physical, mental and emotional well being. The researcher concluded that participation in an intergenerational community service art project might advance the personal development and commitment to community in an adolescent.

AB  - Service learning experiences hold the potential to significantly influence participants' view of cultures other than their own. This qualitative study examines how service learning affects preservice teachers' attitudes about working with students from diverse backgrounds. Two groups of preservice teachers enrolled in a reading methods course participated in focus group interviews both at the beginning of the project and at the end. The results revealed that the service learning group (vs. the non-service learning group) changed significantly from the beginning of the project to the end in terms of their attitudes toward students from diverse populations, level of engagement in the focus group interviews, the group synergy, and the quality and level of nuanced responses to key questions about diversity.

AB  - This article asks whether institutional research could help improve the quality of student engagement by researching at sub-institutional levels such as in courses bridging students from school into higher education. In answer it argues two interacting propositions: one, that student engagement provides useful indicators of quality in higher education; and, two, that research into student engagement is best conducted at a sub-institutional level. The authors use evidence obtained from a funded Teaching and Learning Research Initiative project in New Zealand to support these propositions. The project gauged the perceptions of first-time students in four different bridging (access) courses in one higher education institution. Results showed significant differences in the way they perceived the efforts of teachers and the institution to support their engagement. Not only did course results differ from institutional scores, courses also differed significantly from each other. These results suggest that the quality of student engagement could be enhanced if institutional research focused closely on engagement at sub-institutional levels such as courses.

AB  - In this chapter I describe the close relationship between meditative techniques and service-learning pedagogy. Service-learning can drive a spiritually-based curriculum that gives students both a foundation for internal cultivation and self-development (mind-body techniques) and external experiences (service-learning) to make students capable and socially oriented working professionals who can make a positive impact on society. I highlight the parallels between the two concepts and synthesize their respective qualities to propose a holistic curriculum for students' spiritual development, and methods for them to carry peace- and community-oriented values into mainstream society in practical ways. I draw on both my extensive experience with yoga, meditation, and qigong; and the classes I have taught which include a service-learning component.

AB  - Although millions of students have access to varieties of learning materials in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), many of them feel lost or isolated in their learning experience. One of the potential reasons is the lack of interactions and guidance for individuals. Since MOOC students have diverse learning objectives, we propose to design different strategies for those students with different engagement styles. In this paper, we provide personalized learning guidance for MOOC students based on multi-source data analysis. We first conduct content analysis to identify key concepts in the courses. We then propose two structured model to evaluate student knowledge states by their quiz submissions. We also study on student learning behaviors and design a dropout prediction system. The experiments show the effectiveness of our algorithms and we discuss on the result both quantitatively and qualitatively. Last but not least, we employ a Web application of online student assessment service for both students and instructors, in order to display student learning states and provide suggestion for individuals.

AB  - In North Texas, recognizing the potential benefits of combining community service and outreach, three design centers, the Arlington Urban Design Center (AUDC), the Dallas City Design Studio (DCDS), and the Oak Cliff Storefront (OCS) were established since 2009. A fourth design center is also in the process of being established in Waco. Similar to their counterparts across the U.S., these centers were established to provide design and planning services to cities, communities, institutions, and private owners. Although they are widely reviewed in a broad expanse of scholarly literature (Hardin, Eribes, & Poster, 2006; Forsyth & McGirr, 1999) very little is known about their impacts from the perspectives of the beneficiaries' of these services. This research focuses on assessing the design and planning services of the Arlington Urban Design Center, the first design center established in North Texas, by evaluating clients' perspectives on the services the center provide. The clients in this research are defined as private land owners, communities, city departments, institutions, investors and others who used the center's design and planning services over a three-year period. The research also reports on the AUDC's design and planning impacts from the view of other stakeholders (Arlington city planners, UTA deans, and student interns) in order to understand the varying viewpoints of the AUDC's services. This research primarily follows qualitative research methods (Taylor & Bogdan, 1997) and evaluation techniques (Rossi, & Freeman, 1993) to assess clients' perspectives on the design and planning impacts of the AUDC. A number of interviews are also conducted with other stakeholders (Arlington city planners, UTA deans and student interns) to ascertain their varying viewpoints on this topic. Systematic review of the City of Arlington's project archives, as well as passive observations on constructed projects, are also utilized as supporting procedures to document and illustrate the types of design and planning activities undertaken by the AUDC. The findings of this research illustrate that the clients are benefiting regularly from urban design, architecture, landscape architecture, planning, and even interior and graphic design services which correspond with the overall mission of the AUDC. However, clients' also seem to be interested in additional services such as civil engineering and construction related issues. Clients seem to be interested in AUDC's services primarily due to its no service cost, visionary design ideas, and partnership opportunities they provide with the city and the local institutions. In conclusion, understanding clients' and other stakeholders' perspectives toward the AUDC's design and planning service are beneficial to the future of the AUDC, as well as other service-learning programs to understand and better respond to the needs of the beneficiaries of these centers. Additionally, knowing clients' needs and thoughts could benefit landscape architecture by not only exposing students with real-life design and planning problems but also informing design professionals about business development and consulting services with these centers.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the extent of experiential programs in existence in secondary schools of North Dakota in 1984-85. The descriptive study investigated the extent of experiential education, the types of programs being implemented, criteria for program adoption, program eligibility, program evaluation, and effectiveness of the program. A two page questionnaire was developed to survey the extent of experiential programs in use. All 244 secondary schools in North Dakota were sent the questionnaire with an introductory letter. After approximately two weeks, a follow-up letter was sent to schools to encourage completion of the questionnaire. The questionnaire served to gain information in three areas. The areas for data collection were background information, comments, and a checklist of experiential programs. The checklist of programs consisted of seven experiential programs. The eleven programs included in the survey were: Outward Bound, Walkabout, Flexible Scheduling, Action Learning, Alternative Paths to Graduation, Work Study, Internships and Practica, Cooperative Education, Outdoor Education, Service Learning, and Clinics. The questionnaires were returned at a rate of seventy-five percent, as 182 questionnaires were returned. The completed questionnaires were utilized in a statistical analysis. Percents, frequency distribution, chi square, and descriptive interpretations were used in the study. Five school districts were selected for an on-site visitation. The five school districts of Fargo, Bismarck, Grand Forks, Jamestown, and Minot were selected based on their involvement in experiential programs and because they each offer an alternative school or alternative approach to the traditional school setting. The findings of the study revealed that some experiential programming exists but to a small degree. The major emphasis was in Cooperative Education and Clinics. Internships and Practica were used in several schools in the larger school districts. When the data was restructured for grouping similar programs, Action Learning/Work Study/Service Learning as a group demonstrated the highest degree of participation. Based on the findings of the survey, it was recommended that schools take a close look at the experiential approach to learning. The demand for educational excellence may be addressed through implementation of one or more of the experiential programs. (Abstract shortened with permission of author.)

AB  - Objective: Based on the growing number of transfer students in higher education and the concern that transfer students are not as engaged as their peers, specifically in participation in high-impact practices (HIPs), this research asks, "Is there a significant direct or indirect relationship between transfer status, student engagement, and HIP participation?" Method: The current study employed a general latent variable model to explore the relationship between community college transfer student status, student engagement, and participation in HIPs. Using data from the 2014 administration of the National Survey of Student Engagement, 22,994 senior student responses were examined to measure the association between transfer status (students who transferred from a 2-year to 4-year institution compared with nontransfer students), student engagement (collaborative learning, student-faculty interaction, and supportive campus environment), and HIP participation (learning community, service-learning, research with a faculty member, internship, study abroad, and culminating senior experience). Results: Although each of the student engagement indicators significantly mediated HIP participation for transfer students, only the effect for student-faculty interaction was nontrivial. Contributions: The results from this study indicate the importance of faculty in advocating for and supporting transfer students, while presenting questions about the degree to which these students may need additional institutional support to recognize HIPs in a 4-year context. Implications for enhancing student-faculty interaction among transfer students, as a means to increase HIP participation, are discussed.

AB  - Given that social media dominates informal and often formal communication routes, we argue that schools must reshape their attention to a fourth rhetorical dimension: the media through which they communicate. Specifically, schools must find ways to embrace social media as a mechanism to reach their broad audiences. This article identifies clear obstacles to integrating social media platforms into the communication strands utilized by schools, the rhetorical necessities for doing so, and clear methodologies for making the transition from the "letter home" to the tweet and Facebook post work in a developing digital society.

AB  - Service learning is a well established pedagogy within higher education. Specifically, service learning allows students to engage in "real world" activities to practice skills and reflect upon their own competence. To enhance the effectiveness of service learning, instructors need to consider a multitude of learning influences. This study adhered to the tenants of the Social Cognitive Theory (Bandura, 1986; Schunk, 2004) to engage students enrolled in a 2000 level recreation program development course in service learning activities related to entry level administrative competencies. Data analysis included a content analysis of reflection papers (n = 186) to determine how many times competencies expected of entry level recreation professionals were mentioned. Students perceived the acquisition of competencies consistent with entry level competencies identified within the recreation industry. Findings contribute to the development of effective assignments to facilitate the acquisition of desired professional competencies.

AB  - Youth who are at-risk for social deviance and failure, whether they are in the community or in residential group care settings, are often viewed as liabilities rather than as potential assets. In response to this dynamic, two community service projects, Carry-Out-Caravan II and the Illinois Youth on Campus Service Learning Project, were developed and implemented to foster personal and social growth in at-risk youth. The purpose of these projects was to use a service-learning approach to facilitate the transition of at-risk adolescents into responsible social roles. On the basis of the guidelines for initiating service-learning experiences provided by D. Giles et al (1991), junior and senior high school youth provided grocery shopping and delivery, house and garage painting, yard and garden maintenance, and social and recreation program services to older persons.

AB  - This study investigated the qualitatively different ways which students experienced human-centered design. The findings of this research are important in developing effective design learning experiences and have potential impact across design education. This study provides the basis for being able to assess learning of human-centered design which will allow educational programs to determine their impact, and what aspects are most effective. Because the object of study was the variation of students’ experiences human-centered design, a phenomenographic framework was used to guide the methodology of the study. The literature and research on service-learning and human-centered design informed the construction of the phenomenographic study and also provided ways to interpret the data and situate the results. Thirty-three student designers from a variety of academic contexts were interviewed using a semi-structured, open-ended approach in which they discussed concrete experiences “designing for others”, and reflections and meanings associated with those experiences. Analysis of the data yielded seven qualitatively different ways in which the students experienced human-centered design, or categories of description. Logically related, the seven categories of description formed an outcome space that was two-dimensional with distinct, but not independent, axes. The critical differences among the categories provided the basis for developing their hierarchical relationship. Five of the categories were nested hierarchically. From less comprehensive to more comprehensive, those categories included: Human-centered design as “User as Information Source Input to Linear Process”, “Keep Users’ Needs in Mind”, “Design in Context”, “Commitment” and “Empathic Design”. Two categories represented ways of experiencing human-centered design that were distinct: design was not human-centered, but “Technology-Centered” and human-centered design was not design, but “Service”. In addition, this study found that students’ understanding of the user and their ability to integrate that into their design are related in the development of more comprehensive ways of experiencing human-centered design, and a conception of both aspects is needed. Furthermore, critical or immersive experiences involving real clients and users were important in allowing the students to experience human-centered design in more comprehensive ways.

AB  - As the number of community engagement efforts increase, it is important to understand the impact of these experiences to inform best practices and to ensure that the efforts are positively benefitting all of the stakeholders. Although our program, EPICS, is well-established and has intentionally focused on long-term partnerships, research suggests that immersive experiences can help develop more comprehensive ways of understanding of the community partners. This past summer, our service-learning design program offered a local immersive design experience to a group of 13 students from a variety of majors in a camp for children with disabilities. This paper describes the immersive experience and examines its impact on student learning through analyses of the student reflections and course evaluations. In addition, it describes how these findings can inform this program specifically, as well as other courses and programs using a service-learning pedagogy, especially those that engage in design.

AB  - In statistical text emotion recognition, semi-supervised learning that can leverage plenty of unlabeled data has drawn much attention in recent years. However, the quality of the training data is typically influenced by some mislabeled samples. In this paper, we present a novel co-training method, namely adaptive multi-view selection (AMVS), to improve labeling accuracy of unlabeled samples for semi-supervised emotion recognition. In particular, two importance distributions are proposed to construct multiple discriminative feature views. One is the distribution of feature emotional strengths, and the other is the importance distribution of view dimensionality. On the basis of these two distributions, several feature views are iteratively selected from the original feature space in a cascaded way, and corresponding base classifiers are trained on these views to build a dynamic and robust ensemble. The experimental results on the real-life dataset consisting of moods posts demonstrate the proposed AMVS outperforms conventional multi-view semi-supervised emotion recognition methods, and that abundant emotional discriminative features could be fully exploited in view selection process.

AB  - A comentoring project paired students in a lifespan developmental psychology course with older adults to conduct a life review. The intergenerational paring was designed to increase students' knowledge of older adults, the aging process, and development across the lifespan. Students developed a paper that included their partner's life history, a developmental analysis, and a personal reflection. The results of an exploratory qualitative analysis of students' personal reflections revealed salient themes, such as introspection, and themes not previously reported in the literature including inspiration, admiration, and role modeling by the older adults.

AB  - Counseling psychology is well positioned to address issues of social justice to meet the needs of marginalized groups such as older adults. Given the rapid growth of the senior population and an insufficient number of competent professionals to serve them, it is imperative that counseling psychologists act immediately to develop effective pedagogies to prepare for the future. This article describes four nontraditional pedagogies that help prepare students to work with older adults: (a) service-learning (SL) involving undergraduates who provide community service to seniors; (b) an active learning strategy utilizing a narrative therapy technique, in a multicultural training setting with master's students; (c) a brief, case-based, interprofessional training experience for doctoral students; and (d) a hierarchical supervision model with doctoral and master's students in a community outreach wellness program. The relevance to social justice training within the counseling psychology profession is also highlighted.

AB  - The As We Teach and Learn program consists of an instrument to assess the Catholic dimension of a school and is designed to be used with study modules in a faculty-meeting format. Module topics include: "Faith Community"; "Faith Development"; "Religion Curriculum Articulation: Faith as the Root of all Instruction"; "Service Learning"; "Prayer and Liturgy Integration"; and "Social Justice." Each module has been created so that it can stand alone or be used with other modules. Each module contains an overview of the complete program, a general introduction, directions and suggestions for using the program, a suggested first faculty meeting outline, an introduction to the module, outlines of five meetings, materials which can be duplicated, a suggested final faculty meeting, and a school planning form. This module, "Faith Development," focuses on creating a Christian environment where faith can grow and mature. Five specific topics include: "What Is Faith for Me?"; "Nurturing Faith"; "Journey of Faith"; "Mission and Faith: A Call for Transformation"; and "Faith: The Foundation of Discipleship." Eleven appendices are included. (RJC)

AB  - This paper explores the impact of a student learning activity involving service learning. As part of a vocational course in the Academy of Health Sciences at a Western Australian TAFE (Technical and Further Education) institute, Allied Health Assistant (AHA) students participated in a service learning program focused on work-based learning in residential aged care. Students delivered a therapy program for residents at the facility, and then completed evaluation questionnaires on conclusion of the study. Of 121 students completing the questionnaires, 91% thought the experience challenged their way of thinking, while only two percent disagreed. The majority of students (93%) reported the experience interesting and engaging and a similar percentage (93%) reported that they felt better prepared to enter the workforce. The major themes in qualitative analysis related to the positive learning experience, increased confidence for future working career, improved knowledge and practice of aged care, and improved resident and student quality of life.

AB  - This thesis articulates the philosophical, pedagogical, and empirical grounding for the author's assertion that wilderness service learning can facilitate self-realization. This contention's underlying principles lie in the related theories of Spinoza's Ethics (1677), Kant's Categorical Imperative (1785) and Arne Naess' Ecology of Wisdom (2008). Each of these ethicists place paramount importance on respect for all sentient beings and their right to achieve self-realization. Aspects of experiential education, adventure education, and service learning theory each reflect this principle. Having applied heuristic research methodology to reflection upon praxis, primary data is derived from the author's practicum as a crew leader for North Cascades Wild. This program takes under-served high school youth on 13-day trips including place-based environmental education, team building, leadership, outdoor skill development and stewardship projects. This thesis illustrates how the author's philosophical background frames and informs his experience of progressing self-realization through wilderness service learning, and how in turn this praxis has reshaped and distilled his understanding of philosophy.

AB  - Purpose: Milwaukee has very high rates of risky sexual behavior and low rates of academic achievement among adolescents. Milwaukee school representatives partnered with researchers to create and implement an innovative project-based learning (PBL) high school health curriculum to engage students in school. This health education program, Project Health (PH), aimed to engage Milwaukee Public Schools high school students, by PBL, into the urban health classroom. The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of the curriculum on student engagement and document the process of implementing this program, in order to identify strengths, weaknesses and areas of needed improvement. Design/methodology/approach: Student engagement was measured with an 18-item scale at three time points in intervention and control schools. Attendance data were collected by tracking the number of days students were absent from school the semester the curriculum was implemented. Analysis of covariance was used to test whether students in PH classes were more engaged and if they had fewer absences than students in the control classes. The process evaluation included interviews with teachers, focus groups with high school students, and focus groups with teaching assistants. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed using thematic analysis to extract key themes and categories across all data. Findings: Students in the intervention health class were significantly less absent from school than control students. However, they were not more engaged than their peers in control schools as measured by a student engagement scale. Various components of the PBL teaching approach used in the Project Health high school curriculum were viewed as positive by health educators, students, and teaching assistants. Results indicate that PBL used in health education may increase school attendance. Originality/value: This study was original in that it documented how a novel health education program that incorporated PBL can positively impact urban students' school attendance. It also highlighted the process of implementing this program from the vantage point of students, assistants, and health education. (Contains 1 table.)

AB  - Summary We examined whether participation in the ‘Accessible Community’ program (an Israeli nationwide community program), changed social work students’ attitudes towards people with disabilities. A total of 150 social work students in their first year were divided into task groups focusing on variety activities for and with people with disabilities. The students attended an academic course in community social work, and completed an ‘Attitudes towards Persons with Disability’ questionnaire (ATDP) prior and subsequent to participation; 58.67% (N = 88) completed the questionnaire before the project, 79 also filled it in afterwards (89.7%). Findings Two subscales of ATDP for positive and negative items were composed in order to extrapolate more specific data. Participation in the project did not lead to any significant overall change in attitude. Yet, negative attitudes were significantly associated with previous volunteering and prior negative attitudes, while positive attitudes were significantly associated with prior positive attitudes. Applications It is important to identify amongst those working in the helping professions their prior attitudes toward people with disabilities in order to provide them with significant corrective experiences during their practical training.

AB  - The purpose of the chapter is twofold: It will highlight how the Australian educational context has become further debilitating for minoritized students through neoliberal educational policies and practices as well as other pernicious policies to commodify social life, and it will capture how critical-service learning has the power to function as a pedagogy to challenge the commercialized educational social order in Australia and in other social contexts.

AB  - In the most general sense, service-learning is a pedagogic method that combines formal instruction with the corresponding service activity in the community, where the students gain further understanding of the course content, as well as an enhanced sense of civic responsibility, through direct application of what they study in appropriate social contexts. In this paper we describe the application of the service-learning concept in EFL teaching at the Faculty of Philosophy in Niš. The elective course Grammar in EFL Teaching provides a framework for the cooperation between the teachers and students at the Department of English and those at other departments. The students at the English Department got the chance to gain additional experience through tutoring the students from the other departments, as well as to evaluate this experience reflectively. The paper provides a qualitative and quantitative analysis, based on structured questionnaires, evaluation protocols and interviews, which examine the attitudes of all stakeholders in this type of teaching practice. The results indicate that both the direct participants (the students of English and those from other departments) and the indirect participants (the English teachers at varous departments whose students participated in this activity) confimed the usefulness of and justification for this kind of pedagogic practice. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Учењe кроз друштвено-користан рад (енгл. service-learning) у најширем смислу представља наставни метод који комбинује формалну наставу са одгова- рајућим радом у друштвеној заједници, при чему се научено утврђује и обогаћује у непосредној примени у одговарајућем друштвеном контексту. У овом раду приказана су искуства у примени концепта учења уз друштвено-користан рад у настави енглеског језика на Филозофском факултету у Нишу. У оквиру изборног предмета Граматика у настави енглеског језика успостављена је сарадња настав- никâ и студената на Департману за англистику и на другим департманима. Сту- денти Англистике добили су прилику да стекну додатно педагошко искуство у добровољном стручном раду са студентима осталих департмана и да у оквиру предиспитних обавеза евалуирају своје академско и радно искуство, са нагласком на граматичкој компоненти енглеског језика, у складу са захтевима изборног предмета. У раду је дата квалитативна и квантитативна анализа, где су, на основу структурисаних упитника, евалуативних протокола и интервјуа, испитани ставови свих учесника у овој врсти педагошке праксе. Резултати показују да су и директни учесници (студенти Англистике и студенти других департмана), као и индиректни учесници (наставници чији су студенти били обухваћени допунском наставом) потврдили оправданост увођења овакве праксе.

AB  - The study aimed to identify the most important Service-Learning projects that should be available in the books of civic education for middle school level, and to identify these projects actually contained in these books. As a study approach, the content analysis method of the four Civic Education Textbooks to the middle school level for the 2013/2014 academic year was used. The study ended up with the construction of the Service Learning projects list that should be available in those books which contained (31) projects. It was found that, after the analysis of these books, the projects aiming to development are deficient, as there is no clear plan in terms of preparation, planning and implementation. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] L'étude vise à déterminer les projets d'apprentissage -service les plus importants que doivent contenir les livres d'éducation civique du cycle moyen, et à identifier les projets réellement contenus dans ces livres. L'approche utilisée est la méthode d'analyse du contenu des quatre livres d'éducation civique du niveau de l'enseignement moyen pour l'année scolaire 2013/2014. Les résultats ont révélé une mise en liste de (31) projets d'apprentissage service que doivent contenir ces livres. Il a résulté après l'analyse de ces livres le manque de projets visant le développement, ainsi que l'absence d'un plan clair qui détermine la façon de préparer, de planifier et de mettre en oeuvre ces projets.
